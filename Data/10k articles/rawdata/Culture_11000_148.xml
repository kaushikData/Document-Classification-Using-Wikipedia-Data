{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ab urbe condita''}}
[[Image:Antoninianus-Pacatianus-1001-RIC 0006cf.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Antoninianus]] of [[Pacatianus]], [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] in 248. It bears the legend ROMAE AETER[NAE] AN[NO] MIL[LESIMO] ET PRIMO, "To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year".]]
'''''Ab urbe condita''''' ({{IPA-la|ab ˈʊrbɛ ˈkɔndɪtaː}}), or '''''Anno urbis conditæ''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈannoː ˈʊrbɪs ˈkɔndɪtae̯}}), often abbreviated as AUC in either case, is a convention that was used in antiquity and by [[Classicist|classical historians]] to refer to a given year in [[Ancient Rome]].  ''Ab urbe condita'' literally means "from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]]," while ''anno urbis conditæ'' means "in the year since the City's founding."  Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, [[753 BC]], would be written AUC 1, while [[AD 1]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 BC would be AUC 727.

Usage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity.  In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as was the [[Diocletian era]] in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to  [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ([[1st century BC|First Century BC]]). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls "''ab urbe condita'' 245," accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.

From the time of [[Claudius]] (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{cn|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.

In AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum|sæculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "[y]ear one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Sæculum Novum''.

==Calendar era==
{{see|Calendar era}}
The [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. 
Dionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the 
[[Diocletian era]].
This convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.&lt;ref&gt;
J. David Thomas, "On Dating by Regnal Years of Diocletian, Maximian and the Caesars", 
''Chronique d'Egypte'' 46.91 (1971),  173&amp;ndash;179, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234 doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234].&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of  Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ …").&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&amp;id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&amp;ndash;780.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has later been calculated{{by whom|date=May 2018}} (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. 
Thus, 
* AUC 1 = 753 BC
* AUC 753 = 1 BC
* AUC 754 = AD 1 
* AUC 1000 = AD 247
* AUC 2753 = AD 2000
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+752}} = AD {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}

'''Alexander Nikolayevich Radishchev''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Ради́щев}}; {{OldStyleDate|31 August|1749|20 August}} – {{OldStyleDate|24 September|1802|12 September}}) was a [[Russians|Russian]] author and social critic who was arrested and exiled under [[Catherine the Great]]. He brought the tradition of [[radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] in [[Russian literature]] to prominence with his 1790 novel ''[[Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow]]''. His depiction of socio-economic conditions in Russia resulted in his exile to [[Siberia]] until 1797.

He was the grandfather of painter [[Alexey Bogolyubov]].

==Biography==
Radishchev was born on an estate just outside [[Moscow]], into a minor noble family of [[Tatar]] descent, tracing its roots back to defeated princes who entered into the service of [[Ivan the Terrible]] after the [[conquest of Kazan]] in 1552,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick L. Alston, ''Alexander N. Radischev: A Spokesman of the Russian Enlightenment'', University of California (1956), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tsar]] offering them, in exchange of [[baptism]], to work for him and being allotted lands of some twenty-two thousand acres, a number their descendants will keep upgrading by serving the Tsars over the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Mcconnell, ''A Russian Philosopher : Alexander Radishchev'', Springer (2012), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Nicholas Afanasevich Radischev, a prominent landowner in Moscow, had a reputation for treating his 3000-plus serfs humanely. Until he was 8 years old he lived on his father's estate in [[Verkhni Oblyazovo]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} (then part of the [[Saratov Governorate]], today in [[Penza Oblast]]), one hundred miles west of the [[Volga river]] with a nurse and tutor. He then went to live with a relative in Moscow, where he was allowed to spend time at the newly established [[Moscow University]].  In 1765 his family connections provided him with an opportunity to serve as a page in Catherine's court, which he nonetheless regarded with suspicion for its "contempt for the Orthodox faith, and a desire to deliver the homeland into foreign (German) hands".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, D.M.  1977.  The First Russian Radical: Alexander Radischev.  Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group. p 26&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his exceptional academic promise, Radishchev was chosen as of one of a dozen young students to be sent abroad to acquire Western learning.  For several years he studied at the [[University of Leipzig]].  His foreign education influenced his approach to Russian society, and upon his return he hoped to incorporate [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophies such as [[natural law]] and the [[social contract]] into Russian conditions.  Even as he served as a [[Table of Ranks|Titular Councillor]], drafting legal protocols, in Catherine's civil service, he lauded revolutionaries like [[George Washington]], praised the early stages of the [[French Revolution]], and found himself enamored of the Russian Freemason, [[Nikolay Novikov|Nicholas Ivanovich Novikov]], whose publication [[Truten|''The Drone'']] offered the first public critiques of the government, particularly with regards to [[serfdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Novikov's sharp satire and indignation inspired Radischev's most famous work – ''[[Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow]]'' – in which he emulates Novikov's harsh and passionate style.  He too was especially critical of serfdom and of the limits to personal freedom imposed by the autocracy.

The Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] read the work, viewed Radishchev's calls for reform as evidence of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]]-style radicalism, and ordered copies of the text confiscated and destroyed.  Out of the 650 copies originally printed, only 17 had survived by the time the work was reprinted in England fifty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Yarmolinsky, Avrahm.  1959.  Road to Revolution: A Century of Russian Radicalism.  New York: Macmillan.  P 5&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1790 Radischev was arrested and condemned to death.  He humbly begged forgiveness of Catherine, publicly disowning his book, and his sentence was commuted to exile to [[Ilimsk]] in Siberia. ''En route'' the writer was treated like a common convict, shackled at the ankles and forced to endure the Russian cold from which he eventually fell ill.  His friend, Count [[Alexander Vorontsov]], who held sway with Catherine, interceded and managed to secure Radischev more appropriate accommodations, allowing him to return to Moscow to recover and restart his journey with dignity and comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 204&lt;/ref&gt;   Beginning in October, 1790, Radischev's two-year trip took him through Siberia, stopping in the towns of [[Yekaterinburg|Ekaterinberg]], [[Tobolsk]], and [[Irkutsk]] before reaching the small town of [[Ilimsk]] in 1792.  Along the way, he began writing a biography of [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]], the Cossack conqueror of Siberia, and pursuing an interest in [[geology]] and nature.  Settling in Ilimsk for five years with his second wife, Elizabeth Vasilievna Rubanovsky, and his two children, Radischev, as the only educated man in the area, became the local doctor and saved several lives.  He also wrote a long treatise, ''On Man, His Mortality, His Immortality'', revered{{by whom|date=August 2015}} as one of the few great philosophical works of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 217&lt;/ref&gt;   In it he addresses man's belief in the afterlife, the corporality of the soul, the ultimate redemption of sinners and the faults of [[materialism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

After Catherine's death (1796) her successor Tsar [[Paul of Russia|Paul]] recalled Radishchev from Siberia and confined him to his own estate; the writer again attempted to push for reforms in Russia's government.  When [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] became Emperor (1801), Radishchev was briefly employed to help revise Russian law, a realization of his lifelong dream.  Unfortunately, his tenure in this administrative role proved short and unsuccessful.  In 1802 a despondent Radishchev - possibly rebuked in a friendly manner, for expressing radical ideas, by [[Pyotr Zavadovsky|Count Zavadovsky]] who in his reproof spoke of another exile to Siberia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=KVVK8Wra4iIC&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;ots=VoJibBP4Et&amp;dq=22%20a%20journey%20from%20st.%20petersburg%20to%20moscow%20excerpts%20often%20called%20the%20father%20of%20russian%20intelligentsia&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q=22%20a%20journey%20from%20st.%20petersburg%20to%20moscow%20excerpts%20often%20called%20the%20father%20of%20russian%20intelligentsia&amp;f=false|title=Readings in Russian Civilization Rev Ed|last=Riha|first=Thomas|date=2009-02-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226718446|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - committed suicide by drinking [[poison]].

==Legacy==
During the author's last years, his Moscow apartment became the center of several literary circles who extolled similar views and most outspokenly mourned his death.  The Russian autocracy, however, managed to prevent ''A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow'' from being published until 1905, during which time it circulated through radical groups and was translated into several languages.  [[Alexander Pushkin]], sympathetic to Radischev's views and passion, undertook to write a sequel to his inflammatory book, which was unfortunately never finished and early on faced pressure from the censors.  Following the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, however, Radischev was accepted into the radical canon and became widely read throughout Russia and Europe.  Despite the discrepancies between the author's ideal and the Soviet reality, authorities managed to paint him as "a materialist, an active fighter against autocratic tyranny, and a veritable forefather of Bolshevism."&lt;ref&gt;Lang 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
As a true student of the Enlightenment, Radischev held views that favored the freedom of the individual, Humanism, and patriotism.  These values are best summed up by “equality of all classes before the law, abolition of the Table of Ranks, trial by jury, [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of the press]], emancipation of manorial serfs, [[habeas corpus]], and freedom of trade”.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, Allen, The Empress and Her Protégé: Catherine II and Radischev.  The Journal of Modern History , Vol. 36, No. 1 (Mar., 1964), pp. 14-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his return from Leipzig in 1771, Radischev saw with fresh eyes the stark contrast between life under liberal Western states like [[England]] and [[Switzerland]] and that under Russia's autocracy.  Echoing the sentiments of Catherine herself, he advocated education for all classes, a system he had the fortune to witness in a school in Irkutsk.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 211&lt;/ref&gt;  A more educated populace would provide the foundation for an eventual republican or parliamentary system.  Of all of Russia's social ills, Radischev especially despised the inequality and prolongation of serfdom, rooted in a traditional social system that enforced a strict hierarchy and permitted abuses and exploitation.  Ironically, under Catherine's enlightened reign, serfdom was intensified and spread to newly conquered territories.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, 18&lt;/ref&gt;   While in Siberia, Radischev's economic thought developed, not only in terms of decreasing dependence on serfdom but denouncing international trade.  Though influenced by [[Adam Smith]], Radischev maintained protectionist views, condemning unnecessary international trade and proposing stronger domestic production.  In the debate over Sino-Russian trade relations, he believed Russia's own resources were enough to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticizing the history of arbitrary rule in Russia, Radischev called autocracy the system of governance "most contrary to human nature".&lt;ref&gt;Radischev, Alexander.  A Journey From St. Petersburg to Moscow.  p 282&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this system, government was better positioned to breach its social contract with the governed, creating an unjust and oppressed society.  He extends this system to master-serf relations as well, noting that seeking unlimited power is a natural human vice.  Radischev does not sweepingly criticize all autocrats, but only tyrants, praising, in fact, [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], the philosopher king of [[Sparta]] who promoted equality and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, Allen, Radishchev's Political Thought.  American Slavic and East European Review , Vol. 17, No. 4 (Dec., 1958), pp. 439-453&lt;/ref&gt; Radischev, however, did not believe in, or desire, bloody revolution and instead hoped for a reforming autocrat who would abolish serfdom and "maintain equality in society, protect the widow and the orphan and save the innocent from harm".&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, 442&lt;/ref&gt;  As a member of the ruling class, he didn’t seek to overturn autocracy but to persuade his countrymen and superiors to give up some of their vested power.  In no way an idealist, the writer acknowledged that “where there was more enlightenment, where there was more social life, there was more corruption, so inseparable are good and evil on the earth.”&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, 451&lt;/ref&gt;

Radischev's religious and philosophical views were incredibly liberal for his time.  Denying the belief that sensory experience is primary, Radischev, in ''On Man, His Mortality, His Immortality'', speaks in favor of man's higher virtues as the main elements in complex human thought.  He believed that man's hereditary faculties have as much influence on his development as the external environment.  He also points out, however, that there are common, innate traits that bind all people, particularly the belief in a higher power.  The belief in immortality remains particularly potent for him, both as a factor of faith and as a solace amidst the difficulties of life.

'''''Angústia''''' is a book by [[Graciliano Ramos]] that tells the life of Luís da Silva, a man very confused with his own life. 

One day, he meets Marina, his new neighbour, a beautiful girl with whom he falls in love. From this point, the monotony of his life is abruptly changed for a voluntary thought about the family, the childhood and the present, when Julião Tavares, a rich man, fell in love with Marina.

==Style==
Though the book is considered modernist, the author also makes use of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]]. His theories about [[romantic love|romance]] are shown when he describes the angst of the main character, Luís da Silva: suffering, anxiety, a feeling of sickness. It's curious to say but there's an influence from the psychoanalysis, too, when the imagined disease of Luís da Silva begins to change his behavior and his sense of reality. Thus, [[Graciliano Ramos]] is one of the greatest authors of Brazilian modernism, transcending regional limits with his literary style, in comparison with [[Marcel Proust]].

'''''Battlefield V''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[EA DICE]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. ''Battlefield V'' is the sixteenth installment in the ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' series. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on November 20, 2018. Those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game were granted early access to the game on November 15, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/18/complete-guide-to-battlefield-5-preorder-bonuses|title=Complete Guide to Battlefield 5 Preorder Bonuses|last=Macy|first=Seth G.|website=IGN|date=October 18, 2018|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Origin Access]] Premium subscribers on PC received access to the game on 9 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/9/18079060/battlefield-5-ea-subscribers-early-release-date|title=Players who buy Battlefield 5 have to wait the longest to play it|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is based on [[World War II]] and is a thematic continuation of its [[World War I]] based precursor ''[[Battlefield 1]]''.

Pre-release reception of the game was mixed, with the announcement trailer causing backlash from fans of the series for a perceived lack of historical accuracy and the inclusion of female soldiers. Upon release, ''Battlefield V'' received generally favourable reviews from critics. 

== Gameplay ==
''Battlefield V'' will focus extensively on party-based features and mechanics, scarcity of resources, and removing "abstractions" from game mechanics to increase realism.&lt;ref name="vergereturn" /&gt; There will be an expanded focus on player customization through the new [[Company (military unit)|Company]] system, where players will be able to create multiple characters with various cosmetic and weapon options. Cosmetic items, and currency used to purchase others, will be earned by completing in-game objectives.&lt;ref name="polygoncustom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17385040/battlefield-5-character-customization-items|last=Gilliam|first=Ryan|date=May 23, 2018|title=Players can customize every aspect of their characters in Battlefield 5|work=Polygon|access-date=May 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530130700/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17385040/battlefield-5-character-customization-items|archive-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vergereturn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-nopass" /&gt;

The game will feature several new multiplayer modes, including the "continuous" campaign mode "Tides of War", "[[Battle royale game|Firestorm]]", and "Grand Operations". The Grand Operations mode is an expansion of the "Operations" mode introduced in ''Battlefield 1'', which focuses on matches taking place across multiple stages to simulate a campaign from the war. In Grand Operations, each round will have specific objectives, and performance in each stage will influence the next. Games will culminate with a "Final Stand", with players using only a primary weapon with limited ammo, and no respawns. Similarly to ''Battlefield 1'', the game will feature a collection of single-player "war stories" based on aspects of World War II.&lt;ref name="vergereturn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|last=Savov|first=Vlad|title=Battlefield V returns to World War II this October|work=The Verge|date=May 23, 2018|access-date=May 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530130250/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384042/battlefield-5-release-date-trailer-video|archive-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also features a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode not seen since ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' called "Combined Arms", where four players can undertake missions together and features dynamic missions and objectives so missions cannot be played the same way each time. Combined Arms is scheduled to be released after launch.&lt;ref name="screenrant"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://screenrant.com/battlefield-v-co-op-campaign-combined-arms/|last=Treese|first=Tyler|date=May 23, 2018|title=Battlefield V 4-Player Co-op Campaign Combined Arms Revealed|work=Screen Rant|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle royale game|Battle Royale]] mode will be built around the franchise's "core pillars of destruction, team play, and vehicles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-09-battlefield-v-is-getting-a-battle-royale-mode-called-royale|title=Battlefield V is getting a battle royale mode called Royale|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=June 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/battlefield-5-release-date-3231890|last=|first=|title=Battlefield 5: EA announces Battle Royale mode at E3 2018|work=TrustedReviews|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-battlefield-5-battle-royale-mode-announced/1100-6459536/|last=|first=|title=E3 2018: Battlefield 5 Battle Royale Mode Announced By EA|work=GameSpot|date=June 9, 2018|access-date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Firestorm" is derived from a literal storm of fire that engulfs players similar to the popular Battle Royale game mechanic of restricting the play area. Furthermore, this particular game mode is not being developed by EA DICE themselves, but has been outsourced to [[Criterion Games]] and features the biggest map created by the franchise to date. It is playable by 64 players, which are divided into up to 16 squads with a focus on team work.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Firestorm is scheduled to be released in March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5s-battle-royale-mode-wont-be-live-until-spring-2019/|title=Battlefield 5's battle royale mode won't be live until spring 2019|work=PC Gamer|access-date=November 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
As in ''Battlefield 1'', the single-player campaign is divided into episodic ''War Stories,'' three of which are available at launch: ''"Nordlys"'' takes place from the point-of-view of a [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] fighter taking part in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|sabotage of the German nuclear program]], ''"Tirailleur"'' tells the story of a [[Senegalese_Tirailleurs|Senegalese Tirallieur]] during [[Operation Dragoon]], and ''"Under No Flag"'' puts the player in the shoes of Billy Bridger, a convicted bank robber and explosives expert conscripted into the [[Special Boat Service]] to take part in [[Operation Albumen]]. A fourth campaign, ''"The Last Tiger"'', will launch later.

DICE unveiled the first details surrounding ''Battlefield V'' on May 23, 2018, with more information to be unveiled during the EA Play press conference near [[E3 2018]] in June. DICE has stated that, unlike ''Battlefield 1'', it does not plan to use paid [[downloadable content]], or "[[loot box]]es" for non-cosmetic items within ''Battlefield V''; new content will be added to the game for all players over time (which, itself, will progress through the different stages of World War II), at no additional charge.&lt;ref name="polygon-nopass"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|title=Battlefield 5 ditches the premium pass|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115940/https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/23/17384662/battlefield-5-premium-pass|archive-date=May 24, 2018|work=Polygon|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|title=‘Battlefield V’ Hits Oct. 19, Explores WWII Free of Premium Pass, Loot Boxes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120154/http://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/battlefield-v-details-1202819935/|archive-date=May 24, 2018|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=May 23, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to exclude these features was made following the outrage over the loot box system in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'', another EA DICE title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|title=Here's Our First Look At Battlefield V, Which Goes Back To WWII|work=Kotaku|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524115705/https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-battlefield-v-which-goes-back-1826271285|archive-date=May 24, 2018|access-date=May 24, 2018|date=May 23, 2018|last=Scheirer|first=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally set to release on October 19, but was delayed to November 20 to enable the developers to "make some final adjustments to core gameplay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/battlefield-5-release-date-delayed-to-november/|title=Battlefield 5 release date delayed to November|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
=== Pre-release ===
The announcement trailer was met with a backlash from fans of the series who criticized the game for a lack of [[Historicity|historical accuracy]] and authenticity. Complaints were given to the use of certain weapons, [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]], and body art as being very uncommon in that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=This 'Battlefield 5' Reveal Trailer Has Me More Confused Than Hyped|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/05/23/battlefield-5s-reveal-trailer-has-me-more-confused-than-hyped/#7cb0098156f9|website=Forbes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525205623/https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/05/23/battlefield-5s-reveal-trailer-has-me-more-confused-than-hyped |archive-date=May 30, 2018|access-date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fans were also frustrated with the portrayal of women in the game, specifically with the British woman featured in the trailer as British women never participated in frontline combat and were mostly relegated to supporting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Groux|first1=Christopher|title='Battlefield V' Trailer Sparks Outrage, But Did Women Fight in World War II?|url=https://www.newsweek.com/battlefield-v-5-trailer-outrage-did-women-fight-world-war-2-943856|archiveurl=|archivedate=|website=Newsweek|access-date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although acknowledging that British women were rarely on the frontline, critics have responded that [[Women in World War II|female soldiers did participate in World War II]], highlighting real-life examples from multiple countries, and that previous games in the ''Battlefield'' series are not seen as a completely realistic portrayal of war. Some also suggested that the backlash was partly due to [[misogyny]], rather than genuine worries over historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plunkett|first1=Luke|title=Oh No, There Are Women In Battlefield V|url=https://kotaku.com/oh-no-there-are-women-in-battlefield-v-1826275455|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530135530/https://kotaku.com/oh-no-there-are-women-in-battlefield-v-1826275455|archive-date=May 30, 2018|website=Kotaku|access-date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Matt|title=Battlefield 5 has women in it.

In response to the outcry, the game's executive producer Aleksander Grøndal wrote on [[Twitter]] that the team would "always put fun over authentic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shabana|last=Arif|title=Battlefield V Producer Says DICE Will 'Always Put Fun Over Authentic'|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/05/24/battlefield-v-producer-says-dice-will-always-put-fun-over-authentic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530140512/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/24/battlefield-v-producer-says-dice-will-always-put-fun-over-authentic|archive-date=May 30, 2018|website=IGN|date=May 24, 2018|access-date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; DICE's general manager Oskar Gabrielson also responded on Twitter, saying "Player choice and female playable characters are here to stay ...

"We stand up for the cause, because I think those people who don’t understand it, well, you have two choices: either accept it or don’t buy the game," he said. "I’m fine with either or." Söderlund went on to say that the development team itself pushed for women in ''Battlefield V''.&lt;ref name=TV&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453728/ea-women-in-battlefield-v-backlash-response|title=EA on the backlash against women in Battlefield V: ‘Accept it or don’t buy the game’|last1=Farokhmanesh|first1=Megan|last2=Nicolett|first2=Megan|date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, after the game was delayed by a month, DICE revealed they are planning on "dialing back" the character customization to attempt to "give more authenticity to the game", saying "We want players to be excited about customizing their characters with authentic gear. We dialed it back a bit. It was pretty crazy, We wanted to offer some authenticity, and that’s important to us, that’s important to our players.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DICE is “dialling back” Battlefield V’s character customisation|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-v/battlefield-v-authentic-customisation|last=Jones|first=Ali|publisher=''[[PCGamesN]]''|date=September 13, 2018|access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beauty and Sadness''''' ({{lang-ja|美しさと哀しみと}} ''Utsukushisa to kanashimi to'') is a 1964 novel by Japanese author [[Yasunari Kawabata]].

==Plot synopsis ==
Opening on the train to [[Kyoto]], the narrative, in characteristic Kawabata fashion, subtly brings up issues of tradition and modernity as it explores writer Oki Toshio's reunion with a young lover from his past, Otoko Ueno, who is now a famous artist and recluse.  Ueno is now living with her protégée and a jealous lover, Keiko Sakami, and the unfolding relationships between Oki, Otoko, and Keiko form the plot of the novel. Keiko states several times that she will avenge Otoko for Oki's abandonment, and the story coalesces into a climactic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beauty and Sadness|last=Kawabata|first=Yasunari|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|year=2011|isbn=978-0-141-19261-1|location=London|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
The novel was made into films by [[Masahiro Shinoda]] (''[[With Beauty and Sorrow|Utsukushisa to kanashimi to]]'', released 1965) and by [[Joy Fleury]], starring [[Charlotte Rampling]] (''Tristesse et beauté'', released 1985).

==Life==
Bhoja or Bhojo was born in 1785&lt;ref name="Datta1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leva Patil|Leva]] [[Kanbi]]&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt; caste at village named Fattehpur or Devkigalol near [[Jetpur, Navagadh|Jetpur]] in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. His father's name was Karshandas and mother was Gangabai and family surname was Savalia. He met his guru, a [[sanyasin]] from Girnar at age of 12. Later, when he was 24, the family shifted to [[Fatehpur, Gujarat|Fatehpur]] near [[Amreli]], Gujarat. He came to be known as Bhoja Bhagat ([[Bhagat]] derived from ''Bhakt'', devotee) and Bhojalram in his later life.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=x/&gt;

By occupation he was a farmer. Although, he was an illiterate, but with blessings of his [[Guru]] in [[Girnar]], he wrote poems and songs condemning social inequities, which became well known as "Bhoja Bhagat Na Chabkha".&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|title=Milestones in Gujarati Literature|author=Krishnalal M.

Bhoja Bhagat died in 1850 at age of 65 at [[Virpur (Rajkot)|Virpur]], where he had gone to visit his disciple [[Jalaram]].

These satirical pieces are known as ''Bhoja Bhagat na Chabkha'' ( literally ''Lashes of Bhoja Bhagat'' ) in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. His rough language is seen in these ''Chabkha'' which tells about social equanimity. His tender and compassionate language his visible in his verses, ''pada'' describing separation of [[Gopi]]s from [[Krishna]] in ''Bhaktamala'', ''Chalaiyakhyan'' and his ''bhajan'' of ''Kachabo ane Kachabi'' (couple of turtles).

'''''Counter-Strike''''' (also known as '''''Half-Life: Counter-Strike''''') is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Valve Corporation]]. It was initially developed and released as a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' [[Game mod|modification]] by [[Minh Le|Minh "Gooseman" Le]] and [[Jess Cliffe]] in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. ''Counter-Strike'' was released by Valve on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in 2000. The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the ''Counter-Strike'' series. Several [[Video game remake|remakes]] and [[port (video gaming)|port]]s of ''Counter-Strike'' have been released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console, as well as [[OS X]] and [[Linux]]. It is commonly referred to as '''''Counter-Strike 1.6''''' to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major [[software update]] the game received.

Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams of the governmental [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] forces and various [[terrorism|terrorist]] militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Counter-Strike screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player is standing in the terrorist starting zone of de_dust using a CV-47 ([[AK-47]]).]]
''Counter-Strike'' is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams [[spawning (computer gaming)|spawning]] simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.

The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:
:* '''Bomb defusal''': The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.
:* '''Hostage rescue''': The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.
:* '''Assassination''': One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.

A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as "freeze time") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral "buy zones" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.

Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).

The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and [[Ping (video gaming)|ping]] (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.

Killed players become "spectators" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of [[Internet cafe]]s and [[Voice over IP]] programs such as [[TeamSpeak]] or [[Ventrilo]]). This form of cheating is known as "ghosting."

== Development ==
''Counter-Strike'' itself is a mod, and it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add [[Computer game bot|bots]], while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some mods, often called "admin plugins", give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over their servers. There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of zombies and must "spread the infection" by killing the other team (using only the knife). There are also the Superhero and mods which mix the first-person gameplay of ''Counter-Strike'' with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is also highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, spray graphics, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.

=== Valve Anti-Cheat ===
{{Main|Valve Anti-Cheat}}

''Counter-Strike'' has been a target for [[cheating in online games]] since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as "[[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]" in reference to programs or "[[hacker (hobbyist)|hacks]]" executed by the client. Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers.

With the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait two years to have the account unbanned. Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that if a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. By delaying the initial ban, Valve hopes to identify and ban as many cheaters as possible. Like any software detection system, some cheats are not detected by VAC. To remedy this, some servers implement a voting system, in which case players can call for a vote to kick or ban the accused cheater. VAC's success at identifying cheats and banning those who use them has also provided a boost in the purchasing of private cheats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |title=Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cheats are updated frequently to minimize the risk of detection, and are generally only available to a trusted list of recipients who collectively promise not to reveal the underlying design. Even with private cheats however, some servers have alternative anticheats to coincide with VAC itself. This can help with detecting some cheaters, but most paid for cheats are designed to bypass these alternative server-based anticheats.

== Release ==
When ''Counter-Strike'' was published by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Studios]],  it was bundled with ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'' multiplayer, and the ''Wanted'', ''Half-Life: Absolute Redemption'' and ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'' mods.&lt;ref name="IGN Review" /&gt;

On March 24, 1999, [[Planet Half-Life]] opened its ''Counter-Strike'' section. Within two weeks, the site had received 10,000 hits. On June 19, 1999, the first public beta of ''Counter-Strike'' was released, followed by numerous further "beta" releases. On April 12, 2000, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] announced that the ''Counter-Strike'' developers and Valve had teamed up. In January 2013, Valve began testing a version of ''Counter-Strike'' for [[OS X]] and [[Linux]], eventually releasing the update to all users in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1010199179645672708|title = Counter-Strike 1.6 Beta released|date = January 28, 2013|accessdate = March 16, 2014|publisher = [[Steam (software)|Steam]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130214014350/http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1010199179645672708|archivedate = February 14, 2013|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1802838328069953132|title = Counter-Strike 1.6 update released|accessdate = March 16, 2014|date = April 1, 2013|publisher = [[Steam (software)|Steam]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140316053054/http://steamcommunity.com/games/10/announcements/detail/1802838328069953132|deadurl = no|archivedate = March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazilian sale ban ===
On January 17, 2008, a Brazilian federal court order prohibiting all sales of ''Counter-Strike'' and ''[[EverQuest]]'' began to be enforced. The federal Brazilian judge Carlos Alberto Simões de Tomaz ordered the ban in October 2007 because, as argued by the judge, the games "bring imminent stimulus to the subversion of the social order, attempting against the democratic state and the law and against public security."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kotaku.com.au/2008/01/brazilian_government_bans_counterstrike_everquest_fun-2/|title = Brazilian Government Bans Counter-Strike, EverQuest, Fun|date = January 19, 2008|accessdate = April 1, 2014|website = [[Kotaku]] Australia|last = McWhertor|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/80757-Brazil-Bans-Counter-Strike-EverQuest|title = Brazil Bans Counter-Strike, EverQuest|date = January 21, 2008|accessdate = April 1, 2014|website = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|first = Andy|last = Chalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/179980/banned-in-brazil-counter-strike-and-everquest/|title = Banned in Brazil: Counter-Strike and EverQuest|date = January 21, 2008|accessdate = April 1, 2014|website = Computer and Video Games|last = Bishop|first = Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 18, 2009, a [[Regional Federal Courts|regional federal court]] order lifting the prohibition on the sale of ''Counter-Strike'' was published.

== Sequels ==
{{Main|Counter-Strike}}
Following the success of the first ''Counter-Strike'', Valve went on to make multiple sequels to the game. ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', a game using ''Counter-Strike's'' [[GoldSrc]] engine, was released in 2004. ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', a remake of the original ''Counter-Strike'' game, was the first in the series to use Valve's [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] and was also released in 2004, only eight months after the release of ''Counter-Strike: Condition Zero''. The next game in the ''Counter-Strike'' series to be developed primarily by Valve Corporation was ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', released for Windows, OS X, Linux, [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012.

The game also spawned multiple spin-offs in the form of arcade games developed by [[Nexon Corporation]] and targeted primarily at Asian gaming markets. Four ''Counter-Strike'' games have been developed and released by Nexon Corporation thus far, ''[[Counter-Strike Neo]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Online]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies]]'', and ''[[Counter-Strike Online 2]]''.

{{Costume}}

A '''folk costume''' (also '''regional costume''', '''national costume''', or '''traditional garment''') expresses an [[national identity|identity]] through [[costume]], which is usually associated with a geographic area or a period of time in history. It can also indicate social, marital or religious status. If the costume is used to represent the [[culture]] or [[Cultural identity|identity]] of a specific [[ethnic group]], it is usually known as '''ethnic costume''' (also '''ethnic dress''', '''ethnic wear''', '''ethnic clothing''', '''traditional ethnic wear''' or '''traditional ethnic garment'''). Such costumes often come in two forms: one for everyday occasions, the other for traditional [[festival]]s and [[formal wear]].

Following the outbreak of [[romantic nationalism]], the peasantry of [[Europe]] came to serve as models for all that appeared genuine and desirable. Their dress crystallised into so-called "typical" forms, and enthusiasts adopted that attire as part of their [[symbol]]ism.

In areas where [[Western dress codes]] have become usual, traditional garments are often worn at special events or celebrations; particularly those connected with cultural traditions, heritage or pride. International events may cater for non-Western attendees with a compound [[dress code]] such as "business suit or national dress".

In modern times, there are instances where traditional garments are required by [[sumptuary law]]s. In [[Bhutan]], the traditional [[Tibet]]an-style clothing of ''[[gho]]'' and ''kera'' for men, and ''[[Kira (Bhutan)|kira]]'' and ''[[toego]]'' for women, must be worn by all citizens, including those not of Tibetan heritage. In [[Saudi Arabia]], women are also required to wear the [[abaya]] in public.

The '''Gibraltar Heritage Trust''' is a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] established by [[Law of Gibraltar|statute]] on 1 May 1989 to preserve and promote the [[cultural heritage|cultural]] [[natural heritage]] of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Gibraltar  Heritage  Trust Act 1989|p=1}}

==Funding and responsibilities==
The Trust collaborates with the [[Government of Gibraltar]] and with private organisations and individuals to preserve and promote Gibraltar's heritage for cultural, educational and tourism purposes.{{sfn|About the Trust}} The Trust is funded through fees from exhibitions, a portion of ticket sales for access to listed properties managed by the [[Gibraltar Tourist Board]] and from donations.{{sfn|Gibraltar  Heritage  Trust Act 1989|p=7}} Although the [[Gibraltar Museum]] is owned and operated by the government, the Trust has an advisory role and assists in expanding the collection.{{sfn|Gibraltar  Heritage  Trust Act 1989|p=17}}

==Sites==
The Trust maintains a list of historically important buildings and structures, and gives advice on their preservation and restoration. With Gibraltar's long history as a garrison town and [[naval base]], most of the listed structures are military, including [[defensive wall]]s, [[bastion]]s and [[artillery battery|batteries]]. However, the Trust also covers natural attractions and civilian structures such as caves and churches.{{sfn|Gibraltar  Heritage  Trust Act 1989|p=Schedules 1 and 2}}

Some of the tourist sites for which the Trust coordinates conservation and development lie on the high slopes of The Rock in the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]]. These include [[O'Hara's Battery]], the [[RML 17.72 inch gun|100 ton gun]] at [[Napier of Magdala Battery]], the Military Heritage Centre at [[Princess Caroline's Battery]] and the [[Parson's Lodge Battery]].{{sfn|Bennett|Doyle|1998|p=110}} In the late 1990s the trust arranged for the restoration of [[Parson's Lodge Battery]], which in 1884 had three {{convert|10|in}} muzzled loading rifled guns.{{sfn|Ehlen|Harmon|2001|p=104}} The Trust operates the coastal fort, which is open to the public, with examples of artillery from different periods.{{sfn|Finlayson|Fa|2006|p=57}}

'''Girart de Roussillon''', also called ''Girard'', ''Gérard II'', ''Gyrart de Vienne,'' and ''Girart de Fraite'', (c. 810–877/879?) was a [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] chief who became [[Count of Paris]] in 837, and embraced the cause of [[Lothair I]] against [[Charles the Bald]]. He was a son of [[Leuthard I of Paris|Leuthard I]], Count of Fézensac and of Paris, and his wife Grimildis.

Girart is not described as being from [[Roussillon]] in authentic historical sources. The placename in his title is derived from a castle he built on Mont Lassois, near [[Vix, Côte-d'Or|Vix]] and [[Châtillon-sur-Seine]] ([[Côte-d'Or]]).

'''Girart de Roussillon''' also is an epic figure in the cycle of [[Carolingian]] [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]s, collectively known as the ''[[Matter of France]].'' In the genealogy of the cycle’s [[legendary history|legendary heroes]], Girart is a son of [[Doon de Mayence]] and appears in the various irreconcilable events.

==Biography==
[[Image:Fontenoy obelisk IMG 2132.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Obelisk commemorating the Battle of Fontenay (841)]]

Girart fought at the [[Battle of Fontenay (841)|Battle of Fontenay]] in 841, and doubtless followed [[Lothair I]], his future brother-in-law, to [[Aix-en-Provence]]. In 843, he married Bertha, daughter of Lothair I (May 800 - Sep 855) and Ermengarde of Tours (800-851).  Hugh II (780-837) was Bertha's grandfather.

In 855, Girart became [[Count of Provence|governor of Provence]] for Lothair's son [[Charles of Provence|Charles]], nominal [[king of Provence]]. His wife Bertha defended [[Vienne]] unsuccessfully against Charles the Bald in 870. Girart, who had perhaps aspired to be the titular ruler of the northern part of Provence, continued to administer it under [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] until that prince's death in 869. He retired with his wife to [[Avignon]] where he died probably in 877, certainly before 879.

==Romance==
The legend of Girart’s piety, the heroism of his wife Bertha, and of his wars with Charles passed into the genre of literary romance; however, the historical facts are so distorted that, in the epic ''Girart de Roussillon'', he became an opponent of [[Charles Martel]] who was married to Bertha's sister. The legendary narrative ''Girart de Roussillon'' was long held to be a Provençal work, but its Burgundian origin has been proven.

Accounts of Girart are found in several early manuscripts. The earliest ''[[chanson de geste]]'', called ''Le Chanson de Girart de Roussillon'', dates from the second half of the 12th century. The original text, written in rhymed [[decasyllable]]s, is preserved at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)]]. It was translated the first time by Paul Meyer in 1884, (Paris: Champion). A recent translation into modern French with notes by Micheline Combarieu du Grès and Gérard Gouiran was published in 1993 (Paris: Librairie générale française).

A romance written in rhymed [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s was written between 1330 and 1349 by [[monk]]s in the [[abbey]] of [[Pothières]], which was founded in about 860 by Girart. It was dedicated to [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]] (ca. 1295–1350), and [[Joan the Lame|Jeanne de Bourgogne]] (called "Joan the Lame"), queen of France (1293–1349). The text is composed in a dialect midway between [[French language|French]] and [[Old Occitan]]. Five manuscript copies of this version survive; two in [[Montpellier, France]] at the Bibliothèque Interuniversitaire (section médecine), one in [[Troyes]] (now held at the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]] in Paris), one in Paris at the BnF, and one in [[Brussels]] at the [[Bibliothèque royale de Belgique]]. This version was printed by [[Yale University]] in 1939 (New Haven: Yale University Press, Yale Romanic Studies, 16).

The version in Alexandrines was the source for a romance in prose by [[Jean Wauquelin|Jehan Wauquelin]] in 1447 (Paris: éd. L. de Montille, 1880).

Southern French traditions concerning Girart, in which he is called the son of [[Garin de Monglane]], are embodied in the 13th century narrative in rhymed [[decasyllable]] verses about the [[siege]] of [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] by [[Charlemagne]] in ''[[Girart de Vienne]]'' by [[Bertrand de Bar-sur-l'Aube]]. The same traditions also are embraced in ''Aspramonte'' by [[Andrea da Barberino]], based on the French ''chanson'' ''[[Aspremont (chanson de geste)| Aspremont]]'', where he is called Girart de Frete or de Fraite and he leads an army of [[infidel]]s against Charlemagne.

'''''God, Inc.''''' is a comedy internet video series about the office space of [[God]] by filmmaker [[Francis Stokes]]. The premise is that God runs the world through a company with different departments such as [[disaster]]s, [[miracle]]s, [[population control]], [[publicity]], [[customer relations]], [[:wikt:approval|approvals]], and [[product development]]. It has recently gathered critical acclaim from a number of media outlets.&lt;ref name="The Office Meets The Almighty"&gt;{{cite news | last =Kaufman | first =Anthony | coauthors = | title ="God, Inc.": "The Office" Meets The Almighty | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =The Daily Reel | date =January 8, 2007 | url=http://www.thedailyreel.com/news-opinion/reel-focus/god-inc-the-office-meets-the-almighty?gnewsid=1168209370.23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131520/http://www.thedailyreel.com/news-opinion/reel-focus/god-inc-the-office-meets-the-almighty?gnewsid=1168209370.23| archivedate=2007-09-27| accessdate =2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A YouTube Star is Born"&gt;{{cite news | last =Coyle | first =Jake | coauthors = | title =A YouTube star is born ... with the right plan | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date =January 27, 2007 | url =http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/301388_youtubestars27.html | accessdate =2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rules For YouTube: Make Art, Not Bore"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hornaday | first =Ann | coauthors = | title =Rules For YouTube: Make Art, Not Bore | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =The Washington Post | date =February 4, 2007 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/02/AR2007020200358.html | accessdate =2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Sitcoms Rise On The Web"&gt;{{cite news | last =Jurgensen | first =John | coauthors = | title =New Sitcoms Rise On The Web | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =The Wall Street Journal | date =January 20, 2007 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116924952086782081?mod=todays_us_pursuits | accessdate =2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'God, Inc.' puts 'Office' humor in heavenly setting"&gt;{{cite news | last =Falsani | first =Cathleen | coauthors = | title ='God, Inc.' puts 'Office' humor in heavenly setting | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =The Chicago Sun Times | date =March 30, 2007 | url =http://www.suntimes.com/news/falsani/320014,CST-NWS-fals30.article |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702223836/http://www.suntimes.com/news/falsani/320014,CST-NWS-fals30.article |archivedate=2011-05-17 | accessdate =2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creator [[Francis Stokes]] has stated on comments on the sixth episode, that he plans to turn the web series into a TV series.

==Characters==
* '''Sarah Melody Church''' (played by Rachel Oliva) (June 3, 1976-November 5, 2006) lived in [[Florida]] all her life and died of [[leukemia]]. She becomes an intern placed in Product Development where she is the only female.
* '''Austin''' (played by Stephen Falk) is the last remaining person in the Miracles Department. Changes in staffing within the office have him disillusioned about working there.
* '''Piper Morris''' (played by Elizabeth Pan) is the boss and is described as a hardass. In the first episode Brad tells Sarah not to "talk to her, or make eye contact".
* '''Owen''' (played by Jeff Sass) works in Population Control. He likes his cup o'noodles soup &amp; has a fondness for [[cancer]].
* '''Paige''' (played by Stephanie Jane Markham, Francis Stokes' real-life wife) is God's secretary who isn't seen frequently because she works upstairs. Paige appears in Episode 3, "Who Stole God's Lunch."
* '''Keaton''' (played by Chet Nelson) is the boss of Product Development. He has designed 64 animal species and 217 plant species.
* '''Gavin''' (played by Dayton Mesher) works in Product Development. He has designed 28 animal species. It would be 29 but his attempts to submit the porcupotamus as a new animal species keep getting rejected by the Approvals Department.
* '''Amid''' (played by Rizwan Manji) is a marketer in the Publicity department who propagates faith in Islam.  Riding the contemporary wave of fanaticism and solidarity in the Muslim world, Amid often tops the performance charts in his department.  This makes him arrogant, attributing his success to what he calls: "the one true marketing strategy."
* '''Esther''' (played by Amie Farrell) works in the Publicity department trying to increase the numbers of "Really Christians".  She is highly task focused and will go to the most deviously unchristian lengths to outperform Amid. 
* '''Andy''' (played by Michael Lutgen) works alongside Esther in Publicity. He is the rep for "Sort-of Christians" and is accordingly indifferent about the faith that he is selling or how he performs in the office.

'''Jud Newborn''' (born in 1952), is a New York-based author, lecturer, [[cultural anthropologist]] and curator.  A pioneer in the creation of [[Holocaust]] museums, he helped build New York's [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]], serving as its Founding Historian and curator.  He is known for his co-authored book, ''[[Sophie Scholl and the White Rose]]'' (Oneworld Publications, 2006), an account of the history of the [[White Rose]], a group formed in part by German Christian students—some former Hitler Youth fanatics—who were part of the German anti-Nazi resistance.  

Newborn is also a wide-ranging lecturer who has spoken throughout North America and worldwide. He is known for dramatic multimedia programs that set unsung aspects of the Holocaust, among other subjects, within the context of such compelling, contemporary issues as the rise of extremism, oppression, fanaticism and genocide, in order to inspire audiences to join in the fight for freedom and "our shared humanity."

Newborn's involvement with the holocaust began at age 5 when he was discovered a  sepia family photograph which his grandmother had hidden away.  When he brought it to her and asked who the people in it were, "her face turned bright red. Tears welled in her eyes. And she said in her Yiddish accent, 'Dunt ask me. Hitler burnt dem all.'" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/story-of-courage-amid-horrors-of-holocaust-1.4925210 Story of courage amid horrors of Holocaust Newsday March 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
      
Jud Newborn was educated at [[New York University]], [[Cambridge University]] and the [[University of Chicago]], which awarded him his doctorate with Distinction in 1994 for his dissertation, ''"Work Makes Free": The Hidden Cultural Meanings of the Holocaust''; (''Work Makes Free'': English translation of [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi forced labor camp]] [[slogan]] ''[[Arbeit Macht Frei]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2614">The '''Land of Darkness''' was a mythical land supposedly enshrouded in perpetual darkness. It was usually said to be in [[Abkhazia]] and was officially known as '''Hanyson''' or '''Hamson''' (or some variation; the name apparently comes from the [[Hamshen]] area of Turkey), or simply the '''Forest of Abkhazia'''.

The Land of Darkness enjoyed popularity in fictional [[medieval]] [[travel literature]] such as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. According to Mandeville, no one ventures into Hanyson out of fear, but the people in the surrounding area know it to be populated, as they can hear human voices inside. The residents of Hanyson are the descendants of [[Sassanid dynasty|Persian Emperor]] Saures ([[Shapur II]]) and his men, who were trapped there forever by a miracle of God. Saures had been persecuting his Christian subjects in Abkhazia, and had cornered them on a plain. They prayed to God, and God responded by surrounding the king's armies in the thick, impenetrable darkness that still affected the land. In the ''Alexander Romance'', [[Alexander the Great]] crosses the Land of Darkness in his search for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. After passing through Russia and coming almost to the edge of the world, Alexander finds the darkened country and travels it with his servant Andreas (in the [[Persian language|Persian]] version of the ''Romance'', this servant is identified with [[Al-Khidr]], the hero from the [[Qur'an]]). Alexander cannot find his way through the darkness, but his servant does. Andreas drinks of the Water of Life and becomes immortal.

The Land of Darkness was also identified with the area around the northern [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Martin, ''Treasure from the Land of Darkness: The Fur Trade and its Significance for Medieval Russia'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; When Abu Hamid al-Gharnati visited [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1135-36 he was told that the Land of Darkness was not far from [[Yugra]]. 

[[Ibn Battuta]] was in the same area and wanted to visit the Land of Darkness but decided not to because it required a 40-day journey on "small wagons drawn by large dogs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Star Wars comics|comic books]] set in the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. Lucasfilm's now-corporate sibling [[Marvel Comics]], which published ''Star Wars'' comics from 1977 to 1986, are once again publishing ''Star Wars'' titles that started in 2015. [[Dark Horse Comics]] owned the license to publish ''Star Wars'' comics from [[Lucasfilm]] exclusively from 1991 to 2014. The only comics considered canon are those released since 2015.

For a complete list of ''Star Wars'' novels please refer to [[List of Star Wars books|''Star Wars'' books]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Overview==
{{Inc-film}}
This list is split into two categories:

;'''CANON''':
The new primary ''Star Wars'' canon includes all the movie episodes, the television shows ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', books, comics, and video games published after April 2014, and comics published in 2015. These stories are coordinated by the Lucasfilm Story Team to be consistent with both each other and the upcoming films.

;'''LEGENDS''':
These books are part of the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], and vary in levels of canonicity. The new canon works will not be based on these stories, but some parts may still be incorporated into them (e.g. [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]]).

Note''':''' BBY and ABY are the standards of measurement for years in the [[Star Wars galaxy|''Star Wars'' galaxy]].
*'''BBY''' stands for years before the Battle of Yavin, which occurred during ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''.
*'''ABY''' stands for years after the Battle of Yavin.
*'''FB''' denotes flashbacks.

In September 2015, multinational food and beverage company [[Nestlé]] released two animated webcomics as part of a licensed Star Wars-themed promotional campaign for ''The Force Awakens''. Adapted from the novels ''The Weapon of a Jedi: A Luke Skywalker Adventure'' by Jason Fry and ''Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo &amp; Chewbacca Adventure'' by Greg Rucka, the two animated comics were originally offered exclusively on the now-defunct Nestlé Comics website by typing a digital code featured on every box of Nestlé cereals.

[[File:PalazzoTrinci026.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Chariot races, as depicted on this 2nd-century [[relief]], were among the ''ludi'' presented at Roman religious festivals]]
'''''Ludi''''' ([[Latin]] plural) were public games held for the benefit and entertainment of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]]. ''Ludi'' were held in conjunction with, or sometimes as the major feature of, [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Religious festival#Ancient Roman religious festivals|festivals]], and were also presented as part of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult of state]].

The earliest ''ludi'' were [[Chariot racing#Roman era|horse races]] in the [[Circus (building)|circus]] (''ludi circenses'').&lt;ref&gt;Not all [[chariot races]] were part of religious festivals.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal exhibitions with mock hunts (''[[venationes]]'') and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical performances]] (''ludi scaenici'') also became part of the festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Days on which ''ludi'' were held were public holidays, and no business could be conducted — "remarkably," it has been noted, "considering that in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] more than 135 days might be spent at these entertainments" during the year.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246. In the late [[Roman Republic]], 57 days were spent at ''ludi'' on fixed dates, with many of the additional game days added by Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; Although their entertainment value may have overshadowed religious sentiment at any given moment, even in [[late antiquity]] the ''ludi'' were understood as part of the worship of the traditional gods, and the [[Church Fathers]] thus advised [[early Christianity|Christians]] not to participate in the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, ''Religions of Rome'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The singular form '''''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]]''''', "game, sport" or "play" has several meanings in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;''Ludus'', for instance, may refer to child's play, erotic game-playing, an elementary school, and a training camp for gladiators: ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprint), pp. 1048–1049.&lt;/ref&gt; The plural is used for "games" in a sense analogous to the Greek festivals of games, such as the [[Panhellenic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Lovatt]], ''Statius and Epic Games: Sport, Politics, and Poetics in the Thebaid'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[late antiquity|late-antique]] scholar [[Isidore of Seville]], however, classifies the forms of ''ludus'' as ''gymnicus'' ("athletic"), ''circensis'' ("held in the circus," mainly the [[chariot races]]), ''gladiatorius'' ("gladiatorial") and ''scaenicus'' ("theatrical").&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''Etymologiae'' 18.16.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of gladiatorial games to the ''ludi'' is complex; see [[Gladiator]].

==Politics and religion==
[[File:Milano - Antiquarium - Terracotta con venatio, sec. I - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 14-July-2007 - 1.jpg|thumb|[[Terracotta]] plaque (1st century) depicting a ''[[venatio]]'', or human-animal [[blood sport]]]]
Originally, all ''ludi'' seem to have been votive offerings (''ludi votivi''), staged as the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|fulfillment of a vow]] to a deity whose favor had been sought and evidenced. In 366 BC, the ''[[Ludi Romani]]'' became the first games to be placed on the [[Fasti|religious calendar]] as an annual event sponsored by the [[Roman State|state]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Futrell, ''The Roman Games: A Sourcebook'' (Blackwell, 2006), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Games in the circus were preceded by a parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'' featuring the competitors, mounted youths of the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]], armed dancers, musicians, a [[satyr]] chorus, and images of [[List of Roman deities|the gods]]. As the product of military victory, ''ludi'' were often connected to [[Roman triumph|triumphs]]. The first recorded ''[[venatio]]'' (staged beast hunt) was presented in 186 BC by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|M. Fulvius Nobilior]] as part of his ''ludi votivi'', for which he paid with booty displayed at his triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Östenberg, ''Staging the World: Spoils, Captives, and Representations in the Roman Triumphal Procession'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

As religious ceremonies, ''ludi'' were organized at first by various [[College of Pontiffs|colleges of priests]]; during the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], they were later presented by [[Roman consul|consuls]], but became most associated with the responsibilities of the [[aedile]]s. Although public money was allocated for the staging of ''ludi'', the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of [[public relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovat, ''Statius and Epic Games'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The sponsor was able to advertise his wealth, while declaring that he intended to share it for public benefit. Although some men with an eye on the consulship skipped the office of aedile for the very reason that massive expenditures were expected, those with sufficient resources spent lavishly to cultivate the favor of the people. The religious festivals to which the ''ludi'' were attached also occasioned public banquets, and often public works such as the refurbishing or building of temples.&lt;ref&gt;Overview based on Sumi, ''Ceremony and Power'' (see below). For an example, see  discussion of [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]]'s aedileship in W. Jeffrey Tatum, ''The Patrician Tribune'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), pp. 198–199 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHGYYaHLgfgC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=%22Clodius+was+elected+aedile+for+56%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Clodius%20was%20elected%20aedile%20for%2056%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bust of augustus.jpg|thumb|Octavian crowned as Augustus]]
Following the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] at the Ides of March in 44 BC, [[Marcus Brutus]] realized that a significant segment of the ''populus'' regarded him not as a liberator, but as the murderer of a beloved champion, and among other gestures of goodwill toward the people, he arranged to sponsor the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'', held annually July 6–13. Caesar's heir [[Octavian]] at once upstaged him with ''[[Ludi Victoriae Caesaris]]'', "games in honor of Caesar's victory," which ran July 20–28 in conjunction with a festival to honor [[Venus Genetrix]], Caesar's patron deity and divine matriarch of the [[gens Iulia|Julian ''gens'']]. It was during these ''ludi'', which also served as funeral games, that the comet famously appeared to "announce" [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#End of the Republic|Caesar's newly divine status]]. Octavian recognized the value of the festivals in unifying the people, and as [[Augustus]] instituted new ''ludi'' within his program of religious reform; public spectacles and entertainments were thus subsumed by [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey S. Sumi, ''Ceremony and Power: Performing Politics in Rome between Republic and Empire'' (University of Michigan Press, 2005), p. 15. Brutus's ''Ludi Apollinares'' is discussed at length, pp. 143–150, followed by discussion of Octavian's counter-efforts. See also John T. Ramsey and A. Lewis Licht, ''The Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games'' (American Philological Association, 1997), and Ittai Gradel, ''Emperor worship and Roman religion'' (Oxford University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ludi compitalicii''===
{{See also|Compitalia}}
The ''ludi compitalicii'' ("crossroads games") were entertainments staged by the neighborhoods or community associations of Rome (''[[Vicus (Rome)#Subdivisions of Rome|vici]]'')&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''vicus'' may refer to either the neighborhood itself, or to the neighborhood association. For a modern equivalent, see [[Neighborhood association]].&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the [[Compitalia]], the [[new year]] festival held on movable dates between the [[Saturnalia]] and January 5&lt;ref&gt;In 67 BC, the Compitalia was held on December 31; in 60 and 58, on January 1; and in 50, January 2 (Cicero, ''Ad Atticum'' 2.3.4 and 7.7.3; ''In Pisonem'' 8). The [[Chronography of 354|calendar of Philocalus]] (4th century AD) and that of [[Polemius Silvius]] (5th century AD) place ''ludi compitales'' on January 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of the crossroads [[Lares]]. In the late Republic, performances were held at the main intersections of neighborhoods throughout the city on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Catullus and His World: A Reappraisal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman civil wars|civil wars of the 80s]], these ''ludi'' gave rise to often unruly [[plebs|plebeian]] political expression by the neighborhood organizations. [[Freedman|Freedmen]] played a leading role, and even slaves participated in the festivities.

In 67 BC, the Compitalia had been disrupted by a riot at the ''ludi'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Asconius]] 45C.&lt;/ref&gt; which were also the scene of disturbances in 66–65 BC. This unrest on the first occasion was a response to the trial of [[Gaius Manilius|Manilius]], who had backed reforms pertaining to the [[voting rights]] of freedmen, and on the second is attached to the murky events later referred to misleadingly as the [[Catiline#First Catilinian Conspiracy|First Catilinarian Conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''Violence in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1968), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with some forms of occupational guilds (''[[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]'') and neighborhood associations, the ''ludi compitalicii'' were consequently banned by the [[Roman senate|senate]] in 64 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Purcell, "The City of Rome and the ''plebs urbana'' in the late Republic," ''The Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994, 2003, 2nd ed.) vol. 9, p. 674. For a discussion of the problematic relationship of the ''vici'' and the ''collegia'', see W. Jeffrey Tatum, ''The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 117. John Bert Lott, ''The Neighborhoods of Augustan Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 177, makes a distinction between the Compitalia proper, which was a state holiday, and the localized celebrations that were "discouraged at times."&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed [[tribune|tribune of the ''plebs'']] supported efforts to stage the ''ludi'' for 61 BC, but the consul-designate [[Metellus Celer]] squelched the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''In Pisonem'' 7.25–26; Tatum, ''Patrician Tribune'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 58 BC, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius Pulcher]], who had given up his [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] status to become one of the people's tribunes, restored the [[Freedom of association|right of association]], but even before his law was enacted, his aide Sextus Cloelius had prepared the way by organizing new-year ''ludi''. The consul [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Calpurnius Piso]], father-in-law of Caesar, permitted the games, even though the organizations that ran them were still outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Damon, "Sex. Cloelius, ''Scriba''," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 94 (1992), pp. 228 and 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar banned the ''collegia'' and ''ludi'' again in 46 BC.

In 7 BC, [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Augustus reorganized Rome for administrative purposes]] into 265 districts which replaced but which were still called ''vici''.&lt;ref&gt;Asconius 6–7; [[Suetonius]], ''Divus Julius'' 42.3 and ''Augustus'' 30.2 and 31.4; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), pp. 279–280. Costas Panayotakis, ''Decimus Laberius: The Fragments'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 208, is not convinced that ''ludi scaenici'', or theatrical performances, were part of the crossroads events.&lt;/ref&gt; An image of the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of Augustus now stood between the Lares at the crossroads shrines, and the ''ludi'' once considered dangerously subversive became expressions of Imperial [[pietas|piety]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Boyle, ''An Introduction to Roman Tragedy'' (Routledge, 2006), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ludi circenses''==
''Ludi circenses'' were games presented in the [[circus (building)|circus]]. The [[Circus Maximus]] was primarily a venue for chariot races, but other athletic events, races, and beast hunts might be offered as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The games were preceded by an opening parade, the ''[[pompa circensis]]''. ''Ludi circenses'' were regularly featured in celebrating a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] or dedicating a major building. They were part of the most important holidays and festivals, such as the [[Floralia]], [[Ludi Romani|''Ludi Romani'' ("Roman Games")]], and [[Ludi Plebeii|''Ludi Plebeii'' ("Plebeian Games")]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary'', pp. 82, 87; Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Imperial era, circus games were often added to festivals for which they were not traditionally celebrated in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, ''On Roman Time'', p. 126 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Circus games were held in various [[Roman province|provinces]] throughout the empire, as indicated by archaeological remains of tracks and supporting structures, although many areas would have lacked costly permanent facilities and instead erected temporary stands around suitable grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, ''The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire'' (Brill, 2004), vol. 3, pp. 337–343; A.T. Fear, ''Rome and Baetica: Urbanization in Southern Spain c. 50 BC–AD 150'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996, 2002), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galaxy 195707.jpg|thumb|right|"Memory" was originally published in the July 1957 ''Galaxy'' as "A World Called Maanerek"]]
'''Memory''' (first title ''A World Called Maanerek'') is a [[science fiction]] narration by [[Poul Anderson]], first published in 1957. 
&lt;!-- Commented out for now; see Talk
The plot has been adopted for the 2009 film [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]] by [[James Cameron]] with rather slight changes.&lt;ref&gt;Schätz, Joachim: [http://www.falter.at/web/kino/filmdetail.php?filmcode=287367 ''Avatar - Aufbruch nach Pandora'']. In: Falter, 2009-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification}}
--&gt;

== Plot ==
In a far future, people are distributed over numerous planets, many of which have lost contact with Earth's civilisation. On a far ring planet, known as ''World Called Maanerek'' by its inhabitants, only a weak memory of Earth has survived, and technology has declined to preindustrial. Maanerek is coveted by a highly developed civilization because it is situated at a location of strategical value.

As the story opens, the protagonist ''Torrek'' jumps down onto a large bird with a wing spread of nine meters, kills it and lands with it in the sea, to prove himself worthy of marrying ''Sonna'', a girl of the local tribe.

Torrek and Sonna are seized in invisible bonds and abducted in a spaceship. It is revealed that Torrek was a member of the same military unit of the abductors. In a neurological experiment, he has been sent to Maanerek with his memory emptied, for the sake of infiltrating the natives so that they willingly cooperate. The natives have accepted him as a somewhat strange, but friendly fellow.

With his memory restored, Torrek begins talking as if no time had passed, sharing all the biased views of his military comrades about the natives. He now considers himself the officer ''Korul Wanen'' again, and reproaches his leaders for having sent him to the planet, because he could have died there.

They bring him to the girl, hoping to obtain information from her that will make it easier to eradicate her people; but Wanen still feels a strong sympathy towards her. To change that, he is commanded to rape and to kill her. Wanen finds confederates and frees Sonna forcefully. He steals a spaceship and flees, leaving his earlier "civilised" companions behind him, in a fireball. 

Though his memory of having been Torrek is gone, Wanen's loyalty is now with the inhabitants of the planet, whom he would help to develop technologically and be better prepared for any new incursion by his former compatriots. 

Many competing groups try, each in its own way, to reunite the disparate planets of the former Empire.

== Source for the film ''Avatar'' by James Cameron ==

Cameron has not just taken over details as big as, for example, the name of the hero, ''Torrek'', which reappears in ''Avatar'' in the name the natives have for a man who is able to ride one of their big birds: ''Toruk Makto'' (the birds themselves are called ''Toruks'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Leonopteryx ''Toruk Makto'']. James Cameron's Avatar Wiki, 2009-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Leonopteryx ''Great Leonopteryx'']. James Cameron's Avatar Wiki, 2009-12-31&lt;/ref&gt; From other works by Anderson, we also know, for example, a paraplegic who slips into the body of a blue alien telepathically (''[[Call Me Joe]]'', 1957), what's but here standing in the connection to a different subject (that of getting somebody of a principally different inner nature), and the ''flying mountains'' of the film. Anderson has published a collection of science fiction novels, ''Tales of the Flying Mountains'', in 1970, and a science fiction novel ''The Avatar'', in 1978.&lt;ref name="SciFiArchive" /&gt;[http://scifiarchive.com/anderson.htm ''Poul (William) Anderson'']. SciFiArchive.Com, 2009-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron takes over the mission of the soldier for the sake of avoiding force in the exploitation of the planet's raw materials, the transduction of certain contents to his brain by futuristic technical means, his love to a girl of the natives, the riding on birds like they're known from museums of the earth's natural history, the fact that the hero has to prove being a man by it, thus getting able to marry a girl of the local tribe, the sudden change between the "civilised" world in the spaceship and that of the natives, Torrek's decision to stay among these, his rebellion, the fact that he finds followers among his old comrades, and his and their success in the final forceful quarrel.

In the film, the natives deviate from homo sapiens stronger than in Anderson's novel. Therefore, a new type in-between has to be generated, artificially. Jake, the hero of the film ''Avatar'', slips from one of two different bodies into the other several times. He, but, doesn't forget what he has lived through in the respective other world, doing so, as strongly as Torrek does, in ''Memory''. The following is that the film largely lacks the special stimulus of the novel, which is that in the soul of the re-transformed, like from a far distance, a memory reappears of his life among the natives. On the other hand side, scenes get possible, thus, in which the "civilised" soldier and the native girl are together and look into each other's eyes through the window of Jake's space suit, knowing who's the respective other.

The film brings things into a much bigger monumentality and, also, sharpens them decisively, in some cases.

'''Middle-earth''' is the fictional [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of much of British writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]].
The term is equivalent to the term ''[[Midgard]]'' of [[Norse mythology]], describing the [[oikumene|human-inhabited world]], that is, the central continent of the [[Earth]] in Tolkien's imagined [[mythopoeia|mythological past]].&lt;ref name="1971interview"&gt;During an interview in January 1971, when asked whether the stories take place in a different era, Tolkien stated, "No ... at a different stage of imagination, yes." Speaking of ''Midgard'' and ''Middle-earth'', he said: "Oh yes, they're the same word.&lt;!--sic, word (not *world)--&gt; Most people have made this mistake of thinking Middle-earth is a particular kind of earth or is another planet of the science fiction sort but it's just an old fashioned word for this world we live in, as imagined surrounded by the Ocean."

Tolkien's most widely read works, ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', take place entirely in Middle-earth, and ''Middle-earth'' has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium and Tolkien's fictional take on the world.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Within his stories, Tolkien translated the name "Middle-earth" as ''Endor'' (or sometimes ''Endórë'') and ''Ennor'' in the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] respectively, sometimes referring only to the continent that the stories take place on, with another southern continent called the [[Dark Land]].{{fact|date=February 2018}}

==Tolkien's legendarium==
{{main article|Tolkien's legendarium}}
Tolkien's stories chronicle the struggle to control the world (called [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]) and the continent of Middle-earth: on one side, the angelic [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and their allies among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]; on the other, the demonic [[Melkor]] or ''Morgoth'' (a Vala fallen into evil) and his minions, mostly [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]] and enslaved Men. In later ages, after Morgoth's defeat and expulsion from Arda, his place was taken by his lieutenant [[Sauron]].

The Valar withdrew from direct involvement in the affairs of Middle-earth after the defeat of Morgoth, but in later years they sent the wizards or [[Istari]] to help in the struggle against Sauron. The most important wizards were [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] and [[Saruman|Saruman the White]]. Gandalf remained true to his mission and proved crucial in the fight against Sauron. Saruman, however, became corrupted and sought to establish himself as a rival to Sauron for absolute power in Middle-earth. Other races involved in the struggle against evil were [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[Ent]]s and most famously [[Hobbit]]s. The early stages of the conflict are chronicled in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', while the final stages of the struggle to defeat Sauron are told in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and in  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Conflict over the possession and control of precious or magical objects is a recurring theme in the stories. The [[First Age]] is dominated by the doomed quest of the elf [[Fëanor]] and most of his [[Noldor]]in  clan to recover three precious jewels called the [[Silmaril]]s that Morgoth stole from them (hence the title ''The Silmarillion''). The [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]] are dominated by the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], and the fate of the [[One Ring]] forged by Sauron, which gives its wearer the power to control or influence those wearing the other Rings of Power (hence the title ''The Lord of the Rings'').

==Terminology==

===Etymology===
In ancient [[Germanic mythology]], the world of Men is known by several names, such as [[Midgard]], [[Middenheim]], Manaheim, and [[Middengeard]]. The [[Old English language|Old English]] ''middangeard'' descends from an earlier [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word and so has [[cognate]]s in languages related to Old English such as the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] word ''Miðgarðr'' from [[Norse mythology]], transliterated to modern English as ''Midgard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/m/middleearth.html|title=Middle-earth|via= glyphweb.com| work=Encyclopedia of Arda|quote=In fact, the name is from an Old English word: Middangeard (probably more familiar in the form Midgard — see ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', no. 165).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Middle-earth"; also commonly referred to as "middle-world," was therefore not invented by Tolkien. It is found throughout the [[Modern English]] period{{efn|The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118148 records usages of it] by, among others, [[William Shakespeare]], [[Robert Kirk (folklorist)|Robert Kirk]], [[Walter Scott]], [[George Crabbe]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and, in the 1920s, [[E. R. Eddison]].}} as a development of the [[Middle English language|Middle English]] word ''middel-erde'' (cf. modern German ''Mittelerde''), which developed in turn, through a process of [[folk etymology]],&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Midgard
  | accessdate = 12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''middanġeard'' (the ''g'' being soft, i.e. pronounced like ''y'' in its modern descendant "yard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Bruce| last1= Mitchell| first2= Fred C.| last2= Robinson| title= A Guide to Old English| edition= Sixth| page= 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The word ''middangeard'' appears several times in the ''[[Beowulf]]'' poem. The word is also used by [[Cædmon]] in ''Cædmon's Hymn''.}}). By the time of the [[Middle English]] period, ''middangeard'' was being written as ''middellærd'', ''midden-erde'', or ''middel-erde'', indicating that the second element had been reinterpreted, based on its similarity to the word for "earth".&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; The shift in meaning was not great, however: ''middangeard'' properly meant "middle enclosure" instead of "middle-earth";{{efn|"-geard" (Old Norse ''garðr'') means, among other things, "yard" or "enclosure", while "-erde" (Old Norse ''jörð'') means "earth".{{cn|date= October 2017}}}} Nevertheless, ''middangeard'' has been commonly translated as "middle-earth" and Tolkien followed this course.

===Use by Tolkien===
Tolkien first encountered the term ''middangeard'' in an Old English fragment he studied in 1914:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / above the middle-earth sent unto men.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quote is from the second of the fragmentary remnants of the [[Christ I|Crist]] poems by [[Cynewulf]]. The name ''Éarendel'' was the inspiration for Tolkien's mariner [[Eärendil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 297}}&lt;/ref&gt; who set sail from the lands of Middle-earth to ask for aid from the angelic powers, the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]. Tolkien's earliest poem about Eärendil, from 1914, the same year he read the Crist poems, refers to "the mid-world's rim".&lt;ref name="RingofWords164"&gt;''The Ring of Words'', p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''middangeard'' was considered by Tolkien to be the same as a particular usage of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη}} - ''[[oikoumene|oikoumenē]]'' (from which the word [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] is derived). In this usage Tolkien says that the ''oikoumenē'' is "the abiding place of men";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 151, 183 and 283}}&lt;/ref&gt; by this he means it is the physical world in which Man lives out his life and destiny, as opposed to the unseen worlds, like [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]]. Tolkien wrote:

{{Quote|Middle-earth is ... not my own invention. It is a modernization or alteration ... of an old word for the inhabited world of Men, the ''oikoumene'': middle because thought of vaguely as set amidst the encircling Seas and (in the northern-imagination) between ice of the North and the fire of the South. O. English ''middan-geard'', mediaeval E. ''midden-erd'', ''middle-erd''. Many reviewers seem to assume that Middle-earth is another planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term "Middle-earth" is not found in Tolkien's earliest writings about Middle-earth, dating from the early 1920s and published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' (1983-4). Nor is the term used in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="RingofWords164" /&gt; Tolkien began to use the term "Middle-earth" in the late 1930s, in place of the earlier terms "Great Lands", "Outer Lands", and "Hither Lands".&lt;ref name="RingofWords164" /&gt; The term "Middle-earth" appears in drafts of ''The Lord of the Rings'', and the first published appearance of the word "Middle-earth" in Tolkien's works is in the Prologue to that work: "...&amp;nbsp;Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk even became aware of them."&lt;ref name="LOTR2" /&gt;

===Extended usage===
The term Middle-earth has also come to  be  applied as a short-hand for the entirety of Tolkien's legendarium, instead of the technically more appropriate, but lesser known terms ''[[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]'' (which refers to the physical world) and ''[[Eä]]'' (which refers to the physical reality of creation as a whole).

This wider use is reflected in book titles such as ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', and in particular the series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', all of which cover areas outside of the strict geographical definition of the term Middle-earth.  Tolkien himself used the term loosely at times.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

The term "Middle-earth" is sometimes incorrectly capitalised as "Middle-Earth",&lt;ref&gt;An example of this spelling is the [[Blind Guardian]] album ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the hyphen is sometimes incorrectly omitted as well, as in "Middle Earth", "Middle earth" and "Middleearth".

==Geography==
Within the overall context of his [[legendarium]], Tolkien's Middle-earth was part of his created world of Arda (which includes the [[Aman (Tolkien)|Undying Lands of Aman]] and [[Eressëa]], removed from the rest of the physical world), which itself was part of the wider creation he called [[Eä]].

Aman and Middle-earth are separated from each other by the Great Sea [[Belegaer]] (analogous to the Atlantic Ocean). 
The western continent, Aman, was the home of the Valar and the Elves called the [[Eldalië|Eldar]].

The eastern side of Middle-earth was washed by the [[Minor places in Arda#Eastern Sea|Eastern Sea]]. Beyond this lay an uninhabited Eastern continent, but this does not figure in the stories. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Most of the events of in Tolkien's stories take place in the north-west of Middle-earth. In the [[First Age]] the north-west was the subcontinent [[Beleriand]], which was later engulfed by [[Belegaer|the ocean]] at the end of the First Age.

===Maps===
Tolkien prepared several maps of Middle-earth and of the regions of Middle-earth where his stories took place. 
Some were published in his lifetime, though some of the earliest maps were not published until after his death. 
The main maps are those published in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and appear as foldouts or illustrations.

====Map of Middle-earth====
The definitive map of Middle-earth was published in ''The Lord of the Rings''. This iconic map incorporates all the chief locations of the main story, and also includes places from some of the background histories. This map was also published (with various additions and embellishment) as a stand-alone poster: "[[A Map of Middle-Earth]]".

It is important to note that this map does not cover all of Middle-earth, but only shows the north-west of the continent. This is made more explicit in the revised version published in ''Unfinished Tales'', which is titled 'The West of Middle-earth at the end of the [[Third Age]]'. Tolkien's [[#Whole-world maps|sketch-maps of the whole world]] also confirm that Middle-earth is far vaster than the area depicted on the ''Lord of the Rings'' map. The part of the map designated as '[[Rhûn]]' is in fact only the western edge of that vast region; similarly the area inscribed '[[Far Harad]]' is merely the northern extremity of Middle-earth's vast southern region.

The Ered Luin ([[Minor places in Middle-earth#Ered Luin|Blue Mountains]]) on the upper left of the map are essentially the same range that  stands on the extreme left of the map of [[Beleriand]] that is published in ''The Silmarillion''.

====Whole-world maps====
Tolkien's maps focus on the regions of Middle-earth where the main stories are set. However in ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'', volume IV of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Christopher Tolkien published several remarkable maps which his father had created in the latter part of the 1930s. These depict the whole [[Arda (Tolkien)|world]] of which Middle-earth was a part: both the original flat Earth and the subsequent round world, and they also show other continents besides Middle-earth. [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] drew from these maps to develop detailed, but non-canonical, "whole world maps" reflecting a world consistent with the historical ages depicted in ''The Silmarillion'', ''The Hobbit'', and ''The Lord of the Rings''.

====Cartography and legal issues====
The first maps appearing in Tolkien's published works – those in ''The Hobbit'' – were drawn entirely by the author himself. The finished versions of maps appearing in later publications were drawn by Tolkien's son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], based on the detailed base-maps that the author had developed; in the case of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien supervised the process.

The developmental base-maps were later published in the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' series. Tolkien's early conceptions of the map of [[Beleriand]] were published as "The First ''Silmarillion'' Map" in volume 4 (''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'') and "The Second Map of Middle-earth west of the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Ered Luin|Blue Mountains]]" (also known as "The Second ''Silmarillion'' Map") in volume 11 (''[[The War of the Jewels]]).'' The author's first drafts of the map of Middle-earth in ''The Lord of the Rings'' were published as "The First Map of ''The Lord of the Rings''" in volume 7 (''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings|The Treason of Isengard]]''); subsequent versions were published as "The Second Map (West)" and "The Second Map (East)" in volume 8 (''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings|The War of the Ring]]'').

The [[Tolkien Estate]] maintains the position that the geographical layout of Middle-earth or any other places in the imaginary universe created by J.R.R. Tolkien was the intellectual property of J.R.R. Tolkien and subsequently is that of his heirs. The Tolkien Estate has therefore restricted the publishing of maps to those authorized by the Estate and legally pursues anyone who publishes any maps, including self-made works, on the Internet.{{efn|Websites such as [http://www.jrrtolkien.org.uk J.R.R.

===Formation===
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|thumbnail|The Two Trees of Valinor, Laurelin and Telperion]]
In Tolkien's conception, ''[[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]'' (the Earth) was created specifically as "the Habitation" (''Imbar'' or ''Ambar'') for the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] ([[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]). It is envisaged in a [[flat Earth]] cosmology, with the [[Sun (Middle-earth)|sun]], [[Moon (Middle-earth)|moon]] and stars revolving around it.  Tolkien's sketches show a disc-like face for the world which looked up to the stars. However, Tolkien's legendarium addresses the [[spherical Earth]] paradigm by depicting a catastrophic transition from a flat to a spherical world, in which [[Aman (Tolkien)|Aman]] was removed "from the circles of the world".

Middle-earth or Endor originally conformed to a largely symmetrical scheme that was marred by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. The various conflicts with Melkor (as well as by the action of the [[Valar]] on one occasion) resulted in the shapes of the lands being distorted.

Originally, Arda began as a single flat world and the Valar created [[Two Lamps|two great lamps]] to illuminate it, Illuin and Ormal. The Vala [[Aulë]] forged vast towers, Helcar in the north of Middle-earth, and Ringil in [[Harad|the south]]. Illuin was set upon Helcar and Ormal upon Ringil. In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of [[Almaren]] in the midst of a [[Minor places in Arda#Great Lake|Great Lake]].

When Melkor destroyed the Lamps of the Valar, two vast inland seas formed at their sites (the [[Sea of Helcar]] and [[Sea of Ringil]]), but Almaren and its lake were destroyed. Arda's two main oceans, [[Belegaer]] and the [[Minor places in Arda#Eastern Sea|Eastern Sea]], were also created in this primeval epoch.

The Valar left Middle-earth and went to the newly formed continent of Aman in the west, where they created their home called [[Valinor]]. To discourage Melkor from assailing Aman, they thrust the continent of Middle-earth to the east, thus widening Belegaer at its middle and raising five major mountain ranges in Middle-earth which adopted a relatively symmetrical distribution, namely the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Ered Luin|Blue]], Red, Grey, Yellow Mountains and the Mountains of the Wind. This act, however, ruined the symmetry of the shape of the continents and their intervening seas.

Many centuries after Valinor was established, Melkor raised the [[Misty Mountains]] to impede the progress of the Vala [[Oromë]] as he hunted Melkor's beasts during the period of darkness in Middle-earth prior to the awakening of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]].

Additional changes occurred when the Valar assaulted [[Utumno]], some years after the Awakening of the Elves. The North-west of Middle-earth, notably the regions west of the Blue Mountains (named [[Beleriand]]) wherein Melkor met the Valar host, was "much broken". Belegaer, the sea between Middle-earth and Aman widened further, creating among other bays one which was the Bay of Balar, the confluence of [[River Sirion|Sirion]]. The highland of [[Dorthonion]] and the mountains about [[Hithlum]] were also a result of the battles.

In the central region of Middle-earth, a Great Gulf (of Belegaer) was formed (the precursor to the later [[Bay of Belfalas]]). To the far south, the Inland Sea of Ringil expanded greatly and separated the southernmost part of the continent from the mainland, in effect forming the [[Dark Land]] (Hyarmenor) and the Inner Sea, linking by straits the previously separated Belegaer and Eastern Sea.

===The First Age===
As told in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', most of the events of the [[First Age]] took place in the large Middle-earth region of [[Beleriand]] and its environs. Tolkien placed within the bounds of Beleriand the hidden Elven kingdoms of [[Doriath]], ruled by King [[Thingol]], and [[Gondolin]], founded by [[Turgon]]. Also important was the fortress of [[Nargothrond]], founded by the elf [[Finrod Felagund]]. In the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Ered Luin|Blue Mountains]] to the east were the great dwarf halls of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]]. Beleriand was split into eastern and western sections by the great river [[River Sirion|Sirion]]. In East Beleriand was the river [[Gelion]] with its seven tributaries, which defined the Green-elf realm of [[Ossiriand]]. To the north of Beleriand lay the regions of [[Nevrast]], [[Hithlum]] and [[Dor-lómin]], and the [[Iron Mountains]] where Morgoth ([[Melkor]]) had his fortress of [[Angband (Middle-earth)|Angband]]. The violent struggles during the [[War of Wrath]] between the Host of the Valar and the armies of Melkor at the end of the First Age brought about the destruction of Angband, and changed the shape of Middle-earth so that most of Beleriand vanished under the sea.

In the First Age geographical changes also occurred in [[Aman (Tolkien)|Aman]], the continent to the west of Middle-earth. The [[Pelóri]] Mountains were raised, along with the [[Minor places in Arda#Enchanted Isles|Enchanted Isles]], to make [[Valinor]] essentially impassable save by the fortified [[Aman (Middle-earth)#Calacirya|Calacirya]].

===The Second and Third Ages===
In the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s, during which Tolkien set the events of the ''[[Akallabêth]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the Western regions of Middle-earth contained the lands of [[Eriador]], [[Gondor]], the [[Misty Mountains]], and the vales of the great river [[Anduin]]. Eriador was bordered by the [[Ered Luin]] or Blue Mountains to the west, which bordered the sea and the [[Grey Havens]], also called Mithlond. On the east of Eriador stood the Misty Mountains, which ran from the far north to [[Isengard]], home of the wizard [[Saruman]], in the south. The Misty Mountains contained the great [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-halls of Khazad-dûm or [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].

Within Eriador lay originally the kingdom of [[Arnor]], founded by Men who had fled the destruction of [[Númenor]]. It later split into the kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]], and [[Rhudaur]]. These kingdoms too had long since passed into history by the time of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Eriador also contained [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], homeland of the [[Hobbit]]s, and the nearby settlement of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. [[Rivendell]] or Imladris, the home of the Half-elven [[Elrond]] also lay in Eriador, close to the western side of the Misty Mountains.

East of the Misty Mountains lay the large region called Wilderland ([[Rhovanion]]) and the great river [[Anduin]]. On its western side, between Anduin and the Misty Mountains, lay the Elvish kingdom of [[Lothlórien]], home of the elf [[Galadriel]], and the forest of [[Fangorn]], home of the [[Ents]]. To the east of the Anduin lay the great forest of [[Mirkwood]], (formerly Greenwood), and further east again were the Lonely Mountain or [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] (seized from the Dwarves by the dragon [[Smaug]]), the town of [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Dale]], [[Dorwinion]], and the [[Iron Hills]]. South and east of the Misty Mountains was the kingdom of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], inhabited by the allies of Gondor, and further south the kingdom of [[Gondor]], founded like Arnor by men who escaped the destruction of the island of Númenor. East of Gondor, and surrounded by high mountains was [[Mordor]], home of [[Sauron]] in his fortress of [[Barad-dûr]].

South of Gondor lay the far lands of [[Harad]] and [[Khand (Middle-earth)#Khand|Khand]], and the port of [[Umbar]]. In the [[Rhûn|far East]] of Middle-earth, beyond Rhovanion, was the [[Sea of Rhûn]], on the eastern side of which dwelt the [[Easterling]] peoples. The inhabitants of all these farther lands were traditionally hostile to Gondor, and allied with Sauron at the time of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

===Correspondence with the geography of Earth===
Tolkien described the region in which the [[Hobbits]] lived as "the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea",&lt;ref name="LOTR2"&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| chapter= Prologue| publisher= | edition= | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the north-west of the [[Old World]] is essentially [[Europe]] (including [[Great Britain|Britain]]). However, as he noted in private letters, the geographies do not match, and he did not consciously make them match when he was writing (with the exception of a newly discovered annotated map, see below):

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the shape of the world of the [[Third Age]], I am afraid that was devised 'dramatically' rather than geologically, or paleontologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am historically minded. Middle-earth is not an imaginary world. The name is the modern form (appearing in the 13th century) of midden-erd&gt;middel-erd, an ancient name for the ''[[oikoumene]]'', the abiding place of Men, the objectively real world, in use specifically opposed to imaginary worlds (as Fairyland) or unseen worlds (as Heaven or Hell). The theatre of my tale is this earth, the one in which we now live, but the historical period is imaginary. The essentials of that abiding place are all there (at any rate for inhabitants of N.W. Europe), so naturally it feels familiar, even if a little glorified by enchantment of distance in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...if it were 'history', it would be difficult to fit the lands and events (or 'cultures') into such evidence as we possess, archaeological or geological, concerning the nearer or remoter part of what is now called Europe; though [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], for instance, is expressly stated to have been in this region...I hope the, evidently long but undefined gap* in time between the Fall of [[Barad-dûr]] and our Days is sufficient for 'literary credibility', even for readers acquainted with what is known as 'pre-history'. I have, I suppose, constructed an imaginary time, but kept my feet on my own mother-earth for place. I prefer that to the contemporary mode of seeking remote globes in 'space'. However curious, they are alien, and not loveable with the love of blood-kin...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another letter, Tolkien made correspondences in latitude (not equations) between Europe and Middle-earth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The action of the story takes place in the North-west of 'Middle-earth', equivalent in latitude to the coastlands of Europe and the north shores of the Mediterranean. ... If [[Hobbiton]] and [[Rivendell]] are taken (as intended) to be at about the latitude of [[Oxford]], then [[Minas Tirith]], 600 miles south, is at about the latitude of [[Florence]]. The Mouths of [[Anduin]] and the ancient city of [[Pelargir]] are at about the latitude of ancient [[Troy]].&lt;ref name="letters294"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He did confirm, however, that [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], the land of his [[Hobbit]] heroes, was ''based on'' [[England]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'The Shire' is based on rural England and not any other country in the world...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Prologue to ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien writes: "Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has been changed..."

The Appendices make several references in both history and etymology of topics 'now' (in modern English languages) and 'then' (ancient languages);

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The year no doubt was of the same length,¹ [''the footnote here reads'': 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds.] for long ago as those times are now reckoned in years and lives of men, they were not very remote according to the memory of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| page= 1107| publisher= Harper Collins, Inc.| edition= 2009 | format= Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nodded to both in Appendices and ''The Silmarillion'' (with supporting information within the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' series) there are constellations and stars that correspond to the astronomy seen in the northern hemisphere of Earth, including references to the Sun, the Moon, [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] (and his belt),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= The Silmarillion| isbn= | page= 44| quote= Menelmacar with his shining belt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursa Major]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= The Silmarillion| isbn= | page= 45| quote=And high in the north as a challenge to [[Melkor]] she set the crown of seven mighty stars to swing, [[Valacirca]], the Sickle of the Valar...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| page= 174| publisher= Harper Collins, Inc.| edition= Kindle| isbn= | quote= The Sickle [The Hobbits’ name for the Plough or Great Bear] was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other planets (described as "stars"; thus Carnil is "[[Mars]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.annalsofarda.dk/annals-of-arda/Object-index-tables/Object/Carnil.htm |title=Annals Of Arda - Carnil |last1= |first1= |date= |website= annalsofarda.dk |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A map annotated by Tolkien, discovered in October 2015 in [[Pauline Baynes]]'s collection, places Hobbiton on the same latitude as Oxford, but also corresponds Minas Tirith with Ravenna, Italy.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Arda|Timeline of Arda}}
In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' the history of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]] is divided into four great time periods, known as the [[Ainulindalë]], the [[Years of the Lamps]], the [[Years of the Trees]] (the Valian years) and the [[Years of the Sun]]. In Middle-earth recorded history did not begin until the [[First Age]] and the [[Awakening of the Elves]] during the Years of the Trees - the time prior to that is simply known as the Beginning of Days. During the First Age the awakening of Men coincided with the first rising of the Sun and the beginning of the Years of the Sun, which have lasted from the First Age, through the Second, Third and [[Fourth Age]]s to the present day.

===Ainulindalë===
{{Main article|Ainulindalë}}
In Tolkien's universe, God is called [[Eru Ilúvatar]]. Tolkien created a [[cosmogony]] in which the genesis of the world was musical: in the beginning, Ilúvatar created spirits named the [[Ainu (Middle-earth)|Ainur]] and taught them to make music. After the Ainur had become proficient in their skills, Ilúvatar commanded them to make a great music based on a theme of his own design. The most powerful Ainu, [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (later called ''Morgoth'' or "Dark Enemy" by the Elves), disrupted the theme. In response, Ilúvatar introduced new themes that enhanced the music beyond the comprehension of the Ainur. The foundation of Tolkien's creation is that the movements of their song, and the conflict in themes between Melkor and Ilúvatar, laid the seeds of much of the history of the as-yet-unmade universe and the people who were to dwell therein.

Then Ilúvatar stopped the music and revealed its meaning to the Ainur through a vision. Moved, many of the Ainur felt a compelling urge to experience its events directly. Ilúvatar therefore created [[Eä]], the universe itself, and some of the Ainur went into the universe to share in its experience. But upon arriving in Eä, the Ainur found that it was shapeless because they had entered at the beginning of time. The Ainur undertook great labours in these unnamed "ages of the stars", in which they shaped the universe and filled it with many things far beyond the reach of Men.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===The Beginning of Days===
In time, however, the Ainur formed Arda, the future abiding place of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]: Elves and Men. [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and his followers entered Eä as well, and they set about ruining and undoing whatever the others did. The fifteen most powerful Ainur are called the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]; Melkor was the most powerful, but [[Manwë]] was the leader. Each of the Valar was attracted to a particular aspect of the world that became the focus of their powers. Melkor was drawn to terrible extremes and violence — bitter cold, scorching heat, earthquakes, rendings, breakings, utter darkness, burning light etc. His power was so great that at first the Valar were unable to restrain him, until the Vala [[Tulkas]] entered Eä and tipped the balance. Driven out by Tulkas, Melkor brooded in the darkness at the outer reaches of Arda. The Valar settled in Arda to watch over it and help prepare it for the awakening of the Children.

The [[Years of the Lamps]] began shortly after the Valar finished their labours in shaping Arda. Arda began as a single flat world and the Valar created [[Two Lamps|two great Lamps]] to illuminate it, Illuin and Ormal. Each Lamp was set on an enormous pillar in Middle-earth. In the middle, where the light of the Lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt on the island of [[Almaren]]. This period, known as the "Spring of Arda", was a time when the Valar had ordered the World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the [[Walls of Night]]. During this time animals first appeared, and forests started to grow. The Spring was interrupted when Melkor returned to Arda, and ended completely when he destroyed the [[Lamps of the Valar]]. Melkor's destruction of the two Lamps marked the end of the Years of the Lamps.

The [[Years of the Trees]] began after Melkor's destruction of the two Lamps, when the Valar left Middle-earth and retreated to the extreme western regions of Arda. There the Vala [[Yavanna]] made the [[Two Trees]] named [[Telperion]] and [[Laurelin]] to give light to their new homeland of [[Valinor]] in the land of Aman. The Trees illuminated Aman, leaving the rest of Arda (including Middle-earth) in darkness, illuminated only by the stars.

===The First Age===
{{Main article|First Age}}
The First Age in Tolkien's history of Middle-earth began when the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]] beside Lake [[Cuiviénen]] in the east of Endor (Middle-earth). The [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] were soon approached by the [[Valar]], who requested that they leave Middle-earth and come to Aman to live beside them. Many of the Elves were persuaded to undertake the [[Great Journey]] westwards towards Aman, but not all of them completed the journey (see [[Sundering of the Elves]]). The Valar had imprisoned [[Melkor]], but he appeared to repent and was released on parole. He sowed great discord among the Elves and stirred up rivalry between the Elven princes [[Fëanor]] and [[Fingolfin]]. He then slew their father, King [[Finwë]], destroyed the [[Two Trees]] themselves with the aid of [[Ungoliant]] the spider, and stole the [[Silmaril]]s, three extraordinarily precious gems crafted by Fëanor that contained light of the Two Trees, from their maker's vault.

Fëanor persuaded most of his people, the [[Noldor]], to leave Aman in pursuit of Melkor to [[Beleriand]] in Middle-earth, cursing him with the name ''Morgoth'', 'Black Enemy'. He and his sons swore an oath to recover the Silmarils at any cost. Fëanor led the first of two groups of the Noldor. The second and larger group was led by Fingolfin. The Noldor stopped at the [[Teleri]] port-city, [[Alqualondë]], but the Teleri refused to give them ships to get to Middle-earth. The first [[Kinslaying]] ensued when Fëanor and many of his followers attacked the Teleri and stole their ships. Fëanor's host sailed on the stolen ships, leaving Fingolfin's behind. The second group had little choice but to cross over to Middle-earth through the deadly [[Helcaraxë]] (or 'Grinding Ice') in the far north. Subsequently, Fëanor was slain, but most of his sons survived and founded realms, as did Fingolfin and his heirs. Meanwhile, the Valar took the last two living fruit of the Two Trees and used them to create the [[Moon (Middle-earth)|Moon]] and [[Sun (Middle-earth)|Sun]], which remained a part of Arda, but were separate from [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Ambar]] (the earthly world).

The [[Years of the Sun]] began when the Valar made the Sun, and it rose over Ambar, and thereafter time in the First Age was counted from the date of its rising. After several great battles, a [[Siege of Angband|Long Peace]] ensued for four hundred years, during which time the first Men, the [[Edain]], entered Beleriand by crossing over the [[Ered Lindon|Blue Mountains]]. When Morgoth broke the [[siege of Angband]], one by one, the Elven kingdoms fell, even the hidden city of [[Gondolin]]. The only measurable success achieved by Elves and Men came when [[Beren]] of the Edain and [[Lúthien]], daughter of [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]], retrieved a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. Afterward, [[Beren and Lúthien]] died, and were restored to life by the Valar with the understanding that Lúthien was to become mortal and Beren should never be seen by Men again.

Thingol quarrelled with the Dwarves of [[Nogrod]] and they slew him, stealing the Silmaril. Beren waylaid the dwarves and recovered the Silmaril, which he gave to Lúthien. Soon afterwards, both Beren and Lúthien died again. The Silmaril was given to their son [[Dior (Middle-earth)|Dior Half-elven]], who had restored the Kingdom of [[Doriath]]. The [[sons of Fëanor]] demanded that Dior surrender the Silmaril to them, and he refused. The Fëanorians destroyed Doriath and killed Dior in the second Kinslaying, but Dior's young daughter [[Elwing]] escaped with the jewel. Three sons of Fëanor—[[Celegorm]], [[Curufin]], and [[Caranthir]]—died trying to retake the jewel.

By the end of the age, all that remained of the free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the [[River Sirion]]. Among them was [[Eärendil]], who married Elwing. But the Fëanorians again demanded the Silmaril be returned to them, and after their demand was rejected they resolved to take the jewel by force, leading to the third Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]], to beg the Valar for pardon and aid. The Valar responded. Melkor was captured, most of his works were destroyed, and he was banished beyond the confines of the world into the [[Door of Night]].

The Silmarils were recovered at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was broken and began to sink under the sea. Fëanor's last remaining sons, [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], were ordered to return to [[Valinor]]. They proceeded to steal the Silmarils from the victorious [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]. But, as with Melkor, the Silmarils burned their hands and they then realized they were not meant to possess them, and that their oath was null. Each of the brothers met his fate: Maedhros threw himself with the Silmaril into a chasm of fire, and Maglor threw his Silmaril into the sea. Thus, one Silmaril ended in the sky, worn by Eärendil, a second in the earth, and the third in the sea.

===The Second Age===
{{Main article|Second Age}}
At the beginning of the Second Age, the [[Edain]] were given the island of [[Númenor]] toward the west of [[Belegaer|the Great Sea]] as their home, while many [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] were welcomed into the West. The Númenóreans were blessed by the [[Valar]] with long life, three times that of lesser men. They became great seafarers, and, in their days of glory, came to Middle-earth to teach the lesser men great skills. However, the Númenóreans grew jealous of their immortal brethren, the Elves. At the height of their power, the Númenóreans ruled over the Men of Middle-earth, instead of helping them. After a few centuries, [[Sauron]], [[Morgoth]]'s most powerful servant and chief captain, began to organize evil creatures in the eastern lands. He persuaded Elven smiths in [[Eregion]] to create [[Rings of Power]], and secretly forged the [[One Ring]] to control the other Rings. But the Elves became aware of Sauron's plan as soon as he put the One Ring on his hand, and they removed [[Three Rings|their own Rings]] before he could master their wills. During this time, the Shadow grew over Númenor, as kings no longer laid down their lives when they had lived to the fullest, but rather clung greedily to life. Númenor, ever thankful to [[Eru Ilúvatar]] and the Valar in the past, now neglected to pay tribute, growing ever more restless about the Doom of Man, the curse of mortality. The people of Númenor became divided between the [[Númenor#King's Men|King's Men]], those who would see the power and dominion of Númenor grow and their gratitude towards the Elves and Valar wane, and [[Númenor#Elendili|the Faithful]], who still maintained their ties with the Elves, and still paid heed to the words of Eru.

With his newfound might and growing dominion over Middle-earth, Sauron claimed that he was the King of Men. [[Ar-Pharazôn]], the last king of Númenor, thinking that none but he should have this title, sailed to Middle-earth with an army to challenge Sauron's claim. Sauron, seeing the might of Númenor at its noontide, knew that he could not stand against them. So he allowed himself to be captured and taken back to Númenor as a hostage. Soon, Sauron's deceit and fair-seeming words won him favour with the King. He lied to the King, and told him that Melkor, Lord of Darkness, was the true God and that Eru was but an invention of the Valar. Thus began the persecution of the Faithful, who were sacrificed in the name of Melkor. Finally, as Ar-Pharazôn grew old, Sauron, using the power of the One Ring, told the King that none, not even the Valar of Valinor, could challenge the might of Númenor, and that the King should assail Valinor, and by setting foot on the Undying Lands, achieve immortality. Ar-Pharazôn, fearing death, assembled a massive fleet and set sail for the Undying Lands. [[Amandil]], chief of those still faithful to the Valar, remembering the embassy of Eärendil, set sail to seek mercy from the Valar. To disguise his intent, he sailed first to the east, and then sailed west, but was never heard from again. His son [[Elendil]] and grandsons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] kept the Faithful out of the coming war and made preparations to flee in [[Middle-earth objects#Nine Ships|nine ships]].

Before the end of the [[Second Age]], when the Men of [[Númenor]] rebelled against the Valar due to the deceits of Sauron, Ilúvatar destroyed Númenor, separated [[Valinor]] from the rest of Arda, and formed new lands, making the world round. When the King's forces landed on Aman, the Valar called for Ilúvatar to intervene. The world was changed, so that Aman was removed from Imbar. From that time onward, Men could no longer find Aman, but Elves seeking passage in specially hallowed ships received the grace of using the [[Straight Road]], which led from Middle-earth's seas to the seas of Aman. The mighty fleet of Ar-Pharazôn and the land of Númenor, were utterly destroyed, and with it the fair body of Sauron; but his spirit endured and fled back to Middle-earth. Elendil and his sons also escaped to Middle-earth, and founded the realms of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].

Sauron soon rose again, but the Elves allied with the Men to form the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] and defeated him. In a siege that lasted years, [[Gil-galad]], High King of the Elves; [[Elendil]], the ruler of Gondor and Arnor; and [[Anárion]], son of Elendil; were slain, as was Sauron's body. Elendil's other son Isildur finally cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with his father's sword, diminishing Sauron's power and making his spirit flee once again, and thus achieving victory and peace for a time. But Isildur refused to destroy the One Ring in the fires of [[Mount Doom]], against all advice, and took it as a [[weregild]] for his father and brother. However, the Ring soon betrayed him when it abandoned him during an ambush of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] at the [[Middle-earth wars and battles#Disaster of the Gladden Fields|Gladden Fields]]; Isildur was slain and the Ring was lost in the [[Anduin]] for over two thousand years.

===The Third Age===
{{Main article|Third Age}}
The [[Third Age]] saw the rise in power of the realms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], and their decline. By the time of ''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Sauron]] had recovered much of his former strength, and was seeking the [[One Ring]]. He learned that it was in the possession of a [[Hobbit]] and sent out the nine [[Ringwraith]]s to retrieve it. The Ring-bearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], travelled to [[Rivendell]], where it was decided that the Ring had to be destroyed in the only way possible: casting it into the fires of [[Mount Doom]]. Frodo set out on the quest with eight companions—the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. At the last moment, he failed, but with the intervention of the creature [[Gollum]]—who was saved by the pity of Frodo and [[Bilbo Baggins]]—the Ring was nevertheless destroyed. Frodo with his companion [[Sam Gamgee]] were hailed as heroes. Sauron was destroyed and his spirit forever dissipated.

The end of the Third Age marked the end of the dominion of the Elves and the beginning of the [[dominion of Men]].

===The Fourth Age===
As the [[Fourth Age]] began, many of the Elves who had lingered in Middle-earth left for [[Valinor]], never to return; those who remained behind would "fade" and diminish. The Dwarves returned in large numbers to [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] and resettled it, though they eventually dwindled away as well. Under King Elessar of [[Gondor]] ([[Aragorn]] of the [[Dúnedain]]), peace was restored between Gondor and the lands to the south and east.

In this age King Elessar bans humans from entering [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], allowing the [[Hobbits]] to live peaceful and unmolested lives. Elessar and Queen [[Arwen]] die at almost the same time, and the kingdom is passed to his son.

Tolkien started a story to be known as [[The New Shadow]] set several generations after King Elessar in which a new evil had arisen, men playing at orcs, and which the protagonist follows one of the cultists to learn more about them, before the thirty pages of the draft abruptly stops. Tolkien never finished the story, as he regarded it merely as a "thriller".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-first= Christopher| editor-last= Tolkien| title= The Peoples of Middle Earth'', ''The History of Middle Earth| volume= XII| isbn= 0-395-82760-4| page= 410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages and peoples==
{{Main article|Languages of Middle-earth|Middle-earth peoples}}
{{See also|List of Middle-earth peoples}}

===Ainur===
{{Main article|Ainu (Middle-earth)}}
The Ainur were angelic beings created by [[Ilúvatar]]. The cosmological myth called the ''[[Ainulindalë]]'', or "Music of the Ainur", describes how the Ainur sang for Ilúvatar, who then created [[Eä]] to give material form to their music. Many of the Ainur entered Eä, and the greatest of these were called the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]. [[Melkor]], the chief agent of evil in Eä, and later called ''Morgoth'', was initially one of the Valar.

With the Valar came lesser spirits of the Ainur, called the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. [[Melian]], the wife of the Elven King Thingol in the [[First Age]], was a Maia. There were also evil Maiar, called Umaiar, including the [[Balrog]]s and the second Dark Lord, [[Sauron]]. Sauron devised the [[Black Speech]] (Burzum) for his slaves (such as [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]) to speak. In the [[Third Age]], a number of the Maiar were embodied and sent to Middle-earth to help the free peoples to overthrow Sauron. These are the Istari (or ''Wise Ones'', called [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizard]]s by Men), including [[Gandalf]], [[Saruman]], [[Radagast (Middle-earth)|Radagast]], [[Alatar]] and [[Pallando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unfinished Tales|last = Tolkien|first = J.R.R.|publisher = |year = |isbn = 9780261103627|location = |pages = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elves===
{{Main article|Elf (Middle-earth)}}

The Elves are known as the first born of [[Ilúvatar]]: intelligent beings created by Ilúvatar alone. There are many different clans of Elves, but the main distinction is between the Calaquendi or Light Elves and the Moriquendi or Dark Elves. Tolkien's work ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' tells of how the race of Elves [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]] in [[Cuiviénen]] in eastern Middle-earth. The [[Valar]] came to Middle-earth soon afterwards, and invited the Elves to come and live with them in their home in [[Aman (Tolkien)|Aman]], the continent to the west of Middle-earth. Those elves who accepted and began the Great Journey to Aman from their birthplace of Cuiviénen were called the Eldar or the Middle-earth Eldar. The elves who completed the journey were sometimes called the Light Elves because they saw the magical Light of the [[Two Trees]], the source of light in Aman. Those elves who refused the offer were called the Avari, and the Eldar who tired of the long journey west and remained behind in Middle-earth were called the Dark Elves because they would never see the Light of the Two Trees. Generally Dark Elves were considered less powerful than Light Elves, but the term 'Dark' did not imply they were in any way evil. In later years some of the Light Elves (chiefly the [[Noldor]] clan) returned to Middle-earth, mainly on a quest to retrieve precious jewels called the [[Silmarils]], stolen from them by [[Morgoth]].

Originally Elves all spoke the same [[Common Eldarin]] ancestral tongue, but after the long separation of thousands of years it diverged into different languages. The two main Elven languages were [[Quenya]], spoken by the Light Elves, and [[Sindarin]], spoken by the [[Sindar]], the Dark Elves who stayed behind in Beleriand as mentioned above. Tolkien compared the use of Quenya in Middle-earth as like Latin, with Sindarin as the common speech. The [[Teleri]] of [[Valinor]] spoke [[Telerin]], which was very close to Quenya but generally considered a distinct language and not a dialect.

Physically the Elves resemble humans almost identically; indeed, they are arguably the same species, as they can marry and have children (though this is extremely rare and the [[Half-elven]] are very famous as a result). However the Elves have a more ethereal and less visceral nature, and their bodies "fade" into their spirits, to the point that any Elves alive today would be totally ghostlike and invisible to most Humans.

The Elves are very agile and quick-footed. They are generally somewhat taller than Men. They are also extremely well coordinated, as is evident in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', when the elves walk across the [[tightrope]] in the woods of [[Lothlórien]]. Their eyesight is hawk-like and they are also said to glow with light. Another example is when the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] take the pass of [[Caradhras]], where [[Legolas]] is able to walk across the deep snow without falling through. Though they can be killed, Elves are immortal, and when they reach maturity they appear to cease aging (though they do continue to physically age, just at a rate so slow as to be almost imperceptible, such as in [[Círdan]]'s case). They are also re-embodied in [[Valinor]] if they are slain or die in an accident, and in the first and second ages, had the ability to return to Middle Earth exactly as they were previously, though they very seldom opted to do so. Their ears are pointed to a slight extent.

In Tolkien's writings the elves have been divided in several subgroups described in English as high elves, light-elves, fair-elves, deep elves, sea-elves, green-elves, wood-elves (sylvan elves), dark elves, grey-elves, and the special category half-elves. In the languages of the Elves there are additional subgroups under the above categories.

===Men===
{{Main article|Man (Middle-earth)}}

Men were the second born of the Children of Ilúvatar, who awoke in Middle-earth much later than the Elves and (probably) also after the Dwarves. The capitalized term "Man" (plural "Men") is used as a gender-neutral racial description, to distinguish humans from the other human-like races of Middle-earth.

In appearance they are much like Elves, but on average less beautiful. Unlike Elves, Men are mortal, ageing and dying quickly, usually living 40–80 years. However the [[Númenóreans]] could live several centuries, and their descendants the [[Dúnedain]] also tended to live longer than regular humans. Nevertheless, except in a few 'purer' houses, this tendency was weakened both by time and by intermingling with 'lesser' peoples.

The Men involved in Tolkien's stories are mainly the [[Edain]] and their descendants. Originally the Edain were three tribes of Men who allied themselves with the Elves of [[Beleriand]] in the [[First Age]]. As a reward for their loyalty and suffering in the [[Battles of Beleriand|Wars of Beleriand]], the Edain were given a new home on [[Númenor]], a large island in the ocean far to the west of Middle-earth. Eventually, near the end of the [[Second Age]], Númenor was destroyed, and a remnant of the Númenóreans established realms in the northern lands of Middle-earth. Those who remained faithful to the [[Valar]] founded the kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. These Men were then known as the [[Dúnedain]]. Other Númenórean survivors, still devoted to evil but living far to the south, became known as the [[Black Númenóreans]].

The languages spoken by Men include [[Adûnaic]] – spoken by the [[Númenor|Númenóreans]], [[Westron]] – The 'Common Speech' – represented by English, and [[Rohirric]] – spoken by the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#People|Rohirrim]] – represented in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[Old English language|Old English]].

At the end of the [[Third Age]] and the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]], the King of Gondor is [[Aragorn]]. Other notable Men in ''The Lord of the Rings'' are [[Théoden]], [[Éowyn]], and [[Éomer]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], and the brothers [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]] of Gondor.

[[Beorn]] appears in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as a huge man with the ability to transform into a bear. Beorn often left home for days at a time to fight the enemies threatening the forest people. His origins lay in the distant past; [[Gandalf]] suspected that he and his people originally came from the mountains. Beorn is the ancestor of the Beornings, who live in the north at the end of the Third Age, allied with the Woodsmen of [[Mirkwood]].

===Dwarves===
{{Main article|Dwarf (Middle-earth)}}
The Dwarves are a race of humanoids shorter than Men, and larger than Hobbits. They are mortal like Men, but live much longer, usually several hundred years. A peculiarity of Dwarves is that both males and females are bearded, and thus appear identical to outsiders. The language spoken by Dwarves is called [[Khuzdul]], and was kept largely as a secret language for their own use. Like Men and Hobbits, Dwarves live exclusively in Middle-earth. They generally reside under mountains, where they are specialists in mining and metalwork.

The Dwarves are said to have been created by the Vala [[Aulë]], who offered to destroy them when [[Ilúvatar]] confronted him. The seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Dwarf Fathers]] had no true life as created by Aulë, but were tied to his power. When Ilúvatar saw that Aulë had created the Dwarves in a desire to see Ilúvatar's vision fulfilled and not out of a desire for power or domination of Aulë's will, Ilúvatar brought true life to the seven Dwarf fathers. He forgave Aulë's transgression and adopted the Dwarves as his own. His only condition was that they were not allowed to awaken before the Elves. Therefore, the Dwarves' creator Aulë laid them to sleep in widely-separated hidden mountain locations in northern Middle-earth, and there they remained in [[suspended animation]] until after the had Elves awoken. These dwarves were known as the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, who (along with their mates) went on to found the seven kindreds of Dwarves when they awoke.

The first dwarf to awake was [[Durin]] the father of the [[Longbeards]], the oldest and wisest kindred of the Dwarves, and the main focus of Tolkien's stories. Durin founded the greatest Dwarf kingdom called [[Khazad-dûm]], later known as [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] in the [[Misty Mountains]]. The Dwarves spread throughout northern Middle-earth and each kindred founded its own kingdom. Only two other of these kingdoms are mentioned by Tolkien, [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Ered Luin|Blue Mountains]]. These were the home of the Firebeards and the Broadbeams, who were allies of the Elves of [[Beleriand]] against [[Morgoth]] in the [[First Age]].

''The Silmarillion'' introduces the [[Petty dwarf|Petty-dwarves]] who were diminutive even by dwarvish standards. They had been exiled from several of the Dwarf houses. They were hunted by the elves, leading to their eventual extinction. They had other cultural differences including that they were more unsociable, and freely gave out their Khuzdul names to outsiders.

Of the races, Dwarves are the most resistant to corruption and influence of Morgoth and later [[Sauron]]. The [[Seven Rings|seven rings of Power]] of the dwarves did not turn them to evil, but it did amplify their greed and lust for gold. The Dwarves' resistance to corruption is perhaps explained by their origin as the creations of Aulë and not being created by or original children in Ilúvatar's vision. It is said that very few wilfully served the side of darkness.  Of those who did very little was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/11/15/did-dwarves-ever-serve-sauron/ |title=Did Dwarves Ever Serve Sauron? |last1=Martinez |first1=Michael |date= 15 November 2011|website= middle-earth.xenite.org|publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven houses few fought on either side during the Last Alliance at the end of the [[Second Age]], and is known that none from the House of Durin ever fought on the side of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Silmarillion| page= 352| publisher= Harper Collins, Inc.| edition= 2009 | format= Kindle | quote= Of the Dwarves few fought upon either side; but the kindred of Durin of Moria fought against Sauron.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early parts of the [[Third Age]] (or at least in legends of the previous), it is known that in some places wicked dwarves had made alliances with [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Hobbit| pages= 1057–59| publisher= Harper Collins, Inc.| edition= 2009 | format= Kindle| quote= They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested by Tolkien in some of his notes that of the dwarves that turned to wickedness they most likely came from the Dwarves of the far eastern mansions (and perhaps some of the nearer ones) came under the Shadow of Morgoth and turned to evil. It is however unclear if these refer to Dwarves beyond [[Iron Hills]] (the most eastern known stronghold of the Dwarves).&lt;ref&gt;28. For they had met some far to the East who were of evil mind. [This was a later pencilled note. On the previous page of the typescript my father wrote at the same time, without indication of its reference to the text but perhaps arising from the mention (p. 301) of the awakening of the eastern kindreds of the Dwarves: 'Alas, it seems probable that (as Men did later) the Dwarves of the far eastern mansions (and some of the nearer ones?) came under the Shadow of Morgoth and turned to evil.'] Peoples of Middle Earth, HoME 12&lt;/ref&gt; Because Dwarves are not evil by nature, few ever served the Enemy of their own free will (though rumors of Men suggest the total was greater).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| chapter= Appendix F| publisher= | edition=  | format= | quote= But they [Dwarves] are not evil by nature, and few ever served the Enemy of free will, whatever the tales of Men may have alleged. For Men of old lusted after their wealth and the work of their hands, and there has been enmity between the races.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbits===
{{Main article|Hobbit}}
Tolkien identified Hobbits as an offshoot of the race of Men. Another name for Hobbit is 'Halfling', as they were generally only half the size of Men (Men in those times usually grew to six feet (ca. 180 cm) in height, and a Hobbit would be only three or four feet (ca. 90–120 cm) tall). In their lifestyle and habits they closely resemble Men, except for their preference for living in holes underground.

Although their origins and ancient history are not known, Tolkien implied that they settled in the [[Anduin|Vales of Anduin]] early in the [[Third Age]], but after a thousand years the Hobbits began migrating west over the [[Misty Mountains]] into [[Eriador]]. Eventually, many Hobbits settled in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] and in nearby [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Tolkien says that there were three kinds of Hobbit: the Stoors, Fallohides and Harfoots.

The hobbits who appear most prominently in Tolkien's stories are [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his nephew [[Frodo Baggins]], who each have an important role in the quest to destroy the One [[Rings of power|Ring of Power]] forged by [[Sauron]]; another is Sméagol, who took the One Ring after it was found in the [[Anduin]]. Frodo is told by [[Gandalf]] that Sméagol was part of a Hobbit-like riverfolk, but long possession of the ring corrupted and deformed him into the creature [[Gollum]].

By the time of ''The Lord of the Rings'' Hobbits had long spoken the Mannish tongue [[Westron]], though their dialect of Westron indicates that they formerly spoke a language akin to that of the Men of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]].

===Other humanoid races===
The [[Ent]]s were shepherds of trees. They were created by [[Ilúvatar]] at the request of [[Yavanna]], to protect trees from the depredations of Elves, Dwarves, and Men. When the Elves first awoke, they "desired to converse with all things", and taught the Ents to speak. The Ents developed their own peculiar "Entish" language, which was impossible for other races to learn due to its long descriptive phrases for even the smallest things. Nevertheless, the Ents could learn other races' languages and were able to communicate with others that way. Huorns were intermediate in form between Ents and trees:  Ents that were "falling asleep" or trees that were becoming wildly active; they bore a deep antagonism toward orcs.  By the time of ''The Lord of the Rings'' the Ents were a dwindling race, as the Entwives had left the Ents and disappeared.  In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the Ents, led by [[Treebeard]], the oldest Ent, were instrumental in defeating [[Saruman]] by destroying his fortress of [[Isengard]], and the Huorns destroyed his army of orcs.

[[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]] were evil creatures bred by [[Morgoth]]. They were not original creations but rather "mockeries" of the Children of Ilúvatar and Ents, since only Ilúvatar has the ability to give conscious life to things. The precise origins of Orcs and Trolls are unclear, as Tolkien considered various possibilities and sometimes changed his mind, leaving several inconsistent accounts. ''The Hobbit'' speaks of Goblins and Hobgoblins, and a note at the beginning of most editions explains that "orc" and "goblin" are synonymous, while "hobgoblin" refers to orcs of larger size.  Late in the Third Age, the Uruks or [[Uruk-hai]] appeared: a race of Orcs of great size and strength that tolerate sunlight better than ordinary Orcs.

Tolkien also mentions "Men-orcs" and "Orc-men"; or "half-orcs" or "goblin-men".  They share some characteristics with Orcs (like "slanty eyes") but are described as looking more like men. Some appear at the [[Battle of the Hornburg|battle of Helm's Deep]] and in the ''Scouring of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]'', where it is recalled that similar-looking men were seen earlier causing trouble in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]].

Trolls were made from stone. The Ent Treebeard describes them in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as "mockeries of Ents, they are stupid creatures, foul mouthed and brutal".{{fact|date=November 2018}} Daylight turned such "stone trolls" back into stone. In "Roast Mutton" in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', three trolls catch [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and his Dwarf companions, and plan on eating them; but they are turned back to stone by the light of dawn before they get the chance. Tolkien also describes a race of trolls bred by [[Sauron]] called the 'Olog-hai' who were larger and stronger than ordinary trolls, and who could endure daylight. Other varieties mentioned include cave-trolls, hill-trolls, mountain-trolls (which dwarf all other troll kinds), and snow-trolls. In ''The Hobbit'', [[Gandalf]] alludes to trolls that have more than one head: "I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each." Some soldiers from [[Far Harad]] are described as Half-trolls or troll-men.

Stone-giants appear in ''The Hobbit'' fighting one another in the valleys of the [[Misty Mountains]]. No further reference is made to them in any other of Tolkien's writings. In ''The Hobbit'', Bilbo remembers stories of giants and ogres, and thinks of them when trying to solve one of [[Gollum]]'s riddles.&lt;ref name="PoorBilbo"&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Hobbit| chapter= Riddles in the Dark| publisher= | edition= | format= | quote= Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giants are mentioned in passing throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', sometimes in poetic passages. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] mistakes the [[Argonath]] for giants before seeing that they are just statues, and both [[Helm's Deep]] and [[Minas Tirith]] were reputedly built by giants.

[[The Mewlips|Mewlips]] are legendary creatures mentioned in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. They said to live in a fortress beyond Merlock Mountains and the Marsh of Tode (though it is not clear if these are actual places). They capture their victims and drag them down into the fortress to feast upon.

===Non-humanoid races===
:''see also: [[Middle-earth animals]]''

[[sapience|Sapient]] animals also appear in Middle-earth, such as the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagles]], [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]] the Great Hound from [[Valinor]] and the wolf-like [[Warg]]s. The Eagles were created by [[Ilúvatar]] along with the Ents, and the Wargs were possibly descendants of earlier [[Werewolf (Middle-earth)|werewolves]], but in general the origins and nature of these animals are unclear. [[Middle-earth animals#Great Spiders|Giant spiders]] such as [[Shelob]] descended from [[Ungoliant]], of unknown origin. Other sapient species include the [[Crebain]], evil crows who become spies for [[Saruman]], and the [[Middle-earth animals#Ravens of Erebor|Ravens]], who brought news to the Dwarves. Vampires are mentioned briefly in ''The Silmarillion'' (possibly equivalent to large bats who aided the Goblins and Wargs in ''The Hobbit''). The horse-line of the [[Mearas]] of Rohan also appear to be intelligent and understand human speech. [[Beorn]] had a number of animal friends about his house. The [[List of Middle-earth animals#Badger-brock|Badger-folk]] are introduced in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. They are said to live between the [[Barrow-downs]] and the [[Old Forest]]. In one story they capture [[Tom Bombadil]]. In another poem Bombadil speaks with several local animals: [[List of Middle-earth animals#Little Bird|Little Bird]], the willow-wren; [[List of Middle-earth animals#Fisher Blue|Fisher Blue]], a kingfisher, [[List of Middle-earth animals#Whisker-lad|Whisker-lad]] of the Otter-folk, and [[List of Middle-earth animals#Old Swan|Old Swan]] of Elvet-isle.

In ''The Two Towers'', when [[Gandalf]] returns, he mentions nameless things that dwelt along the path he followed deep under the earth, creatures who gnaw at the roots of the world.

[[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]] (or "worms") appear in several varieties, distinguished by whether they have wings and whether they breathe fire (cold-drakes versus fire-drakes).  The first of the fire-drakes (''Urulóki'' in Quenya)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= The Silmarillion| isbn= | page= 353}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was [[Glaurung]] the Golden, bred by [[Morgoth]] in [[Angband]], and called "The Great Worm", "The Worm of Morgoth", and "The Father of Dragons".  Glaurung played a decisive part in the battles of Morgoth against the Elves in the [[First Age]], and directed the defeat of [[Nargothrond]], but was eventually slain by [[Túrin]].  Winged dragons first appeared in the [[War of Wrath|Great Battle]] at the end of the First Age, led by [[Ancalagon the Black]], the mightiest of that host.  In that battle he was slain by Eärendil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= The Silmarillion| isbn= | page= 252| quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandalf avers, however, that even the fire of Ancalagon was not sufficiently hot to destroy [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring]].

In the [[Third Age]] lived Scatha the Worm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| chapter= Many Partings| publisher= | edition= | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "the great dragon of the [[Ered Mithrin]]" or Grey Mountains,&lt;ref name="App A.II"&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| chapter= Appendix A, Part II | publisher= | edition= | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He owned a large hoard of dwarf-treasure, but was killed by Fram of the [[Éothéod]] in the North not long after the dwarves were driven from [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. The dwarves demanded their treasure back, but Fram gave them only a necklace made of Scatha's teeth.&lt;ref name="App A.II" /&gt;  Subsequently, many dwarves settled in the Grey Mountains; but dragons multiplied there, and a great cold-drake killed [[Dain I]] (whereupon his heir [[Thrór]], grandfather of [[Thorin Oakenshield]], returned to re-establish the Kingdom under the Mountain at [[Erebor]]).&lt;ref name="App A.III"&gt;{{cite book| first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien |title= The Lord of the Rings| chapter= Appendix A, Part III | publisher= | edition= | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly two centuries, that kingdom was destroyed by [[Smaug]], a flying fire-drake, who was later killed by [[Bard the Bowman]] in ''The Hobbit''. ''The Hobbit'' also refers in passing to "[[Wereworms|Were-worms]] in the Last Desert" (in the "East of East"), and to stone dragons.

Turtle-fish are a race of giant sea-turtles mentioned in ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil''. [[Fastitocalon (poem)|Fastitocalon]], the last of the Turtle-fish, emulates an island, waiting for people to land on his back. Then he turns over, sending them to their deaths in the sea.

==Books==
''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' are presented as Tolkien's retelling of events depicted in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], which was written by [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Frodo Baggins]], and other Hobbits, and corrected and annotated by one or more [[Gondor|Gondorian]] scholars. Tolkien wrote extensively about the [[linguistics]], [[mythology]] and history of the world, which provide [[back-story]] for these stories. Many of these writings were edited and published posthumously by his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]].

Among them is ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which provides a creation story and description of the [[cosmology]] that includes Middle-earth. ''The Silmarillion'' is the primary source of information about [[Valinor]], [[Númenor]], and other lands. The ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and the multiple volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' include many incomplete stories and essays as well as numerous drafts of Tolkien's Middle-earth mythology, from the earliest forms down through the last writings of his life.

===Films===
{{main article|Middle-earth in film}}
In a letter to his son Christopher Tolkien, J. R. R. Tolkien set out his policy regarding film adaptations of his works: "Art or Cash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= J.R.R.| last= Tolkien | title= Letters| isbn= | editor= Humphrey Carpenter| volume= 202}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the film rights for ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1969 after being faced with a sudden tax bill. They are currently in the hands of [[Middle-earth Enterprises]], formerly known as Tolkien Enterprises. The [[Tolkien Estate]] retains the film rights to ''The Silmarillion'' and other works.

The first adaptation to be shown was ''[[The Hobbit (1977 movie)|The Hobbit]]'' in 1977, made by [[Rankin-Bass]] studios. This was initially shown on United States television.

The following year (1978), a movie entitled ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was released, produced and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]; it was an adaptation of the first half of the story, using [[rotoscope]] animation. Although the film was relatively faithful to the story and a commercial success, its [[criticism|critical]] response (from critics, readers and non-readers alike) was mixed.
[[File:London 12 2012 LHR 4836.JPG|thumb|An [[Air New Zealand]] [[Boeing 777-300ER]] with "The Airline of Middle-earth" livery to promote the film ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', at [[London Heathrow Airport]].]]
In 1980, Rankin-Bass produced a TV special covering roughly the last half of ''The Lord of the Rings'', called ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]''. However, this did not follow on directly from the end of the Bakshi film.

Plans for a live-action version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' would wait until the late 1990s to be realized. These were directed by [[Peter Jackson]] and funded by [[New Line Cinema]], and produced in [[New Zealand]] with backing from the government and banking system.
*''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001)
*''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002)
*''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003)

The trilogy was a box office and critical success. The three films won seventeen [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] altogether (at least one in each applicable category for a fictional, English language, live-action feature film, except in the acting categories).

[[The Hobbit (film series)]], a live-action adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', was made as a prequel to ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy, produced in New Zealand under the direction of [[Peter Jackson]]. Although Tolkien's novel ''The Hobbit'' is a single book, unlike ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Hobbit'' film series is a trilogy like ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series. The films were released in December 2012, December 2013, and December 2014.

===Games===
{{main article|Middle-earth in video games}}
{{See also|List of Middle-earth role-playing games}}
The works of Tolkien have been a major influence on [[role-playing games]] along with others such as [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[Michael Moorcock]]. Although the most famous game to be inspired partially by the setting was [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], there have been two specifically Middle-earth based and licensed games. These are the [[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]] from [[Decipher Inc.]] and the [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game (MERP) and Middle Earth the Wizards CCG from [[Iron Crown Enterprises]].

A ''[[Middle-Earth Play-By-Mail]]'' game was originally created in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/111094/middle-earth-play-mail|title=Middle-Earth Play-By-Mail | website= BoardGameGeek.com|publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Game Systems, Inc.]] under license by [[Tolkien Enterprises]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleearth.com/current_licensees.html |title= Middle Earth Enterprises |website= middleearth.com |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923045914/http://www.middleearth.com/current_licensees.html |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gamesystems.com/ |publisher= Games Systems Inc. | title= Middle-Earth Play-By-Mail| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[play-by-mail game|play-by-email]] game was inducted into the [[Origins Award|Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design's Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

[[Simulations Publications]] created three [[wargaming|war games]] based on Tolkien's work. ''War of the Ring'' covered most of the events in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Gondor'' focused on the [[battle of Pelennor Fields]], and ''Sauron'' covered the Second Age battle before the gates of Mordor. The three games above were then released together as the ''Middle Earth'' game trilogy. [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] published ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. A [[board game]] also called ''War of the Ring'' has been published by [[Fantasy Flight Games]].

EA Games has released games based on the Jackson movies for the gaming consoles and the PC. These include the platformers ''The Two Towers'', ''The Return of the King'', the real-time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth|The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', its sequel ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' and its expansion ''The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-King''—which puts you in control of the warriors of Angmar, the home of the [[Witch-king]], and the role-playing game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age|The Third Age]]''.
Also recently, [[Pandemic Studios]], famous creators of the [[Star Wars: Battlefront series]] worked with EA to create [[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]], a game with a similar system to Battlefront. The game has mixed reviews but overall was successfully accepted. ''[[Traveller's Tales]]'' games developed ''[[Lego The Hobbit]]'' and before that ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings]]''. The games were based on the films, but their worlds and characters were almost entirely made of LEGO bricks.

Book-based games (officially licensed from [[Tolkien Enterprises]]) include Vivendi's own platformer, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', and Sierra's own real-time strategy game, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|War of the Ring]]'', and the many games based on ''[[Hobbit (disambiguation)#Other media|The Hobbit]]''.

To add on to that, some games take place in between Tolkien's two major works (The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings), such as ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]''. In this game players take on the role of Talion, a slain Ranger of Gondor, trapped between life and death. He is aided by the wraith of Celebrimbor. Together they must sow chaos throughout the armies and servants of the second Dark Lord, Sauron.

[[Turbine, Inc.|Turbine]] (now a subsidiary of [[Warner Bros.]]) released the first Middle-earth-based graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game ([[MMORPG]]): ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'' in April 2007.  Since then, there have been five major expansions of the game, each adding large portions of the Middle-earth landscape.
* Shadows of Angmar (original game release):  Featured The Shire, Rivendell, Bree, and most of the lands of northern Eriador.  Evendim and Forochel were added later, but they were not considered a major expansion of the game.
* [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]:  Added Eregion, [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], and [[Lothlórien]].
* [[Siege of Mirkwood]]:  Added southern [[Mirkwood]] (including [[Dol Guldur]]), and [[Enedwaith]].
* [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Rise of Isengard]]:  Added [[Dunland]], the [[Gap of Rohan]], [[Isengard]], and the [[Field of Celebrant|Great River]] area south of Lothlorien.
* [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]:  Added the area of Rohan east of the Entwash, including the Wold, the  East Wall, the Norcrofts, the Sutcrofts, the Entwash Vale, and in a game update the region of Wildermore.
* [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]:  Added the area of Rohan west of the Entwash, linking it to the [[Gap of Rohan]], and including [[Edoras]] and the fortress of [[Helm's Deep]].

Aside from officially licensed games, many Tolkien-inspired [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]], custom maps and total conversions have been made for many games, such as ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bauer|first1=Manuel|title=Minecraft: Spieler haben das komplette Auenland nachgebaut|url=http://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cbs-News-PC-Minecraft-Spieler-Auenland-nachgebaut-13195125.html|publisher=Computer Bild|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rome: Total War]]'', ''[[Medieval II: Total War]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''.

Moreover, the [[Middle-Earth DEM Project]] seeks to create a highly detailed model of middle earth by using various [[#Maps of Middle-earth|middle-earth maps]] to map every feasible aspect of the fictional world such as rivers, vegetation and buildings for their dataset compiled for the [[Outerra|Outerra game engine]].

In addition, there are many text-based MMORPGs (known as [[MU*]]s) based on Tolkien's Middle-earth. The oldest of these dates back to 1991, and was known as Middle-Earth MUD, run by using LPMUD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.mud.lp/browse_thread/thread/c4ecbb9be83f903d/2a9be0ea86e4c932?lnk=gst&amp;q=Middle-earth#2a9be0ea86e4c932 Groups.google.com], rec.games.mud.lp Newsgroup, 1 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt; After Middle-Earth MUD ended in 1992, it was followed by [[Elendor]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.10/lotr_pr.html|title=The Fellowship of the Ring|first=Erik|last=Davis|work= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| publisher= |date= 1 October 2001| access-date= 25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MUME (Multi Users in Middle-earth).&lt;ref&gt;For a (rather long) list of all the Tolkien inspired MU*s go to [http://www.mudconnector.com The Mud Connector] and run a search for 'tolkien'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
Climatologists from the University of Bristol actually simulated what the weather would be like in author J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth from ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/climatologists-modeled-weather-of-middle-earth-2013-12&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Pancost, one of the scientists who worked on the climate model, pointed out in a press release: "Because climate models are based on fundamental scientific processes, they are able not only to simulate the climate of the modern Earth, but can also be easily adapted to simulate any planet, real or imagined, so long as the underlying continental positions and heights, and ocean depths are known."

===Middle-earth in other works===
There are allusions to concepts similar to, or identical to Middle-earth, in other works by Tolkien, and the work of other writers. The earliest of these in modern English is the poem "The Gray Magician" (1918) by [[Margaret Widdemer]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "I was living very merrily on Middle Earth&lt;br&gt;
    As merry as a maid may be&lt;br&gt;
  Till the Gray Magician came down along the road&lt;br&gt;
    And flung his cobweb cloak on me..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/widdemer/paradise/paradise.html#p21|title=The Old Road to Paradise by Margaret Widdemer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Space Trilogy]],'' in which Earth is also called Middle-earth. Lewis's novels are situated at the approximate time of World War II, with the last novel, ''[[That Hideous Strength]],'' taking place in post-war England, and they specifically bring in references to Tolkien's legendarium (at that time largely unpublished) and treats these references as primary fact within Lewis's fiction. [[Merlin]], of [[King Arthur]] fame, is treated as a successor to the [[Atlantis]] magic found within "Numinor" (Lewis's unintentional misspelling of [[Númenor]]), and similarities can also be found in the [[Quenya]] name for Númenor, which is ''Atalantë,'' and Lewis specifically references the earth as Middle-earth twice, both in Chapter 13, "They Have Pulled Down Deep Heaven on Their Heads". Lewis's borrowings came directly from Tolkien himself: they were close friends and shared each other's literary creations. Lewis encouraged Tolkien to persevere with his Middle-earth writings.

In [[Arabic music]], a '''''mizmār''''' ({{lang-ar|{{script|Arab|مزمار}}}}; plural مَزَامِير '''''mazāmīr''''') is any single or [[double reed]] [[wind instrument]]. In [[Egypt]], the term ''mizmar'' usually refers to the conical [[shawm]] that is called ''[[zurna]]'' in [[Turkey]].

''Mizmar'' is also a term used for a group of musicians, usually a duo or trio, that play a ''mizmar'' instrument along with an accompaniment of one or two double-sided [[bass drum]]s, known in Arabic as ''[[davul|tabl baladi]]'' or simply ''[[davul|tabl]].'' Mizmars are usually played in Egypt at either [[wedding]]s or as an accompaniment to [[belly dance]]rs. In [[Lebanon]], the [[Palestinian Territories]], and [[Syria]], it is influenced by the [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] ''[[zurna]],'' a higher-pitched version of the ''mizmar'', and may also be known in those countries as a ''zamr'' ('''زمر''')&lt;ref name="BergerBrocke2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Shlomo|last2=Brocke|first2=Michael|last3=Zwiep|first3=Irene |title=Zutot 2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVpAUOlQuZEC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1402013248|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''zamour'', as well as ''mizmar''. In [[Algeria]] a similar instrument is called ''ghaita'' or ''[[rhaita]]'' ('''غيطة''').&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David. [http://larkinam.com/Articles/ArtOrientalOboes.html Oriental Oboes and Shawms] larkinam.com&lt;/ref&gt; Along with belly dancing, the mizmar may accompany the [[dabke]], a folkloric [[line dance]] done in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Iraq]].

The '''Museum of the History of Science''' in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]], [[Oxford]], [[England]], holds a leading collection of [[scientific instrument]]s from [[Science in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] to the 19th century. The museum building is also known as the '''Old Ashmolean Building''' to distinguish it from the newer [[Ashmolean Museum]] building completed in 1894. The museum was built in 1683, and it is the world's oldest surviving purpose-built [[museum]].

The museum is open to the general public every afternoon except Mondays, with free admission.

==History==
Built in 1683 to house [[Elias Ashmole]]'s collection, it was the world's first purpose-built museum building and was also open to the public. The original concept of the museum was to institutionalize the [[new learning]] about nature that appeared in the 17th century and experiments concerning [[natural philosophy]] were undertaken in a [[Laboratory|chemical laboratory]] in the basement, while lectures and demonstration took place in the School of Natural History, on the middle floor. Ashmole's collection was expanded to include a broad range of activities associated with the history of natural knowledge and in 1924 the gift of [[Lewis Evans (collector)|Lewis Evans]]' collection allowed the museum further improvement, becoming the ''Museum of the History of Science'' and appointing [[Robert Gunther]] as its first curator.

==Collections and exhibitions==

The collection and the building itself now occupies a special position in the study of the history of science and in the development of western culture and collecting.
One of the most iconic objects in the collection is [[Einstein's Blackboard]]&lt;ref name="blackboard"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/blackboard/einstein-text.htm |title=Bye-bye blackboard... from Einstein and others |publisher=Museum of the History of Science |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Albert Einstein]] used on 16 May 1931 in his lectures while visiting the [[University of Oxford]], rescued by dons including and [[E. J. Bowen]] and [[Gavin de Beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=A. E. | last=Gunther | series=Early Science in Oxford | volume=XV | title=Robert T. Gunther | publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] | date=1967 | pages=250, 436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current collection contains around 18,000 objects from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] to the early 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the [[history of science]] and is used for both academic study and enjoyment by the visiting public.
The museum contains a wide range of scientific instruments, such as [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s, [[astrolabe]]s (the most complete collection in the world with c.170 instruments), [[sundial]]s, early [[mathematical instrument]]s (used for calculating, [[astronomy]], [[Celestial navigation|navigation]], [[surveying]] and drawing), optical instruments ([[microscope]]s, [[telescope]]s and [[camera]]s), equipment associated with chemistry, natural philosophy and medicine, and a reference [[library]] regarding the history of scientific instruments that includes [[manuscript]]s, [[Incunabulum|incunabula]], prints and printed [[ephemera]], and early [[Photography|photographic]] items.

The museum shows the development of mechanical clocks. [[Lantern clock]]s and [[longcase clock]]s are exhibited in the Beeson Room, named after the [[antiquarian]] [[Horology|horologist]] [[Cyril Beeson]] (1889–1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beeson |first=C.F.C. |authorlink=Cyril Beeson |editor-first=Simcock |editor-last=A.V. |year=1989 |origyear=1962 |edition=3rd |title=Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400–1850 |place=Oxford |publisher=Museum of the History of Science |isbn=0-903364-06-9 |at=frontispiece}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gave his collection to the museum. Early [[turret clock]]s are exhibited above the stairs from the basement to the raised ground floor.

From October 2009 until February 2010, the Museum hosted the first major exhibition of [[Steampunk]] art objects, curated by Art Donovan and presented by Dr [[Jim Bennett (historian)|Jim Bennett]], then the museum director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steampunk |quote=Imagine the technology of today with the aesthetic of Victorian science.

The museum is also home to the Rochester Avionic Archive, which includes a collection of avionics that originated with the [[Elliott Brothers (computer company)|Elliot Brothers]], but also includes pieces from Marconi and [[BAE Systems Avionics|BAE Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT ROCHESTER AVIONIC ARCHIVES|url=http://rochesteravionicarchives.co.uk/about-us|website=Rochester Avionic Archives|publisher=Rochester Avionic Archives|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Romantic style''' was a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] architectural style that was part of the [[Romantic nationalism|National Romantic movement]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is often considered to be a form of [[Art Nouveau]].

==History==
The National Romantic style spread across [[Finland]]; the Scandinavian countries of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]; the Baltic countries of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], as well as [[Russia]] (mainly [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]). Unlike much nostalgic [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] architecture elsewhere, National Romantic architecture expressed progressive social and political ideals, through reformed domestic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Miller Lane, ''National Romanticism and Modern Architecture in Germany and the Scandinavian Countries'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 2000:10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designers turned to early [[medieval architecture]] and even prehistoric precedents to construct a style appropriate to the perceived character of a people. The style can be seen as a reaction to industrialism and an expression of the same "Dream of the North" nationalism that gave impetus to renewed interest in the [[edda]]s and [[saga]]s.

'''''Oh, God!''''' is a 1977 American [[comedy film]] starring [[George Burns]] and [[John Denver]]. Based on a novel of the same name by [[Avery Corman]], the film was directed by [[Carl Reiner]] from a screenplay written by [[Larry Gelbart]]. The story centers on unassuming supermarket manager Jerry Landers (Denver), chosen by [[God]] (Burns) to spread his message despite the skepticism of the media, religious authorities, and Landers' own wife ([[Teri Garr]]).

The film inspired two sequels, ''[[Oh, God! Book II]]'' (1980) and ''[[Oh, God! You Devil]]'' (1984), both of which featured Burns reprising his role, but with no other recurring characters from the original story.

==Plot==
God ([[George Burns]]) appears as a kindly old man to Jerry Landers ([[John Denver]]), an assistant supermarket manager. After a few failed attempts in trying to set up an "interview," God tells Jerry that he has been selected to be His messenger to the modern world, much like a contemporary [[Moses]]. Timidly at first, Landers tells his wife ([[Teri Garr]]), children and a religion editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' of his encounters with God and soon becomes a national icon of comedic fodder.

Jerry soon appears on television with [[Dinah Shore]] and describes the look God takes when he encounters him. The next day, after Jerry is stranded from a car breakdown, God appears as a taxi driver to take Jerry home, where they are met by a bunch of chanting "religious nuts." Before he disappears, God consoles Jerry that he has the "strength that comes from knowing."

Skeptical at first, Landers finds his life turned upside down as a group of [[theologian]]s attempt to discredit him by challenging him to answer a series of written questions in [[Aramaic]] while locked in a hotel room alone to prove God is contacting him directly. To Jerry's relief after an agonizing wait, God, working as [[room service]], delivers food to Jerry and answers the questions. After being sued for [[slander]] by a charismatic preacher that God directed Jerry to call a "phony," Jerry decides to prove his story in a court of law.

Jerry argues that if [[God's existence]] is a reasonable possibility, then He can materialize and sit in the witness chair if He so chooses.  At first, God fails to appear and the judge threatens to charge Jerry with contempt for "what you apparently thought was a clever stunt." Jerry argues that when everyone waited for a moment to see what would happen when he raised the mere possibility of God making a personal appearance in the courtroom, that proved that He at least deserves the [[Wiktionary:benefit of the doubt|benefit of the doubt]], although given that a plaintiff in an American civil lawsuit needs only prove his/her case by a [[preponderance of the evidence]] in order to win, the mere establishment of reasonable doubt (including merely establishing that a given doubt is reasonable) is not enough to guarantee a defense verdict.

Suddenly, without opening the doors, God appears and asks to be sworn in, concluding the procedure with "So help me Me." "If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court, I'm God, your honor."

God provides some miracles, first in the form of a few rather impressive card tricks for the judge. Then, to help the people believe, he leaves the stand, walks a few steps and, with everyone watching, literally disappears before their eyes. His disembodied voice then issues a parting shot: "It can work. If you find it hard to believe in Me, maybe it will help to know that I believe in you."

Sometime later, after hearing the ringing of a public telephone, Jerry meets up with God once again. God states he's going on a trip to spend some time with animals. Jerry expresses worry that they failed, but God compares him to [[Johnny Appleseed]], saying he was given the best seeds and they'll take root. Jerry then says he has lost his job and that everybody thinks he's a nut, but God assures him that there are other supermarkets and that he's in "good company." God had said to Jerry earlier: "lose a job; save a world." God gets ready to leave and says that he will not be coming back. Jerry then asks what if he needs to talk with him. God says to him "I'll tell you what, you talk. I'll listen." He then disappears. Jerry smiles as God departs.

'''Pakistani village life''' is the traditional [[Rural area|rural]] life of the people of [[Pakistan]].

The rural villagers of Pakistan commonly live in houses made of bricks, clay or mud. These typically have two or three rooms which house extended families. In the modern days they are living by making separate home for each family but they don't live way from each other, they are extending their villages by making more homes.  In Gongrani, Baluchistan, people live in homes built within cliff-side caves that are connected by walkways.&lt;ref name="Pakistan-ThePeople"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8Ee8RaSlUUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Village+life%22,+Pakistan:+The+People&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QYSjT9T3A6aMiALA0JHdAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Village%20life%22%2C%20Pakistan%3A%20The%20People&amp;f=false|title=Pakistan: The People |author=Black, Carolyn |year=2002 |isbn=9780778793472 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the villagers are farmers but other rural occupations include [[blacksmiths]], hairdressers and tailorers, shepherds.&lt;ref name="Pakistan-ThePeople"/&gt;

The traditional culture of the village is now subject to change due to the effects upon village society from the introduction of modern technology, such as pumps and [[tube well]]s for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;Knerr, Béatrice (Prof. Dr.). page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance to social and cultural changes exists among Pakistani village inhabitants, and varying methods of managing these changes have been tried.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_village_culture_in_transition.html?id=hduRAAAAIAAJ|title=The village culture in transition.

[[Socioeconomic status]] among rural Pakistani villagers is often based upon the ownership of [[agricultural land]], which also may provide [[Social status|social prestige]] in village cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Knerr, Béatrice (Prof. Dr.). page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of rural Pakistani inhabitants livelihoods is based upon the rearing of livestock, which also comprises a significant part of Pakistan's gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;Knerr, Béatrice (Prof. Dr.). page 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Livestock in Pakistan|livestock raised by rural Pakistanis]] include cattle and goats.&lt;ref&gt;Knerr, Béatrice (Prof. Dr.). page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=worship}}
The '''Paschal Greeting''', also known as the '''Easter Acclamation''', is an [[Easter]] custom among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]], and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] Christians. It is also found among some Christians from liturgical [[Protestant]] denominations, such as certain [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} In place of "hello" or its equivalent, one is to greet another person with "Christ is Risen!" or "The Lord is Risen!", and the response is "Truly, He is Risen," "Indeed, He is Risen," or "He is Risen Indeed" (compare {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:64|}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|28:6–7|}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|16:6|}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|24:6|}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|24:34|}}).&lt;ref name="Kovacs2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kovacs|first=Judith L.|title=1 Corinthians: Interpreted by Early Christian Commentators|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=9780802825773|page=10|quote=The traditional greeting on Easter morning is "Christ is risen" To which the response is "He is risen indeed. Alleluia!" This ancient phrase echoes the greeting of the angel to Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph as they arrived at the sepulchre to anoint the body of Jesus: "He is not here; for he has risen, as he said" (Matt 28:6).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.H. Withrow, M.A., D.D., F.R.S.C.|year=1904|journal=Methodist Magazine and Review|volume=59|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, such as in Russia and Serbia, it is also customary to exchange a triple [[kiss of peace]] on the alternating cheeks after the greeting.

Similar responses are also used in the [[liturgy|liturgies]] of [[List of Christian denominations|other Christian churches]], but not so much as general greetings.

'''Phi Ta Khon''' ({{lang-th|ผีตาโขน}}; phǐi taa khǒn; {{IPA-th|pʰǐː taː kʰǒn|}}), sometimes known as '''Ghost Festival''', is the most common name for a group of [[festival]]s held in Dan Sai, [[Loei province]], [[Isan]], [[Thailand]]. The events take place over three days some time between March and July, the dates being selected annually by the town’s [[Mediumship|medium]]s.   

The whole event is called ''Bun Luang'', part of a Buddhist [[merit-making]] holiday also known as ''Bun Phawet''.

The first day is the Ghost Festival itself, also called ''Wan Ruam'' (assembly day). The town’s residents invite protection from ''Phra U-pakut'', the spirit of the [[Mun river]]. They then hold a series of games and take part in a procession wearing [[mask]]s made of [[rice]] husks or [[coconut]] leaves with hats made from rice steamers, plus [[patchwork]] clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribaltrappings.com/AO_1A.html Phi Ta Khon Masks]&lt;/ref&gt; They also wear [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s and wave wooden [[phallus]]es.

The origins of this part of the festival are traditionally ascribed to a story of the [[Vessantara Jataka]] in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in one of his past lives as a prince made a long journey and was presumed dead. The celebrations on his return were so raucous as to wake the dead. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thailand.com/travel/festival/festivals_phitakhon.htm Phi Ta Khon Festival - Thailand Tourism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704064122/http://www.thailand.com/travel/festival/festivals_phitakhon.htm |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The second day of the festival incorporates elements of the [[Rocket Festival]], plus costume and dance contests and more parades.

On the third and final day, the villagers listen to sermons from Buddhist monks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19461">The '''Proto-Human language''' (also '''Proto-Sapiens''', '''Proto-World''') is the hypothetical direct [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic]] predecessor of the  [[list of language families|world's languages]].

The concept is purely speculative and not amenable to analysis in [[historical linguistics]]. It presupposes a monogenetic [[origin of language]], i.e. the derivation of all [[natural language]]s from a single origin, presumably at some point of the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. As the predecessor of all ''extant'' languages, it would not necessarily be ancestral to a hypothetical  [[Neanderthal language]].

==Terminology==
There is no generally accepted term for this concept. Most treatments of the subject do not include a name for the language under consideration (e.g. Bengtson and Ruhlen 1994). The terms ''Proto-World'' and ''Proto-Human''&lt;ref&gt;Used by the [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/MTLR-34b.htm (2003)] and [[John Bengtson]] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; are in occasional use. [[Merritt Ruhlen]] has been using the term ''Proto-Sapiens''.

==History of the idea==
The first serious scientific attempt to establish the reality of monogenesis was that of [[Alfredo Trombetti]], in his book ''L'unità d'origine del linguaggio'', published in 1905 (cf. Ruhlen 1994:263). Trombetti estimated that the common ancestor of existing languages had been spoken between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago (1922:315).

Monogenesis was dismissed by many linguists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the doctrine of the [[Polygenism|polygenesis]] of the human races [[polygenesis (linguistics)|and their languages]] was widely popular (e.g. Saussure 1986/1916:190).

The best-known supporter of monogenesis in America in the mid-20th century was [[Morris Swadesh]] (cf. Ruhlen 1994:215). He pioneered two important methods for investigating deep relationships between languages, [[lexicostatistics]] and [[glottochronology]].

In the second half of the 20th century, [[Joseph Greenberg]] produced a series of large-scale classifications of the world's languages. These were and are controversial but widely discussed. Although Greenberg did not produce an explicit argument for monogenesis, all of his classification work was geared toward this end. As he stated (1987:337): "The ultimate goal is a comprehensive classification of what is very likely a single language family."

Notable American advocates of linguistic monogenesis include [[Merritt Ruhlen]], [[John Bengtson]], and [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]].

==Date and location==
The first concrete attempt to estimate the date of the hypothetical ancestor language was that of [[Alfredo Trombetti]] (1922:315), who concluded it was spoken between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, or close to the first emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

It is uncertain or disputed whether the earliest members of ''Homo sapiens'' had fully developed language. Some scholars link the emergence of language proper (out of a [[proto-linguistic]] stage that may have lasted considerably longer) to the development of [[behavioral modernity]] towards the end of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] or at the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], roughly 50,000 years ago. 
Thus, in the opinion of [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]], the ability to produce complex speech only developed some 50,000 years ago (with the appearance of modern humans or [[Cro-Magnons]]).
[[Johanna Nichols]] (1998) argued that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127-70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Phonemic_diversity}}
In a 2012 study, an estimate on the time of the first emergence of human language was based on 
phonemic diversity. This is based on the assumption that phonemic diversity evolves much more slowly than grammar or vocabulary, slowly increasing over time (but reduced among small founding populations).
[[African languages]] today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized.
The authors used data from the colonization of Southeast Asia to estimate the rate of increase in phonemic diversity.
Applying this rate to African languages, they arrived at an estimated age of 350,000 to 150,000 years ago, compatible with the emergence and early dispersal of ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e35289 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135 | pmc = 3338724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The validity of this approach has been criticized as flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunley |first1=Keith |last2=Bowern |first2=Claire |last3=Healy |first3=Meghan |title=Rejection of a serial founder effects model of genetic and linguistic coevolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=2 January 2012 |ref=harv}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowern |first1=Claire |title=Out of Africa?

==Characteristics==
Speculation as to "characteristics" of Proto-World is limited to [[linguistic typology]], i.e. the identification of universal features shared by all human languages, such as [[grammar]] (in the sense of "fixed or preferred sequences of linguistic elements"), and [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursion]] ("[[clause]]s [or phrases] embedded in other clauses [or phrases]"), but that beyond this nothing can be known of it (Campbell and Poser 2008:391).

[[Christopher Ehret]] has hypothesized that Proto-Human had a very complex consonant system, including [[click consonant|clicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmr0AE1Qyws | title=CARTA: The Origin of Us -- Christopher Ehret: Relationships of Ancient African Languages | date=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few linguists, such as Merritt Ruhlen, have suggested the application of [[mass comparison]] and [[internal reconstruction]] (cf. Babaev 2008). A number of linguists have attempted to reconstruct the language, while many others{{who|date=January 2018}} reject this as [[fringe science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0719/p13s01-stgn.html|title=Linguists seek a time when we spoke as one|journal=Christian Science Monitor|date=19 July 2007|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=May 2018}}

According to [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and Merritt Ruhlen (2011), the ancestral language would have had a basic order of Subject (S) - Object (O) - Verb (V) or [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gell-Mann |first1=Murray |last2=Ruhlen |first2=Merritt |date=August 26, 2011|title=The Origin and Evolution of Word Order|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/42/17290.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=42 |pages=17290–5 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113716108|pmid=21987807 |pmc=3198322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocabulary===
Ruhlen tentatively traces a number of words back to the ancestral language, based on the occurrence of similar sound-and-meaning forms in languages across the globe. Bengtson and Ruhlen (1994) identify 27 "global etymologies". The following table, adapted from Ruhlen (1994b), lists a selection of these forms:

:::''Source:'' Ruhlen 1994b:103. The symbol V stands for "a vowel whose precise character is unknown" (ib. 105).

Based on these correspondences, Ruhlen (1994b:105) lists these roots for the ancestor language:

*''ku'' = 'who'
*''ma'' = 'what'
*''pal'' = 'two'
*''ak&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;a'' = 'water'
*''tik'' = 'finger'
*''kanV'' = 'arm'
*''boko'' = 'arm'
*''buŋku'' = 'knee'
*''sum'' = 'hair'
*''putV'' = 'vulva'
*''čuna'' = 'nose, smell'

===Syntax===

In a 2011 paper, [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Merritt Ruhlen]] argued that the ancestral language had subject–object–verb ([[subject–object–verb|SOV]]) word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/108/42/17290.abstract|title = The origin and evolution of word order|last = Gell-Mann|first = Murray|date = 2011|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113716108|pmid = 21987807|pmc = 3198322|last2 = Ruhlen|first2 = Merritt|volume = 108|issue = 42|pages = 17290–17295 |accessdate = June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for thinking so is that in the world's natural language families, it is typical for the original language to have an SOV word order, and languages that evolve from it sometimes deviate. Their proposal develops an earlier one made by [[Talmy Givón]] (1979:271–309).{{how|date=October 2013}}

Languages with SOV word order have a strong tendency to have other word orders in common, such as:&lt;ref&gt;Gell-Mann &amp; Ruhlen (2003:3–4)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Adjective]]s precede the nouns they modify.
* Dependent [[genitive construction|genitives]] precede the nouns they modify.
* "[[Preposition]]s" are really "postpositions", following the nouns they refer to.

For example, instead of saying ''The man goes to the wide river'', as in English, Ruhlen's Proto-Human speakers would have said ''Man wide river to goes''. However, half of all current languages have SOV order, and historically languages cycle between word orders, so finding evidence of this order in the reconstructions of many families may reflect no more than this general tendency, rather than reflecting a common ancestral form.

===Criticism===

Many linguists reject the methods used to determine these forms. Several areas of criticism are raised with the methods Ruhlen and Gell-Mann employ. The essential basis of these criticisms is that the words being compared do not show common ancestry; the reasons for this vary. One is [[onomatopoeia]]: for example, the suggested root for 'smell' listed above, *''čuna'', may simply be a result of many languages employing an onomatopoeic word that sounds like sniffing, snuffling, or smelling. Another is the [[taboo]] quality of certain words. [[Lyle Campbell]] points out that many established proto-languages do not contain an equivalent word for *''putV'' 'vulva' because of how often [[euphemism treadmill|such taboo words are replaced in the lexicon]], and notes that it "strains credibility to imagine" that a proto-World form of such a word would survive in many languages.

Using the criteria that Bengtson and Ruhlen employ to find cognates to their proposed roots, Lyle Campbell finds seven possible matches to their root for woman *''kuna'' in Spanish, including ''cónyuge'' 'wife, spouse', ''chica'' 'girl', and ''cana'' 'old woman (adjective)'. He then goes on to show how what Bengtson and Ruhlen would identify as reflexes of *''kuna'' cannot possibly be related to a proto-World word for woman. ''Cónyuge'', for example, comes from the Latin root meaning 'to join', so its origin had nothing to do with the word 'woman'; ''chica'' is a feminine adjective coming from a Latin noun meaning 'worthless object'; ''cana'' comes from the Latin word for 'white', and again shows a history unrelated to the word 'woman' (Campbell and Poser 2008:370–372). Campbell's assertion is that these types of problems are endemic to the methods used by Ruhlen and others.

There are some linguists who question the very possibility of tracing language elements so far back into the past. Campbell notes that given the time elapsed since the origin of human language, every word from that time would have been replaced or changed beyond recognition in all languages today. Campbell harshly criticizes efforts to reconstruct a Proto-human language, saying "the search for global etymologies is at best a hopeless waste of time, at worst an embarrassment to linguistics as a discipline, unfortunately confusing and misleading to those who might look to linguistics for understanding in this area." (Campbell and Poser 2008:393)

'''Rebenque''' is the shared name in [[South American Spanish]] and [[Brazilian Portuguese]] for a type of [[whip]] used by [[gaucho]]s in [[South America]].

The word derives from the French ''raban'', Dutch ''ra-band'',  from ''ra'' 'yard-beam' + band. 
Originally it was the rope that ties the sail to the yard, but soon came to mean a whip made of leather or tarred hemp, used to punish sailors (compare [[rope's end]]). 

Especially in [[Argentina]], it is the traditional riding, fighting, and punishing whip of the gaucho (the Argentine, [[Uruguay]]an and Southern [[Brazil|Brazilian]] [[cowboy]]). It consists of a rawhide wrapped wooden handle about {{convert|0.5|m|in}} long with a thong made of a {{convert|5|cm|in}} wide rawhide strap a little longer than the handle. The handle is topped by a knob, and have a wrist strap. It can be embellished with gold and silver.

==Types==
The basic rebenque is composed of a rawhide covered wooden handle {{convert|30|-|50|cm|ft}} long, and differently from other riding whips, a rawhide strap about {{convert|3|-|5|cm|in}} wide and a little longer than the handle. The strap can be double, sewn at the edges, and could have the point unsown, for making a slapper. It has a wrist strap at the top of the handle. 

The wide strap made the rebenque an instrument less severe on the horse than the [[Europe]]an [[riding crop]].

As the gaucho was never far from the horse, the rebenque was always on him. When not in use, he made a knot with the strap and held the rebenque lazily by the wrist strap with the middle fingers of his hand, or hung it from the handle of his [[facón]] knife (as he used the large knife almost horizontally at his back, held by the belt or waistband, the handle protruded from his right side). The rebenque was used also for fighting, as a weapon by itself, when the fight did not merit a knife, or with the strap rolled on his left hand and the handle hanging, as a secondary weapon to the knife in his right hand. 

Of course, it was also used for domestic punishments, and for quasi-judicial chastisement (corporal punishments were outlawed in Argentina, at least in the books, from 1813 on, but the country was very large, sparsely populated and not totally under government control, not unlike the American West). A couple of lashes with the rebenque on the bare legs were widely used as a punishment for children, even in the urban areas.

As an equestrian culture, not only the poor gauchos used the rebenque, and there were (and still are) elaborate versions, with silver knobs and ferrules for the ranch owners (estancieros) and prominent citizens, the cost of the 

Besides the common rebenque described above, there were several other types.
*'''Rebenque de argolla''' (Spanish) (Argentina) is a short handled rebenque with a large ring ("argolla" in Spanish) for holding it. The strap is very wide and a little longer than the handle plus the ring.
*'''Talero''' is a cheap rebenque, perhaps the original, with the wooden handle uncovered
*'''Guacha''' (in Brazil ''mango'') with a short and very thick handle of lightwood, and a very wide strap is used for breaking in horses. Being less severe and noisier than the regular rebenque, it can be generously used on the animal, scaring it without actual damage.
*Work rebenque had a handle simply covered with the leather of a cow tail.
*The '''arreador''' (literally "for herding"), also ''arriador'', in Brazil also '''enchiqueirador''' or '''relhador''', is originally the whip used to drive cattle. As a symbol of authority for prominent persons, a costly and elaborate baton version was used, as various staffs in other cultures. To its handle, about two feet long, when made as a symbol, of fine wood with silver or golden ferrules, topped by a carved silver or gold head in the form of an animal head, or other figure, as on walking canes, a round braided leather thong of about two to three feet was attached. The handle ended in a ferrule (also silver or gold) with a ring, to which the thong—was attached which had also a ring at its point, to which it was attached a short leather fall, with a total length between a yard and {{convert|10|ft|m}}.
*'''Cola de tatú''' (in Brazil, '''rabo-de-tatú'''), literally it means “armadillo tail” (but never made from that animal) is a short whip with the handle covered in a special braiding called “caracol” (snail), becoming a thin braided thong, finished by a short fall.
*'''Chasquero''' (from the Quechua ''chasqui'' 'messenger') has a hollowed handle to hide letters, or a blade, like some gentlemen's walking canes.
*'''Lagarto''' (literally "lizard"), for driving the horse teams in a coach, was just a long tapering braided leather whip, with handle nor fall, but could hurt very severely.
*'''Polca''' (Córdoba province, Argentina) has a longer and thinner handle than the talero, sometimes made with a piece of iron, covered with a rawhide cow leather or braided thin rawhide strips
*'''Rebenque de Argolla''' 'Ring Rebenque' has a large metal ring (in Spanish “argolla”) instead of the wrist strap. The strap used to be wider than in the common rebenque.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''Referential density''' is a concept of [[ficto-narrative theory]] put forward by [[Thomas Pavel|Thomas G. Pavel]] in his 1986 book, ''Fictional Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, Thomas G. ''Fictional Worlds''. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1986. {{ISBN|0-674-29966-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept refers to the referential relationship of a text to a [[Fictional universe|fictional world]], the [[ontology]] of which can be established by a [[possible world]]s approach.&lt;ref&gt;Doležel, Lubomir. ''Heterocosmica: Fiction and Possible Worlds''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8018-5749-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large text that refers to a small fictional world is said to have low referential density, whereas a small text referring to a large fictional world has high referential density. The size of the text is measured in abstract terms as amplitude, which in most cases will correspond to its physical length; exceptions to this may arise in cases of embedded discourses, such as [[metanarratives]] (or imaging digressions), which refer to the actual world. For this reason, the form and [[genre]] of a fictional work provide only an approximate indication of its size; by the same token, it is possible to refer to the size and referential density of part of a fictional work. The size of a fictional world, in turn, is measured in terms of the sum total of properties applicable to the objects and agents inhabiting the fictional world.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Marie-Laure. ''Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory''. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1991. {{ISBN|0-253-35004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative density==
Relative (referential) density builds upon the abstract definition of referential density by including context sensitive factors such as the degree of external information the reader has to import to his reconstruction of the fictional world, the text’s narrative crowding, the ratio between action and description, and the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] paths chosen by the text. These factors will usually have more impact on the number of references in a text than its amplitude.

==Significance==
Referential density and relative (referential) density account for much of what makes fictional texts 'thick' or 'easy' reads. All other factors being equal, high density will make for difficult reading in that the reader is required to reconstruct the fictional world in a short space, whereas low density is characteristic of a high degree of action. An author may, however, focus on psychology and thereby have a static [[plot (narrative)|plot]] with low density. On the other hand, certain authors and genres make the reader's reconstruction of the fictional world the very point of the text's enjoyment, which is the case with most works of [[science-fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[historical fiction]].

'''Seigniorage''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|j|ər|ɪ|dʒ}}, also spelled '''seignorage''' or '''seigneurage''' (from [[Old French]] ''seigneuriage'' "right of the lord (''seigneur'') to mint money"), is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in the following ways:

* Seigniorage derived from specie—metal [[coin]]s—is a [[tax]], added to the total price of a coin (metal content and production costs), that a customer of the [[mint (coin)|mint]] had to pay to the mint, and that was sent to the sovereign of the political area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR2142.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seigniorage derived from notes is more indirect, being the difference between interest earned on [[security (finance)|securities]] acquired in exchange for bank notes and the costs of producing and distributing those notes.&lt;ref name=bank-of-canada-backgrounder&gt;{{cite web|last=Bank of Canada|title=Backgrounders: Seigniorage|url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/seigniorage.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2013|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also applies to monetary seignorage, where sovereign-issued securities [[Monetization#Monetizing debt|are exchanged]] for newly minted bank notes by a central bank, thus allowing the sovereign to 'borrow' without needing to repay.&lt;ref name=fred-seignorage&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neumann|first1=Manfred J.M.|title=Seigniorage in the United How Much Does the U.S. Government Make from Money Production?|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/92/03/Seigniorage_Mar_Apr1992.pdf|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, monetary seignorage refers to the sovereign revenue obtained through routine [[Monetization#Monetizing debt|debt monetization]], including expanding the [[money supply]] during GDP growth and meeting yearly inflation targets.&lt;ref name=fred-seignorage/&gt;

Seigniorage is a convenient source of revenue for some governments. By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of the public's purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an '''inflation tax''' on the public.

==Examples==

===Scenario A===
A person has one ounce of gold, trades it for a government-issued gold certificate (providing for redemption in one ounce of gold), keeps that certificate for a year, and then redeems it in gold.  That person ends up with exactly one ounce of gold again. No seigniorage occurs.

===Scenario B===
Instead of issuing gold certificates, a government converts gold into currency at the market rate by printing paper notes. A person exchanges one ounce of gold for its value in currency. This person keeps the currency for one year, and then exchanges it all for an amount of gold at the new market value.  If the value of the currency relative to gold has changed during the interim this second exchange may yield more or less than one ounce of gold.  (Assume that the value or direct [[purchasing power]] of one ounce of gold remains constant through the year.)

If the value of the currency relative to gold has decreased, then the person receives less than one ounce of gold.  Seigniorage occurred.

If the value of the currency relative to gold has increased, then the person receives more than one ounce of gold.  Seigniorage did not occur.

Seigniorage, therefore, is the positive return on issuing notes and coins, or "[[carry (investment)|carry]]" on money in circulation.

The opposite, "[[demurrage (currency)|cost of carry (demurrage)]]", is not regarded as a form of seigniorage.

==Ordinary seigniorage==
Ordinarily seigniorage is only an interest-free loan (for instance of gold) to the issuer of the coin or paper money. When the currency is worn out, the issuer buys it back at face value, thereby balancing exactly the revenue received when it was put into circulation, without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received.

Historically, seigniorage was the profit resulting from producing coins.  Silver and gold were mixed with base metals to make durable coins.  Thus the British "sterling" was 92.5% pure silver; the base metal added (and thus the pure silver retained by the government mint) was (less costs) the profit, the seigniorage.  United States gold coins before 1933 were made from 90% gold and 10% copper. To make up for the lack of gold the coins are over-weighted. A one-ounce Gold American Eagle will have as much of the alloy as is needed to contain a total of one ounce of gold which will be over one ounce. Seigniorage is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin.

Currently, under the rules governing monetary operations of major central banks (including the central bank of the United States), seigniorage on bank notes is simply defined as the [[interest]] payments received by central banks on the total amount of currency issued.  This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more dollars into circulation.  However, if the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the back end of the deal never occurs (that is, the currency is never returned to the central bank). Thus the issuer of the currency keeps the whole seigniorage profit, by not having to buy worn out issued currency back at face value.

===Solvency constraints of central banks===
The solvency constraint of the standard central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than the same amount of itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.

==Seigniorage as a tax==
Economists regard seigniorage as a form of inflation tax, redistributing real resources to the currency issuer. Issuing new currency, rather than collecting taxes paid out of the existing money stock, is then considered in effect a tax that falls on those who hold the existing currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSVakrh8TToC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=seigniorage+macroeconomics&amp;sig=8biDt3jtUXRForOCnW9rk_NzyEs#PPA365,M1|title=An Encyclopedia of Macroeconomics|first1=Brian|last1=Snowdon|first2=Howard R.|last2=Vane|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Edward Elgar|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[monetary inflation|Inflation]] of the [[money supply]] in the long run may cause—and, all other things being equal, will cause—a general rise in prices due to the reduced purchasing power of the currency.

This is one reason offered in support of [[free banking]], a [[gold standard|gold]] or [[silver standard]], or at a minimum the reduction of political control over [[central banks]]. The latter could then take as their primary objective ensuring a stable value of currency by controlling monetary expansion and thus limiting inflation. Independence from government is required to reach this aim – indeed, it is well known in economic literature that governments face a conflict of interest in this regard{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  In fact, "hard money" advocates argue that central banks have utterly failed to obtain the objective of a stable currency.  Under the gold standard, for example, the price level in both England and the US remained relatively stable over hundreds of years, though with some protracted periods of [[deflation (economics)|deflation]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  Since the US [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] was formed in 1913, however, the US dollar has fallen to barely a twentieth of its former value through the consistently inflationary policies of the bank.  Economists counter that deflation is hard to control once it sets in and its effects are much more damaging than modest, consistent inflation.

Banks or governments relying heavily on seigniorage and [[Fractional reserve banking|fractional reserve sources of revenue]] can find it counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Tara McIndoe-Calder, [https://www.academia.edu/595168/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe_Money_Demand_Seigniorage_and_Aid_Shocks ''Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe: Money Demand, Seigniorage and Aid shocks''], [[Central Bank of Ireland]]; [[University of Dublin]] - Institute for International Integration Studies, May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rational expectations]] of inflation take into account a bank's seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from [[fiat money]] and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal [[tax]]ation and other means.

===Inflation tax benefits to governments===

In the book ''Inflation Tax: The Plan To Deal With The Debts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oi3IQXzH5kgC|title=Inflation Tax: The Plan to Deal with the Debts|first=Pete|last=Comley|date=1 July 2013|publisher=Pete Comley|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are suggested to be a number of ways in which governments gain benefits directly or indirectly from inflation i.e.
* Decreased debt burden (the primary benefit; only occurs if inflation is unexpected)
* Increased personal tax revenue
* Extra revenue from saving account interest tax
* Increased revenue from business taxation
* Relatively lower public expenditure
* Taxing people who don't vote (e.g., foreigners)
* Helping to reduce the burden of other debtors (e.g. mortgage holders and banks; only occurs if inflation is unexpected)
* Making GDP appear higher.

It has been argued that inflation has been used by successive governments since 1945 as a tool to manage their debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inflation Tax |author=Pete Comley |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
The [[50 State Quarters|"50 State" series]] of [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] (25-cent coins) was launched in the U.S. in 1999. The [[U.S. government]] planned on a large number of people collecting each new quarter as it rolled out of the [[Us mint|U.S. Mint]], thus taking the pieces out of circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/circulatingcoins/index.cfm?action=CircPenny United States Mint 50 State Quarters® Design Use Policy], Retrieved December 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Each set of quarters is worth $14.00 (a complete set includes quarters for all fifty states, the five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia). Since it costs the Mint about five cents for each 25-cent piece it produces, the government made a profit whenever someone "bought" a coin.&lt;ref name="State quarters FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=The 50 State Quarters Program of the United States Mint|publisher=[[United States Mint]]|accessdate=2009-10-18|url=http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/50sq_program/index.cfm?action=faq_50sq#costtotaxpayer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713215905/http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/50sq_program/index.cfm?action=faq_50sq#costtotaxpayer|archivedate=2007-07-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Treasury]] estimates that it has earned about US$6.3 billion in seigniorage from the quarters over the course of the entire program.&lt;ref name="Coin Update News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.coinupdate.com/state-quarters-program-seigniorage-0133/|title=50 State Quarters Program Earned $6.3 Billion in Seigniorage - Coin Update|author=|date=|website=news.coinupdate.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, national mints report the amount of seigniorage provided to their respective governments; for example, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] reported that in 2006 it generated $C93 million in seigniorage for the Government of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/royalcanadianmintpublic/RcmImageLibrary.aspx?filename=RCM_AR06_E.pdf|title=Canadian Coins - Circulation, Collecting Coins &amp; Coin Sets - the Royal Canadian Mint|author=|date=|website=www.mint.ca|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government, the largest beneficiary of seignorage, earned approximately $25 billion annually as of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://banking.senate.gov/docs/reports/dollar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  For coinage only, seigniorage accruing to the U.S. Treasury per dollar issued for the fiscal year 2011 was 45 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/about/budget-performance/Documents/20%20-%20FY%202013%20US%20Mint%20CJ.pdf United States Mint FY 2013 President’s Budget Submission] ''[[United States Treasury]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, central banks have introduced limited quantities of higher-valued banknotes in unusual denominations, with the intention of these notes being collected.  The denomination chosen will usually coincide with an anniversary of national significance.  However, the potential seigniorage that can be earned from such printings has proven to be limited, since the unusual denomination makes the notes more difficult to circulate and only a relatively small number of people are willing to collect higher-valued notes.

According to some reports,  over half of [[Zimbabwe]] governmental revenue in 2008 was seigniorage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/19/AR2008021902337.html |first=Michael |last=Gerson |title=Dying Silently In Zimbabwe |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbabwe has experienced [[hyperinflation]] (see ''[[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe]]''), with the annualized rate at about 24,000% in July 2008 (prices doubling every 46 days).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/inflation180.17386.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas circulation==
A very profitable type of seignorage is from the international circulation of banknotes. While the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services at the face value of the note to obtain it. The banknote is retained because the entity values it as a ''[[store of value]]'' because of mistrust of the local currency.

Overseas circulation is intimately tied in with large value banknotes. One purpose of using foreign currency is for store of value, but another is efficiency of private transactions, some of which are illegal.

American currency has been circulating globally for most of the 20th century. Certainly in [[World War II]], the amount of currency in circulation was increased several fold. However, the modern era of huge printings of the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill]] started with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Production was quadrupled with the first ever trillion dollar printing of this bill. As of the end of 2008, U.S. currency in circulation with the public amounted to $824 billion and 76% of the currency supply was in the form of $100 denomination banknotes, amounting to twenty $100 bills per U.S. citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar L. Feige "New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" Forthcoming in Crime, Law and Social Change. https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade there has been considerable controversy concerning the amount of U.S. currency circulating abroad. Porter and Judson&lt;ref&gt;Porter and Judson, 1996, R. D. Porter and R. A. Judson, The location of U.S. currency: How much is abroad? Federal Reserve Bulletin 82 (1996), pp. 883–903&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that in the mid nineties between 53 and 67 percent of U.S. currency was overseas, whereas Feige’s&lt;ref&gt;Feige, 1997, E. L. Feige, Revised estimates of the underground economy: Implications of U.S. currency held abroad, in O. Lippert and M. Walker (ed.) The Underground economy: Global evidence of its size and impact. (1997), pp. 151–208. https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/13805.html&lt;/ref&gt; estimates suggested a figure closer to 40 percent abroad. Most recently, Goldberg&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, 2010, L. S. Goldberg, Is the International Role of the Dollar Changing? Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance, 16(1) (2010) pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; writing in a New York Federal Reserve publication asserted that “about 65 percent ($580 billion) of all banknotes are in circulation outside of the country. However, these assertions are contradicted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds statistics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/ and See:Edgar L. Feige "New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html&lt;/ref&gt; which show that at the end of March 2009, only $313 billion (36.7 percent) of U.S. currency was held abroad. Feige calculates that since 1964, "the cumulative seigniorage earnings accruing to the U.S. by virtue of the currency held by foreigners amounted to $167–$185 billion and over the past two decades seigniorage revenues from foreigners have averaged $6–$7 billion dollars per year".

The American $100 bill has some competition, primarily from the [[500 euro note|€500 note]]. The larger value of the banknote makes it easier to transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/09/21/africa.drug.cartels/index.html |title=Latin American drug cartels find home in West Africa | work=CNN | date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Banknotes of the Swiss franc|Swiss 1000 franc note]] is probably the only other banknote that is in circulation outside of its home country. It is worth slightly more than US$1000. However, to the non-Swiss it doesn't provide a significant advantage over the €500 note as there are 20 times as many of the €500 note circulating and they are more widely recognized. As a [[reserve currency]] it is roughly 0.1% of the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves.

Governments differ radically in their issuance of large banknotes. As of August 2009, the number of 1000 Swiss franc notes circulating was over three times the population of [[Switzerland]]. In comparison, the number of £50 banknotes circulating is slightly less than three times the population of the United Kingdom. But the 1000 franc note is worth roughly £600. The British government has traditionally been wary of large banknotes since the [[counterfeit]]ing [[Operation Bernhard]] in [[World War II]] which caused the [[Bank of England]] to withdraw all notes larger than £5 from circulation, and not reintroduce other denominations until the early 1960s (£10), 1970 (£20) and March 20, 1981 (£50).

The American treasury considered re-issuing a US$500 banknote when the euro banknotes began circulating. There was concern that the high value banknotes would provide competition. However, after recognition that the $500 banknote would provide a huge advantage to worldwide criminal operations and [[dictatorship]]s, the decision was made not to pursue this option.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

''' Shape-memory polymers (SMPs)''' are polymeric [[smart material]]s that have the ability to return from a deformed state (temporary shape) to their original (permanent) shape induced by an external stimulus (trigger), such as temperature change.&lt;ref name=lendlein&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lendlein, A., Kelch, S.|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020617)41:12&lt;2034::AID-ANIE2034&gt;3.0.CO;2-M|title=Shape-memory polymers|journal=Angew.

==Properties of shape-memory polymers==
SMPs can retain two or sometimes three shapes, and the transition between those is induced by temperature. In addition to temperature change, the shape change of SMPs can also be triggered by an electric or [[magnetic field]],&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600079103|pmc=1383650|pmid= 16537442| title = Initiation of shape-memory effect by inductive heating of magnetic nanoparticles in thermoplastic polymers| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 103| issue = 10| pages = 3540–5| year = 2006| last1 = Mohr | first1 = R.| last2 = Kratz | first2 = K.| last3 = Weigel | first3 = T.| last4 = Lucka-Gabor | first4 = M.| last5 = Moneke | first5 = M.| last6 = Lendlein | first6 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03496| pmid = 15829960| title = Light-induced shape-memory polymers| journal = Nature| volume = 434| issue = 7035| pages = 879–82| year = 2005| last1 = Lendlein | first1 = A. | last2 = Jiang | first2 = H. | last3 = Jünger | first3 = O. | last4 = Langer | first4 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; or solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2936288| title = Comment on "Water-driven programable polyurethane shape memory polymer: Demonstration and mechanism" [Appl.

SMPs include [[thermoplastic]] and [[thermoset]] (covalently cross-linked) polymeric materials. SMPs are known to be able to store up to three different shapes in memory.&lt;ref name="toen"/&gt; SMPs have demonstrated recoverable strains of above 800%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adfm.200901409| title = High-Strain Shape-Memory Polymers| journal = Advanced Functional Materials| volume = 20| pages = 162–171| year = 2010| last1 = Voit | first1 = W. | last2 = Ware | first2 = T. | last3 = Dasari | first3 = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two important quantities that are used to describe shape-memory effects are the strain recovery rate (''R''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and strain fixity rate (''R''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;). The strain recovery rate describes the ability of the material to memorize its permanent shape, while the strain fixity rate describes the ability of switching segments to fix the mechanical deformation.

:&lt;math&gt;R_r(N) = \frac{\varepsilon_m - \varepsilon_p(N)}{\varepsilon_m - \varepsilon_p(N-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_f(N) = \frac{\varepsilon_p(N)}{\varepsilon_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the cycle number, ''ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the maximum strain imposed on the material, and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(N)'' and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(N-1)'' are the strains of the sample in two successive cycles in the stress-free state before yield stress is applied.

Shape-memory effect can be described briefly as the following mathematical model:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kim B.K. |author2=Lee S.Y. |author3=Xu M. |journal=Polymer|year=1996|volume=37|issue=26 |page=5781|title=Polyurethanes having shape memory effects|doi=10.1016/S0032-3861(96)00442-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_f(N) = 1 - \frac{E_f}{E_g}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_r(N) = 1 - \frac{f_{IR}}{f_\alpha (1 - E_f/E_g)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the glassy modulus, ''E&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rubbery modulus, ''f&lt;sub&gt;IR&lt;/sub&gt;'' is viscous flow strain and ''f&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is strain for ''t &gt;&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Triple-shape memory===
While most traditional shape-memory polymers can only hold a permanent and temporary shape, recent technological advances have allowed the introduction of triple-shape-memory materials. Much as a traditional double-shape-memory polymer will change from a temporary shape back to a permanent shape at a particular temperature, triple-shape-memory polymers will switch from one temporary shape to another at the first transition temperature, and then back to the permanent shape at another, higher activation temperature. This is usually achieved by combining two double-shape-memory polymers with different glass transition temperatures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608586103|pmc=1838703|pmid=17116879| title = Polymeric triple-shape materials| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 103| issue = 48| pages = 18043–7| year = 2006| last1 = Bellin | first1 = I.| last2 = Kelch | first2 = S.| last3 = Langer | first3 = R.| last4 = Lendlein | first4 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when heating a programmed shape-memory polymer first above the glass transition temperature and then above the melting transition temperature of the switching segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pretsch, T. |title= Triple-shape properties of a thermoresponsive poly(ester urethane)|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|volume= 19|pages=015006|year=2010|doi=10.1088/0964-1726/19/1/015006|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bothe, M., Mya, K.

==Description of the thermally induced shape-memory effect==
[[File:SMProcess.jpg|thumb|400px|A schematic representation of the shape-memory effect|right]]
Polymers exhibiting a shape-memory effect have both a visible, current (temporary) form and a stored (permanent) form. Once the latter has been manufactured by conventional methods, the material is changed into another, temporary form by processing through heating, deformation, and finally, cooling. The polymer maintains this temporary shape until the shape change into the permanent form is activated by a predetermined external stimulus. The secret behind these materials lies in their molecular network structure, which contains at least two separate phases. The phase showing the highest thermal transition, ''T&lt;sub&gt;perm&lt;/sub&gt;'', is the temperature that must be exceeded to establish the physical crosslinks responsible for the permanent shape. The switching segments, on the other hand, are the segments with the ability to soften past a certain transition temperature (''T&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;'') and are responsible for the temporary shape. In some cases this is the [[glass transition temperature]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') and others the melting temperature (''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''). Exceeding ''T&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;'' (while remaining below ''T&lt;sub&gt;perm&lt;/sub&gt;'') activates the switching by softening these switching segments and thereby allowing the material to resume its original (permanent) form. Below ''T&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;'', flexibility of the segments is at least partly limited. If ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is chosen for programming the SMP, strain-induced crystallization of the switching segment can be initiated when it is stretched above ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and subsequently cooled below ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''. These crystallites form covalent netpoints which prevent the polymer from reforming its usual coiled structure. The hard to soft segment ratio is often between 5/95 and 95/5, but ideally this ratio is between 20/80 and 80/20.&lt;ref name=shan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shanmugasundaram, O.L.|title=Shape Memory Polymers &amp; their applications|journal=The Indian Textile Journal|year=2009|url=http://www.indiantextilejournal.com/articles/FAdetails.asp?id=776}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape-memory polymers are effectively viscoelastic and many models and analysis methods exist.

===Thermodynamics of the shape-memory effect===
In the amorphous state, polymer chains assume a completely random distribution within the matrix. W represents the probability of a strongly coiled conformation, which is the conformation with maximum entropy, and is the most likely state for an amorphous linear polymer chain. This relationship is represented mathematically by [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]] ''S'' = ''k'' ln ''W'', where ''S'' is the [[entropy]] and ''k'' is Boltzmann's constant.

In the transition from the glassy state to a rubber-elastic state by thermal activation, the rotations around segment bonds become increasingly unimpeded. This allows chains to assume other possibly, energetically equivalent conformations with a small amount of disentangling. As a result, the majority of SMPs will form compact, random coils because this conformation is entropically favored over a stretched conformation.&lt;ref name=lendlein/&gt;

Polymers in this elastic state with [[number average molecular weight]] greater than 20,000 stretch in the direction of an applied external force. If the force is applied for a short time, the entanglement of polymer chains with their neighbors will prevent large movement of the chain and the sample recovers its original conformation upon removal of the force. If the force is applied for a longer period of time, however, a relaxation process takes place whereby a plastic, irreversible deformation of the sample takes place due to the slipping and disentangling of the polymer chains.&lt;ref name=lendlein/&gt;

To prevent the slipping and flow of polymer chains, cross-linking can be used, both chemical and physical.

===Physically crosslinked SMPs===

====Linear block copolymers====
Representative shape-memory polymers in this category are [[polyurethane]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=B. Q. Y.|last2=Liow|first2=S. S.|last3=Loh|first3=X.

Front.|date=2017|volume=1|issue=4|pages=767–779|doi=10.1039/C6QM00243A}}&lt;/ref&gt; polyurethanes with ionic or mesogenic components made by [[prepolymer]] method. Other [[block copolymer]]s also show the shape-memory effect, such as, block copolymer of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) and [[Polyethylene glycol|polyethyleneoxide]] (PEO), block copolymers containing [[polystyrene]] and poly(1,4-butadiene), and an ABA triblock copolymer made from poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) and [[polytetrahydrofuran]].

====Other thermoplastic polymers====
A linear, amorphous [[Norbornene#Polynorbornenes|polynorbornene]] (Norsorex, developed by CdF Chemie/Nippon Zeon) or organic-inorganic hybrid polymers consisting of polynorbornene units that are partially substituted by polyhedral oligo[[silsesquioxane]] (POSS) also have shape-memory effect.

[[File:wiki norbornene.jpg|700px]]

===Chemically crosslinked SMPs===
The main limitation of physically crosslinked polymers for the shape-memory application is irreversible deformation during memory programming due to the [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. The [[network polymer]] can be synthesized by either polymerization with multifunctional (3 or more) [[crosslinker]] or by subsequent crosslinking of a linear or branched polymer. They form insoluble materials which swell in certain solvents.&lt;ref name=lendlein/&gt;

====Crosslinked polyurethane====
This material can be made by using excess diisocyanate or by using a crosslinker such as [[glycerin]], [[trimethylol propane]]. Introduction of covalent crosslinking improves in creep, increase in recovery temperature and recovery window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Buckley CP. |author2=Prisacariu C. |author3=Caraculacu A. |journal=Polymer|year=2007|volume=48|issue=5 |page=1388|title=Novel triol-crosslinked polyurethanes and their thermorheological characterization as shape-memory materials|doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2006.12.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PEO based crosslinked SMPs====
The PEO-PET block [[copolymer]]s can be crosslinked by using [[maleic anhydride]], glycerin or dimethyl 5-isophthalates as a crosslinking agent. The addition of 1.5 wt% maleic anhydride increased in shape recovery from 35% to 65% and tensile strength from 3 to 5 MPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/app.20903| title = Shape memory effect of poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer cross-linked with glycerol and sulfoisophthalate group and its application to impact-absorbing composite material| journal = Journal of Applied Polymer Science| volume = 94| pages = 308–316| year = 2004| last1 = Park | first1 = C. | last2 = Yul Lee | first2 = J. | last3 = Chul Chun | first3 = B. | last4 = Chung | first4 = Y.

====Thermoplastic shape-memory====
While shape-memory effects are traditionally limited to [[thermosetting plastic]]s, some [[thermoplastic]] polymers, most notably [[PEEK]], can be used as well.&lt;ref name="Anonymous"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=Surgical Technologies; MedShape Solutions, Inc.

==Light-induced SMPs==
[[File:lightinduced.jpg|thumb|350px|A schematic representation of reversible LASMP crosslinking|right]]Light-activated shape-memory polymers (LASMP) use processes of photo-crosslinking and photo-cleaving to change ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''. Photo-crosslinking is achieved by using one wavelength of light, while a second wavelength of light reversibly cleaves the photo-crosslinked bonds. The effect achieved is that the material may be reversibly switched between an [[elastomer]] and a rigid polymer. Light does not change the temperature, only the cross-linking density within the material.&lt;ref name=light&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Light-activated shape memory polymers and associated applications|journal=Proc. SPIE|volume= 5762|year=2005|doi=10.1117/12.606109|last1=Havens|first1=E.|last2=Snyder |first2=E.A. |last3=Tong |first3=T.H.|page=48|series=Smart Structures and Materials 2005: Industrial and Commercial Applications of Smart Structures Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been reported that polymers containing cinnamic groups can be fixed into predetermined shapes by [[UV light]] illumination (&gt; 260&amp;nbsp;nm) and then recover their original shape when exposed to UV light of a different wavelength (&lt; 260&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=light/&gt; Examples of photoresponsive switches include [[cinnamic acid]] and [[cinnamylidene acetic acid]].

==Electro-active SMPs==
The use of electricity to activate the shape-memory effect of polymers is desirable for applications where it would not be possible to use heat and is another active area of research. Some current efforts use conducting SMP composites with [[carbon nanotubes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.08.016| title = Review of electro-active shape-memory polymer composite| journal = Composites Science and Technology| volume = 69| issue = 13| pages = 2064| year = 2009| last1 = Liu | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lv | first2 = H. | last3 = Lan | first3 = X. | last4 = Leng | first4 = J. | last5 = Du | first5 = S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; short carbon fibers (SCFs),&lt;ref name=lu1&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2790497| title = Electroactivate shape-memory polymer filled with nanocarbon particles and short carbon fibers| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 91| issue = 14| pages = 144105| year = 2007| last1 = Leng | first1 = J. | last2 = Lv | first2 = H. | last3 = Liu | first3 = Y. | last4 = Du | first4 = S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3026724| title = Synergic effect of carbon black and short carbon fiber on shape memory polymer actuation by electricity| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 104| issue = 10| pages = 104917| year = 2008| last1 = Leng | first1 = J. | last2 = Lv | first2 = H. | last3 = Liu | first3 = Y. | last4 = Du | first4 = S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; carbon black,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kai|first=D.|last2=Tan|first2=M.

These conducting SMPs are produced by chemically surface-modifying multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in a mixed solvent of [[nitric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]], with the purpose of improving the interfacial bonding between the polymers and the conductive fillers. The shape-memory effect in these types of SMPs have been shown to be dependent on the filler content and the degree of surface modification of the MWNTs, with the surface modified versions exhibiting good energy conversion efficiency and improved mechanical properties.

Another technique being investigated involves the use of surface-modified super-paramagnetic nanoparticles. When introduced into the polymer matrix, remote actuation of shape transitions is possible. An example of this involves the use of oligo (e-caprolactone)dimethacrylate/butyl acrylate composite with between 2 and 12% [[magnetite]] [[nanoparticles]]. [[Nickel]] and hybrid fibers have also been used with some degree of success.&lt;ref name=lu1/&gt;

Shape-memory polymers differ from [[shape memory alloys]] (SMAs) &lt;ref&gt;Czichos H. (1989) "Adolf Martens and the Research on Martensite", pp. 3–14 in ''The Martensitic Transformation in Science and Technology'' E. Hornbogen and N. Jost (eds. ). Informationsgesellschaft. {{ISBN|3883551538}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by their glass transition or melting transition from a hard to a soft phase which is responsible for the shape-memory effect. In shape-memory alloys [[martensite|martensitic]]/[[Austenite|austenitic]] transitions are responsible for the shape-memory effect. 
There are numerous advantages that make SMPs more attractive than [[shape memory alloys]]. They have a high capacity for elastic deformation (up to 200% in most cases), much lower cost, lower density, a broad range of application temperatures which can be tailored, easy processing, potential biocompatibility and biodegradability,&lt;ref name=SMA&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b615954k| title = Review of progress in shape-memory polymers| journal = Journal of Materials Chemistry| volume = 17| issue = 16| pages = 1543| year = 2007| last1 = Liu | first1 = C.| last2 = Qin | first2 = H.| last3 = Mather | first3 = P.

==Applications==

===Industrial applications===
One of the first conceived industrial applications was in robotics  where shape-memory (SM) foams were used to provide initial soft pretension in gripping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brennan, Mairin|title=Suite of shape-memory polymers|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|year=2001|issue=6|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/topstory/7906/7906notw1.html|volume=79|page=5|doi=10.1021/cen-v079n006.p005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These SM foams could be subsequently hardened by cooling making a shape adaptive grip. Since this time the materials have seen widespread usage in e.g. the building industry (foam which expands with warmth to seal window frames), sports wear (helmets, judo and karate suits) and in some cases with thermochromic additives for ease of thermal profile observation.&lt;ref&gt;Monkman. G.J. and Taylor, P.M. (June 1991) "Memory Foams for Robot Grippers  Robots in Unstructured Environments", pp. 339–342 in  ''Proc. 5th Intl. Conf. on Advanced Robotics'', Pisa.&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane SMPs are also applied as an autochoke element for engines.&lt;ref name="tobushi"/&gt;

===Application in photonics===
One fascinating field in which SMPs are impacting quite significantly nowadays is photonics. Due to the shape changing capability, SMPs enable the production of functional and responsive photonic gratings.&lt;ref name="espinha14"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adom.201300532| title = Thermoresponsive shape-memory photonic nanostructures | journal = Advanced Optical Materials| volume = 2| issue = 6| pages = 516| year = 2014| last1 = Espinha | first1 = A. | last2 = Serrano | first2 = M. C. | last3 = Blanco | first3 = A. | last4 = López | first4 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by using modern soft lithography techniques such as replica molding, it is possible to imprint periodic nanostructures, with sizes of the order of magnitude of visible light, onto the surface of shape memory polymeric blocks. As a result of the refractive index periodicity, these systems diffract light. By taking advantage of the polymer’s shape memory effect, it is possible to reprogram the lattice parameter of the structure and consequently tune its diffractive behavior.
Another application example of SMPs in photonics is in shape changing random lasers.&lt;ref name="espinha15"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adom.201500128| title = Random lasing in novel dye-doped white paints with shape memory | journal = Advanced Optical Materials| volume = 3| issue = 8| pages = 1080| year = 2015| last1 = Espinha | first1 = A. | last2 = Serrano | first2 = M. C. | last3 = Blanco | first3 = A. | last4 = López | first4 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; By doping SMPs with highly scattering particles such as titania ones it is possible to tune the light transport properties of the composite. Additionally, optical gain may be introduced by adding a molecular dye to the material. By configuring both the amount of scatters and of the organic dye, a light amplification regime may be observed when the composites are optically pumped. Shape memory polymers have been also been used in conjunction with [[Nanocellulose]] to fabricate composites exhibiting both chiroptical properties and thermo-activated shape memory effect. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Espinha|first1=André|last2=Guidetti|first2=Giulia|last3=Serrano|first3=María C|last4=Frka-Petesic|first4=Bruno|last5=Dumanli|first5=Ahu Gümrah|last6=Hamad|first6=Wadood Y|last7=Blanco|first7=Álvaro|last8=López|first8=Cefe|last9=Vignolini|first9=Silvia|title=Shape memory cellulose-based photonic reflectors|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|date=8 November 2016|volume=8|issue=46|pages=31935–31940|doi=10.1021/acsami.6b10611|pmid=27786436|pmc=5495156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical applications===
Most medical applications of SMP have yet to be developed, but devices with SMP are now beginning to hit the market. Recently, this technology has expanded to applications in [[orthopedic surgery]].&lt;ref name="Anonymous"/&gt;
Additionally, SMPs are now being used in various ophthalmic devices including punctal plugs, glaucoma shunts and introacular lenses.

===Potential medical applications===
SMPs are [[smart material]]s with potential applications as, e.g., intravenous cannula,&lt;ref name="tobushi"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/015009| pmid = 27877946| title = Shape recovery and irrecoverable strain control in polyurethane shape-memory polymer|pmc=5099815| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 9| issue = 1| pages = 015009| year = 2008| last1 = Tobushi | first1 = H. | last2 = Hayashi | first2 = S. | last3 = Hoshio | first3 = K. | last4 = Ejiri | first4 = Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-adjusting orthodontic wires and selectively pliable tools for small scale surgical procedures where currently metal-based shape-memory alloys such as Nitinol are widely used. Another application of SMP in the medical field could be its use in implants: for example minimally invasive, through small incisions or natural orifices, implantation of a device in its small temporary shape. Shape-memory technologies have shown great promise for cardiovascular stents, since they allow a small stent to be inserted along a vein or artery and then expanded to prop it open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.01.030|pmid=17296222|pmc=2700024| title = Unconstrained recovery characterization of shape-memory polymer networks for cardiovascular applications| journal = Biomaterials| volume = 28| issue = 14| pages = 2255–63| year = 2007| last1 = Yakacki | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Shandas | first2 = R. | last3 = Lanning | first3 = C. | last4 = Rech | first4 = B. | last5 = Eckstein | first5 = A. | last6 = Gall | first6 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; After activating the shape memory by temperature increase or mechanical stress, it would assume its permanent shape. Certain classes of shape-memory polymers possess an additional property: [[biodegradability]]. This offers the option to develop temporary implants. In the case of biodegradable polymers, after the implant has fulfilled its intended use, e.g. healing/tissue regeneration has occurred, the material degrades into substances which can be eliminated by the body. Thus full functionality would be restored without the necessity for a second surgery to remove the implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=B. Q. Y.|last2=Low|first2=Z. W. K.|last3=Heng|first3=S. J. W.|last4=Chan|first4=S. Y.|last5=Owh|first5=C.|last6=Loh|first6=X.

When used in surgical sutures, the shape-memory property of SMPs enables wound closure with self-adjusting optimal tension, which avoids tissue damage due to overtightened sutures and does support healing and regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lendlein, A., Langer, R.|title= Biodegradable, Elastic Shape Memory Polymers for Potential Biomedical Applications|journal=Science|volume= 296|pages=1673–1675|year=2002|doi=10.1126/science.1066102|pmid=11976407|issue=5573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential industrial applications===
Further potential applications include self-repairing structural components, such as e.g. automobile fenders in which dents are repaired by application of temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Monkman. G.J. |doi=10.1016/S0957-4158(99)00068-9|title= Advances in Shape Memory Polymer Actuation |journal= Mechatronics |volume= 10|issue= 4/5|pages= 489–498 |date= June–August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an undesired deformation, such as a dent in the fender, these materials "remember" their original shape. Heating them activates their "memory." In the example of the dent, the fender could be repaired with a heat source, such as a hair-dryer. The impact results in a temporary form, which changes back to the original form upon heating—in effect, the plastic repairs itself. SMPs may also be useful in the production of aircraft which would morph during flight. Currently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [[DARPA]] is testing wings which would change shape by 150%.&lt;ref name=toen&gt;Toensmeier, P.A. (2 April 2009) [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-130130851.html "Shape memory polymers reshape product design"], Plastics Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

The realization of a better control over the switching behavior of polymers is seen as key factor to implement new technical concepts. For instance, an accurate setting of the onset temperature of shape recovering can be exploited to tune the release temperature of information stored in a shape memory polymer. This may pave the way for the monitoring of temperature abuses of food or pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fritzsche, N., Pretsch, T. |title= Programming of Temperature-Memory Onsets in a Semicrystalline Polyurethane Elastomer|journal=Macromolecules|volume= 47|pages=5952–5959|year=2014|doi=10.1021/ma501171p|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a new manufacturing process, Mnemosynation, was developed at [[Georgia Tech]] to enable mass production of crosslinked SMP devices, which would otherwise be cost-prohibitive using traditional thermoset polymerization techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.polymer.2010.05.049| title = Radiation crosslinked shape-memory polymers| journal = Polymer| volume = 51| issue = 15| pages = 3551| year = 2010| last1 = Voit | first1 = W. | last2 = Ware | first2 = T. | last3 = Gall | first3 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mnemosynation was named for the Greek goddess of memory, [[Mnemosyne]] and is the controlled imparting of memory on an amorphous thermoplastic materials utilizing radiation-induced covalent crosslinking, much like [[Vulcanization]] imparts recoverable elastomeric behavior on rubbers using sulfur crosslinks. Mnemosynation combines advances in [[ionizing radiation]] and tuning the mechanical properties of SMPs to enable traditional plastics processing ([[extrusion]], [[blow molding]], [[injection molding]], [[resin transfer molding]], etc.) and allows thermoset SMPs in complex geometries. The customizable mechanical properties of traditional SMPs are achievable with high throughput plastics processing techniques to enable mass producible plastic products with thermosetting shape-memory properties: low residual strains, tunable recoverable force and adjustable glass transition temperatures.

The '''skeptical movement''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|British spelling]]: '''sceptical movement''') is a modern [[social movement]] based on the idea of '''scientific skepticism''' (also called '''rational skepticism'''). Scientific [[skepticism]] involves the application of skeptical [[philosophy]], [[critical thinking | critical-thinking]] skills, and [[knowledge]] of [[science]] and its [[scientific method| methods]] to [[empirical evidence| empirical]] claims, while remaining [[agnosticism |agnostic]] or neutral to non-empirical claims (except those that directly impact the practice of science).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/scientific-skepticism-rationalism-and-secularism/|title= Scientific Skepticism, Rationalism, and Secularism - NeuroLogica Blog|author= |date= |website= theness.com|accessdate= 7 May 2018|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170910232249/http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/scientific-skepticism-rationalism-and-secularism/|archivedate= 10 September 2017|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has the goal of investigating claims made on [[fringe science |fringe topics]] and determining whether they are supported by [[empirical research]] and are [[reproducibility|reproducible]], as part of a methodological norm pursuing "the extension of certified knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Stemwedel|first= Janet D.|title= Basic concepts: the norms of science|date= 2008-01-29|url= http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/01/29/basic-concepts-the-norms-of-sc|work= ScienceBlogs: Adventures in Ethics and Science|publisher= [[ScienceBlogs]]|format= blog|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231940/http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/01/29/basic-concepts-the-norms-of-sc/|archivedate= 2013-05-12|df= }}: quoting [[Robert K. Merton |Merton, R.

Roots of the movement date at least from the 19th century, when people started publicly raising questions regarding the unquestioned acceptance of claims about [[spiritism]], of various widely-held [[superstition]]s, and of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;
Asbjørn Dyrendal: "Oh no it isn't!" Skeptics and the Rhetorical Use of Science in Religion. in Olav Hammer &amp; James R. Lewis (red.) ''Handbook of'' ''Religion and the Authority of Science''. pp. 879–900. Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers 2010, Dyrendal refers to spiritualists as early targets of skeptics based on Hammer 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Loxton, 2013, pp. 10ff.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Publications such as those of the Dutch [[Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij]] (1881) also targeted [[medical quackery]].

Using as a template the Belgian organization founded in 1949, [[Comité Para]], Americans [[Paul Kurtz]] and [[Marcello Truzzi]] founded the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry| Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)]], in [[Amherst, New York]] in 1976. Now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), this organization has inspired others to form similar groups worldwide.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

== Scientific skepticism ==
'''Scientific skepticism''' or '''rational skepticism''' (also spelled '''scepticism'''), sometimes referred to as '''skeptical inquiry''', is a practical, [[epistemology|epistemological]] position in which one questions the veracity of claims lacking [[empirical evidence]]. In practice, the term is most commonly applied to the examination of claims and theories that appear to be [[Pseudoscience|beyond mainstream science]], rather than to the routine discussions and challenges among scientists. Scientific skepticism is different from [[philosophical skepticism]], which questions humans' ability to claim any knowledge about the nature of the world and how they perceive it. [[Cartesian doubt|Methodological skepticism]], a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, is similar but distinct. The ''New Skepticism'' described by [[Paul Kurtz]] is scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurtz | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Kurtz | title = The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge | publisher = [[Prometheus Books|Prometheus]] | year = 1992 | location = | page = 371 | url =| isbn = 0-87975-766-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Robert K. Merton]] asserts that all ideas must be tested and are subject to rigorous, structured community scrutiny (as described in [[Mertonian norms]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Normative Structure of Science|last=Merton|first=R. K.|year=1942}} in {{cite book|title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations|last=Merton|first=Robert King | authorlink=Robert K. Merton|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1973|isbn=978-0-226-52091-9|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference to classical skepticism, according to religious history professor [[Olav Hammer]], is that it is not directly aligned with classical [[pyrrhonian scepticism]], which would question all sort of orthodox wisdom, as well as the one established by modern science. According to Hammer, "the intellectual forebears of the modern skeptical movement are rather to be found among the many writers throughout history who have argued against beliefs they did not share."&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

The following are quotations related to scientific skepticism:

{{quote|text=Briefly stated, a skeptic is one who is willing to question any claim to truth, asking for clarity in definition, consistency in logic, and adequacy of evidence. The use of skepticism is thus an essential part of objective scientific inquiry and the search for reliable knowledge.|author=[[Paul Kurtz]] in ''[[The New Skepticism]]'', 1992, p. 9}}

{{quote|text=What skeptical thinking boils down to is the means to construct, and to understand, a reasoned argument and, especially important, to recognize a fallacious or fraudulent argument. The question is not whether we ''like'' the conclusion that emerges out of a train of reasoning, but whether the conclusion ''follows'' from the premises or starting point and whether that premise is true.|author=[[Carl Sagan]] in ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'', 1995, p. 197}}

{{quote|text=Science is [...] a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we’re up for grabs for the next charlatan, political or religious, who comes ambling along.|author=[[Carl Sagan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink1=Carl Sagan|title=Carl Sagan &gt; Quotes &gt; Quotable Quote|url=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/962093-science-is-more-than-a-body-of-knowledge-it-is|website=Goodreads.com|accessdate=30 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830161340/https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/962093-science-is-more-than-a-body-of-knowledge-it-is|archive-date= 30 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote| text=Scientific skepticism (is) the practice or project of studying paranormal and pseudoscientific claims through the lens of science and critical scholarship, and then sharing the results with the public.

{{quote| text=A skeptic is one who prefers beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid to ones that are comforting or convenient, and therefore rigorously and openly applies the methods of science and reason to all empirical claims, especially their own. A skeptic provisionally proportions acceptance of any claim to valid logic and a fair and thorough assessment of available evidence, and studies the pitfalls of human reason and the mechanisms of deception so as to avoid being deceived by others or themselves. Skepticism values method over any particular conclusion.

{{quote| text="Skepticism is a provisional approach to claims. It is the application of reason to any and all ideas—no sacred cows allowed.

{{quote| text=The true meaning of the word ''skepticism'' has nothing to do with doubt, disbelief, or negativity.

With regard to the skeptical social movement, Loxton refers to other movements already promoting "humanism, atheism, rationalism, science education and even critical thinking" before.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Loxton, pp. 29 ff "Modern Skepticism's Unique Mandate"&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the demand for the new movement—a movement of people called "skeptics" — being based on a lack of interest by the scientific community to address paranormal and fringe science claims. In line with [[Kendrick Frazier]], he describes the movement as a surrogate in that area for institutional science. The movement set up a distinct field of study, and provided an organizational structure, while long-standing genre of individual skeptical activities lacked such a community and background.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Skeptical organizations typically tend to have science education and promotion among their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vof.se/about|title=About the Swedish Skeptics Association|website=Vetenskap och Folkbildning|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113025227/http://www.vof.se/about/|archivedate=13 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nycskeptics.org/about|title=About NYC Skeptics|website=NYC Skeptics|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115143504/http://nycskeptics.org/about|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Scientific skeptics maintain that empirical investigation of [[reality]] leads to the [[truth]], and that the [[scientific method]] is best suited to this purpose.&lt;ref name="NeurologicaNovella10Aug2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|title=Rethinking the Skeptical Movement|url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/rethinking-the-skeptical-movement/|website=Neurologica|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412180401/http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/rethinking-the-skeptical-movement/|archivedate=12 April 2016|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific skeptics attempt to evaluate [[hypothesis|claims]] based on verifiability and [[falsifiability]] and discourage accepting claims on [[faith]] or [[anecdotal evidence]]. Skeptics often focus their criticism on claims they consider to be implausible, dubious or clearly contradictory to generally accepted science. Scientific skeptics do not assert that unusual claims should be automatically rejected out of hand on ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' grounds—rather they argue that claims of paranormal or anomalous phenomena should be critically examined and that extraordinary claims would require extraordinary evidence in their favor before they could be accepted as having validity.&lt;ref name="NeurologicaNovella10Aug2015" /&gt; From a scientific point of view, theories are judged on many criteria, such as falsifiability,&lt;ref name="NeurologicaNovella10Aug2015" /&gt; [[Occam's Razor]],&lt;ref name="HowStuffWorksClark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Josh|title=How Occam's Razor Works|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/scientific-experiments/occams-razor3.htm|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729093039/http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/scientific-experiments/occams-razor3.htm|archivedate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan's Canon]]&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morgan, C.L.|year=1903|title=An Introduction to Comparative Psychology|edition=2|publisher=W.

The skeptic spectrum has been characterized as divided into "wet" and "dry" sceptics, primarily based on the level of engagement with those promoting claims that appear to be pseudoscience; the dry skeptics preferring to debunk and ridicule, in order to avoid giving attention and thus credence to the promoters, and the "wet" skeptics, preferring slower and more considered engagement, in order to avoid appearing sloppy and ill-considered and thus similar to the groups all skeptics opposed.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;{{rp|389}}

[[Ronald A. Lindsay|Ron Lindsay]] has argued that while some of the claims appear to be harmless or "soft targets," it is important to continue to address them and the underlying habits of thought that lead to them so that we do not "have a lot more people believing that 9/11 was an inside job, that climate change is a hoax, that our government is controlled by aliens, and so forth -- and those beliefs are far from harmless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=Ronald A. |authorlink1=Ronald A.

The movement has had issues with allegations of sexism. The disparity between women and men in the movement was raised in a 1985 skeptic newsletter by [[Mary Coulman]].&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt;{{rp|112}} The skeptic movement has generally been made up of men; at a 1987 conference the members there discussed the fact that the attendees were predominantly older white men and a 1991 listing of 50 CSICOP fellows included four women.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Science in the New Age: The Paranormal, Its Defenders and Debunkers, and American Culture|last=Hess|first=David J.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=|isbn=9780299138202|location=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109}}  Following a 2011 conference, [[Rebecca Watson]], a prominent skeptic,&lt;ref name=Rinallo2013&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Consumption and Spirituality|last=Rinallo|first=Diego|last2=Scott|first2=Linda M.|last3=Maclaran|first3=Pauline|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415889117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} raised issues of the way female skeptics are targeted with [[Cybercrime#Harassment|online harassment]] including threats of sexual violence by opponents of the movement, and also raised issues of sexism within the movement itself.  While she received some support in response to her discussion of sexism within the movement, she later became a target of virulent online harassment, even from fellow skeptics, after posting an online video that equated a man showing interest in her with misogyny. This became known as "[[Elevatorgate]]", based on Watson's discussion about being propositioned in a hotel elevator in the early morning after a skeptic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Rebecca|title=It Stands to Reason, Skeptics Can Be Sexist Too|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/10/sexism_in_the_skeptic_community_i_spoke_out_then_came_the_rape_threats.html|work=Slate|date=24 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424094011/http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/10/sexism_in_the_skeptic_community_i_spoke_out_then_came_the_rape_threats.html|archivedate=24 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Reading the Comments: Likers, Haters, and Manipulators at the Bottom of the Web|last=Reagle|first=Joseph M.|pages=114–17|date=2015-04-24|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262028936|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mandy De Waal.

== Debunking and rational inquiry ==
{{See also |Debunking}}The term "debunk" is used to describe efforts by skeptics to expose or discredit claims believed to be false, exaggerated, or pretentious. It is closely associated with skeptical investigation or rational inquiry of controversial topics (compare [[list of topics characterized as pseudoscience]]) such as [[Unidentified flying object|U.F.O.s]], claimed [[paranormal]] phenomena, [[cryptid]]s, [[conspiracy theories]], [[alternative medicine]], [[religion]], or exploratory or [[Fringe science|fringe]] areas of scientific or [[pseudoscientific]] research.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Debunker|title=Debunker|accessdate=2007-09-26|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821043533/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/debunker|archivedate=2007-08-21|df=}} "to expose or excoriate (a claim, assertion, sentiment, etc.) as being pretentious, false, or exaggerated: to debunk advertising slogans."&lt;/ref&gt;

Further topics that scientifically skeptical literature questions include health claims surrounding certain foods, procedures, and [[alternative medicine]]s; the plausibility and existence of [[supernatural]] abilities (e.g. [[tarot reading]]) or entities (e.g. [[poltergeists]], [[angels]], [[deity|gods]]—including [[Zeus]]); the monsters of [[cryptozoology]] (e.g. the [[Loch Ness monster]]); as well as [[creationism]]/[[intelligent design]], [[dowsing]], [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and other claims the skeptic sees as unlikely to be true on scientific grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=Dover|year=1957|isbn=0-486-20394-8|authorlink=Martin Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/contents.html|title=Skeptics Dictionary Alphabetical Index Abracadabra to Zombies|last=|first=|authorlink=|year=2007|publisher=skepdic.com|work=|accessdate=2007-05-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528204928/http://skepdic.com/contents.html|archivedate=2007-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics such as [[James Randi]] have become famous for [[debunker|debunking]] claims related to some of these. Paranormal investigator [[Joe Nickell]] cautions, however, that "debunkers" must be careful to engage paranormal claims seriously and without bias. He explains that open minded investigation is more likely to teach and change minds than debunking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nickell|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Skeptical inquiry vs debunking|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/joe_nickell_skeptical_inquiry_vs_debunking/|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324160704/http://www.pointofinquiry.org/joe_nickell_skeptical_inquiry_vs_debunking/|archivedate=2016-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/CSICOPoverview.htm|title=CSICOP and the Skeptics: An Overview|last=Hansen|first=George P.|year=1992|publisher=|work=|accessdate=2010-05-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510120707/http://www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/CSICOPoverview.htm|archivedate=2010-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A striking characteristic of the skeptical movement is the fact that while most of the phenomena covered, such as [[astrology]] and [[homeopathy]], have been debunked again and again, they stay popular.&lt;ref name = Hammer/&gt; Frazier reemphasized in 2018 that "[w]e need independent, evidence-based, science-based critical investigation and inquiry now more than perhaps at any other time in our history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=In Troubled Times, This Is What We Do |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=14-15 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/in_troubled_times_this_is_what_we_do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606235847/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/in_troubled_times_this_is_what_we_do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-06-06 |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The scientific skepticism community has traditionally been focused on what people believe rather than why they believe—there might be psychological, cognitive or instinctive reasons for belief when there is little evidence for such beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_do_people_believe_in_gods|title=Why Do People Believe in Gods?|website=CSICOP|publisher=Center for Inquiry|last1=Bakker|first1=Gary|accessdate=4 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019031943/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_do_people_believe_in_gods|archivedate=19 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hammer, the bulk of the skeptical movement's literature works on an implicit model, that belief in the irrational is being based on scientific illiteracy or cognitive illusions. He points to the skeptical discussion about astrology: The skeptical notion of astrology as a "failed hypothesis" fails to address basic [[anthropological]] assumptions about astrology as a form of ritualized [[divination]]. While the anthropological approach attempts to explain the activities of astrologers and their clients, the skeptical movement's interest in the cultural aspects of such beliefs is muted.&lt;ref name = Hammer&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bm-7DH2bZ8QC&amp;pg=PA395|title=Handbook of New Age|last=Kemp|first=Daren|last2=Lewis|first2=James R.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9004153551|location=|pages=382, 390, 395–96|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sociologist David J. Hess, the skeptical discourse tends to set science and the skeptical project apart from the social and the economic. From this perspective, he argues that skepticism takes on some aspects of a sacred discourse, as in [[Emile Durkheim]]'s ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life|Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''—Science, seen as pure and sacred (motivated by values of the mind and reason), is set apart from popular dealings with the paranormal, seen as profane (permeated by the economic and the social); obscuring the confrontation between science and religion.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8oVwJwSPjLQC&amp;pg=PA63|title=Science in the New Age: The Paranormal, Its Defenders and Debunkers, and American Culture|last=Hess|first=David J.|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=|isbn=9780299138202|location=|pages=63–64|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hess states as well a strong tendency in [[Other (philosophy)|othering]]: both skeptics and their opponents see the other as being driven by materialistic philosophy and material gain and assume themselves to have purer motives.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

=== Perceived dangers of pseudoscience ===
{{see also|Anti-cult movement}}

While not all pseudoscientific beliefs are necessarily dangerous, some can potentially be harmful.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; [[Plato]] believed that to release others from ignorance despite their initial resistance is a great and noble thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allegory of the cave]], Plato ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', (New [[Cambridge University Press|CUP]] translation by Tom Griffith and G.R.F. Ferrari into English) {{ISBN|0-521-48443-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern skeptical writers address this question in a variety of ways. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that some individual actions based on beliefs for which there is no evidence of efficacy, can result in destructive actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell4.htm|title=On the Value of Scepticism|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year=1928|publisher=Positive Atheism|doi=|work=The Will To Doubt|accessdate=2007-05-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222658/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell4.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Amardeo Sarma]] provided some perspective on the state of the [[skeptical movement]] by addressing "the essence of contemporary skepticism and [highlighting] the vital nonpartisan and science-based role of skeptics in preventing deception and harm."

=== Pseudoskepticism ===
{{main article|Pseudoskepticism}}
Richard Cameron Wilson, in an article in ''[[New Statesman]]'', wrote that "the bogus sceptic is, in reality, a disguised dogmatist, made all the more dangerous for his success in appropriating the mantle of the unbiased and open-minded inquirer". Some advocates of discredited intellectual positions (such as [[AIDS denial]], [[Holocaust denial]] and [[climate change denial]]) engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as "skeptics". This is despite their [[cherry picking]] of evidence that conforms to a pre-existing belief.&lt;ref name="Wilson_NS"&gt;{{citation|last=Wilson|first=Richard|title=Against the Evidence|date=2008-09-18|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2008/09/evidence-sceptic-hiv-bogus|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|publisher=Progressive Media International|issn=1364-7431|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016192228/http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2008/09/evidence-sceptic-hiv-bogus|archivedate=2014-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson, who highlights the phenomenon in his 2008 book ''Don't Get Fooled Again'', the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it "centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position".&lt;ref name="Wilson_fooled"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ARNNLgAACAAJ|title=Don't get fooled again: the sceptic's guide to life|last=Wilson|first=Richard C.|publisher=Icon|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84831-014-8|location=|pages=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific skepticism is itself sometimes criticized on this ground. The term ''pseudoskepticism'' has found occasional use in controversial fields where opposition from scientific skeptics is strong. For example, in 1994, [[Susan Blackmore]], a parapsychologist who became more skeptical and eventually became a [[CSICOP|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP) fellow in 1991, described what she termed the "worst kind of pseudoskepticism":

{{quote | There are some members of the skeptics' groups who clearly believe they know the right answer prior to inquiry.

== History ==

=== Historical roots ===
According to skeptic author [[Daniel Loxton]], "skepticism is a story without a beginning or an end." His article ''Why Is There a Skeptical Movement'' claims a history of two millennia of paranormal skepticism.&lt;ref name="Loxton2013"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/Why-Is-There-a-Skeptical-Movement.pdf |title=Why Is There a Skeptical Movement? |author=[[Daniel Loxton]] |publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]] website |page=3 |date=2013 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807152309/http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/Why-Is-There-a-Skeptical-Movement.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of the opinion that the practice, problems, and central concepts extend all the way to antiquity and refers to a debunking tale as told [[Bel and the Dragon#Bel|in some versions of the Old Testament]], where the Prophet Daniel exposes a tale of a "living" statue as a scam.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Loxton, Why Is There a Skeptical Movement? 2013 p. 24, reference 91&lt;/ref&gt; According to Loxton, throughout history, there are further examples of individuals practicing critical inquiry and writing books or performing publicly against particular frauds and popular superstitions, including people like [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] (2nd century), [[Michel de Montaigne]] (16th century), [[Thomas Ady]] and [[Thomas Browne]] (17th century), [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (18th century), many different philosophers, scientists and magicians throughout the 19th and early 20th century up until and after [[Harry Houdini]]. However, skeptics banding together in societies that research the paranormal and fringe science is a modern phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Loxton2013"/&gt;

[[Daniel Loxton]] mentions the Belgian [[Comité Para]] (1949) as the oldest "broad mandate" skeptical organization.&lt;ref name="Loxton2013" /&gt; Although it was preceded by the Dutch [[Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij]] (VtdK) (1881), which is therefore considered the oldest skeptical organization by others,&lt;ref name="Quackometer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/08/dutch-sceptics-have-bogus-libel.html |title=Dutch Sceptics Have 'Bogus' Libel Decision Overturned On Human Rights Grounds |author=Andy Lewis |publisher=The Quackometer |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213174338/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/08/dutch-sceptics-have-bogus-libel.html |archivedate=13 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Standaard"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/ip1dpjjp |title=Masseuse met kapsones |author= |publisher=[[De Standaard]] |date=21 June 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |language=nl |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114062240/http://www.standaard.be/cnt/ip1dpjjp |archivedate=14 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the VtdK only focuses on fighting quackery, and thus has a 'narrow mandate'. The Comité Para was partly formed as a response to a predatory industry of bogus psychics who were exploiting the grieving relatives of people who had gone missing during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Loxton2013" /&gt; In contrast, [[Michael Shermer]] traces the origins of the modern scientific skeptical movement to [[Martin Gardner]]'s 1952 book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/manifesto/ |title=A Skeptical Manifesto |author=Michael Shermer |authorlink=Michael Shermer |publisher=The Skeptics Society website |date=1997 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626213613/http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/manifesto/ |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the  [[Association française pour l'information scientifique|French Association for Scientific Information]] (AFIS) was founded. AFIS strives to promote science against those who deny its cultural value, abuse it for criminal purposes or as a cover for [[quackery]]. According to AFIS, science itself cannot solve humanity's problems, nor can one solve them without using the [[scientific method]]. It maintains that people should be informed about scientific and technical advancements and the problems it helps to solve. Its magazine, ''Science et pseudo-sciences'', attempts to distribute scientific information in a language that everyone can understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article23 |title=Notre histoire |author=Jean-Pierre Thomas |work=Website AFIS |publisher=AFIS |accessdate=3 April 2015 |language=fr |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706105911/http://www.pseudo-sciences.org/spip.php?article23 |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CSICOP and contemporary skepticism ===
{{main|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}
[[File:Ken-RayPaulRandiKen photo at TAM8.jpg|300px|thumb|Influential North American skeptics: [[Ray Hyman]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[James Randi]] and [[Kendrick Frazier]]]]
In 1976, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), known as the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) since November 2006, was founded in the [[United States]]. Some see this as the "birth of modern skepticism",&lt;ref&gt;Loxton (2013), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; however, founder [[Paul Kurtz]] actually modeled it after the Comité Para, including its name.&lt;ref name="Loxton2013"/&gt; Kurtz' motive was being "dismayed ... by the rising tide of belief in the paranormal and the lack of adequate scientific examinations of these claims."&lt;ref&gt;Loxton (2013), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurtz was an atheist and had also founded the [[Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion]]. While he saw both aspects as being covered in the skeptical movement, he had recommended CSICOP to focus on paranormal and pseudoscientific claims and to leave religious aspects to others.&lt;ref name="NisbetKurtsStrategicError"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Paul Kurtz on the "Strategic Blunder" of the New Atheists |url=https://bigthink.com/age-of-engagement/paul-kurtz-on-the-strategic-blunder-of-the-new-atheists |website=www.bigthink.com |accessdate=12 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319051059/http://bigthink.com/age-of-engagement/paul-kurtz-on-the-strategic-blunder-of-the-new-atheists |archivedate=2018-03-19 |date=16 August 2010 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being the oldest, CSICOP was "the first successful, broad-mandate North American skeptical organization of the contemporary period",&lt;ref&gt;Loxton (2013), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; popularized the usage of the terms "skeptic", "skeptical" and "skepticism" by its magazine, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'',&lt;ref name="Wonder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boel |first=Herman |date=2003 |title=Wat is het verschil tussen Skepticisme en Scepticisme? |url=http://nederlands.skepdic.com/skepticus.htm |journal=Wonder en is gheen wonder |publisher=[[SKEPP]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages= |doi= |accessdate=24 May 2014 |language=nl |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517153013/http://nederlands.skepdic.com/skepticus.htm |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and directly inspired the foundation of many other skeptical organizations throughout the world, especially in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frazier |first=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier |date=1996 |title=The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal |url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csicop/ |location=[[Amherst, New York]] |publisher= |pages=168–80 |isbn= |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615171346/http://www.csicop.org/about/csicop/ |archivedate=15 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These included [[Australian Skeptics]] (1980), [[Föreningen Vetenskap och Folkbildning|Vetenskap och Folkbildning]] (Sweden, 1982), [[New Zealand Skeptics]] (1986), [[Gesellschaft zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften|GWUP]] (Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 1987), [[Skepsis (organization)|Skepsis r.y.]] (Finland, 1987), [[Stichting Skepsis]] (Netherlands, 1987), [[CICAP]] (Italy, 1989) and [[SKEPP]] (Dutch-speaking Belgium, 1990).

Besides scientists such as [[astronomers]], stage magicians like [[James Randi]] were important in investigating charlatans and exposing their trickery. In 1996 Randi formed the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] (JREF) and created the [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]], where anyone who could demonstrate paranormal abilities, under mutually agreed-upon controlled circumstances, could claim the prize. After Randi's retirement in 2015, the Paranormal Challenge was officially terminated by the JREF with the prize unclaimed:{{Quote|text=Effective 9/1/2015 the JREF has made major changes including converting to a grant making foundation and no longer accepting applications for the Million Dollar Prize from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JREF Status, 9-1-2015|url=http://web.randi.org/home/jref-status|website=Web.randi.org|publisher=JREF|accessdate=30 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152145/http://web.randi.org/home/jref-status|archive-date = 30 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other influential second-generation American organizations were [[The Skeptics Society]] (founded in 1992 by [[Michael Shermer]]), the [[New England Skeptical Society]] (originating in 1996) and the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (formed in 2000 by [[James Underdown]]).

=== After 1989 ===
After the [[Revolutions of 1989]], Eastern Europe saw a surge in quackery and paranormal beliefs that were no longer restrained by the generally secular Communist regimes or the Iron curtain and its information barriers. The foundation of many new skeptical organizations was as well intending to [[consumer protection|protect consumers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahner |first=Martin |date=January–February 2002 |title=10th European Skeptics Congress: Rise and Development of Paranormal Beliefs in Eastern Europe |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/10th_european_skeptics_congress_rise_and_development_of_paranormal_beliefs_ |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages= |doi= |accessdate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010034/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/10th_european_skeptics_congress_rise_and_development_of_paranormal_beliefs_ |archivedate=28 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the [[Czech Skeptics' Club Sisyfos]] (1995),&lt;ref name="Sisyfos"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sysifos.cz/index.php?id=vypis&amp;sec=1148731628&amp;lang=en |title=Czech Skeptical Club SISYFOS |publisher=Sisyfos website |date=27 May 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625110707/http://sysifos.cz/index.php?id=vypis&amp;sec=1148731628&amp;lang=en |archivedate=25 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hungarian Skeptic Society]] (2006), the [[Polish Sceptics Club]] (2010)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_inception_of_the_polish_sceptics_club |title=The Inception of the Polish Sceptics Club |author=Tomasz Witkowski &amp; Maciej Zatonski |publisher=CSI website |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010248/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_inception_of_the_polish_sceptics_club |archivedate=28 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian-speaking [[Skeptic Society]] (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-333-8mar2015 |title=Episode 338 |author=Richard Saunders |work=The Skeptic Zone |publisher=Skepticzone.tv |accessdate=1 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004174846/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-333-8mar2015 |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian Skeptical Society in Vienna (founded in 2002) deals with issues such as [[John Grander|Johann Grander's "vitalized water"]] and the use of [[dowsing]] at the Austrian Parliament''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2012/19/A-Skeptiker|title=Skeptikerbewegung: Die Apokalypse in den Köpfen|last=Müller|first=Stefan|date=2012-05-03|newspaper=Die Zeit|issn=0044-2070|access-date=2016-09-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107173701/http://www.zeit.de/2012/19/A-Skeptiker|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, as a form of skeptical outreach to the general population, [[Susan Gerbic]] launched the [[Susan Gerbic#GSoW|Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia]] (GSoW) project to improve skeptical content on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|title=Wikapediatrician Susan Gerbic discusses her Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia project|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/wikapediatrician_susan_gerbic_discusses_her_guerrilla_skepticism_on_wikiped|work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|date=March 8, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830023844/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/wikapediatrician_susan_gerbic_discusses_her_guerrilla_skepticism_on_wikiped|archivedate=August 30, 2015 |deadurl=no|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Gerbic (who was made a [[fellow]] of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] in 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cause_effect_99/|title=Center for Inquiry News: Cause &amp; Effect: The CFI Newsletter - No. 99|website=www.centerforinquiry.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208134003/http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cause_effect_99/|archivedate=8 February 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her GSoW team received an award from the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] which "is given to the person or organization that best represents the spirit of the foundation by encouraging critical questions and seeking unbiased, fact-based answers.

In July 2018, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' reported that the GSoW team had grown to more than 120 volunteer editors from around the world, and they were collectively responsible for creating or improving some of Wikipedia's most heavily trafficked articles on skeptical topics.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

Forsythe and MacAllen first conceived softwall as a method for repurposing architectural shells to provide shelter for the homeless. The concept grew into a modular system of space partitions that could quickly and easily transform space to suit diverse uses, whether in small live/work studios or large scale environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10x10: 100 Architects, 10 Critics|date=2005|publisher=Phaidon Press Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-714-83922-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

softwall reflects molo’s interest in sustainable building methods and flexible living. Both the paper and polyethylene textile used for the soft collection are 100% recyclable.

{{Sound change}}
{{IPA notice}} '''Sound change''' includes any processes of [[language change]] that affect pronunciation (phonetic change) or sound system structures ([[phonological change]]). Sound change can consist of the replacement of one [[phoneme|speech sound]] (or, more generally, one [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] value) by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''environmentally conditioned'', meaning that the change only occurs in a defined [[Phonetic environment|sound environment]], whereas in other environments the same speech sound is not affected by the change. The term "sound change" refers to [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] changes—that is, irreversible changes in a language's sound system over time; "[[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]", on the other hand, refers to changes that happen [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]]ally (i.e. within the language of an individual speaker, depending on the neighboring sounds) and which do not change the language's [[underlying representation|underlying system]] (for example, the ''-s'' in the [[English plural]] can be pronounced differently depending on what sound it follows, as in ''bet''[s], ''bed''[z]; this is a form of alternation, rather than sound change). However, since "sound change" can refer to the historical introduction of an alternation (such as post-vocalic /k/ in [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]—once [k] as in ''di'' [k]''arlo'' 'of Carlo', but now [h] ''di'' [h]''arlo'', alternating with [k] in other positions: ''con'' [k]''arlo'' 'with Carlo')—the label is inherently imprecise and often must be clarified as referring to phonemic change or restructuring.

Research on sound change is usually conducted on the [[Heuristic|working assumption]] that it is ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors (such as the meaning of the words affected). However, apparent exceptions to regular change can occur—due to dialect borrowing, grammatical analogy, or other causes known and unknown—and some changes are described as "sporadic", meaning that they affect only one particular word or a few words, without any apparent regularity.

The [[Neogrammarian]] linguists of the 19th century introduced the term "sound law" to refer to rules of regular change, perhaps in imitation of the laws of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Sihler, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "law" is still used in referring to specific sound rules named after their authors, such as [[Grimm's Law]], [[Grassmann's Law]], [[:Category:Sound laws|etc.]]. Real-world sound changes often admit exceptions; nevertheless, the expectation of their regularity or absence of exceptions is of great [[heuristic]] value, since it allows historical linguists to define the notion of ''regular correspondence'' (see: [[comparative method]]).

Each sound change is limited in space and time. This means it functions within a limited area (within certain [[dialect]]s) and during a limited period of time. For these (and other) reasons, the term "sound law" has been criticized for implying a universality that is unrealistic with regard to sound change.&lt;ref&gt;For example by "[t]he French phoneticians and the Fino-Ugric linguists", according to Anttila, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound change that affects the phonological system, in the number or distribution of its [[phoneme]]s, is covered more fully at [[phonological change]].

==Formal notation==
{{see also|Phonological rule}}

A statement of the form

::A &gt; B

is to be read, "sound A changes into (or is replaced by, is reflected as, etc) sound B". Therefore, A belongs to an older stage of the language in question, whereas B belongs to a more recent stage. The symbol "&gt;" can be reversed, B &lt; A, still meaning that the (more recent) B derives from the (older) A".

For example,

::POc. *t &gt; Rot. f

:means that "Proto-[[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] (''POc.'') *t is reflected as the [[Voiceless labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|[f]}} in the [[Rotuman language]] (''Rot.'')."

The two sides of such a statement indicate start and end points only, and do not imply that there are no additional intermediate stages. The example above is actually a compressed account of a ''sequence'' of changes; *t changed first into a [[Voiceless dental fricative#Voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative|voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|[θ]}} (like the initial consonant of English ''thin''), which has yielded present-day [f]. This can be represented more fully as:

:: t &gt; {{IPA|θ}} &gt; f

Unless a change operates unconditionally (in all environments), the context in which it applies must be specified:

::A &gt; B /X__Y

:= "A changes to B when preceded by X and followed by Y."

For example:

::It. b &gt; v /[vowel]__[vowel], which can be simplified to just
::It. b &gt; v /V__V (where the capital V stands for any given vowel)

:= "Intervocalic [b] (inherited from Latin) became [v] in Italian" (e.g. in ''caballum, dēbet'' &gt; ''cavallo'' 'horse', ''deve'' 'owe (3sg.)'

A second example:

::PIr. [&amp;minus;cont][&amp;minus;voi] &gt; [+cont]/__[C][+cont]

:= "Preconsonantal voiceless non-continuants (i.e. voiceless stops) changed into corresponding voiceless continuants ([[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]) in Proto-[[Iranian languages|Iranian]] (''PIr'')" when immediately followed by a continuant consonant (i.e. resonants and fricatives). Examples: Proto-Indo-Iranian *''pra'' 'forth' &gt; Avestan ''fra''; *''trayas'' "three" (masc.nom.pl.)&gt; Av. ''θrayō''; *''čatwāras'' "four" (masc.nom.pl.) &gt; Av. ''čaθwārō''; *''pśaws'' "of a cow" (nom. *''paśu'') &gt; Av. ''fšāoš'' (nom. ''pasu''). Note that the fricativization does not occur before stops, so *''sapta'' "seven" &gt; Av. ''hapta''. (However, in the variety of Iranian that led to [[Old Persian]], fricativization occurs in all clusters, thus Old Persian ''hafta'' "seven".)

The symbol "#" stands for a word boundary (initial or final). Thus the notation "/__#" means "word-finally", and "/#__" means "word-initially". For example:

::Gk. [stop] &gt; ∅ /__#

:= "Word-final stops were deleted in Greek (''Gk.'')."

This can be simplified to

::Gk. P &gt; ∅ / __#

where capital P stands for any plosive.

==Principles==

The following statements are used as heuristics in formulating sound changes as understood within the [[Neogrammarian]] model. However, for modern linguistics, they are not taken as inviolable rules; rather, they are seen as guidelines.

'''Sound change has no memory''': Sound change does not discriminate between the sources of a sound. If a previous sound change causes X,Y &gt; Y (features X and Y merge as Y), a new one cannot affect only an original X.

'''Sound change ignores grammar''': A sound change can only have phonological constraints, like X &gt; Z in [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed syllables]]. For example, it cannot only affect [[adjective]]s. The only exception to this is that a sound change may or may not recognise word boundaries, even when they are not indicated by [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] clues. Also, sound changes may be [[regularization (linguistics)|regularized]] in inflectional paradigms (such as verbal inflection), in which case the change is no longer [[phonology|phonological]] but [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;See Hill, Nathan W. (2014) '[http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/18595/ Grammatically conditioned sound change].' ''Language and Linguistics Compass,'' 8 (6). pp. 211-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound change is exceptionless''': if a sound change can happen at a place, it will. It affects all sounds that meet the criteria for change. Apparent exceptions are possible, due to [[analogy]] and other regularization processes, or another sound change, or an unrecognized conditioning factor. This is the traditional view, expressed by the [[Neogrammarian]]s. In past decades it has been shown that sound change does not necessarily affect all the words that in principle it could. However, when a sound change is initiated, it often expands to the whole [[lexicon]] given enough time, though not always. For example, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] the fronting of the [[Vulgar Latin]] [g] ([[voiced velar stop]]) before [i e ɛ] seems to have reached every possible word it could. By contrast, the voicing of word-initial Latin [k] to [g] occurred in ''colaphus'' &gt; ''golpe'' and ''cattus'' &gt; ''gato'', but not in ''canna'' &gt; ''caña''. See also [[lexical diffusion]].

'''Sound change is unstoppable''': ''All'' languages vary from place to place and time to time, and neither writing nor media prevent this change.

==Terms for changes in pronunciation==

In [[historical linguistics]], a number of traditional terms designate types of phonetic change, either by nature or result. A number of such types are often (or usually) sporadic, that is, more or less accidents that happen to a specific form. Others affect a whole phonological system. Sound changes that affect a whole phonological system are also classified according to how they affect the overall shape of the system; see ''[[phonological change]]''.

* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Assimilation]]: One sound becomes more like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become more like each other. Example: in Latin the prefix *''kom''- becomes ''con''- before an [[Apical consonant|apical stop]] ({{IPA|[t d]}}) or {{IPA|[n]}}: ''contactus'' "touched", ''condere'' "to found, establish", ''connūbium'' "legal marriage". The great majority of assimilations take place between contiguous segments,{{Citation needed|date= September 2012}} and the great majority involve the earlier sound becoming more like the later one (e.g. in ''connūbium,'' ''m- + n'' becomes ''-nn-'' rather than ''-mm-''). Assimilation between contiguous segments are ([[diachronics|diachronically]] speaking) exceptionless sound laws rather than sporadic, isolated changes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* [[Dissimilation]]: The opposite of assimilation. One sound becomes less like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become less like each other. Examples: Latin ''quīnque'' {{IPA|/kʷiːnkʷe/}} "five" &gt; Proto-Romance *''kinkʷe'' (whence French ''cinq'', Italian ''cinque'', etc.); [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''omne'' "man" &gt; Spanish ''hombre''. The great majority of dissimilations involve segments that are '''not''' contiguous, but, as with assimilations, the great majority involve an earlier sound changing with reference to a later one. Dissimilation is usually a sporadic phenomenon, but [[Grassmann's Law]] (in Sanskrit and Greek) exemplifies a systematic dissimilation. If the change of a sequence of fricatives such that one becomes a stop is dissimilation, then such changes as [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *χs to {{IPA|/ks/}} (spelled ''x'') in English would count as a regular sound law: PGmc. *''seχs'' "six" &gt; [[Old English]] ''siex'', etc.
* [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]]: Two sounds switch places. Example: Old English ''th'''ri'''dda'' became Middle English ''th'''ir'''d''. Most such changes are sporadic, but occasionally a sound law is involved, as Romance *''tl'' &gt; Spanish ''ld'', thus *''kapitlu, *titlu'' "chapter (of a cathedral)", "[[tittle]]" &gt; Spanish ''cabildo, tilde''. Metathesis can take place between non-contiguous segments, as Greek ''amélgō'' "I milk" &gt; Modern Greek ''armégō.''
* [[Lenition]], softening of a consonant, e.g. [[stop consonant]] to [[affricate]] or [[fricative]]; and its [[antonym]] [[fortition]], hardening of a consonant.
* [[Tone (linguistics)#Origin|Tonogenesis]]: Syllables come to have distinctive [[pitch contour]]s.
* [[Sandhi]]: conditioned changes that take place at word-boundaries but not elsewhere. It can be [[morpheme]]-specific, as in the loss of the vowel in the enclitic forms of English ''is'' {{IPA|/ɪz/}}, with subsequent change of {{IPA|/z/}} to {{IPA|/s/}} adjacent to a voiceless consonant ''Frank's not here'' {{IPA|/ˈfræŋksnɒtˈhɪər/}}. Or a small class of elements, such as the assimilation of the {{IPA|/ð/}} of English ''the, this'' and ''that'' to a preceding {{IPA|/n/}} (including the {{IPA|/n/}} of ''and'' when the {{IPA|/d/}} is elided) or {{IPA|/l/}}: ''all the'' often {{IPA|/ɔːllə/}}, ''in the'' often {{IPA|/ɪnnə/}}, and so on. As in these examples, such features are rarely indicated in standard orthography. In a striking exception, Sanskrit orthography reflects a wide variety of such features; thus, ''tat'' "that" is written ''tat'','' tac'','' taj'','' tad'','' ''or ''tan'' depending on what the first sound of the next word is. These are all assimilations, but medial sequences do not assimilate the same way.
* [[Haplology]]: The loss of a syllable when  an adjacent syllable is similar or (rarely) identical. Example: Old English ''Englaland'' became Modern English ''England'', or the common pronunciation of ''probably'' as {{IPA|[ˈprɒbli]}}. This change usually affects commonly used words. The word haplology itself is sometimes jokingly pronounced "haplogy".
* [[Elision]], [[Apheresis (linguistics)|aphaeresis]], [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], and [[apocope]]: all losses of sounds. Elision is the loss of unstressed sounds, aphaeresis the loss of initial sounds, syncope is the loss of medial sounds, and apocope is the loss of final sounds.
** Elision examples: in the southeastern United States, unstressed schwas tend to drop, so "American" is not {{IPA|/əˈmɛɹəkən/}} but {{IPA|/ˈmɚkən/}}. Standard English is ''possum'' &lt; ''opossum''.
** Syncope examples: the Old French word for "state" is ''estat'', but the ''s'' disappeared, yielding ''état''. Similarly, the loss of {{IPA|/t/}} in English ''soften, hasten, castle'', etc.
** Apocope examples: the final -''e'' {{IPA|[ə]}} in Middle English words was pronounced, but is only retained in spelling as a [[silent E]]. In English {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} were apocopated in final position after nasals: ''lamb, long'' {{IPA|/læm/, /lɒŋ ~ lɔːŋ/}}.
* [[Epenthesis]] (also known as anaptyxis): The introduction of a sound between two adjacent sounds. Examples: Latin ''humilis'' &gt; English ''humble''; in Slavic an -l- intrudes between a labial and a following yod, as *''zemya'' "land" &gt; Russian ''zemlya'' (земля). Most commonly, epenthesis is in the nature of a "transitional" consonant, but vowels may be epenthetic: non-standard English ''film'' in two syllables, ''athlete'' in three. Epenthesis can be regular, as when the Indo-European "tool" suffix *-''tlom'' everywhere becomes Latin -''culum'' (so ''speculum'' "mirror" &lt; *''speḱtlom'', ''pōculum'' "drinking cup" &lt; *''poH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-tlom''). Some scholars reserve the term ''epenthesis'' for "intrusive" vowels and use ''excrescence'' for intrusive consonants.
* [[Prothesis (linguistics)|Prothesis]]: The addition of a sound at the beginning of a word. Example: word-initial {{IPA|/s/}} + stop clusters in Latin gained a preceding {{IPA|/e/}} in Old Spanish and Old French; hence, the Spanish word for "state" is ''estado'', deriving from Latin ''status''.
* [[Nasalization]]: Vowels followed by nasal consonants can become nasalized. If the nasal consonant is lost but the vowel retains its nasalized pronunciation, nasalization becomes [[phoneme|phonemic]], that is, distinctive. Example: French "-in" words used to be pronounced {{IPA|[in]}}, but are now pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ̃]}}, and the {{IPA|[n]}} is no longer pronounced (except in cases of [[liaison (French)|liaison]]).

"'''Star Trekkin''''" is a 1987 song by British band [[The Firm (novelty band)|The Firm]].  It parodies the first television series of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and prominently features comical voice caricatures of the original ''Trek'' characters, provided by members of the band, a studio technician, and the wife of one of the songwriters. One of song's phrases, "It's life, Jim, but not as we know it", originated with "Star Trekkin'", but has been subsequently misattributed to the TV series.

The song's promotional video was created by a team of art students called The Film Garage, featuring a combination of puppetry, [[stop motion]] animation and [[computer-generated imagery]].

The song entered the UK charts at number 74, eventually climbing to spend two weeks at number 1. It also found chart success in a number of other countries, selling more than a million copies.

==Origin and recording==
"Star Trekkin{{'"}} originated from songwriter Rory Kehoe's experiences with an [[English Civil War]] [[combat reenactment]] society called [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]]. Kehoe had written a series of five lines about the 1960s American science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', which were sung around campfires, after Sealed Knot battles, to the tune of "[[The Music Man (song)|The Music Man]]". This version was re-titled "I Am The Star Trek Man". Chris Steinhauer performed this version at a folk club one evening in 1986, which is where it was first heard by Grahame Lister, of novelty band [[The Firm (novelty band)|The Firm]]. Lister convinced Steinhauer to record the song onto an [[audio cassette]] and took it to his writing partner John O'Connor.&lt;ref name="kutner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kutner|first=Jon|title=Star Trekkin’ (The Firm) 
|url=http://www.jonkutner.com/star-trekkin/|publisher=JonKutner.com|accessdate=29 July 2016|date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo dropped "The Music Man" melody, and wrote a new chorus.&lt;ref name="kutner"/&gt; They at first attempted to set Kehoe's lyrics to the tune of their 1982 hit single, "Arthur Daley (e's Alright)", creating an alternative version initially entitled "Captain Kirk (He's Alright)". Unsatisfied, they sought to create something original, locking themselves away for a week to write "Star Trekkin'",&lt;ref name="lookin"/&gt; based on an increasing tempo seen previously in [[Rolf Harris]]' "[[The Court of King Caractacus]]".&lt;ref name="kutner"/&gt; They sought to have it recorded professionally, but were received unfavourably by potential recording labels.&lt;ref name="alllister"/&gt; Instead, they recorded it at O'Connor's and Brian O'Shaughnessy's Bark Studios in [[Walthamstow]], East London.&lt;ref name="studio" /&gt; The arrangement was by Bill C. Martin, and the rest of The Firm was made up of Dev Douglas and Peter Sills.&lt;ref name="alllister"&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham Lister|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/graham-lister-mn0001009154|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy later said "One of the greatest highlights of my career was producing 'Star Trekkin{{'}}{{'}}. The record was produced to mock the series and we had no idea it was going to be a big hit."&lt;ref name="studio" /&gt;

The song features the [[catchphrase]]s of several ''Star Trek'' characters, including Captain [[James T. Kirk]], [[Spock]] and Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]]. These were intended to be recognisable to British listeners who had seen the episodes of the series on re-runs throughout the 1970s and 1980s, or those who were only relatively familiar with the source. While several of the lines such as [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]]'s "Ye [[Scots language|cannae]] change the [[laws of physics]]!", or [[Uhura]]'s "There's [[Klingons]] on the [[starboard]] [[Bow (ship)|bow]]." had been said in the series, other phrases had not.{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=37}} Spock's quote, "It's life, Jim, but not as we know it", never featured in ''The Original Series'' but "Star Trekkin{{'"}} subsequently so popularised the phrase that it is now commonly misattributed. The closest equivalent in the series is the phrase "No life as we know it" in "[[The Devil in the Dark]]".{{sfn |Knowles| 2002| p=224}} Kirk's "We come in peace; shoot to kill" also never featured, and was suggested by author Brian Robb as having "summed up the popular impression of the trigger-happy captain's approach to alien encounters".{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=37}} The voices of the characters were not provided by the actors who portrayed them in ''The Original Series''; O'Connor voiced the Kirk and McCoy, while Douglas voiced Spock. Scotty was voiced by a studio engineer and O'Connor's wife, Shelly, voiced Uhura.&lt;ref name="tbtimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wuench|first1=Kevin|title=Begin your Star Trek weekend with this '80s classic|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/begin-your-star-trek-weekend-with-this-80s-classic/2286443|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 22, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818180647/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/begin-your-star-trek-weekend-with-this-80s-classic/2286443|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Having funded the pressing of 500 copies of the single,&lt;ref name="kutner"/&gt; O'Connor sent copies of it to British radio stations, with the studio's phone number on them.{{sfn |Roberts| 2006| p=476}} One [[Liverpool]] station began giving the phone number out on air and O'Connor began to receive many phone calls from the area, asking for copies of the record. A [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] disc jockey, [[Simon Bates]], promoted the song and after an initial release where it reached 74th position in the on the [[UK Singles Chart]], it climbed the following week to 13th place.{{sfn |Roberts| 2006| p=476}} For the two weeks afterwards, it was placed at number one,&lt;ref name=ukchart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/star%20trekkin'/ |title=Star Trekkin'|publisher=Official Charts Company |accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming the ninth best-selling single of [[1987 in music|1987]] in the UK.{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=37}} While it was at number one, it kept [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[I Wanna Dance With Somebody]]" in second place,&lt;ref name="studio"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Walthamstow studio's role in one of the most iconic singles of the 90s|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/localhistory/10966161.a_walthamstow_studio_s_role_in_one_of_the_most_iconic_singles_of_the_90s/|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=Epping Forest Guardian|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously at number one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Justin|title=Official Charts Pop Gem #80: Whitney – I Wanna Dance With Somebody|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/official-charts-pop-gem-80-whitney-i-wanna-dance-with-somebody__6506/|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=30 July 2016|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, it was selling 60,000 copies a day,&lt;ref name="lookin"&gt;{{cite news|title="It's a Hit Jim, But Not As We Know It..."|work=Lookin|issue=30|date=18 July 1987|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to sell more than 470,000 copies in the UK alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Gallup Year End Charts 1987: Singles |periodical=[[Record Mirror]] |publisher=Spotlight Publications |location=London, England |page=36 |date=23 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single was also released outside of the UK, reaching 22nd place in the [[Ultratop]] chart within Belgium,&lt;ref name=ultratop/&gt; 9th place in the neighbouring [[Dutch Top 40]],&lt;ref name=dutch/&gt; and on the other side of the world, it reached third place in the [[ARIA Charts]] within Australia and peaked at the number 2 spot on [[Official New Zealand Music Chart]].&lt;ref name="annoying"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzcharts/&gt; Worldwide, it sold more than a million copies.&lt;ref name="tbtimes" /&gt; "Star Trekkin{{'"}} has become well known in the United States due to frequent play on the ''[[Dr. Demento]] Show'' radio program.&lt;ref name="tbtimes" /&gt;

The Firm subsequently released an album, ''Serious Fun'', in 1987, through [[K-Tel]] in the UK and [[Dino Music]] in Australia. "Star Trekkin{{'"}} was track one on the A-side of the [[LP record|record]], and the album featured previous single "Arthur Daley (e's Alright)". The album also featured the follow-up single to "Star Trekkin{{'"}}, "Superheroes",&lt;ref name="SeriousFunUK"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Firm, The – Serious Fun  | work = Discogs  | url = http://www.discogs.com/Firm-Serious-Fun/release/1650814  | accessdate = 30 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SeriousFunAU"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Firm, The – Serious Fun  | work = Discogs  | url = http://www.discogs.com/Firm-Serious-Fun/release/637696  | accessdate = 30 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in the UK on 26 September that year.

==Music video==
Following the success of the single, the band realised that they would be expected to appear on the British television series ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on [[BBC One|BBC1]] the following week. The decision was made not to make personal television appearances, as O'Connor and Lister felt that they were a "bunch of balding thirty-something’s" and an appearance as themselves on the show "would kill the whole fun element of the thing stone dead!"{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} So despite the time limit, they sought for an animated music video to be created. They approached several potential providers,&lt;ref name="kutner"/&gt; including the production company behind the television series ''[[Spitting Image]]'', who had previously produced the video for the single "[[Land of Confusion]]" by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. However, the cost was too high, and they needed longer than the week to create the video.&lt;ref name="kutner"/&gt; One of the other companies approached were a team of graduate art students called The Film Garage. On a low budget, the new company created a [[clay animation|claymation]] [[stop motion]] animated video.&lt;ref name="tbtimes" /&gt;

The characters in the video are based on food items, such as being made out of potatoes, with the ''Enterprise'' being created to look like it was made from pizza and sausages. The idea for the video as described by co-director Pete Bishop was that "Kirk has been out in space too long, and is hallucinating – about food". It was shot over seven days under the direction of Pete Bishop and Marc Kitchen-Smith, while the company No Strings were responsible for the model construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.animatormag.com/archive/issue-21/issue-21-page-7/ |title=Trekkin’ across the universe |newspaper=Animator|accessdate=July 29, 2016|issue=21|date=October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was completed with hours to spare before it was due to air for the first time on ''Top of the Pops''.&lt;ref name="kutner"/&gt;

==Reception==
In Brian Robb's 2012 book, ''A Brief Guide to Star Trek'', he said it was a testament to the quality of the series and of the characters that some 20 years after it was originally broadcast,{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=38}} a series of catchphrases could still summarise the appeal of the television series.{{sfn |Robb| 2012| p=37}} The song has appeared in several lists, such as in [[MSN]]'s list of the most annoying songs of all time, "Star Trekkin{{'"}}, placed in 15th place.&lt;ref name="annoying" /&gt; British Sunday newspaper ''[[The People (newspaper)|The People]]'' included it in a list of the most irritating songs in 2005, calling it "Funny, but dreadful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aaaargh Tunes!

'''Stone Protectors''' is a British/American/French multi-media entertainment property consisting primarily of an [[action figure]] line and [[animated series]]. The series also had a tie-in video game released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. It served as a late attempt to market the [[troll doll]] craze of the early 1990s to young boys. While not particularly successful, nor inspired by a prior medium, Stone Protectors generally followed in the same vein as contemporaries including [[Toxic Crusaders]], [[Swamp Thing (1991 TV series)|Swamp Thing]], and the highly popular [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].

==Back-story==
A kingdom built of crystals came under attack by the Saurians whose leader, Zok, desired the powerful crystals protected by the Empress. Zok broke into the castle and reached for the crystals only to see them explode into pieces and fly to Earth.

After being thrown out the back door of a [[New York City]] club, an awful rock band known as the Rock Detectors found the five magical stones which gave them troll-like appearances and special skills (not the least of which is playing ''good'' music). This put them at odds with the music-hating Zok and his henchman Zink, collectively known as The Prodtectors.

*Cornelius, the group's leader, holds the green stone and became a [[samurai]] with an assortment of appropriate weaponry ([[katana]], [[shuriken]], and a pair of [[nunchaku]] made of microphones). He's the band's lead singer, but also plays [[guitar]].
*Chester holds the red stone and became an expert at [[professional wrestling|wrestling]] and received great strength. He plays [[bass guitar]] and [[saxophone]].
*Clifford holds the blue stone and became a "rock climber." He is the band's [[drummer]].
*Angus holds the yellow stone and became a "soldier" and an expert at turning mundane objects into weapons. He plays [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]]. Angus ostensibly built up the Protectors' bizarre attack vehicles from things like barbecues and lawnmowers.
*Maxwell holds the orange stone and became an "accelerator" with in-line skates. He plays guitar.

==Animated series==
A short-lived cartoon series based on the characters debuted in 1993. In it, Empress Opal of Mythrandir splits the legendary Great Crystal into six pieces to keep it out of Zok's hands. Zok manages to capture one piece, but the other five bond with the future Stone Protectors, spiriting them away to Mythrandir to help Opal upset Zok's schemes and spread a sentiment of peace and freedom with their music. The series lasted one season; 8 out of 13 episodes were released on VHS in 1994 by [[Family Home Entertainment]], the whole series was released on VHS in England.

It's notable that while the advertisements for the action figures attempted to tie the Stone Protectors into the troll doll fad, the cartoon seemed eager to avoid the comparison. For instance, it replaced the line "trolls on a roll" from the theme song in the commercials with "Don't you know?"

The series has also been broadcast on the [[BBC]] in England, [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]] in Malaysia, [[Bop TV]] in South Africa and [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in New Zealand.

==Action figures==
The Stone Protectors action figures were produced by the Ace Novelty Toy Company. All of the figures were roughly 5" tall and featured cut joints at the neck, shoulders, and elbows as well as ball joints at the hips. Their heads were a soft, rubbery material with tall, synthetic hair sticking straight out the top. In rotating the right arm of a Stone Protectors figure, a [[flint]] module would ignite inside its chest, creating a quick yet bright flash seen through the translucent chest emblem. A second series of sports-themed figures was also released. Princess Opal was never made as a figure, nor were there any generic Saurian Guards.

Unfortunately, the toyline as well as the cartoon that followed it were seen as poor imitations of the popular [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures|line of toys]] and [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 animated series)|cartoon series]] and overlooked by many.

A [[Super NES]] game based on the property was released in November 1994 by [[Kemco]].&lt;ref&gt;Manx [http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R101385.html Stone Protectors] GameFAQs.com (January 6, 2008). Retrieved on 12-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] version was developed and completed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Stone Protectors|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=68|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1995|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not released. This version, intended to be published by [[Vic Tokai]], was finally leaked to the public in 2010.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

''Stone Protectors'' features 10 levels in which the heroes – Clifford, Cornelius, Chester, Maxwell, and Angus – battle The Predators throughout their mission to retrieve Zok's crystal and bring them all back to the kingdom. Weapons can also be acquired but only used by certain characters. Depending on the difficulty setting, the game's ending scene also features different music in which the Stone Protectors are seen performing as a band.

''[[GamePro]]'' gave the game a generally negative review, commenting that the graphics are good but the animation is poor, and the controls make it difficult to pull off special attacks or counteract enemy attacks. They concluded the game, while not without merits, is overall "a frustrating journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Stone Protectors|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=65|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1994|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta''' (c. 1647? – 1733) was an Irish poet, and a central figure in the seventeenth and eighteenth century [[Kingdom of Oriel|Airgíalla]] school of poets and songwriters in the [[Irish language]]. Like his neighbours [[Peadar Ó Doirnín]], [[Art Mac Cumhaigh]] and [[Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna]], Mac Cuarta was part of the Airgíalla tradition of poetry and song.

==Background==
Mac Cuarta was possibly born in [[Omeath]] in [[County Louth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=MacCuairt, James |first=Norman|last= Moore|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Kilkerley to the north-west of Dundalk is also mentioned as bearing links to his life; he appears to have spent most of his life moving around this area and the [[Boyne Valley]].{{refn|group=nb|In ''Oxford Dictionary National Biography'', it says that Mac Cuarta 'may have been born in the area known as Créamhainn (the tribal territory of Creamhthainn or Uí Chreamhthainn in early medieval times), on the borders of co. Louth and co. Monaghan, although some authorities have argued for a birthplace in the vicinity of Dundalk, others for one in co. Meath, and still others—with perhaps greater probability—in the district of Omeath, co. Louth, with which he is most closely identified.'&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Nollaig Ó|last=Muraíle|title=Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta|id=17408}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As his name suggests, he was either blind or had seriously impaired vision and, at a time when gentry patronage of the poetic class was on the wane, this placed more emphasis on his literary skills rather than the traditional poetic tools of flattery towards their patrons. He was, by all accounts, very sociable and among his friends were fellow musicians and poets [[Niall Óg Mac Mhurchaidh]], [[Pádraig Mac Giolla Fhiondáin]] (1665–1733), and [[Toirdhealbhach Ó Cearbhalláin]] (1670–1738).&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

==Works==
His works display a close affiliation with the older literary traditions, as well as the influence of contemporary popular song and balladry. In the words of [[Nollaig Ó Muraíle]], "Mac Cuarta's poetry reflects a familiarity with Irish literature and history, the classics (Greek and Latin), and the Bible."&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

===Political influences===
His poems also bear a very strong resonance to the political turmoil of the period or, as Ó Muraíle put it, 'Much of Mac Cuarta's work echoes the political events of his time, such as the catastrophic battle of Aughrim (1691)—which inspired ''[[Tuireamh Shomhairle Mhic Dónaill]]'' (a lament for a Catholic leader who fell in that battle)—and the subsequent subjugation of his people by the English, who are condemned both as foreigners and heretics.'&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

Among Séamas's patrons were chieftains of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman]] origin, and he dedicated poems to, among others, Toirealach Ó Néill, Brian Mac Naois, Brian Mac Eoghain, Mac Airt Uí Néill, [[Baron Slane]].&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; 
He lamented in particular the overthrow of the Ó Néill chiefs of the Fews in south Armagh, whose castle in Glasdrummond lay deserted at the time of his writing. However, despite his praise of these nobles, Séamas dismissed nobles who he believed did not resist the English sufficiently; instead, he promoted men without noble lineage but who resisted the English conquest.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

===Nature influences===
His poetry also displays a great love of nature, despite his blindness—a love most poignantly shown in 'Fáilte don éan' from c. 1707.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt; His best poems are those in the form of [[Trí Rainn agus Amhrán]]: three stanzas in loose syllabic verse and one stanza in song form, where both traditions are finely merged. Unlike the classic poetry of most of his contemporaries, Mac Cuarta's work displays a strong feeling for nature, a tendency which marked the [[Old Irish language|Early Irish]] poets. Other poems praise women, although these are not considered to be among his most passionate poems. Some fifty of Mac Cuarta's poems still survive.&lt;ref&gt;''An Duanaire 1600–1900: Poems of the Dispossessed'', p 127.&lt;/ref&gt; They are contained in about 130 manuscripts, the earliest of which is from {{circa}} 1690.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

==Death==
Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta died in 1733, and is buried in an unmarked grave in the old graveyard at [[Monknewton]], [[Co. Meath]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slaneparish.com/mntownhistory.html Christianity Down The Years In Monknewton]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tarring and feathering]] is a physical [[punishment]], used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in [[feudal]] Europe and its [[colonies]] in the [[early modern period]], as well as the early [[American frontier]], mostly as a type of mob vengeance (compare [[Lynch law]]). It is also used in modern popular culture.

==Literature==
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s humorous short story, "[[The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether]]", features the staff of an insane asylum being tarred and feathered. A song based on the story, "(The System of) Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether" is on the ''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'' album by the [[Alan Parsons Project]].
*In ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the Dauphin and the Duke are tarred, feathered, and [[Riding a rail|ridden on a rail]] in Pikesville after performing the Royal Nonesuch to a crowd that Jim had warned about the rapscallions.
*"What Happened To Charles", one of [[James Thurber]]'s ''Fables For Our Time'', has the duck Eva, who eavesdrops on every conversation she hears but never gets anything quite right, tarred and ''un''-feathered after she mistakes "shod" (having shoes put on) for "shot" and spreads the [[rumor]] that the horse Charles has been killed (he turns up alive and wearing new horseshoes).
*[[Jimmy Carter]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Hornet's Nest: A Novel of the Revolutionary War|Hornet's Nest]]'' describes the tarring and feathering of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] by members of the [[Sons of Liberty]]. The man suffers severe burns on both feet when the tar fills his boots, and he has toes amputated as a result.
*[[Seamus Heaney]]'s poem "Punishment" refers to the tarring and feathering of Catholic women who fraternized with British soldiers during the troubles in the 1970s . Heaney juxtaposes this with the punishment of Iron Age bog body the [[Windeby Girl]] (since revealed to be a man) who was at the time thought to have been punished for infidelity, suggesting that the punishment meted to women in Northern Ireland is very much rooted in ancient tribal traditions.
*In [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'', the 8-year-old protagonist has a daydreaming fear of himself and his family being tarred and feathered.

*In ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' by Charles Dickens, Mr Chollop, an American advocate of Lynch law, and slavery, recommended both in print and speech, the 'tarring and feathering' of any unpopular person who differed from himself. He called this 'planting the standard of civilisation in the wilder gardens of 'My country' and was much esteemed for his devotion to rational Liberty. He was usually described by his friends, in the South and West, as 'a splendid sample of our na-tive raw material, sir'. He introduces himself to young Martin Chuzzlewit and Mark Tapley when Martin was taken ill as a result of falling naive victim of fraudulent land dealing of Eden, which is deceptively sold as "a thriving city" with promising business prospect but turns out to be nothing but an abandoned marsh field, for their architects and survey business, called Martin Chuzzlewit Co.

'''Tulipamwe''' means "we are together" and is an independently funded artists project coordinated by the Tulipamwe Arts Trust in [[Namibia]]. The trust is organized under the auspices of the Visual &amp; Performing Arts Department of the [[University of Namibia]] and is affiliated to the [[Triangle Network of Workshops]] initiated by Sir [[Robert Lauder]].

== Introduction ==

Historically Namibia (in southern Africa) has been isolated by the politics of the Apartheid Government in South Africa from the rest of the world and especially from the rest of Africa (except South Africa) for over fifty years. This isolation has been in almost every sphere of interaction, but especially in the arts. The cultural boycott of South Africa extended to Namibia, and South Africa’s policy of destabilization of her neighbours ensured that Namibians did not interact peacefully with these “front-line states”. Since independence (1989) and since democracy in South Africa (1994) this isolation has been addressed in many different ways. Namibians are encouraged to see themselves as part of Africa rather than just a part of South Africa and in the Visual Arts, Tulipamwe has been a major force in the opening up of Namibia’s arts to Africa and the world and the introduction of foreign artists to Namibia.

Tulipamwe, aptly, means ‘we are together’.  As an international workshop it aims to fulfill the promise of its name. The first Tulipamwe International Artists Workshop was held in 1994. The workshops bring together about 20 artists from all over the world. Artists from Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa, Nigeria, Spain, USA, and Germany all applied. The selection process is strictly monitored by members of the organizational committee. The criteria for selection is based on the work submitted with the application and what the artist could bring to the workshop and on how much the artist is expected to gain from it, this allows for both students and professional artists to gain and receive in equal measures. Tulipamwe brings people together who have nothing in common besides their artistic passion which has proved time and time again to be all that is needed for success. Artists were not expected to come with any preparation, but rather to be open to new ideas in a new environment.

Tulipamwe is funded annually by sponsors, such as the Triangle Trust and the Ford Foundation as well as the foreign embassies operating in Windhoek. It depends entirely on the support of these sponsors as it is a non-profit organization founded simply for the benefit of local communities and artists.

In 2008 Tulipamwe was held at Okombahe, a rural community, with a design that included the local people. Five of the local residents of Okombahe participated. This article concentrates mainly on this workshop and the work created by the participants.
After the long process of organizing and coordinating the artists met, travelled to Okombahe and worked together for two solid weeks. Both International artists and local artists where encouraged to experiment with different materials and styles. This gave all the artists the opportunity to learn from each other. Seven nationalities, including Namibia, where represented. These artists were all at different stages of training and understanding in artistic ability and inter-cultural contact. Many of the artists had attended international workshops of a similar nature while for others this was their first.

== Brief history of Tulipamwe (1994–2003) ==

The Tulipamwe project was founded in 1994. Since then more than 200 Namibian artists and international artists have taken part in successful workshops. The Tulipamwe workshops have been held in many different locations; each of these was chosen for its peaceful atmosphere and more recently for the surrounding community. Tulipamwe has gone through a series of small changes over the last 14 years as it has changed hands three times during this time.

The Tulipamwe project was originally inspired by the Triangle Trust's workshop model. This was an international model on which many other similar projects have been based. Tulipamwe was founded in Namibia with the help of a consultant from the UK, Anna Kindersly, who co-ordinated the first workshop in 1994. The coordination was then taken over by the staff of the Visual Arts Department of the University of Namibia (UNAM). UNAM and the working group hosted six International Artists Workshops until 1999. These workshops all concentrated on the artists’ creative exploration. From 1999 to 2004 Tulipamwe was independently run by a Namibian artist, Jo Rogge. Four international workshops were held during this time. In 2005 it returned to the management of UNAM. The aims were then revived and revised and the workshops started again in 2008.

'''1994 – Otjiwa Game Lodge''' The first international artists' workshop in Namibia was held at Otjiwa Game Lodge. The workshop was highly anticipated and much was expected of it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“In planning, the working group anticipated that the Tulipamwe process would address a broad spectrum of creative issues relevant to contemporary Namibian art. What however could not have been anticipated was the degree of success. Not only did the workshop address these predicted issues but it generated an exceptionally high degree of creative energy, experimentation, and learning-through-sharing”''
(Francois de Necker, at the time a member of the working group)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clear that Tulipamwe exceeded its aims, this can be seen not only in the statements made by the participants and organizers but also by the fact that it continues to be promoted today. In this workshop the main impromptu educational focus was on sculpture. A lot of Namibian artists such as Silverius Olibile and Trudi Dicks started their first sculpture pieces at Tulipamwe with the help of sculptors from Zimbabwe, SA and Zambia.
Artists attended from: Botswana, Namibia, UK, USA, Germany, France, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Senegal and South-Africa.

'''1995 – Peperkorrel Farm''' Tulipamwe was then held at Peperkorrel Farm, this farm is the home and studio of internationally famous Namibian sculptor Dorte Berner.  The coordinator of this workshop was Hercules Viljoen, a Namibian artist who is head of the visual arts department at UNAM. Because of the different backgrounds of the artists who attend these workshops different opinions are often argued over. In 1995 a spontaneous and rather explosive debate erupted over the relevance and validity of abstract art, the debate ended amicably and so Tulipamwe was all the more rewarding and renewing. The final exhibit at the end of the workshop brought with it a totally new experience for the National Gallery of Namibia. This was the first time that an installation piece was exhibited in the space. This installation, called ‘Territories viii: Dreams of Africa”, was produced by Jack Beng-Thi a visiting artist from France-Reunion.

Artists attended from France-Reunion, Congo, Namibia, UK, Germany, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South-Africa.

'''1996 – Zebra River Lodge'''
Hercules Viljoen coordinated this workshop at Zebra River Lodge, a country lodge in the south of Namibia situated in the beautiful Zebra River Valley. This Tulipamwe, like all the others, had the aim of encouraging the free flow of ideas and information between professional artists from within Namibia and from abroad. This meeting of artistic minds has been described as "an exciting and stimulating experience of personal growth that can not be duplicated other than in a similar workshop situation" by Cathy McRoberts, a Namibian artist in 1996. This workshop inspired one of its participants, Samuel Amunkete, to further his education in the arts. In a similar way the land art, by Eric Pongerard from France-Reunion, inspired many of the Namibian artists to continue in this style, and this is coming out more and more clearly today.

Artists attended from: Botswana, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, UK, India, South Africa,
France-Reunion, Zambia, France, Germany and Spain

'''1997- Otjiruze Guest Lodge'''
By the fourth annual workshop, Tulipamwe had become one of the major annual events in the Namibian cultural calendar. The coordinator of this workshop, held at Otjiruze Guest Lodge, was Hercules Viljoen.  The location of this workshop resounded so well with the artists that it was used again for the next two Tulipamwe workshops. This workshop brought out in its participants a wish to express their own social, political, moral, and religious beliefs. Eric Schnack, from Namibia, produced work depicting his disgust for game hunting.  Max Edison, from Namibia, used his work to bring awareness to mistreated women and children. Moitshepi Mandidela, from Botswana, worked mainly on works that revolved around religion, his primary piece was called ‘My peoples religion’
Artists attended from: Australia, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, UK, South-Africa, France-Reunion, France, Germany and Spain

'''1998- Otjiruze Guest Lodge'''
This was the last workshop coordinated by Hercules Viljoen before it became a privately run project in 1999. Nine of the participating Namibian artists had attended Tulipamwe workshops previously and were able to build on their experiences and skills.  This is an important part of the workshop.

'''1999- Otjiruze Guest Farm'''
Jo Rogge coordinated and ran Tulipamwe in 1999 and in spite of the change in coordinator the ethos remained the same. Seven of the participants had attended Tulipamwe before.
Artists attended from: Namibia, Denmark, Botswana, Spain, Norway, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Rwanda, Germany, South Africa, Finland and Zambia.

'''2000 - Kansimba Game Lodge''
'This workshop was held at a lodge near Karibib in the Erongo region and was coordinated by Jo Rogge. The participant from Zimbabwe, Chiko, remained after the workshop to host a series of printmaking classes at the John Muafangejo Art Centre.
Artists attended from: Namibia, Norway, Zimbabwe, Finland, Zambia, South Africa, UK, Germany, Botswana, France and Spain.

'''2001 – Gobabeb Research Station'''
The experiences of the artists at the Gobabeb Research Station tended to be more tranquil and serene. This was mainly because the research station is in the middle of the desert, on the divide between the dune fields and the gravel plains, and is situated in an extremely barren area. This seems to have had an effect on the art produced, much of it inspired by nature. The artist from Ireland, Janet Crimble made a large piece of land art in the riverbed made entirely of the pods from the indigenous trees. Francois Niay made large drawings of natural objects.
Artists attended from: Namibia, Northern Ireland, Botswana, Spain, Finland, France, Mozambique, South Africa, Norway and Germany

'''2003 – Otjiruze Guest Farm'''
This Tulipamwe was coordinated by Jo Rogge and had an emphasis on experience and professionalism. "Enthusiasm for participation over the years has not waned, rather, artists eagerly forward their applications".  Sculpture and installation art once again were a huge portion of the work produced.
Artists attended from: Namibia, Uganda, France, Mozambique, Finland, Norway, Zimbabwe.

== Sponsorship ==

The Tulipamwe Arts Trust is an independent body attached to the University of Namibia which provides some logistical and administrative support but the workshops need to be funded annually. It is approved by the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture as well as the National Art Gallery of Namibia. The coordinator and the working group seek funding each year for the running of the workshop. The funding is used for transport, accommodation, catering, materials and publicity. Traditionally the workshop is funded by international donors such as HIVOS, a Dutch funding agency and the Ford Foundation. Funding is also acquired from local international agencies such as the Goethe Centre, the American Cultural Centre, the Franco Namibian Cultural Centre and UNESCO. The private sector in Namibia has also provided funding in the form of services and materials. The funders are acknowledged widely in the press as well as in the catalogues and on the web site. An Open Day is held at the end of the workshop to give an opportunity for the sponsors to meet and talk to the artists in their studios and to view the work created. At the end of a workshop the donors are presented with an artwork in thanks for their sponsorship.

== Art Workshop Networks ==

[[Triangle Arts Trust]] is an umbrella organization that facilitates and supports various workshop initiatives in 23 countries all over the world. It helps to support at least 10 different workshop organizations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Artists often attend more than one workshop in various countries and start to form connections with countries, arts institutions and artists all over the region. Some of these workshops are: Thapong – Botswana, Thupelo – South Africa, Aftershave – Nigeria, Batapata – Zimbabwe, Kuona – Kenya, Insaka – Zambia
Uta Goeble-Gross, from Germany, compared her experience at the 2008 Tulipamwe workshop to two other workshops she had attended in Cape Town. While these urban experiences were both educative and useful to the communities, they lacked the connection she felt to the other artists at Tulipamwe. She felt that the isolation in the empty landscape made it a more individual experience and so allowed her to expand, and work on a bigger scale.

Arterial is an arts network for Africa and provides active network of individuals, organizations, sponsors, companies, and institutions all of which deal with African culture and the arts. This Network was formed to support African arts and to aid the growth of creative projects in Africa. An example of one of Arterials workshops was one that was held recently in Zimbabwe, Harare, it dealt with the marketing strategies of arts organizations. Tulipamwe makes use of networks such as this one and Triangle to advertise their workshops.

== Benefits to artists and to the community ==

In 1994 Tulipamwe was coordinated by [[Anna Kindersley]], from England, she described the benefits of Tulipamwe.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“The benefits emanating from such a workshop are many and varied. The positive effects in participants’ work may sometimes be seen months later together with the knock-on effects for the artists’ respective community or country. The inaugural Tulipamwe has created new and important networks between artists in SA, West Africa, Europe, and USA. This will open new horizons for Namibian artists such as opportunities to participate in sister workshops and to exhibit and work in other countries.”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the aims of Tulipamwe changed to focus on community development (2008) the value of the Tulipamwe project also increased. The local artists who participate in Tulipamwe have the opportunity to apply their creativity in a cultural context and to pass on skills to their community. This may change the perception of artists as people who are willing to share skills and knowledge as opposed to people reliant on community aid. The idea that art can be an income generating activity is also now encouraged.

== Location ==

Tulipamwe has always been located in isolated areas and, more recently, in rural communities. This is one of its unique qualities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} These areas have been called{{By whom|date=July 2011}} ‘marvelous’ and ‘spiritual and quiet warming’. Many other workshops are located in large cities right in the center of the hustle and bustle of everyday life; Tulipamwe escapes this, and so much more time can be spent concentrating on the individual. Uta Goebel-Gross (2008; Germany) explained in her interview how the new environment allowed her to expand as an artist. The absence of day-to-day chores and commitments allows artists a unique space in which to make their art. At the same time, this rural setting allows a whole community to develop and benefit from the workshop.

In 2008 it was particularly clear that Okombahe, its people and environment, featured strongly in the art works produced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Okombahe - the "Place of the Giraffe" appeared in the imagery of paintings and large ceramics were made out of clay from the Omaruru river and were fired in a self-built kiln. Found materials (seed pods, rusty tins) were in artworks and installations. As Seth Basson, a member of the Okombahe community stated, "I learned that you can make beautiful things from scratch, trees and waste".

Personal benefits to artists

== Local Namibian Artists ==

The fact that Tulipamwe was first of all a learning workshop was reiterated by many of the local artists who participated. They were often exposed to western art for the first time and many learnt about abstract and conceptual art from a different perspective. Links were formed across language barriers and many local artists worked in new ways for the first time. Like Ester Ihuhwa a Namibian craftsperson “I enjoyed painting on canvas for the first time. I was very happy to meet new friends from so many different places.”
Dias Machate( 1994 Mozambique). “I’m a teacher but Tulipamwe was anyway a constellation of knowledges: a university in which anyone may become a student of another through exchanges of experience.”

== Foreign Artists ==

Foreign artists often do not know what to expect from Namibia or Tulipamwe, the experience of working in a rural African setting is often daunting but nonetheless rewarding. Simon Faithfull, from Britain, participate in the 1997 Tulipamwe project, during his time there he wrote a journal of his experience. He worked both as a conceptual and installation artist.
In an unusual turnabout, foreign artists are usually more isolated in their own workspaces than local artists, this is because in the large cities they come from they are pressed for studio space and find it hard to work in groups because there is a lack of space. Generally in developed countries people are isolated by their living arrangements, which are very different from the communal living apparent in less developed countries.  African artists often share resources, materials, and space. They tend to work together on projects this perhaps originated in the communal making of traditional functional objects such as baskets and pots.
In the words of a German Tulipamwe participant: “Artists are usually solitary and to be forced to work as a group is unusual and challenging. For me it was a journey of self-discovery where all the artists worked together and helped each other.”
Exposure to raw materials such as clay from riverbeds, abundant indigenous wood and found materials has been inspirational to many of the foreign participants.

Tulipamwe 2008 held in Okombahe, as an international artists workshop, was dormant for the 3 years between 2004 and 2007. This was due to a lack of committed people with time to organize an event like this. The new Tulipamwe was launched in 2007 with new commitment from UNAM to ensure that the project was sustainable. A new working group was gathered together; who would be responsible for the organization, funding and selecting of participants. Tulipamwe was legally constituted as the Tulipamwe Arts Trust and a Board of Trustees was formed, the trustees are high profile members of the Namibian art community as well as a lawyer and an accountant.  In 2007 it was decided to work towards the first workshop in 2008.

The original vision for Tulipamwe was not changed, instead it was given broader aims that encompassed a much larger goal. Tulipamwe now focuses not only on artistic development but also on helping needy communities by holding the workshop in their vicinity and including community members in the program.

== The aims of the Tulipamwe Community Empowerment project ==

1. To create an invigorating artistic environment for Namibian artists to share creative skills with each other and with international artists.

2. To provide international artists with the opportunity to work in a unique African environment where they can explore new creative avenues.

3. To benefit a disadvantaged community by bringing positive energy, activity and community engagement to it through visual arts initiatives.

4. To allow the community the initiative to share in Tulipamwe’s funding by providing workshop facilities, accommodation and meals to workshop participants.

5. To celebrate local traditions and culture as integral part of the global community.

6. To create the opportunity for development in visual art, thereby contributing to Namibia’s cultural capital.

It was decided to hold the next Tulipamwe International Workshop in a rural community. Various communities were investigated. Among those investigated was Gibeon and Bathseba, in the south; however, they were not chosen due to the lack of interest shown by community leaders. Instead the elders of the village council at Okombahe in the Erongo region near Omaruru were approached.
Okombahe showed enthusiasm and could provide accommodation in the form of a large community house. The community was also able to provide catering services and had several interested artists who wished to participate. Six of these artists were chosen by the community elders and came in on a daily basis to work with the other artists.
Through the different artist’s networks, including the Triangle Trust, a call for applications from international artists was sent out. There was an overwhelming response and the fundraising began. By May 2008 the selection process was complete. Artists from Mauritius, SA, USA, France, Germany and Botswana as well as 12 from Namibia where chosen to participate. Due to insufficient funds a lot of the artists had to fund their own travel costs.

Tulipamwe 2008 was held in Okombahe (place of the giraffe) The following artists participated in Tulipamwe 2008: Nirveda Alleck, a painter and installation artist from Mauritius; Diana Hyslop, an object maker from South Africa; Hannah Naomi Kim, a new media artist and painter from the USA; Raphael Caloone  an animator and sculptor from France; Uta Goebel- Gross  a painter from Germany; Kim Modise  a painter from Botswana; Shiya Karuseb an installation artist and print maker from Namibia; Gretta Nashongo a textile maker  from Namibia; Helena Iitembu a painter from Namibia; John Nampala a ceramic artist from Namibia; Abneil Enkali a mixed media artist from Namibia; and Barbara Böhlke a painter from Namibia.  Hulda Gomachas, Cecilia Gowases, Seth Basson, Sandro! Naruseb, MC Henry Gomachab and Ebeneyus Ebos were the participating Okombahe Community Artists.

The artists arrived from their various countries a few days before the workshop. They were accommodated in a Bed and Breakfast. They spent the following few days getting to know one another in Windhoek. On the 16th of August all of the artists were transported to Okombahe with the use of UNAM combis. The Artists immediately got to work and started to experiment with new media. Half way through the workshop the artists were taken to the Brandberge on an outing. This was an astonishing experience for both the Namibian and foreign artists as many of them had never been to this area.

Open day was held on the 29th of August, press, sponsors and other interested parties all attended. They were shown around the area and were given the chance to see the work that had been produced in the space where it had been made, they were also able to talk to the artists about the process of production.

After the workshop back in Windhoek a public discussion was organized and held at the FNCC (Franco Namibian Cultural Center), and an exhibition of selected works was held at the Goethe Center. The exhibition was opened by Joy Sasman, the chairperson of the Board of Trustees; quite a few sales were made.

'''White voice''' or white singing is a [[traditional]] style of singing from [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Білий голос,'' {{Lang-uk|білий спів|translit=bílyi spiv}}, {{Lang-pl|biały śpiew}}).

== Technique ==
The technique is based on the open [[throat]] and noisy free volume of a bright color. Mostly it uses the [[chest register]] and is close to a controlled [[screaming|scream]]. Air escapes through the fully open throat. They are used for the upper and medium [[resonators]], [[Arytenoid cartilage|laryngeal cartilage]], [[bones]] and air cavities in the head and throat. A characteristic feature of this kind of voice is its brightness and intensity, more important than the smooth running and control of [[breathing]]. Most of the [[traditional song]]s feature the [[modal voice register]].

== Occasions ==
It had been practiced since ancient times among the rural population in Central and [[Eastern Europe]]. Loud and clear singing originates from practicing in the open air while working in the [[field (agriculture)|field]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

It was used during [[wedding]]s and annual rituals, [[khorovod]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=N8GiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA520&amp;lpg=PA520&amp;dq=Bilyi+holos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lBKInUaOwH&amp;sig=oMmrc06Ik5ThJWjmn-aRJXzDjPM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioqvjp6fjPAhXEDSwKHb_RDsUQ6AEIIzAB|title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Revival|last=Bithell|first=Caroline|last2=Hill|first2=Juniper|date=2014-06-26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199384921|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in large gatherings human in small spaces.

== Geography ==
[[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Bulgaria]] white voice takes part [[polyphonic]] singing. In [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Slovakia|Slovak]] the approach uses one voice ([[monody]]).

Today, more and more frequently held [[workshop]]s of the white voice conducted by the followers of the old way of singing.

'''Wu Ming''' (extended name: '''Wu Ming Foundation''') is a pseudonym for a group of Italian authors formed in 2000 from a subset of the [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] community in [[Bologna]].
Four of the group earlier wrote the novel ''[[Q (novel)|Q]]'' (first edition 1999). Unlike the open name "Luther Blissett", "Wu Ming" stands for a defined group of writers active in literature and popular culture. The band authored several novels, some of which have been translated in many countries.

Their books are seen as part of a body of literary works (the "nebula", as it is frequently called in Italy) described as the [[New Italian Epic]], a phrase that was proposed by Wu Ming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/outtakes/NIE_have_to_be_the_parents.htm "We're Going To Have To Be The Parents": A Reflection on the New Italian Epic"], opening talk at the conference ''The Italian Perspective on Metahistorical Fiction: The New Italian Epic'', IGRS, University of London, 2 October 2008. Text and audio.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of the name==
In Chinese, "''wu ming''" can mean "anonymous" ({{zh|t=無名|s=无名|p=wúmíng}}) or, with a different tone on the first syllable, "five people" ({{zh|t=五名|s=五名|p=wǔ míng}}), the pun being part of the reason the collective adopted the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/biography.html#wuming "Wu Ming: Who we are and what we do"], biographical page on Wu Ming's website&lt;/ref&gt; The name is meant both as a tribute to dissidents ("Wu Ming" is a common byline among Chinese citizens demanding democracy and [[freedom of speech]]) and as a rejection of the celebrity-making machine which turns the author into a star. "Wu Ming" is also a reference to the third sentence in the ''[[Daodejing]]'': "Heaven and Earth's nameless origin" ({{zh|t=無名天地之始|s=无名天地之始|p=wúmíng tiāndì zhī shǐ}}).

==Members and public personae==
[[Image:Photo wuming.jpg|thumb|right|The picture that Wu Ming used as an "official portrait" from 2001 to 2008, when the quintet became a quartet. As of 14 January 2009, the image is completely absent from the group's official website.]]
The members of Wu Ming are typically known as "Wu Ming 1", "Wu Ming 2", "Wu Ming 3", "Wu Ming 4", and "Wu Ming 5". Real names are not secret though:

*Roberto Bui (Wu Ming 1)
*Giovanni Cattabriga (Wu Ming 2)
*Luca Di Meo (Wu Ming 3 – He left the group in the spring of 2008&lt;ref&gt;On 16 September 2008, Wu Ming's newsletter ''Giap'' announced that Luca Di Meo had left the band for personal reasons, and the separation had taken place in the previous springtime. Cf. {{it icon}} [http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/Giap/giap1_IXa.htm#gummo "Un dispaccio col cuore in mano e l'anima oltre le fiamme"], Giap no. 1, ninth series, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Federico Guglielmi (Wu Ming 4) [Not to be confused with the Italian music journalist of the same name]
*Riccardo Pedrini (Wu Ming 5 - He left the group in the summer of 2015&lt;ref&gt;On 15 February 2016, Wu Ming's blog ''Giap'' announced that Riccardo Petrini had left the collective for personal reasons, and the separation had taken place in the previous summer. Cf. {{it icon}}[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/giap/?p=23841#gummo "Zeppo’s Gone. Riccardo / Wu Ming 5 è uscito dal collettivo "]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The five authors do extensive book tours (which they describe as "almost gratefuldeadesque"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/giap/giapdigest37.htm#1d Wu Ming newsletter], 23 December 2007. Probably a jocular reference to Californian rock band [[Grateful Dead]]'s extensive touring and their [[Deadheads|close relationship with fans]].&lt;/ref&gt;) and frequently appear in public. However, they refuse to be photographed or filmed by the media. Even on their official website, they do not provide any pictures of themselves. Here is how Wu Ming 1 explained the group's stance in a 2007 interview:

{{quote|Once the writer becomes a face... it's a cannibalistic jumble: that face appears everywhere, almost always out of context. A photo is witness to my absence; it's a banner of distance and solitude. A photo paralyses me, it freezes my life into an instant, it negates my ability to transform into something else. I become a "character", a stopgap to hurriedly fill a page layout, an instrument that amplifies banality. On the other hand my voice – with its grain, with its accents, with its imprecise diction, its tonalities, rhythms, pauses and vacillations – is witness to a presence even when I'm not there; it brings me close to people and doesn't negate my transformative capacity because its presence is dynamic, alive and trembling even when seemingly still.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manituana.com/documenti/0/8246/EN "The Perfect Storm, or rather: The Monster Interview"], manituana.com, April 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Wu Ming's official biographical page (Italian version), the collective denies rumors they once beat up a press photographer:

{{quote|The dates and places vary, but the core of all versions stays the same. Well, it never ever happened, but it's true that, like [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]] in [[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]] or [[King Kong]] in the famous gala opening scene, we're no camera-mongers. We don't go on TV either. We are shy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/biografia.htm#lies "Elenco incompleto di leggende urbane e dicerie sul nostro conto"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''54''==

{{main|54 (novel)}}

''54'' is a complex novel about popular culture, the shattered dreams of the [[Italian Resistance Movement|Italian Resistance]], and the relationship between Europe and America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundtracksforthem.blogspot.com/2007/01/54-tells-story-of-life-in-shadow-of.html Detailed review from the ''Soundtracks for Them'' e-zine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Background research began in 1999, after the publication of the group's previous novel ''[[Q (novel)|Q]]''. Plots were outlined in the aftermath of the [[Kosovo war]]. Actual writing work ended ten days after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September]], on the eve of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. These two wars are explicitly referred to in the novel's ''End Titles'': "Begun in May 1999, during the Nato bombings of Belgrade. Delivered to the Italian publishers on September 21, 2001, awaiting the escalation". The events leading to (and following) 11 September are also allegorically described in [[54 (novel)#Contemporary context and interpretations|the book's forenote]].

''54'' was published in Italy in the springtime of 2002. In the following months, Wu Ming collaborated with Italian folk-rock band [[:it:Yo Yo Mundi|Yo Yo Mundi]], whose ensuing concept album ''[[:it:54 (album degli Yo Yo Mundi)|54]]'' (2004) was directly inspired from the novel.

==''Radio Alice'' / ''Working Slowly''==

Wu Ming is also credited as co-writers for the Italian film ''[[:it:Lavorare con lentezza|Lavorare con lentezza]]'' (aka ''[[Radio Alice]]''), directed by [[:it:Guido Chiesa|Guido Chiesa]], released in Italy in 2004.

The original title means "Working slowly" and cites a protest song, a popular leftist anthem in the 1970s: "''Work slowly / And effortlessly / Work may hurt you / And send you to the hospital / Where there's no bed left / And you may even die. / Work slowly / And effortlessly / Health is priceless.''" (Translated by Wu Ming)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/giap/ukscreenings.htm "Working Slowly in the UK"], March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is set during an actual student uprising that paralysed Bologna for several days in March 1977. Several narrative threads are woven around [[Radio Alice]], the station run by the "creative wing" (the so-called "Mao-Dadaists") of the radical [[Autonomia]] movement. In the morning of 11 March a brawl involving radical and catholic students escalated to a full-scale riot in the university district. The [[Carabinieri]] riot squad attacked and shot down a 25-year-old student called Francesco Lorusso. As a result, thousands of students and activists stormed the centre of the town, clashing with the police and throwing [[molotov cocktail]]s. On 13 March the premises of Radio Alice were invaded and vandalised by the police, the station was shut down and every member of the staff was arrested. The film tells the story mixing real anecdotes with semi-fictional characters.

''Radio Alice'' has won several awards and prizes at movie festivals all over Europe, including the Marcello Mastroianni Award for the Best Young Actors at the 2004 [[Venice Film Festival]] and the First Prize at the 2005 Festival de Cinema Politic in [[Barcelona]], Spain.

==''Manituana''==

{{main|Manituana}}

''Manituana'' is the third of Wu Ming's collectively authored novels. It was written in the 2003–07 period and published in Italy in 2007. It is the first episode of an 18th-century pan-Atlantic trilogy which the authors call "the Atlantic Triptych". All novels will be set in the 1770s, all across the Atlantic Ocean (North America, Europe, the West Indies and Africa), before and during the American Revolution.

In the springtime of 2007, ''Manituana'' reached No. 4 in the Italian best-seller charts&lt;ref&gt;Reported on Italian daily paper ''[[La Stampa]]'' on 7 April 2007, article [http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/biography.html#Manituana included by Wu Ming on their website].&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation was published in the UK and the US by [[Verso Books]] in the Fall of 2009.

In an entry on their weblog, Wu Ming wrote that

{{quote|''Manituana'' was written between 2003 and 2007, and it soaked up all the tensions of that period: S11, the Neoconservative hegemony on US foreign policy,  the lies on Saddam allegedly keeping weapons of mass destruction hidden in the desert, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, George W. Bush winning his second term thanks to the Christian right in 2004, Silvio Burlesquoni conquering the hearts and minds of the majority of Italians  etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=1 Awaiting Manituana: A New Beginning in the English-speaking world?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508080349/http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=1# |date=8 May 2009 }}, Wu Ming Foundation Blog, April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The novel is set in the years 1775–1783 in New York's [[Mohawk Valley]], Quebec and London (UK). Among the many real historical chapters that populate the book, the most important ones are [[Joseph Brant]], war chief of the Mohawk nation, and [[Molly Brant]], a matron of the Wolf clan in the [[Iroquois]] Six Nations.

In Italy ''Manituana'' was awarded the Premio [[Sergio Leone]] 2007 and the Premio [[Emilio Salgari]] 2008. In November 2010 it was nominated for [[International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award]].

==''Altai''==
In May 2009 Wu Ming announced that they had almost finished writing a new book, entitled ''Altai'', set "in [their debut novel] Q's world and historical continuum". "After this accomplishment", they added, "we'll go back to the Atlantic Triptych."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=176 "Never Say Never Again. Autumn 2009, Back to ''Q''"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907012753/http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=176# |date=7 September 2009 }}, Wu Ming Foundation Blog, 12 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, they explained:
{{quote|We felt the urge to go back to the "crime scene" (our 1999 debut) after the collective lost a member, in the springtime of 2008. After months of crisis and conflict, we needed a new beginning. We needed a peculiar self-managed group therapy... Gert-from-the-Well appeared and told us: “I can help you, if you bring me back to life!”. And that’s what we did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=458 "Doctor kindly tell your wife that we're alive"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907060947/http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=458# |date=7 September 2009 }}, Wu Ming Foundation Blog, July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The novel, entitled ''Altai'', was published in Italy on 20 November 2009 and immediately reached No. 5 in the national list of best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/wumingblog/?p=959 "Altai's first week: straight to the 5th place"], wumingfoundation.com, 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Interview with Wu Ming in Bologna by Stewart Home|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=9722|work=InEnArt|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The solo novels==

Starting from 2001, each individual member of Wu Ming also authored one or more "solo" novels. Some of them have been translated into other languages, but not yet in English.

Wu Ming 1 is the author of ''New Thing'' (2004), an "[[New Italian Epic#Characteristics|unidentified narrative object]]" blending fiction, journalism and free verse. It is an allegorical tale on [[free jazz]] and the 1960s, set in 1967 New York City and constructed around [[John Coltrane]]'s final days. The French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' described the book as "a choral novel, an inquiry, and a political jam-session loaded with syncopated poetry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/rassegna/LeMonde_NT_GAU.htm "A l'extrême gauche de l'Occident..."], ''Le Monde des livres'', 24 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu Ming 2 is the author of ''Guerra agli umani'' [War on the Humans] (2004), a satire of [[Anarcho-primitivism|primitivism]] and [[survivalism]] set on the [[Apennines]] in an undefined year. The main character and narrator is called Marco, but he nicknames himself "Marco Walden", after Thoreau's ''[[Walden]]''. At the beginning of the book, Marco quits his job as a restroom cleaner at a big cemetery, because he wants to leave the city (presumably Bologna, although it remains unnamed), go to the mountains and become a "hunter-gatherer superhero".

Wu Ming 4 is the author of ''Stella del mattino'' [Star of the Morning] (2008). The novel is set in 1919 Oxford and centered around [[T.E. Lawrence]] suffering writer's block while working on [[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]. Among the characters Lawrence encounters in the book, important roles are played by writers [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[C.S. Lewis]] and, most notably, [[Robert Graves]]. Wu Ming themselves described ''Stella del mattino'' as "the best solo novel ever manufactured in our smithy" and "a bridge between our collective and solo novels".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/Giap/giap22_VIIIa.htm#stelladelmattino "Stella del mattino"], from Giap #22/23, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu Ming 5 is the author of both ''Havana Glam'' (2001) and ''Free Karma Food'' (2007). ''Havana Glam'' is set in an alternate 1970s world where [[David Bowie]] is a communist sympathizer and has a "Cuban period" instead of a "[[David Bowie#1976 to 1979: The Berlin era|Berlin period]]". This causes some turmoil in Havana, as the Cuban intelligence suspect the rockstar to be an infiltrator. ''Free Karma Food'' describes a future society where all kinds of cattle have been killed by a global pandemic known as "The Great Murrain". Some Italian critics described Wu Ming 5's novels as belonging to the literary subgenre known as "[[New Weird]]". Such inclusion, however, has been questioned in weblogs and social network discussion groups devoted to science-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Barone, [http://adriano-barone.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-weird-new-italian-epic-steampunk-e.html "New Weird, New Italian Epic, Steampunk e il pregiudizio italiano sulla letteratura fantastica"], May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu Ming 5 was guitar player in [[:it:Nabat]], one of the first [[Oi!]] bands to reach a cult following in Italy during the early 1980s. The band broke up in 1987 but got together again in the early 1990s, only to break up again in 1998. Nabat reunited in 2010 for a comeback tour, with Wu Ming 5 still on guitar, "splitting services between two bands [Wu Ming and Nabat]", as he quipped during a radio interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feeds.feedburner.com/WuMingAudiotheque Wu Ming 1 and Wu Ming 5 interviewed on Radio Ciroma], 8 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Đinh Tự''''' was a type of [[hat]] worn in [[Vietnam]] throughout the [[Lê dynasty]] and fell out of favor in the 19th century. It used to be widely worn by gentlemen and military officers. Nowadays it can still be seen at local festivals.
