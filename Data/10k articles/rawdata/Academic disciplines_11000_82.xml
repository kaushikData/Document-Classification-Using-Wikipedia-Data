{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement Macroeconomics''' (also known as '''AP Macroeconomics''', '''AP Macro''', '''APMa''', or simply '''Macro''') is an [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] [[macroeconomics]] course and exam offered by the [[College Board]].

Study begins with fundamental economic concepts such as [[scarcity]], [[opportunity costs]], [[Production–possibility frontier|production possibilities]], specialization, [[comparative advantage]], [[Demand (economics)|demand]], [[Supply (economics)|supply]], and [[price determination]].

Major topics include measurement of economic performance, national income and price determination, fiscal and [[monetary policy]], and international economics and growth. AP Macroeconomics is frequently taught in conjunction with (and, in some cases, in the same year as) [[AP Microeconomics]], although more students take the former.

==Criticism==
Tawni Ferrarini, James Gwartney, and John Morton have argued that the examination does not adequately cover recent advances in the field, writing that "[t]he AP macroeconomics exam and resources largely reflect the simplistic Keynesian view from the 1960s and 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;Tawni H. Ferrarini, James D. Gwartney, and John S. Morton, "Advanced Placement Economics: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(1) (January 2011), 67.

==Description==
It was first discovered in 1993 from coastal isolates of coral in the [[Republic of Palau]] in the west [[Pacific Ocean]] and announced in 1996.&lt;ref name=n96&gt;{{cite journal|author=H.

==Genome==
Its genome was sequenced in 2008, revealing a large bacterial genome of 8.3 Mb with nine plasmids.&lt;ref name=genome/&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Acaryochloris'' is a combination of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''a'' (ἄν)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|an|ἄν|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "without", ''caryo'' (κάρυον)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|karuon|κάρυον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "nut" (here intended as "nucleus") and ''chloros'' (χλωρός)&lt;ref name=chloro&gt;{{LSJ|xlwros|χλωρός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning green;&lt;ref&gt;{{lpsn|gender.html|Gender of suffices}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore it is [[new Latin]] ''Acaryochloris'' meaning "without nucleus green".&lt;ref name=desc/&gt;
The specific epithet ''marina'' is [[Latin]] meaning "marine".&lt;ref name=desc/&gt;

==Classification==
{{see also|Bacterial taxonomy}}
{{main|Cyanobacteria}}
Due to historical reason, the classification of the Cyanobacteria is problematic and many are not validly published, meaning they have not yet been placed into the classification framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{lpsn|classifcyano.html|Classification of Cyanobacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these not officially recognised species is ''Acaryochloris marina'', which technically should be written as "Acaryochloris marina" in official writings, but in effect this is rarely done (cf.&lt;ref name=genome/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kühl | first1 = M. | last2 = Chen | first2 = M. | last3 = Ralph | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Schreiber | first4 = U. | last5 = Larkum | first5 = A. W. D. | title = Ecology:  A niche for cyanobacteria containing chlorophyll d | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7028 | pages = 820–820 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1038/433820a | pmid=15729331}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Exoplanet habitability==
Scientists including [[NASA]]'s Nancy Kiang have proposed that the existence of ''Acaryochloris marina'' suggests that organisms that use chlorophyll d, rather than chlorophyll a, may be able to perform oxygenic photosynthesis on [[exoplanets]] orbiting [[red dwarf stars]] (which emit much less light than the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gronstal |first=Aaron |date=February 2012 |title=Far-Out Photosynthesis |url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/201202_mielke/ |newspaper=News &amp; Features |location= |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mielke, S.P.|author2=N.Y. Kiang|author3=R.E. Blankenship|author4=M.R. Gunner|author5=D. Mauzerall|last-author-amp=yes|title=Efficiency of photosynthesis in a Chl d-utilizing cyanobacterium is comparable to or higher than that in Chl a-utilizing oxygenic species|journal= BBA − Bioenergetics |volume=1807|year=2011|pages=1231–1236|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.06.007|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because about 70% of the stars in the [[Milky Way galaxy]] are red dwarfs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stardate.org/astro-guide/btss/stars/colorful_dwarfs |title=Colorful Dwarfs |author =&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=StarDate |publisher=The University of Texas McDonald Observatory |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of ''A. marina'' implies that oxygenic photosynthesis may be occurring on far more exoplanets than [[Astrobiology|astrobiologists]] initially thought possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7612">As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a number of '''archaeological sub-disciplines''' typically characterised by a focus on a specific method or type of material, geographical or chronological focus, or other thematic concern.

==By civilization==
Certain civilizations have attracted so much attention that their study has been specifically named. These sub-disciplines include ''[[Assyriology]]'' ([[Mesopotamia]]), ''[[Classical archaeology]]'' ([[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]), ''[[Etruscology]]'' ([[Etruria]]), and ''[[Egyptology]]'' ([[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]).

==By historicity==
Another main division of archaeology distinguishes:

* ''[[historical archaeology]]'', which examines civilizations that left behind written records; and 
* ''[[prehistoric archaeology]]'', which concerns itself with societies that did not have [[writing systems]]. However, the term is generally valid only in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] where literate societies emerged without colonial influence. In areas where literacy arrived relatively late, it is more convenient to use other terms to divide up the archaeological record.

In areas of semi-literacy the term
*''[[protohistoric archaeology]]'' can be adopted to cover the study of societies with very limited written records. One example of a protohistoric site is [[Fort Ross]] on the northern [[California]] coast, which included settlements of literate [[Russia]]ns and non-literate [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives|Alaska natives]].
*''[[Ethnoarchaeology]]'' is the study of modern societies resembling extinct ones of archaeological interest, for archaeological purposes. It is often difficult to infer solid conclusions about the structure and values of ancient societies from their material remains, not only because objects are mute and say little about those who crafted and used them, but also because not all objects survive to be uncovered by scholars of a later age. Ethnoarchaeology seeks to determine, for instance, what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in [[midden]]s or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used.
*''[[Taphonomy]]'' is the study of how objects decay and degrade over time. This information is critical to the interpretation of [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s and other objects, so that the work of ancient people can be differentiated from the later work of living creatures and elemental forces.

==By time period==
A selective list of sub-disciplines distinguished by time-period or region of study might include:

*[[African archaeology]], [[Archaeology of the Americas]], [[Australian archaeology]], [[European archaeology]]: focuses on archaeologic study concerning the location of the findings. 
*[[Industrial archaeology]] focuses on the preservation of material relics of the [[Industrial Revolution]] or the archaeology of work.
*[[Near Eastern archaeology]] (sometimes known as Middle Eastern archaeology). See also [[Biblical archaeology]], which applies the results of Near Eastern archaeology to the study of the [[Bible]].
*[[Medieval archaeology]] is the study of post-Roman European archaeology until the sixteenth century.
*[[Post-medieval archaeology]] is the study of material culture in Europe from the 16th century onwards.
*[[Contemporary archaeology|Modern archaeology]] is the study of modern society using archaeological methods, e.g. the [[Tucson Garbage Project]].
*[[Historical archaeology]] is the study of the past using both material evidence (i.e. artifacts and their contexts) and documentary evidence (including maps, photographs and film). Usually this is associated with the Americas.
*[[Classical archaeology]] is the study of the past using both material evidence (i.e. artifacts and their contexts) and documentary evidence (including maps, literature of the time, other primary sources, etc.). Classical archaeology specifically pertains to the Mediterranean area and the archaeology of Greece and its surrounding areas.

==Other sub-disciplines==
The following is a list of other sub-disciplines. Some of these are not areas of study in their own right, and are only methods to be used in larger projects.

*[[Aerial archaeology]] - studying sites from air photos, especially by identifying [[cropmarks]]
* [[Anthracology]], the study of charcoal remains&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:kilnerfig.jpg|thumb|200px|Representation of a human aura, after a diagram by [[Walter John Kilner]] (1847–1920).]]

An '''aura''' or '''human energy field''' is, according to [[New Age]] beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a [[subtle body]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=55}} [[Psychics]] and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura.{{sfn|Hines|2002|p=427}}

In New Age [[alternative medicine]], the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affect the health of a client, and is often understood to comprise centers of vital force called [[chakra]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} Such claims are not supported by [[scientific evidence]] and are [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=362–69}} When tested under [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]], the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheiber|first1=Béla|last2=Selby|first2=Carla|title=Therapeutic Touch|date=2000|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=1573928046|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], ''aura'' means wind, breeze or breath. It was used in [[Middle English]] to mean "gentle breeze". By the end of the 19th century, the word was used in some spiritualist circles to describe a speculated subtle emanation around the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=aura |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marques|first1=A.|title=The Human Aura: A Study|publisher=Office of Mercury|pages=1–2 and preface|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jj9DAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Charles Webster Leadbeater.019.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] is credited with developing and popularizing the concept of auras.]]
The concept of auras was first popularized by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], a former priest of the Church of England and a member of the mystic [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=686}} Leadbeater had studied [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in India, and believed he had the capacity to use his clairvoyant powers to make scientific investigations.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=193}} He claimed that he had discovered that most men come from Mars but the more advanced men come from the Moon, and that [[hydrogen]] atoms are made of six bodies contained in an egg-like form.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=220–22}} In his book ''Man Visible and Invisible'' published in 1903, Leadbeater illustrated the aura of man at various stages of his moral evolution, from the "savage" to the [[saint]].{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=235}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leadbeater|first1=Charles Webster|title=Man Visible and Invisible: Examples of Different Types of Men as Seen by Means of Trained Clairvoyance|date=2012|publisher=New Theosophical Press|isbn=9781471747038|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMTJAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Leadbeater introduced the modern conception of auras by incorporating the [[Tantra|Tantric]] notion of [[chakra]]s in his book ''The Inner Life''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=183}} But Leadbeater didn’t simply present the Tantric beliefs to the West, he reconstructed and reinterpreted them by mixing them with his own ideas, without acknowledging the sources of these innovations. Some of Leadbeater’s innovations are describing chakras as energy vortexes, and associating each of them with a gland, an organ and other body parts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=184–87}}

In the following years, Leadbeater’s ideas on the aura and chakras where adopted and reinterpreted by other Theosophists such as [[Rudolf Steiner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Rudolf|last2=Creeger|first2=Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos|date=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, New York|isbn=0880103736|page=159|edition=3rd|url=https://steiner.presswarehouse.com/sites/steiner/research/archive/theosophy/theosophy.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edgar Cayce]], but his occult anatomy remained of minor interest within the esoteric counterculture until the 1980s, when it was picked up by the New Age movement.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=187}}

In 1977, American esotericist [[Christopher Hills]] published the book ''Nuclear Evolution: The Rainbow Body'', which presented a modified version of Leadbeater’s occult anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hills|first1=Christopher|title=Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body|date=1977|publisher=University of the Trees Press|location=Boulder Creek, California|isbn=9780916438098|page=36|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bXRWAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Leadbeater had drawn each chakras with intricately detailed shapes and multiple colors, Hills presented them as a sequence of centers, each one being associated with a color of the rainbow. Most of the subsequent New Age writers will base their representations of the aura on Hill’s interpretation of Leadbeater’s ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=188}} Chakras became a part of mainstream esoteric speculations in the 1980s and 1990s. Many New Age techniques that aim to clear blockages of the chakras were developed during those years, such as [[crystal healing]] and aura-soma.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=92}} Chakras were, by the late 1990s, less connected with their theosophical  and Hinduist root, and more infused with New Age ideas. A variety of New Age books proposed different links between each chakras and colors, personality traits, illnesses, Christian sacraments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myss|first1=Caroline|title=Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing|date=1997|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=9780609800140|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NmwwRCv52SAC|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=189}} Various type of holistic healing within the New Age movement claim to use aura reading techniques, such as [[bioenergetic analysis]], [[energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and [[energy medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=Barbara Ann|title=Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field|date=1988|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553345397|pages=109–10|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?output=html_text&amp;id=M3dOAgz05bQC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Character+structure |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous attempts to capture an energy field around the human body, going as far back as photographs by a French army officer in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baraduc|first1=Hippolyte|title=L'ame humaine: ses mouvements, ses lumières et l'iconographie de l'invisible fluidique|date=1896|publisher=G. Carré|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tD8wAAAAYAAJ|page=61|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supernatural interpretations of these images have often been the result of a lack of understanding of the simple natural phenomena behind them, such as heat emanating from a human body producing aura-like images under [[infrared photography]].&lt;ref name=Nickell&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Nickell |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aura_photography_a_candid_shot/ |title=Aura Photography: A Candid Shot  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baraducforcevital.tif|thumb|left|150px|Picture by Hippolyte Baraduc published in 1896, purported to show a "vital force" around a child.]]
In 1939, [[Semyon Davidovich Kirlian]] discovered that by placing an object or body part directly on photographic paper, and then passing a high voltage across the object, he would obtain the image of a glowing contour surrounding the object. This process became known as [[Kirlian photography]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=240–43}} Some parapsychologists, such as [[Thelma Moss]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], have proposed that these images show levels of psychic powers and bioenergies. However, studies have found that the Kirlian effect is caused by the presence of moisture on the object being photographed. Electricity produces an area of gas ionization around the object if it is moist, which is the case for living things. This causes an alternation of the electric charge pattern on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pehek|first1=JO|last2=Kyler|first2=HJ|last3=Faust|first3=DL|title=Image modulation in corona discharge photography |journal=Science |date=15 October 1976|volume=194|issue=4262|pages=263–70|pmid=968480}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rigorous experimentations, no mysterious process has been discovered in relation to the Kirlian photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=edited by Kendrick|title=The Hundredth monkey and other paradigms of the paranormal : a Skeptical inquirer collection|date=1991|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=0879756551|pages=209–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=427–28}}

More recent attempts at capturing auras include the Aura Imaging cameras and software introduced by Guy Coggins in 1992. Coggins claims that his software uses [[biofeedback]] data to color the picture of the subject. The technique has failed to yield reproducible results.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

==Tests==
[[File:Aura_testing.jpg|thumb|right|An aura reader tested in a [[Scientific control|controlled experiment]] at the [[Observatoire Zététique]], May 2004]]

Tests of psychic abilities to observe alleged aura emanations have repeatedly been met with failure.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

One test involved placing people in a dark room and asking the psychic to state how many auras she could observe. Only chance results were obtained.&lt;ref name="Loftin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftin|first1=Robert W.|title=Auras: Searching for the Light|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1990|volume=24|pages=403–09|publisher=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of auras has occasionally been tested on television. One test involved an ''aura reader'' standing on one side of a room with an opaque partition separating her from a number of slots which might contain either actual people or mannequins. The aura reader failed to identify the slots containing people, incorrectly stating that all contained people.&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/auras.html |title= Auras|accessdate=2006-12-15|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205221945/http://skepdic.com/auras.html| archivedate= 5 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another televised test another aura reader was placed before a partition where five people were standing. He claimed that he could see their auras from behind the partition. As each person moved out, the reader was asked to identify where that person was standing behind the slot. He identified 2 out of 5 correctly.&lt;ref name=Randi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZeQGld5QBU |title=James Randi tests an aura reader|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to prove the existence of auras scientifically have repeatedly met with failure; for example people are unable to see auras in complete darkness, and auras have never been successfully used to identify people when their identifying features are otherwise obscured in controlled tests.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loftin/&gt;&lt;ref name=skepdic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Randi/&gt; A 1999 study concluded that conventional sensory cues such as radiated body heat might be mistaken for evidence of a metaphysical phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Bernhardt/publication/230683042_Perception_of_Conventional_Sensory_Cues_as_an_Alternative_to_the_Postulated'Human_Energy_Field'of_Therapeutic_Touch/links/55eda87108aedecb68fb074e.pdf |title=Perception of Conventional Sensory Cues as an Alternative to the Postulated'Human Energy Field'of Therapeutic Touch (PDF Download Available) |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine.|year=1999|issue=Fall/Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==

Bridgette Perez in a review for the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has written "perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations might promote belief in auras... Psychological factors, including absorption, fantasy proneness, vividness of visual imagery, and after-images, might also be responsible for the phenomena of the aura."&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bridgette M. Perez |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_aura_a_brief_review/ |title=The Aura: A Brief Review  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in laboratory conditions have demonstrated that the aura is best explained as a visual illusion known as an [[afterimage]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Harris, D. F. (1932). ''A psycho physiological explanation of the so-called human "aura"''.  British Journal of Medical Psychology 12: 174–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale, A., Anderson, D. &amp; Wyman, L. (1978).  ''Perceptual Aura: Not Spirit but Afterimage and Border Contrast Effects''.  ''[[Perceptual and Motor Skills]]'' 47: 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologists contend that people may perceive auras because of effects within the brain: [[epilepsy]], [[migraine]]s, or the influence of [[psychedelic drugs]] such as [[LSD]].&lt;ref name="ASID"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Donna L|last2=Daroff|first2=Robert B|last3=Ducros|first3=Anne|last4=Newman|first4=Nancy J|last5=Biousse|first5=Valérie|title=Most Cases Labeled as "Retinal Migraine" Are Not Migraine|journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=March 2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–8|doi=10.1097/WNO.0b013e3180335222|url=http://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2007&amp;issue=03000&amp;article=00002&amp;type=abstract|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015956/http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Familial occipitotemporal lobe epilepsy and migraine with visual aura |publisher=Neurology.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Andrew Neher has written that "there is no good evidence to support the notion that auras are, in any way, psychic in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Andrew|title=The Psychology of Transcendence|date=1990|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486261670|pages=186–88|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that auras may be the result of [[synaesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/auras.html |title=auras – The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=Skepdic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2012 study discovered no link between auras and synaesthesia, concluding "the discrepancies found suggest that both phenomena are phenomenologically and behaviourally dissimilar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milán|first1=E.G.|last2=Iborra|first2=O.|last3=Hochel|first3=M.|last4=Rodríguez Artacho|first4=M.A.|last5=Delgado-Pastor|first5=L.C.|last6=Salazar|first6=E.|last7=González-Hernández|first7=A.|title=Auras in Mysticism and Synaesthesia: A Comparison|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=March 2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=258–68|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical neurologist [[Steven Novella]] has written "Given the weight of the evidence it seems that the connection between auras and synaesthesia is speculative and based on superficial similarities that are likely coincidental."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella |first=Steven |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/05/07/is-aura-reading-synaesthesia-probably-not/ |title=Is Aura Reading Synaesthesia? Probably Not |publisher=Skepticblog |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes may include disorders within the [[visual system]] provoking optical effects.

==In popular culture==
* The book ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'', written by Cyril Henry Hoskin under the pseudonym [[Lobsang Rampa]], claims that Tibetan monks opened the spiritual third eye using [[trepanation]] in order to accelerate the development of clairvoyance and allow to see the aura. It also includes body gazing techniques purported to help achieve aura visualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampa|first1=Lobsang|title=The Third Eye|date=1988|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=9780345340382|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered to be a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yapp|first1=Nick|title=Hoaxers and Their Victims|date=1993|publisher=Parkwest|location=London|isbn=9780860517818|pages=140–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodin|first1=Thierry|title=Imagining Tibet: Perceptions, Projections, and Fantasies|date=2001|publisher=Wisdom Publishing|location=Boston|isbn=9780861711918|pages=196–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The osteoclasts are multi-nucleated [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that contain numerous [[mitochondria]] and [[lysosome]]s.  These are the cells responsible for the resorption of bone. Osteoclasts are generally present on the outer layer of bone, just beneath the [[periosteum]]. Attachment of the osteoclast to the [[osteon]] begins the process. The osteoclast then induces an infolding of its cell membrane and secretes [[collagenase]] and other enzymes important in the resorption process. High levels of calcium, [[magnesium]], [[phosphate]] and products of [[collagen]] will be released into the extracellular fluid as the osteoclasts tunnel into the mineralized bone. Osteoclasts are prominent in the tissue destruction found in [[psoriatic arthritis]] and rheumatological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Altered Bone Remodeling in Psoriatic Arthritis|journal = Current Rheumatology Reports|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1523-3774|pmc = 2656567|pmid = 18662512|pages = 311–317|volume = 10|issue = 4|first = Kofi A.|last = Mensah|first2 = Edward M.|last2 = Schwarz|first3 = Christopher T.|last3 = Ritchlin|doi=10.1007/s11926-008-0050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions that result in a decrease in bone mass can either be caused by an increase in resorption or by a decrease in ossification. During childhood, bone formation exceeds resorption. As the aging process occurs, resorption exceeds formation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bone resorption rates are much higher in post-menopausal older women due to estrogen deficiency related with menopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disorders of Bone Remodeling|journal = Annual Review of Pathology|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 1553-4006|pmc = 3571087|pmid = 20936937|pages = 121–145|volume = 6|doi = 10.1146/annurev-pathol-011110-130203|first = Xu|last = Feng|first2 = Jay M.|last2 = McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common treatments include drugs that increase bone mineral density.

==Regulation==
Bone resorption is highly stimulated or inhibited by signals from other parts of the body, depending on the demand for calcium.

Calcium-sensing membrane receptors in the [[parathyroid gland]] monitor calcium levels in the extracellular fluid. Low levels of calcium stimulates the release of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) from [[Parathyroid chief cell|chief cells]] of the [[parathyroid gland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In addition to its effects on kidney and intestine, PTH increases the number and activity of osteoclasts. The increase in activity of already existing osteoclasts is the initial effect of PTH, and begins in minutes and increases over a few hours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Continued elevation of PTH levels increases the abundance of osteoclasts.  This leads to a greater resorption of calcium and phosphate ions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

High levels of calcium in the blood, on the other hand, leads to decreased PTH release from the parathyroid gland, decreasing the number and activity of osteoclasts, resulting in less bone resorption.  [[Vitamin D]] increases absorption of calcium and phosphate in the intestinal tract, leading to elevated levels of plasma calcium,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and thus lower bone resorption.

[[Calcitriol]] (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is the active form of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium; Ross AC, Taylor CL, Yaktine AL, et al., editors.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56061/&lt;/ref&gt; It has numerous functions involved in blood calcium levels.  Recent research indicates that calcitriol leads to a reduction in osteoclast formation, and bone resorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikuta J, Kawamura S, Okiji F, Shirazaki M, Sakai S, Saito H, Ishii M | date = Apr 2013 | title = Sphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated osteoclast precursor monocyte migration is a critical point of control in antibone-resorptive action of active vitamin D. | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 17| pages = 7009–13 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1218799110 | pmid = 23569273 | pmc = 3637769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamamoto Y, Yoshizawa T, Fukuda T, Shirode-Fukuda Y, Yu T, Sekine K, Sato T, Kawano H, Aihara K, Nakamichi Y, Watanabe T, Shindo M, Inoue K, Inoue E, Tsuji N, Hoshino M, Karsenty G, Metzger D, Chambon P, Kato S, Imai Y | date = Mar 2013 | title = Vitamin D receptor in osteoblasts is a negative regulator of bone mass control | url = | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 154 | issue = 3| pages = 1008–20 | doi = 10.1210/en.2012-1542 | pmid = 23389957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that an increase in vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intake should lead to a decrease in bone resorption — it has been shown that oral administration of vitamin D does not linearly correlate to increased serum levels of [[calcifediol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 69059 | volume=1 | issue=8026 | title=Comparison of oral 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, vitamin D, and ultraviolet light as determinants of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D. | date=Jun 1977 | journal=The Lancet | pages=1341–3 |vauthors=Stamp TC, Haddad JG, Twigg CA | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(77)92553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the precursor to calcitriol.

[[Calcitonin]] is a hormone secreted by the [[thyroid]] in humans. Calcitonin decreases osteoclast activity, and decreases the formation of new osteoclasts, resulting in decreased resorption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Calcitonin has a greater effect in young children than in adults, and plays a smaller role in bone remodeling than PTH.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In some cases where bone resorption outpaces ossification, the bone is broken down much faster than it can be renewed. The bone becomes more porous and fragile, exposing people to the risk of fractures. Depending on where in the body bone resorption occurs, additional problems like tooth loss can arise. This can be caused by conditions such as [[hypoparathyroidism]] and [[hypovitaminosis D]] or even decreased hormonal production in the elderly.  Some diseases with symptoms of decreased bone density are [[osteoporosis]], and [[rickets]].

Some people who experience increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation are [[astronauts]]. Due to the condition of being in a [[zero-gravity]] environment, astronauts do not need to work their musculoskeletal system as hard as when on [[earth]]. Ossification decreases due to a lack of stress, while resorption  increases, leading to a net decrease in bone density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iwamoto J, Takeda T, Sato Y | date = Jun 2005 | title = Interventions to prevent bone loss in astronauts during space flight | url = | journal = The Keio Journal of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 55–9 | pmid = 16077253 | doi=10.2302/kjm.54.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alcoholism ==
The effects of alcohol on [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) are well-known and well-studied in animal and human populations. Through direct and indirect pathways, prolonged ethanol exposure increases fracture risk by decreasing bone mineral density and promoting osteoporosis. Indirect effects of alcohol abuse occur via growth hormone, sex steroids, and oxidative stress.

Growth hormone is an important regulator of bone growth and remodeling in adults, and it acts via insulin-like growth factor I ([[IGF1]]) to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alcohol alters whole body composition, inhibits bone formation, and increases bone marrow adiposity in rats|journal = Osteoporosis International |date = 2009-09-01|issn = 1433-2965|pmid = 19238309|pages = 1529–1538|volume = 20|issue = 9|doi = 10.1007/s00198-009-0836-y|first = G.

T.|last7 = Iwaniec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic alcoholism decreases the levels of IGF1, which suppresses the ability of GH to increase bone mineral density.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Increasing alcohol consumption is linked with decreasing testosterone and serum estradiol levels, which in turn lead to the activation of [[RANK]] (a TNF receptor) protein that promote osteoclast formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alcohol-induced disruption of endocrine signaling|journal = Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0145-6008|pmid = 17559547|pages = 1269–1285|volume = 31|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00436.x|first = Martin J.

J.|last5 = Ronis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct effects of chronic alcoholism are apparent in osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes. Ethanol suppresses the activity and differentiation of osteoblasts.

At the same time, it has a direct effect on osteoclast activity. This results in an increased bone resorption rate and a decreased bone mineral density due to increased pit numbers and pit areas in the bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The amazing osteocyte|journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date = 2011-02-01|issn = 1523-4681|pmc = 3179345|pmid = 21254230|pages = 229–238|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/jbmr.320|first = Lynda F.|last = Bonewald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spatial distribution of Bax and Bcl-2 in osteocytes after bone fatigue: complementary roles in bone remodeling regulation?|journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date = 2002-05-01|issn = 0884-0431|pmid = 12009022|pages = 907–914|volume = 17|issue = 5|doi = 10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.5.907|first = Olivier|last = Verborgt|first2 = Nadine A.|last2 = Tatton|first3 = Robert J.|last3 = Majeska|first4 = Mitchell B.|last4 = Schaffler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that viable osteocytes (another type of bone cell) may prevent osteoclastogenesis, whereas apoptotic osteocytes tend to induce osteoclast stimulation.

In [[biology]], the '''canopy''' is the aboveground portion of a [[plant community]] or [[crop]], formed by the collection of individual [[Crown (botany)|plant crowns]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G.S., and J.M. Norman. 1990. The description and measurement of plant canopy structure. pp. 1-19 In: Russell, G., B. Marshall, and P.G. Jarvis (editors). ''Plant Canopies: Their Growth, Form and Function''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, M.W. 2000. What's ''up''? A critical look at the basic terms of canopy biology.

Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|1-4051-0859-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0859-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[forest ecology]], canopy also refers to the upper layer or [[habitat]] zone, formed by mature [[Crown (botany)|tree crowns]] and including other biological organisms ([[epiphytes]], [[lianas]], [[Arboreal|arboreal animals]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Parker, G.G. 1995. Structure and microclimate of forest canopies. pp. 73-106 In: Lowman, M.D. and N.M. Nadkarni (editors). ''Forest Canopies''. Academic Press, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term canopy is used to refer to the extent of the outer layer of leaves of an individual [[tree]] or group of trees.{{cn|date=October 2015}} [[Shade tree]]s normally have a dense canopy that blocks light from lower growing plants.

== Canopy structure ==
[[File:Monkey Ladder Vine canopy.jpg|thumb|A [[Entada gigas|Monkey Ladder Vine]] canopy over a road]]
Canopy structure is the organization or spatial arrangement (three-dimensional geometry) of a plant canopy. [[Leaf Area Index]] (LAI), leaf area per unit ground area, is a key measure used to understand and compare plant canopies. It is also taller than the understory layer.

== Canopy layer of forests ==

Dominant and co-dominant canopy trees form the uneven canopy layer.  Canopy trees are able to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] relatively rapidly due to abundant light, so it supports the majority of primary productivity in forests.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The canopy layer provides protection from strong winds and storms, while also intercepting sunlight and precipitation, leading to a relatively sparsely vegetated [[understory]] layer.

Forest canopies are home to unique flora and fauna not found in other layers of forests.  The highest terrestrial [[biodiversity]] resides in the canopy of [[tropical rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, M.D. and M.W. Moffett. 1993. The ecology of tropical rain forest canopies. ''Trees'' 8:104-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many rainforest animals have evolved to live solely in the canopy, and never touch the ground.

The canopy of a [[rainforest]] is typically about 10m thick, and intercepts around 95% of sunlight.&lt;ref name=Garden.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Light in the Rain Forest|url=http://assoc.garden.org/courseweb/course1/week4/page5a.htm|website=garden.org|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The canopy is below the [[Rainforest#Layers|emergent layer]], a sparse layer of very tall trees, typically one or two per [[hectare]].  With an abundance of water and a near ideal temperature in rainforests, light and nutrients are two factors that limit tree growth from the understory to the canopy.

In the [[permaculture]] and [[forest gardening]] community, the canopy is the highest of seven layers.

The normal way that a [[computer]] functions manually is through a person that controls the computer. An individual generates computer actions with the use of either a [[computer mouse]] or [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]].  However the latest [[technology]] and computer innovation might allow a computer to not only detect [[body language]] but also respond to it. Modern devices are being experimented with, that may potentially allow that computer related device to [[gesture recognition|respond to and understand an individual's hand gesture]], specific movement or [[facial expression]].

==Relating to computer science==

Being able to read body language is an example of [[artificial intelligence]].  As stated by the man who came up with the term, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], artificial intelligence is “the [[science]] and [[engineering]] of making intelligent machines”.  In relation to computers and body language, research is being done with the use of [[mathematics]] in order to teach computers to interpret human movements, hand gestures and even facial expressions. This is different from the normal way people generally communicate with computers for example with the click of the mouse, keyboard, or any [[physical contact]] in general between the user and the computer.

==Background information on research being done==

===MIAUCE and Chaabane Djeraba===

This type of research is being done by a group of European researchers and other scientists as well. There is also a project called [[MIAUCE]]  (Multimodal interactions analysis and exploration of users within a Controlled Environment). This project has scientists working on making this sort of new advance in [[computer technology]] a reality. [[Chaabane Djeraba]], the project coordinator stated "The motivation of the project is to put humans in the loop of interaction between the computer and their environment."

===Aims and motives of this project===

Researchers and scientists are trying to use their [[innovation]] and ideas in a way that can help them apply these modern technological devices to the daily needs of businesses and places people visit such as the [[Shopping mall|mall]] or an [[airport]]. The project coordinator of MIAUCE stated "We would like to have a form of ambient intelligence where computers are completely hidden…this means a [[multimodal interface]] so people can interact with their environment. The computer sees their behavior and then extracts information useful for the user.” This specific research group has developed a couple of different real life models of computer technology that will use body language as a means of [[communication]] and way to function.

==Prototypes created by scientists and researchers==

===General personal use===

Scientists and researchers experimented with people and computers. A certain number of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s were gathered to test out if computers could function by interpreting what the individual was physically doing without actually having to touch the computer itself. In this specific experiment researchers asked the volunteers to try to control the computer using nothing but their [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]. The science behind this involves the use of [[electrooculography]], also referred to as EOG. This is basically a technique used to examine someones eye movements. This is then made into a [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] on the computer screen for the individual, in this case the volunteers. The volunteers were then shown a display on the [[computer screen]] of the letters in the alphabet. With their eye movements, the volunteers were now able to use this cursor on the computer screen and perform tasks such as typing words.

===Security purposes in busy and overcrowded areas===

An example of the applied version of this computer technology is controlling the [[safety]] of people in heavily populated areas such as [[Bus station|bus terminals]], airports or even [[shopping complex]]es. To monitor such places you definitely need a [[security camera]] at the site itself. However, researchers are trying to make use of computers to manage such areas aside from just [[video camera]]s alone. Basically a [[video stream]] is evaluated and examined which involves a bit of math, for example a description of shapes, the flow of people and their movements. Then that data is analyzed in terms of [[crowd density]], their pace and the direction in which they are moving.  At last is when the use of the computer comes in. The computer aids in evaluating any type of activity in these types of crowded areas that seems fairly irregular. The information that the computer gives will help provide an alert or warning that something is not going the way it should. In the example of a mall, this sort of computer will provide an alert to something like an individual that has fallen from an [[escalator]].

===Marketing purposes===

Helping businesses and local stores analyze how their customers behave while [[shopping]] is another example of how this type of computer technology will be implemented. The scientists and researchers that are creating a computer that runs on this type of technology are making use of the idea of body language being used to work with computers for reasons relating to [[marketing]] purposes. This involves monitoring how many people there are in the street next to that certain shop as well as the use of a [[heat map generator]]. The heat map generator will basically allow the manager or staff at a store to observe how exactly people are moving. It will also allow staff workers to see what things in the store are attracting the attention of the customers the most.

==Controversy and privacy concerns==

Although this sort of technology does seem helpful and practical, certain issues and concerns arise among everyday people who are doubtful about how such computers are going to be used.  Some people debate on the issue of [[security]] and [[privacy]] with such computer technologies. With this new technology comes a bit of concern with the public. Therefore, researchers and scientists have to take into perspective that such computer devices that can read body language have to give people a warning of that kind of a capability. So when building and putting into effect this type of computer, so to say as a means of security, there has to be concern over whether or not to take into consideration if this kind of computer technology would be accepted by the [[general public]]. That includes people who are possibly going to be observed and monitored by a kind of computer that analyzes their body movements and gestures when they are doing something as simple as shopping at a mall or traveling through airports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21361">'''Darcy's law''' is an equation that describes the flow of a [[fluid]] through a [[porous]] medium. The law was formulated by [[Henry Darcy]] based on the results of experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darcy|first=H.|date=1856|title=Les fontaines publiques de la ville de Dijon|publisher=Dalmont|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the flow of [[water]] through beds of [[sand]], forming the basis of [[hydrogeology]], a branch of [[earth science]]s.

== Background ==
Darcy's law was determined experimentally by Darcy. It has since been derived from the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] via [[Homogenization (mathematics)|homogenization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Whitaker |first = S. |title = Flow in porous media I: A theoretical derivation of Darcy's law |journal = Transport in Porous Media |volume = 1 |pages = 3–25 |doi = 10.1007/BF01036523 |year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is analogous to [[Fourier's law]] in the field of [[heat conduction]], [[Ohm's law]] in the field of [[electrical networks]], or [[Fick's law]] in [[diffusion]] theory.

One application of Darcy's law is to analyze water flow through an [[aquifer]]; Darcy's law along with the equation of [[conservation of mass]] are equivalent to the [[groundwater flow equation]], one of the basic relationships of [[hydrogeology]].

[[Morris Muskat]] first{{Citation needed|reason=Adrian E. Scheidegger (The physics of flow through porous media) says that the notion of permeability was introduced by P.G.Nutting|date=October 2018}} refined Darcy's equation for single phase flow by including viscosity in the single (fluid) phase equation of Darcy, and this change made it suitable for the petroleum industry. Based on experimental results worked out by his colleagues Wyckoff and Botset, Muskat and Meres also generalized Darcy's law to cover multiphase flow of water, oil and gas in the porous medium of a petroleum reservoir. The generalized multiphase flow equations by Muskat and others provide the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.

== Description ==
[[Image:Darcy's Law.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram showing definitions and directions for Darcy's law.]]

Darcy's law, as refined by [[Morris Muskat]], in the absence of [[Gravity |gravitational forces]], is a simple proportional relationship between the instantaneous flow rate through a porous medium of permeability &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the [[viscosity]] of the fluid and the pressure drop over a given distance in a homogeneously permeable medium &lt;ref&gt; {{ cite journal|title= Evaporation limited radial capillary penetration in porous media | journal= Langmuir | year=2016 | volume=32 |issue=38 | pages= 9899–9904|url=http://drgan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/040_Langmuir_2016.pdf | doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02404

: &lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{k A \left(p_\mathrm{b} - p_\mathrm{a}\right)}{\mu L}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation, for single phase (fluid) flow, is the [[defining equation (physics)|defining equation]] &lt;ref&gt;Amin F. Zarandi, Krishna M. Pillai, Adam S. Kimmel, "Spontaneous imbibition of liquids in glass-fiber wicks. Part I: Usefulness of a sharp-front approach". American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE Journal. 63: 294–305, 2018. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aic.15965/full DOI:10.1002/aic.15965] &lt;/ref&gt;for absolute permeability (single phase permeability).
The total discharge, {{mvar|Q}} (units of volume per time, e.g., m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) is equal to the product of the intrinsic [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] of the medium, 
{{mvar|k}} (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the cross-sectional area to flow,
{{mvar|A}} (units of area, e.g., m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),  and the total pressure drop {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} (pascals), all divided by the [[viscosity]], 
{{mvar|μ}} (Pa·s) and the length over which the pressure drop is taking place {{mvar|L}} (m).

The negative sign is needed because fluid flows from high pressure to low pressure.  Note that the [[Hydraulic head|elevation head]] must be taken into account if the inlet and outlet are at different elevations. If the change in pressure is negative (where {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}}), then the flow will be in the positive {{mvar|x}} direction. There have been several proposals for a [[constitutive equation]] for absolute permeability, and the most famous one is probably the [[Kozeny–Carman equation|Kozeny equation]] (also called [[Kozeny–Carman equation]]).

Dividing both sides of the equation by the area and using more general notation leads to

: &lt;math&gt;q=-\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla p\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|q}} is the flux (discharge per unit area, with units of length per time, m/s) and {{math|∇''p''}} is the [[pressure gradient]] vector (Pa/m).  This value of flux, often referred to as the Darcy flux or Darcy velocity, is not the velocity which the fluid traveling through the pores is experiencing.  The fluid velocity ({{mvar|v}}) is related to the Darcy flux ({{mvar|q}}) by the [[porosity]] ({{mvar|φ}}). The flux is divided by porosity to account for the fact that only a fraction of the total formation volume is available for flow. The fluid velocity would be the velocity a conservative tracer would experience if carried by the fluid through the formation.

: &lt;math&gt;v=\frac q \varphi \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Darcy's law is a simple mathematical statement which neatly summarizes several familiar properties that [[groundwater]] flowing in [[aquifer]]s exhibits, including:
* if there is no pressure gradient over a distance, no flow occurs (these are [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic]] conditions),
* if there is a pressure gradient, flow will occur from high pressure towards low pressure (opposite the direction of increasing gradient — hence the negative sign in Darcy's law),
* the greater the pressure gradient (through the same formation material), the greater the discharge rate, and
* the discharge rate of fluid will often be different — through different formation materials (or even through the same material, in a different direction) — even if the same pressure gradient exists in both cases.

A graphical illustration of the use of the steady-state [[groundwater flow equation]] (based on Darcy's law and the conservation of mass) is in the construction of [[flownet]]s, to quantify the amount of [[groundwater]] flowing under a [[dam]].

Darcy's law is only valid for slow, [[viscous]] flow; however, most groundwater flow cases fall in this category. Typically any flow with a [[Reynolds number]] less than one is clearly laminar, and it would be valid to apply Darcy's law.  Experimental tests have shown that flow regimes with Reynolds numbers up to 10 may still be Darcian, as in the case of groundwater flow.  The Reynolds number (a dimensionless parameter) for porous media flow is typically expressed as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho v d_{30}}{\mu}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] of [[water]] (units of mass per volume), {{mvar|v}} is the specific discharge (not the pore velocity — with units of length per time),  {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a representative grain diameter for the porous media (often taken as the 30% passing size from a [[grain size]] analysis using sieves — with units of length), and {{mvar|μ}} is the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

== Derivation ==
For stationary, creeping, incompressible flow, i.e. {{math|{{sfrac|''D''(''ρu&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')|''Dt''}} ≈ 0}}, the Navier–Stokes equation simplifies to the [[Stokes flow|Stokes equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \mu\nabla^2 u_i +\rho g_i -\partial_i p=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|μ}} is the viscosity, {{math|u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the velocity in the {{mvar|i}} direction, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the gravity component in the {{mvar|i}} direction and {{mvar|p}} is the pressure. Assuming the viscous resisting force is linear with the velocity we may write:

: &lt;math&gt;-\left(k_{ij}\right)^{-1} \mu\varphi u_j+\rho g_i-\partial_i p=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|φ}} is the [[porosity]], and {{mvar|k&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the second order permeability tensor. This gives the velocity in the {{mvar|n}} direction,

: &lt;math&gt;k_{ni}\left(k_{ij}\right)^{-1} u_j= \delta_{nj} u_j = u_n = -\frac{k_{ni}}{\varphi\mu} \left(\partial_i p-\rho g_i\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives Darcy's law for the volumetric flux density in the {{mvar|n}} direction,

: &lt;math&gt;q_n=-\frac{k_{ni}}{\mu}\left(\partial_i p -\rho g_i\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[isotropy|isotropic]] [[porous medium|porous media]] the off-diagonal elements in the permeability tensor are zero, {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}} and the diagonal elements are identical, {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''k''}}, and the common form is obtained

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{q}=-\frac{k}{\mu}\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla} p -\rho \boldsymbol{g}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation is a [[governing equation]] for single phase fluid flow in a porous medium.

== Additional forms of Darcy's law ==

=== Darcy's law in petroleum engineering ===
Another derivation of Darcy's law is used extensively in [[petroleum engineering]] to determine the flow through permeable media — the most simple of which is for a one-dimensional, homogeneous rock formation with a single fluid phase and constant fluid [[viscosity]].

: &lt;math&gt;Q= \frac {k A}{\mu} \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Q}} is the [[Volumetric flow rate|flowrate]] of the formation (in units of volume per unit time), {{mvar|k}} is the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the formation (typically in [[millidarcy]]s), {{mvar|A}} is the cross-sectional [[area]] of the formation, {{mvar|μ}} is the [[viscosity]] of the fluid (typically in units of [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]]). {{math|{{sfrac|∂''p''|∂''x''}}}} represents the pressure change per unit length of the formation.  This equation can also be solved for permeability and is used to measure it, forcing a fluid of known viscosity through a core of a known length and area, and measuring the pressure drop across the length of the core.

Almost all oil reservoirs have a water zone below the oil leg, and some have also a gas cap above the oil leg. When the reservoir pressure drops due to oil production, water flows into the oil zone from below, and gas flows into the oil zone from above (if the gas cap exists), and we get a simultaneous flow and immiscible mixing of all fluid phases in the oil zone. The operator of the oil field may also inject water (and/or gas) in order to improve oil production. The petroleum industry is therefore using a generalized Darcy equation for multiphase flow that was developed by [[Morris Muskat|Muskat]] et alios. Because Darcy's name is so widespread and strongly associated with flow in porous media, the multiphase equation is denoted [[Darcy's law for multiphase flow]] or generalized Darcy equation (or law) or simply Darcy's equation (or law) or simply flow equation if the context says that the text is discussing the multiphase equation of [[Morris Muskat|Muskat]] et alios. Multiphase flow in oil and gas reservoirs is a comprehensive topic, and one of many articles about this topic is [[Darcy's law for multiphase flow]].

=== Darcy–Forchheimer law ===
For flows in porous media with [[Reynolds number]]s greater than about 1 to 10, [[inertial]] effects can also become significant. Sometimes an [[inertial]] term is added to the Darcy's equation, known as [[Philipp Forchheimer|Forchheimer]] term. This term is able to account for the [[non-linear]] behavior of the pressure difference vs flow data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bejan|first=A.|date=1984|title=Convection Heat Transfer|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=-\frac{\mu}{k}q-\frac{\rho}{k_1}q^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the additional term {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is known as inertial permeability.

The flow in the middle of a sandstone reservoir is so slow that Forchheimer's equation is usually not needed, but the gas flow into a gas production well may be high enough to justify use of Forchheimer's equation. In this case the inflow performance calculations for the well, not the grid cell of the 3D model, is based on the Forchheimer equation. The effect of this is that an additional rate-dependent skin appears in the inflow performance formula.

Some carbonate reservoirs have lots of fractures, and Darcy's equation for multiphase flow is generalized in order to govern both flow in fractures and flow in the matrix (i.e. the traditional porous rock). The irregular surface of the fracture walls and high flow rate in the fractures, may justify use of Forchheimer's equation.

=== Darcy's law for gases in fine media (Knudsen diffusion or Klinkenberg effect) ===
For gas flow in small characteristic dimensions (e.g., very fine sand, nanoporous structures etc.), the particle-wall interactions become more frequent, giving rise to additional wall friction (Knudsen friction).  For a flow in this region, where both [[viscous]] and [[Knudsen diffusion|Knudsen]] friction are present, a new formulation needs to be used. [[Martin Knudsen|Knudsen]] presented a semi-empirical model for flow in transition regime based on his experiments on small capillaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=R. E.|last2=Williams|first2=R. J. J.|date=1980|title=Diffusion in Gases and Porous Media|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrigy2013JES&gt;{{cite journal |last = Carrigy |first = N. |last2=Pant |first2=L.

K. |last4=Secanell |first4=M. |title = Knudsen diffusivity and permeability of pemfc microporous coated gas diffusion layers for different polytetrafluoroethylene loadings |journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society |volume =160 |issue = 2 |pages=F81–89 |doi=10.1149/2.036302jes |year = 2013|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895693}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a porous medium, the Knudsen equation can be given as &lt;ref name=Carrigy2013JES /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N=-\left(\frac{k}{\mu}\frac{p_a+p_b}{2}+D_\mathrm{K}^\mathrm{eff}\right)\frac{1}{R_\mathrm{g}T}\frac{p_\mathrm{b}-p_\mathrm{a}}{L}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} is the molar flux, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the gas constant, {{mvar|T}} is the temperature, {{math|''D''{{su|b=K|p=eff}}}} is the effective Knudsen diffusivity of the porous media. The model can also be derived from the first-principle-based binary friction model (BFM).&lt;ref name=Pant2012JPS&gt;{{cite journal |last = Pant |first = L. M. |last2=Mitra |first2=S. K. |last3=Secanell |first3=M. |title = Absolute permeability and Knudsen diffusivity measurements in PEMFC gas diffusion layers and micro porous layers |journal = Journal of Power Sources |volume = 206 |pages = 153–160 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.099 |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kerkhof |first = P. |title = A modified Maxwell–Stefan model for transport through inert membranes: The binary friction model |journal = Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume = 64 |issue = 3 |pages = 319–343 |doi=10.1016/S0923-0467(96)03134-X |year = 1996|url = https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/a-modified-maxwellstefan-model-for-transport-through-inert-membranes--the-binary-friction-model(6a85d50a-d4e3-454f-bb83-f60770375bc0).html |format = &lt;!-- Submitted manuscript --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differential equation of transition flow in porous media based on BFM is given as&lt;ref name=Pant2012JPS /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=-R_\mathrm{g}T\left(\frac{k p}{\mu}+D_\mathrm{K}\right)^{-1}N\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is valid for [[capillary|capillaries]] as well as porous media. The terminology of the Knudsen effect and Knudsen diffusivity is more common in [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[chemical engineering]]. In geological and petrochemical engineering, this effect is known as the [[Klinkenberg correction|Klinkenberg effect]]. Using the definition of molar flux, the above equation can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=-R_\mathrm{g}T\left(\frac{k p}{\mu}+D_\mathrm{K}\right)^{-1}\dfrac{p}{R_\mathrm{g}T}q\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be rearranged into the following equation

: &lt;math&gt; q=-\frac{k}{\mu}\left(1+\frac{D_\mathrm{K}\mu}{k}\frac{1}{p}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this equation with conventional Darcy's law, a new formulation can be given as

: &lt;math&gt; q=-\frac{k^\mathrm{eff}}{\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;k^\mathrm{eff}=k\left(1+\frac{D_\mathrm{K}\mu}{k}\frac{1}{p}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the effective permeability formulation proposed by Klinkenberg:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last = Klinkenberg |first = L. J. |title = The permeability of porous media to liquids and gases |publisher = American Petroleum Institute |booktitle = Drilling and Production Practice |pages = 200–213 |year = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^\mathrm{eff}=k\left(1+\frac{b}{p}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|b}} is known as the Klinkenberg parameter, which depends on the gas and the porous medium structure. This is quite evident if we compare the above formulations. The Klinkenberg parameter {{mvar|b}} is dependent on permeability, Knudsen diffusivity and viscosity (i.e., both gas and porous medium properties).

=== Darcy's law for short time scales ===
For very short time scales, a time derivative of flux may be added to Darcy's law, which results in valid solutions at very small times (in heat transfer, this is called the modified form of [[Fourier's law]]),

: &lt;math&gt;\tau \frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+q=-k \nabla h\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|τ}} is a very small time constant which causes this equation to reduce to the normal form of Darcy's law at "normal" times (&gt; [[nanosecond]]s). The main reason for doing this is that the regular [[groundwater flow equation]] ([[diffusion equation]]) leads to [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] at constant head boundaries at very small times. This form is more mathematically rigorous, but leads to a [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] groundwater flow equation, which is more difficult to solve and is only useful at very small times, typically out of the realm of practical use.

=== Brinkman form of Darcy's law ===
Another extension to the traditional form of Darcy's law is the Brinkman term, which is used to account for transitional flow between boundaries (introduced by Brinkman in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Brinkman |first = H. C. |title = A calculation of the viscous force exerted by a flowing fluid on a dense swarm of particles |journal = Applied Scientific Research |volume = 1 |pages = 27–34 |doi = 10.1007/BF02120313 |year = 1949|citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.3769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;),

: &lt;math&gt;-\beta \nabla^2 q +q =-\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla p\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|β}} is an effective [[viscosity]] term.  This correction term accounts for flow through medium where the grains of the media are porous themselves, but is difficult to use, and is typically neglected. For example, if a porous [[extracellular matrix]] degrades to form large pores throughout the matrix, the viscous term applies in the large pores, while Darcy's law applies in the remaining intact region. This scenario was considered in a theoretical and modelling study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wertheim|first=Kenneth Y.|last2=Roose|first2=Tiina|date=April 2017|title=A Mathematical Model of Lymphangiogenesis in a Zebrafish Embryo|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|volume=79|issue=4|pages=693–737|doi=10.1007/s11538-017-0248-7|issn=1522-9602|pmc=5501200|pmid=28233173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proposed model, the Brinkman equation is connected to a set of [[Reaction-diffusion-advection equation|reaction-diffusion-convection equations]].

==Validity of Darcy's law==
Darcy's law is valid for [[laminar flow]] through [[sediment]]s. In fine-grained sediments, the dimensions of [[wikt:interstice#Noun|interstices]] are small and thus flow is laminar. Coarse-grained sediments also behave similarly but in very coarse-grained sediments the flow may be [[turbulent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Y.|last2=Uth|first2=M.-F.|last3=Kuznetsov|first3=A. V.|last4=Herwig|first4=H.|title=Numerical investigation of the possibility of macroscopic turbulence in porous media: a direct numerical simulation study|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|date=2 February 2015|volume=766|pages=76–103|doi=10.1017/jfm.2015.9|bibcode = 2015JFM...766...76J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Darcy's law is not always valid in such sediments.
For flow through commercial circular pipes, the flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than 2000 and turbulent when it is more than 4000, but in some sediments it has been found that flow is laminar when the value of Reynolds number is less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arora|first=K.

'''Database theory''' encapsulates a broad range of topics related to the study and research of the theoretical realm of [[database]]s and [[database management system]]s.

Theoretical aspects of data management include, among other areas, the foundations of query languages, [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] and [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] of queries, [[finite model theory]], [[database design]] theory, [[dependency theory (database theory)|dependency theory]], foundations of [[concurrency control]] and [[database recovery]], [[deductive database]]s, [[temporal database|temporal]] and [[spatial database]]s, [[real time database]]s, managing [[uncertain data]] and [[probabilistic database]]s, and Web data.

Most research work has traditionally been based on the [[relational model]], since this model is usually considered the simplest and most foundational model of interest. Corresponding results for other data models, such as object-oriented or [[semi-structured model]]s, or, more recently, graph data models and [[XML]], are often derivable from those for the relational model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A website on the Theoretical Foundations of Data Management |url=http://databasetheory.org/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central focus of database theory is on understanding the complexity and power of query languages and their connection to [[logic]]. Starting from relational algebra and [[first-order logic]] (which are equivalent by [[Codd's theorem]]) and the insight that important queries such as [[graph reachability]] are not expressible in this language, more powerful language based on [[logic programming]] and [[fixpoint logic]] such as [[datalog]] were studied. Another focus was on the foundations of [[query optimization]] and [[data integration]]. Here most work studied [[conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]], which admit query optimization even under constraints using the [[chase (algorithm)|chase]] algorithm.

The main research conferences in the area are the [[ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems]] (PODS) and the [[International Conference on Database Theory]] (ICDT).

'''''Dictyostelium discoideum''''' is a species of soil-living [[Amoeboid|amoeba]] belonging to the phylum [[Amoebozoa]], infraphylum [[Mycetozoa]]. Commonly referred to as [[slime mold]], ''D. discoideum'' is a [[eukaryote]] that transitions from a collection of unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The lifecycle of ''D. discoideum'' is relatively short, which allows for timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are applicable to human cancer research. The simplicity of its lifecycle makes ''D. discoideum'' a valuable model organism to study genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.

==Natural habitat and diet==
In the wild, ''D. discoideum'' can be found in soil and moist leaf litter. Its primary diet consists of [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', found in the soil and decaying organic matter. [[Uninucleate]] [[amoebae]] of ''D. discoideum'' consume bacteria found in its natural habitat, which includes [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forest]] soil and decaying leaves.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eichinger L | year = 2003 | title = Crawling in to a new era – the ''Dictyostelium'' genome project | url = | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 1941–1946 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/cdg214 | pmid = 12727861 | last2 = Noegel | first2 = AA | pmc = 156086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle and reproduction==
The [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of ''D. discoideum'' begins as [[spore]]s are released from a mature [[sorocarp]] (fruiting body). Myxamoebae hatch from the spores under warm and moist conditions. During their vegetative stage, the myxamoebae divide by [[mitosis]] as they feed on bacteria.  The bacteria secrete [[folic acid]], attracting the myxamoebae. When the supply of bacteria is depleted, the myxamoebae enter the aggregation stage.

During aggregation, starvation initiates the creation of a biochemical machinery that includes [[glycoprotein]]s and [[adenylyl cyclase]].&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."&gt;Gilbert S.F. 2006. Developmental Biology. 8th ed. Sunderland (MA):Sinauer p. 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The glycoproteins allow for cell-cell [[adhesion]], and adenylyl cyclase creates [[cyclic AMP]]. Cyclic AMP is secreted by the amoebae to attract neighboring cells to a central location. As they move toward the signal, they bump into each other and stick together by the use of glycoprotein adhesion molecules.

[[File:Dicty Life Cycle H01.svg|left|thumb|Lifecycle]]
The migration stage begins once the amoebae have formed a tight aggregate and the elongated mound of cells tip over to lie flat on the ground. The amoebae work together as a motile pseudoplasmodium, also known as a slug. The slug is about 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm long, composed of up to 100,000 cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cell|last = Cooper|first = Geoffrey M|publisher = [[Sinauer Associates]]|year = 2000|isbn = 0-87893-106-6|location = Sunderland, Massachusetts|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9917/|edition = 2nd|authorlink = Geoffrey M.

Once the slug has found a suitable environment, the anterior end of the slug forms the stalk of the fruiting body and the posterior end forms the spores of the fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  Anterior-like cells, which have only been recently discovered, are also dispersed throughout the posterior region of the slug. These anterior-like cells form the very bottom of the fruiting body and the caps of the spores.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  After the slug settles into one spot, the posterior end spreads out with the anterior end raised in the air, forming what is called the "Mexican hat", and the culmination stage begins.

The prestalk cells and prespore cells switch positions in the culmination stage to form the mature fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  The anterior end of the Mexican hat forms a cellulose tube, which allows the more posterior cells to move up the outside of the tube to the top, and the prestalk cells move down.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; This rearrangement forms the stalk of the fruiting body made up of the cells from the anterior end of the slug, and the cells from the posterior end of the slug are on the top and now form the spores of the fruiting body.  At the end of this 8– to 10-hour process, the mature fruiting body is fully formed.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  This fruiting body is 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm tall and is now able to start the entire cycle over again by releasing the mature spores that become myxamoebae.

==Sexual reproduction==
In general, although ''D. discoideum'' generally reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], ''D. discoideum'' is still capable of [[sexual reproduction]] if certain conditions are met. ''D. discoideum'' has three different mating types and studies have identified the sex locus that specifies these three mating types. Type I strains are specified by the gene called MatA, Type II strains have three different genes: MatB (homologous to Mat A), Mat C, and Mat D, and Type III strains have Mat S and Mat T genes (which are homologous to Mat C and Mat D).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Gareth|last2=Skelton|first2=Jason|last3=Ivens|first3=Alasdair|last4=Tanaka|first4=Yoshimasa|last5=Kay|first5=Robert R.|date=2010-12-10|title=Sex Determination in the Social Amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6010/1533|journal=Science|language=en|volume=330|issue=6010|pages=1533–1536|doi=10.1126/science.1197423|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3648785|pmid=21148389}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sexes can only mate with the two different sexes and not with its own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When incubated with their bacterial food supply, heterothallic or homothallic sexual development can occur, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote.&lt;ref name="pmid21929567"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Day DH, Keszei A |title=Signalling and sex in the social amoebozoans |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=313–29 |date=May 2012  |pmid=21929567 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00200.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20617172"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flowers JM, Li SI, Stathos A, Saxer G, Ostrowski EA, Queller DC, Strassmann JE, Purugganan MD |title=Variation, sex, and social cooperation: molecular population genetics of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001013 |date=July 2010  |pmid=20617172 |pmc=2895654 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heterothallic mating occurs when two amoebae of different [[mating type]]s are present in a dark and wet environment, where they can fuse during aggregation to form a giant zygote cell. The giant cell then releases cAMP to attract other cells, then engulfs the other cells cannibalistically in the aggregate. The consumed cells serve to encase the whole aggregate in a thick, cellulose wall to protect it. This is known as a [[macrocyst]]. Inside the macrocyst, the giant cell divides first through [[meiosis]], then through mitosis to produce many [[haploid]] amoebae that will be released to feed as normal amoebae would. Homothallic ''D. discoideum'' strains AC4 and ZA3A are also able to produce macrocysts.&lt;ref name="pmid24189663"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robson GE, Williams KL |title=The mating system of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=Curr.

While sexual reproduction is possible, it is very rare to see successful [[germination]] of a ''D. discoideum'' macrocyst under laboratory conditions.  Nevertheless, recombination is widespread within ''D. discoideum'' natural populations, indicating that sex is likely an important aspect of their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="pmid20617172" /&gt;

==Use as a model organism==
Because many of its genes are homologous to human genes, yet its lifecycle is simple, ''D. discoideum'' is commonly used as a [[model organism]]. It can be observed at organismic, cellular, and molecular levels primarily because of their restricted number of cell types and behaviors, and their rapid growth.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; It is used to study cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and programmed cell death, which are all normal cellular processes. It is also used to study other aspects of development, including cell sorting, pattern formation, phagocytosis, motility, and signal transduction.&lt;ref&gt;Dictybase, About Dictyostelium. [Online] (1, May, 2009). http://dictybase.org/&lt;/ref&gt; These processes and aspects of development are either absent or too difficult to view in other model organisms. ''D. discoideum'' is closely related to higher metazoans. It carries similar genes and pathways, making it a good candidate for [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilip K. Nag, Disruption of Four Kinesin Genes in Dictyostelium. [Online] (22, April, 2008). http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1529371&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]] process occurs when a cell becomes more specialized to develop into a multicellular organism. Changes in size, shape, metabolic activities, and responsiveness can occur as a result of adjustments in gene expression. Cell diversity and differentiation, in this species, involves decisions made from cell-cell interactions in pathways to either stalk cells or spore cells.&lt;ref name="Kay R.R., Garrod D., and Tilly R."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kay R.R. |author2=Garrod D. |author3=Tilly R. | year = 1978 | title = Requirements for cell differentiation in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 211 | issue = 5640| pages = 58–60 |doi=10.1038/271058a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cell fates depend on their environment and pattern formation. Therefore, the organism is an excellent model for studying cell differentiation.

[[File:Dictyostelium Aggregation.JPG|thumb|right|''D. discoideum'' exhibiting chemotaxis through aggregation]]
[[Chemotaxis]] is defined as a passage of an organism toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In ''D. discoideum'', the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.&lt;ref name=Dusenbery&gt;{{cite book|author=Dusenbery, David B.|year=1996|title=Life at Small Scale|series=Scientific American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-7167-5060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174–175}}

An elegant set of mathematical equations that reproduces the spirals and the streaming patterns of ''D. discoideum'' was discovered by mathematical biologists Thomas Höfer and Martin Boerlijst. Mathematical biologist Cornelis J. Weijer has proven that similar equations can model its movement. The equations of these patterns are mainly influenced by the density of the amoeba population, the rate of the production of cyclic AMP and the sensitivity of individual amoebas to cyclic AMP. The spiraling pattern is formed by amoebas at the centre of a colony who rotate as they send out waves of cyclic AMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/2000_11.html|title=Biomathematics Patterns: Spiral Slime.

The use of cAMP as a chemotactic agent is not established in any other organism. In developmental biology, this is one of the comprehensible examples of chemotaxis, which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in immune surveillance and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of embryogenesis that may be studied with these organisms.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;

[[Thermotaxis]] is movement along a gradient of temperature. The slugs have been shown to migrate along extremely shallow gradients of only 0.05&amp;nbsp;°C/cm, but the direction chosen is complicated; it seems to be away from a temperature about 2&amp;nbsp;°C below the temperature to which they had been acclimated. This complicated behavior has been analyzed by computer modeling of the behavior and the periodic pattern of temperature changes in soil caused by daily changes in air temperature. The conclusion is that the behavior moves slugs a few centimeters below the soil surface up to the surface. This is an amazingly sophisticated behavior by a primitive organism with no apparent sense of gravity.&lt;ref name=Dusenbery/&gt;{{rp|108–109}}

[[Programmed cell death]] (apoptosis) is a normal part of species development.&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."/&gt; Apoptosis is necessary for the proper spacing and sculpting of complex organs. Around 20% of cells in ''D. discoideum'' altruistically sacrifice themselves in the formation of the mature fruiting body.  During the pseudoplasmodium (slug or grex) stage of its lifecycle, the organism has formed three main types of cells: prestalk, prespore, and anterior-like cells. During culmination, the prestalk cells secrete a cellulose coat and extend as a tube through the grex.&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."/&gt;  As they differentiate, they form vacuoles and enlarge, lifting up the prespore cells. The stalk cells undergo apoptosis and die as the prespore cells are lifted high above the substrate. The prespore cells then become spore cells, each one becoming a new myxamoeba upon dispersal.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  This is an example of how apoptosis is used in the formation of a reproductive organ, the mature fruiting body.

A recent major contribution from ''Dictyostelium'' research has come from new techniques allowing the activity of individual genes to be visualised in living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16713960 | year = 2006 | last1 = Chubb | first1 = JR | last2 = Trcek | first2 = T | last3 = Shenoy | first3 = SM | last4 = Singer | first4 = RH | title = Transcriptional pulsing of a developmental gene | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 1018–25 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.092 | journal = Current Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has shown that transcription occurs in "bursts" or "pulses" ([[transcriptional bursting]]) rather than following simple probabilistic or continuous behaviour.  Bursting transcription now appears to be conserved between bacteria and humans.  Another remarkable feature of the organism is that it has sets of DNA repair enzymes found in human cells, which are lacking from many other popular metazoan model systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hudson J. J. |author2=Hsu D. W. |author3=Guo K. |author4=Zhukovskaya N. |author5=Liu P. H. |author6=Williams J. G. |author7=Pears C. J. |author8=Lakin N.

===Lab cultivation===
This organism's ability to be easily cultivated in the laboratory&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; adds to its appeal as a model organism. While ''D. discoideum'' can be grown in liquid culture, it is usually grown in Petri dishes containing nutrient [[agar]] and the surfaces are kept moist. The cultures grow best at 22–24&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature). ''D. discoideum'' feed primarily on ''E. coli'', which is adequate for all stages of the lifecycle.  When the food supply is diminished, the myxamoebae aggregate to form pseudoplasmodia. Soon, the dish is covered with various stages of the lifecycle. Checking the dish often allows for detailed observations of development. The cells can be harvested at any stage of development and grown quickly.

While cultivating ''D. discoidium'' in a laboratory, it is important to take into account its behavioral responses. For example, it has an affinity toward light, higher temperatures, high humidity, low ionic concentrations, and the acidic side of the pH gradient. Experiments are often done to see how manipulations of these parameters hinder, stop, or accelerate development. Variations of these parameters can alter the rate and viability of culture growth. Also, the fruiting bodies, being that this is the tallest stage of development, are very responsive to air currents and physical stimuli. It is unknown if there is a stimulus involved with spore release.

===Protein expression studies===
Detailed analysis of protein expression in ''Dictyostelium'' has been hampered by large shifts in the protein expression profile between different developmental stages and a general lack of commercially available antibodies for ''Dictyostelium'' antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immunoblotting: Equality for slime molds!|date = July 2013|journal = [[BioTechniques]]|page = 9|type = paper|volume = 55|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a group at the [[Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre]] reported an antibody-free protein visualization standard for immunoblotting based on detection of [[MCCC1]] using [[streptavidin]] conjugates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The use of strepavidin conjugates as immunoblot loading controls of mitrochondrial markers for use with Dictyostelium discoidium|date = July 2013|last = Davidson|first = Andrew J.|last2 = King|first2 = Jason S.|last3 = Insall|first3 = Robert H.|volume = 55|issue = 1|pages = 39–41|department = Benchmarks|journal = [[BioTechniques]]|type = paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legionnaire's disease===
The bacterial genus ''[[Legionella]]'' includes the species that causes [[legionnaire's disease]] in humans.  ''D. discoideum'' is also a host for ''Legionella'' and is a suitable model for studying the infection process.&lt;ref name="Bruhn H."&gt;Bruhn H. 2008. ''Dictyostelium'', a tractable model host organism for ''Legionella''. In: Heuner K, Swanson M, editors. ''Legionella'': Molecular Microbiology. Norwich (UK): Caister Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-904455-26-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, ''D. discoideum'' shares with mammalian host cells a similar cytoskeleton and cellular processes relevant to ''Legionella'' infection, including [[phagocytosis]], membrane trafficking, [[endocytosis]], vesicle sorting, and chemotaxis.

=="Farming"==
A 2011 report in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published findings that demonstrated a "primitive farming behaviour" in ''D. discoideum'' colonies.&lt;ref name="primitive farming behaviour"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12227168 "Amoebas show primitive farming behaviour as they travel"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 19 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brock DA, Douglas TE, Queller DC, Strassmann JE |title=Primitive agriculture in a social amoeba |journal=Nature |volume=469 |issue= 7330|pages=393–396 |date=20 January 2011|pmid= 21248849|doi=10.1038/nature09668 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "[[symbiosis]]" between ''D. discoideum'' and bacterial prey, about one-third of wild-collected ''D. discoideum'' colonies engaged in the "[[husbandry]]" of the bacteria when the bacteria were included within the slime mold fruiting bodies.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; The incorporation of the bacteria into the fruiting bodies allows the "seeding" of the food source at the location of the spore dispersal, which is particularly valuable if the new location is low in food resources.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; Colonies produced from the "farming" spores typically also show the same behavior when sporulating. This incorporation has a cost associated with it: Those colonies that do not consume all of the prey bacteria produce smaller spores that cannot disperse as widely. In addition, much less benefit exists for bacteria-containing spores that land in a food-rich region. This balance of the costs and benefits of the behavior may contribute to the fact that a minority of ''D. discoideum'' colonies engage in this practice.&lt;ref name="primitive farming behaviour"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;
''D. discoideum'' is known for eating [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], as well as [[Gram-negative bacteria]], but some of the phagocytized bacteria, including some  human pathogens,&lt;ref name=Microreview&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recent insights into host-pathogen interactions from Dyctiostelium |journal=Cellular Microbiology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=283–291 |year=2010 |url= |doi=10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01413.x |first=Margaret |last=Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; are able to live in the amoebae and exit without killing the cell. When they enter the cell, where they reside, and when they leave the cell are not known. The research is not yet conclusive but it is possible to draw a general lifecycle of ''D. discoideum'' adapted for farmer clones to better understand this symbiotic process.[[File:Life-cycle of farmer dictyostelium discoideum.jpg|thumb|Lifecycle of farmer ''D. discoideum'']]

In the picture, one can see the different stages. First, in the starvation stage, bacteria are enclosed within ''D. discoideum'',&lt;ref name=Microreview/&gt; after entry into amoebae, in a phagosome the fusion with lysosomes is blocked and these unmatured phagosomes are surrounded by host cell organelles such as mitochondria, vesicles, and a multilayer membrane derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of amoebae. The role of the RER in the intracellular infection is not known, but the RER is not required as a source of proteins for the bacteria.&lt;ref name=Molmeret&gt;{{cite journal |author= Molmeret M., Horn, M., Wagner, M., Abu Kwaik, Y |title=Primitive Amoebae as Training Grounds for Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |pages=20–28 |date=January 2005 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.1.20-28.2005 |url= |volume=71 |issue=1|pmc=544274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The bacteria reside within these phagosomes during the aggregation and the multicellular development stages. The amoebae preserve their individuality and each amoeba has its own bacterium. During the culmination stage, when the spores are produced, the bacteria pass from the cell to the sorus with the help of a cytoskeletal structure that prevents host cell destruction.&lt;ref name=Macroautophagy &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant P.Ottom Mary Y.Wu |author2=Margaret Clarke |author3=Hao Lu |author4=O.Roger Anderson |author5=Hubert Hilbi |author6=Howard A. Shuman |author7=Richard H.

Free-living amoebae seem to play a crucial role for persistence and dispersal of some pathogens in the environment. Transient association with amoebae has been reported for a number of different bacteria, including ''Legionella pneumophila'', many ''Mycobacterium'' species, ''Francisella tubarensis'', and ''Escherichia coli'', among others.&lt;ref name=Molmeret/&gt;  Agriculture seems to play a crucial role for pathogens' survival, as they can live and replicate inside ''D. discoideum'', making husbandry. 
''Nature''’s report has made an important advance in the knowledge of amoebic behavior, and the famous Spanish phrase translated as “you are more stupid than an amoeba” is losing the sense because amoebae are an excellent example of social behavior with an amazing coordination and sense of sacrifice for the benefit of the species.

== Sentinel cells ==
[[Sentinel cell]]s in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' are phagocytic cells responsible for removing toxic material from the slug stage of the social cycle. Generally round in shape, these cells are present within the slug sheath where they are found to be circulating freely. The detoxification process occurs when these cells engulf toxins and pathogens within the slug through [[phagocytosis]]. Then, the cells clump into groups of five to ten cells, which then attach to the inner sheath of the slug. The sheath is sloughed off as the slug migrates to a new site in search of food bacteria.

Sentinel cells make up approximately 1% of the total number of slug cells, and the number of sentinel cells remains constant even as they are being released. This indicates a constant regeneration of sentinel cells within the slugs as they are being removed along with toxins and pathogens. Sentinel cells are present in the slug even when there are no toxins or pathogens to be removed. Sentinel cells have been located in five other species of ''Dictyostelia'', which suggests that sentinel cells can be described as a general characteristic of the [[innate immune system]] in social amoebae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Guokai |last2=Zhuchenko |first2=Olga |last3=Kuspa |first3=Adam |date=2007-08-03 |title=Immune-like Phagocyte Activity in the Social Amoeba |journal=Science |location=New York, NY |volume=317 |issue=5838 |pages=678–681 |doi=10.1126/science.1143991 |issn=0036-8075 |pmc=3291017 |pmid=17673666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of farming status on sentinel cells ===
The number of sentinel cells varies depending on the farming status of wild ''D. discoideum''. When exposed to a toxic environment created by the use of ethidium bromide, it was shown that the number of sentinel cells per millimeter was lower for farmers than non-farmers. This was concluded by observing the trails left behind as the slugs migrated and counting the number of sentinel cells present in a millimeter. However, the number of sentinel cells does not affect the spore production and viability in farmers. Farmers exposed to a toxic environment produce the same number of spores as farmers in a non-toxic environment, and the spore viability was the same between the farmers and non-farmers. When Clade 2 ''[[Burkholderia]]'', or farmer-associated bacteria, are removed from the farmers, spore production and viability were similar to that of the non-farmers. Thus, it is suggested that bacteria carried by the farmers provide an additional role of protection for the farmers against potential harm due to toxins or pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brock |first=Debra A. |last2=Callison |first2=W.

==Classification and phylogeny==

In older classifications, ''Dictyostelium'' was placed in the defunct [[polyphyletic]] class [[Acrasiomycete]]s. This was a class of cellular slime molds, which was characterized by the aggregation of individual amoebae into a multicellular fruiting body, making it an important factor that related the acrasids to the dictyostelids.&lt;ref name="Cavender J.C., Spiegl F., Swanson A."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cavender J.C. |author2=Spiegl F. |author3=Swanson A. | year = 2002 | title = Taxonomy, slime molds, and the questions we ask | url = | journal = The Mycological Society of America | volume =  94| issue = 6| pages = 968–979 |pmid=21156570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent genomic studies have shown that ''Dictyostelium'' has maintained more of its ancestral genome diversity than plants and animals, although  proteome-based phylogeny confirms that amoebozoa diverged from the animal–fungal lineage after the plant–animal split.&lt;ref name=Eichenger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eichenger L. | year = 2005 | title = The genome of the social amoeba ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7038| pages = 34–57 |pmid=15875012 | doi = 10.1038/nature03481 | pmc = 1352341 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subclass Dictyosteliidae, order Dictyosteliales is a monophyletic assemblage within the Mycetozoa, a group that includes the protostelid, dictyostelid, and myxogastrid slime molds.  
Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) data analyses support Mycetozoa as a monophyletic group, though rRNA trees place it as a polyphyletic group.  Further, these data support the idea that the dictyostelid and myxogastrid are more closely related to each other than they are the protostelids.  EF-1α analysis also placed the Mycetozoa as the immediate outgroup for the animal-fungal clade.&lt;ref name=Baldauf&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baldauf S.L. |author2=Doolittle W.F. | year = 1997 | title = Origin and evolution of the slime molds (Mycetozoa) | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 94 | issue =22 | pages = 12007–12012 |pmc=23686 | pmid=9342353 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.22.12007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latest phylogenetic data place dictyostelids firmly within supergroup [[Amoebozoa]], along with [[Mycetozoa|myxomycetes]].  Meanwhile, [[Protosteloid|protostelids]] have turned out to be polyphyletic, their stalked fruiting bodies a convergent feature of multiple unrelated lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0006754 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0006754 | volume=4 | issue=8 | title=Eumycetozoa = Amoebozoa?: SSUrDNA Phylogeny of Protosteloid Slime Molds and Its Significance for the Amoebozoan Supergroup | journal=PLoS ONE | pages=e6754 | pmid=19707546 | pmc=2727795 | last1 = Shadwick | first1 = LL | last2 = Spiegel | first2 = FW | last3 = Shadwick | first3 = JD | last4 = Brown | first4 = MW | last5 = Silberman | first5 = JD| year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genome==
The ''D. discoideum'' [[genome]] sequencing project was completed and published in 2005 by an international collaboration of institutes. This was the first free-living protozoan genome to be fully sequenced. ''D. discoideum'' consists of a 34-Mb haploid genome with a base composition of 77% [A+T] and contains six chromosomes that encode around 12,500 proteins.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; Sequencing of the ''D. discoideum'' genome  provides a more intricate study of its cellular and developmental biology.

Tandem repeats of trinucleotides are very abundant in this genome; one class of the genome is clustered, leading researchers to believe it serves as centromeres. The repeats correspond to repeated sequences of amino acids and are thought to be expanded by nucleotide expansion.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; Expansion of trinucleotide repeats also occurs in humans, in general leading to many diseases. Learning how ''D. discoideum'' cells endure these amino acid repeats may provide insight to allow humans to tolerate them.

Every genome sequenced plays an important role in identifying genes that have been gained or lost over time. Comparative genomic studies allow for comparison of eukaryotic genomes. A phylogeny based on the proteome showed that the amoebozoa deviated from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant-animal split.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; The ''D. discoideum'' genome is noteworthy because its many encoded proteins are commonly found in fungi, plants, and animals.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt;

[[File:Root digging stick at Rocky Reach Dam Museum 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A digging stick]]
In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], a '''digging stick''', or sometimes '''yam stick''', is a wooden implement used primarily by [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence-based]] cultures to dig out underground food such as roots and tubers or [[burrowing animals]] and anthills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/digging-stick The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved July 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The stick may also have other uses in hunting or general domestic tasks.

They are common to the [[Indigenous Australians]] but also other peoples worldwide. The tool normally consists of little more than a sturdy stick which has been shaped or sharpened and perhaps hardened by being placed temporarily in a fire. Fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing, it forms a prehistoric [[plow]], and is also a precursor of most modern agricultural handtools.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved March 26, 2015, from Britannica.com website: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163245/digging-stick&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a simple [[tool|device]], and has to be tough and hardy in order not to break.

== By region ==

=== Mexico and the Mesoamerican region ===
In Mexico and the [[Mesoamerican region]], the digging stick was the most important agricultural tool throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;tab=two&amp;typ=reg&amp;id=377 Study the Digging Stick] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;id=320&amp;typ=reg Uictli] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''coa'' stick normally flares out into a triangle at the end and is used for cultivating maize. It is still used for agriculture in some indigenous communities, with some newer 20th-century versions having the addition of a little metal tip.

Other digging sticks, according to Native Americans of the Columbia Plateau, have been used since time immemorial to gather edible roots like balsamroot, bitterroot, camas, and varieties of biscuitroot. Typical digging sticks were and are still about 2 to 3 feet in length, usually slightly arched, with the bottom tip shaved off at an angle. A 5 to 8 inch cross-piece made of antler, bone, or wood was fitted perpendicularly over the top of the stick, allowing the use of two hands to drive the tool into the ground. Since contact with the Europeans in the 19th century, Native Americans have also adapted the use of a metal in making digging sticks.

=== Ethiopia and the Harar region ===

The most common digging stick found in [[Ethiopia]] is the ''ankassay'' in [[Amharic]], a [[Semitic language]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]] and the second-most spoken Semitic language in the world. The ''ankassay'' is a single shaft that is about 4–5 feet in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip.&lt;ref name="Simoons"&gt;Simoons, Frederick J. "The Forked Digging Stick of the Gurage", "[[Zeitschrift für Ethnologie]]", Berlin, Retrieved February 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other digging sticks are unique to the Harar region located in East-Central [[Ethiopia]], which are considered to be unusual due to their function beyond the basic use of other digging sticks, and the use of one as a plow.

The ''deungora'' is a particularly long digging stick is about 110 centimeters, or approximately 3.6 feet, in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip. What's unique about this digging stick is that a bored stone, about 15 centimeters in diameter, is attached at the opposing end. This stone shares the same form as other bored stones that have been discovered in archaeological sites in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

''Maresha'' is the [[Gurage]] name, also the same word used by the [[Amhara people|Amhara]], for a digging stick that differs in construction because of its forked form. It is used primarily to dig holes for construction, planting, and harvesting roots and tubers. This tool is used as a plow to turn over the soil of an entire field before planting. It is used to break clods of soil in areas where the soil is hard or in areas that may be too steep for plowing, and to dig holes for construction or to transplant domestic plants. When compared to the ''ankassay'', this digging stick can perform the same duties and in addition can be used as a hoe.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

=== East-Central New Guinea ===

The Kuman people of this region were horticulturists who used basic tools such as the digging stick, wooden hoe, and wooden spade in their daily lives. Eventually they started to use more sophisticated tools such as iron spades and pick-axes.&lt;ref name="Nilles"&gt;Nilles, John. "The Kuman people: A study of cultural change in a primitive society in the Central Highlands of New Guinea." Oceania (1953): 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of digging sticks both shared a similar shape but differed in size:

* A larger and heavier digging stick with a diameter of about 4 centimeters and 2 meters in length, used for the purpose of turning over the soil surface for new gardens
* A smaller and lighter digging stick with a diameter of about 2 centimeters and 1 meter (or less) in length, mainly used for basic horticulture tasks&lt;ref name="Nilles"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9952">In biochemistry, '''docosanoids''' are [[lipid signaling|signaling molecules]] made by the metabolism of twenty-two-carbon fatty acids (EFAs), especially the [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid) by [[lipoxygenase]], [[cyclooxygenase]], and [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes. Other docosanoids are metabolites of n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid), n-6 DHA (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid, and docosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosatetraenoic acid, DTA, or adrenic acid). Prominent docosanoid metabolites of DHA and n-3 DHA are members of the specialized proresolving mediator class of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] metabolites that possess potent anti-[[inflammation]], tissue healing, and other activities (see [[specialized proresolving mediators]]).

==Prominent docosanoids==

===Specialized proresolving mediator docosanoids===
Potently bioactive agents of the specialized proresolving mediator class include:
*DHA-derived [[Resolvins]] (Rv's) of the D series: RvD1, RvD2, RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, RvD6, AT-RvD1, AT-RvD2, AT-RvD3, AT-RvD4, AT-RvD5, and AT-RvD6 (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived Resolvins]]).
*n-3 DPA-derived Rvs of the D series (RvD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, RvD2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, and RvDD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the T series (RvT1, TvT2, RvT3, and RvT4) (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived resolvins]]).
*DHA-derived [[Neuroprotectin]]s, also termed protectins: PD1, PDX, 17-epi PD1, and 10-epi-DHA1 (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins]]).
*n-3 DPA derived protectins: RD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; and RvD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived resolvins]])(see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3|DPA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins]]. 
*DHA derived [[Maresins]]: MaR1, MaR2, 7-epi-Mar1, Mar-L1, and Mar-L2 (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived Maresins]]).
*n-3 DPA-derived maresins: Mar1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, Mar2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mar3&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived maresins]]).

These DHA metabolites possess anti-[[inflammation]] and tissue-protection activities in animal models of inflammatory diseases; they are proposed to inhibit [[innate immune response]]s and thereby to protect from and to resolve a wide range of inflammatory responses in animals and humans. These metabolites are also proposed to contribute to the anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids by being metabolized to them.&lt;ref name="pmid25149823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calder PC | title = Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: Effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 469–84 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25149823 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25359497"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J, Levy BD | title = Lipid mediators in the resolution of inflammation | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = a016311 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25359497 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a016311 | pmc=4315926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26655290"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barden AE, Mas E, Mori TA | title = n-3 Fatty acid supplementation and proresolving mediators of inflammation | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–32 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26655290 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0000000000000262 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26545300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balas L, Durand T | title = Dihydroxylated E,E,Z-docosatrienes.

===Neurofuran docosanoids===
DHA can be converted non-enzymatically by free radical-mediated peroxidation to 8 different [[neurofuran]] regio[[isomers]] termed neuroprostanes and neurofuranes including 4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, 14-, 17-, and 20-series neurofurans/neuroporstanes for a total of 128 different racemic compounds. The most studied DHA-derived of these products are members of the 4-series, neurofuran 4-F&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;neuroprostane and 4(''RS'')-ST-Δ6-8-neurofurane. These metabolites have been used mainly as [[biomarker]]s of [[oxidative stress]] that are formed in nerve tissues of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="pmid17954232"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arneson KO, Roberts LJ | title = Measurement of products of docosahexaenoic acid peroxidation, neuroprostanes, and neurofurans | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 433 | issue = | pages = 127–43 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17954232 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)33007-3 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25184341"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung KS, Galano JM, Durand T, Lee JC | title = Current development in non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation products, isoprostanoids and isofuranoids, in novel biological samples | journal = Free Radical Research | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 816–26 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25184341 | doi = 10.3109/10715762.2014.960867 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydroxy-docosanoids===
Cells metabolize DHA to 17''S''-hydroperoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (17-HpDHA) and then rapidly reduce this hydroperoxide to  17''S''-hydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (17-HDHA) and similarly metabolize DHA to 13''S''-hydroperoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',14''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (13-HpDHA) and then to 13''S''-hydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',14''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (13-HDHA). 17-HDHA exhibits potent in vitro as well as in vivo (animal model) anti-inflammatory activity while 17-HpDHA and to a lesser extent 17-HDHA inhibit the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22618200"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiu CY, Gomolka B, Dierkes C, Huang NR, Schroeder M, Purschke M, Manstein D, Dangi B, Weylandt KH | title = Omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid-derived resolvins and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid modulate macrophage function and alleviate experimental colitis | journal = Inflammation Research| volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 967–76 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22618200 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-012-0489-8 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23029040"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Hu Y, Wooten RE, Horita DA, Samuel MP, Thomas MJ, Sun H, Edwards IJ | title = 15-lipoxygenase metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = e45480 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23029040 | pmc = 3447860 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045480 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other SPM docosanoids, e.g. RvD1 and RvD2, have anti-growth effects against cancer cells in animal models.&lt;ref name="pmid25857211"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J | title = The resolution code of acute inflammation: Novel pro-resolving lipid mediators in resolution | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–15 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25857211 | pmc = 4515371 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.03.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxo-docosanoids===
Cells can metabolize DHA to products that possess an oxo (i.e. [[ketone]]) residue. These products include 13-oxo-DHA (termed EFOXD6) and 17-oxo-DHA (termed 18-EFOXD6).  Both oxo metabolites  possess anti-inflammatory activity as assesses in in vitro systems (see [[Specialized proresolving mediators#Oxo-DHA and oxo-DPA metabolites]]).&lt;ref name="pmid26546723"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2015 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">In [[English drama]], a '''domestic tragedy''' is a [[tragedy]] in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or lower-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[tragedy]], in which the protagonists are of kingly or [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. 

The [[Ancient Greek]] theorist [[Aristotle]] had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. 

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the first domestic tragedies were written in the [[English Renaissance]]; one of the first was ''[[Arden of Faversham]]'' (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are ''[[A Woman Killed with Kindness]]'' (1607), ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' (1608), and ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="SturgessHeywood2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Sturgess|author2=Thomas Heywood|title=Three Elizabethan Domestic Tragedies: Arden of Faversham; a Yorkshire Tragedy; a Woman Killed with Kindness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kJ-JxlddCsC|date=23 February 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-241-96146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Othello]]'' can be classified as a domestic tragedy.&lt;ref name="Benson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Benson|title=Shakespeare, 'Othello' and Domestic Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgug588s3jgC&amp;pg=PT10|date=15 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3766-1|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic tragedy disappeared during the era of [[Restoration drama]], when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of [[George Lillo]] and Sir [[Richard Steele]] in the [[Augustan drama|eighteenth century]].

'''Doubletime''' ('''dbt''') also known as '''discs overgrown''' ('''dco''') is a [[gene]] that encodes the double-time [[protein]] (DBT) in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. The double-time protein is a [[kinase]] that phosphorylates [[period (gene)|PER]] protein that regulates the molecularly-driven, biological clock controlling [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref name = "k2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yu W, Zheng H, Price JL, Hardin PE | title = DOUBLETIME plays a noncatalytic role to mediate CLOCK phosphorylation and repress CLOCK-dependent transcription within the Drosophila circadian clock | journal = Mol.

== Discovery ==

Double time gene (''dbt'') was first identified and characterized in 1998 by Michael Young and his team at [[The Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref name = "k1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/MichaelYoung/ | title =  Michael W. Young  | publisher = The Rockefeller University | work = Scientists &amp; Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young’s research group, headed by [http://sbs.umkc.edu/facultydetail.cfm?Faculty_ID=124 Jeffrey Price], published their results in a paper which characterized three [[alleles]] of ''dbt'' in fruit flies.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; They discovered that two mutant alleles, named short and long (''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) that were able to alter normal cycling of ''per'' and ''tim''.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; Young’s team suspected that the delay between the rise in mRNA levels of ''[[period (gene)|per]]'' and ''[[timeless (gene)|tim]]'' and the rise of PER and TIM protein were due to the effects of another protein. Young suspected that this protein postponed the intercellular accumulation of PER protein by destroying it. Only when PER was paired with TIM was this break-down not possible. This work showed that DBT regulated the break-down of PER.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt;

Young named the novel gene double-time (''dbt'') due to its effect on the normal period of Drosophila. Mutant flies which only expressed ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; had an 18-hour period while those expressing ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' had a 28-hour period.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; In addition, Young’s team isolated a third allele, ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;' which caused lethality in pupa while [[Ablation|ablating]] any ''per'' or ''tim'' products in larvae.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt;  ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; mutants were important because they provided clues as to how the gene product functioned.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt; Without functional DBT protein, flies accumulated high levels of PER and these PER proteins do not disintegrate in the absence of pairing with TIM protein. These mutants expressed higher cytosolic levels of PER than cells in which PER protein was associated with TIM protein.   The double-time gene regulates the expression of PER which in turns controls circadian rhythm.&lt;ref name="k1" /&gt; Young’s team later [[cloned]] the dbt gene and found that the DBT protein was a [[kinase]] which specifically [[phosphorylated]] PER proteins. Thus, in dbt mutants, PER proteins were not phosphorylated by DBT protein.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt;

== Gene ==

The gene is located on the right arm of chromosome 3.&lt;ref name=Double-Time1 /&gt; The mRNA transcript of ''dbt'' is 3.2 kilo-base pairs long, and it contains four [[exons]] and three [[introns]].

== Protein ==

The DBT protein is composed of 440 [[amino acids]].&lt;ref name=Brody /&gt; The protein has an [[ATP-binding motif|ATP binding site]], a serine/threoine kinase catalytic domains, and several potential [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylation sites]], including a site for [[autophosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=Brody /&gt;

== Function ==

=== Regulation of circadian rhythm ===

In Drosophila, a molecularly-driven clock mechanism works to regulate circadian rhythms such as locomotor activity and [[eclosion]] by oscillating the levels of the proteins [[Period (gene)|PER]] and [[Timeless (gene)|TIM]] via [[Positive feedback|positive]] and [[Negative feedback|negative feedback loops]].&lt;ref name="Double-Time1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Price JL, Blau J, Rothenfluh A, Abodeely M, Kloss B, Young MW | title = double-time is a novel Drosophila clock gene that regulates PERIOD protein accumulation | journal = Cell | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–95 |date=July 1998 | pmid = 9674430 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81224-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drosophila DBT"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muskus MJ, Preuss F, Fan JY, Bjes ES, Price JL | title = Drosophila DBT lacking protein kinase activity produces long-period and arrhythmic circadian behavioral and molecular rhythms | journal = Mol.

Only once TIM accumulates do PER and TIM bind, and this binding inhibits the degradation of PER. This cytoplasmic PER degradation and then accumulation causes the 4-6 hour delay seen between the levels of per mRNA and the levels of PER protein.&lt;ref name="Kloss" /&gt; The PER/TIM complex, still bound to DBT, migrates into the nucleus where it suppresses the transcription of per and tim. TIM is lost from the complex, and DBT then phosphorylates PER which leads to its degradation, allowing for the transcription of the clock and clock-controlled genes (those with transcription controlled by circadian mechanisms).&lt;ref name="Kloss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-470-09082-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Goode J, Chadwick D | title = Molecular clocks and light signalling | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 269–270 | isbn = 0-470-09082-0 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oscillations in the PER and TIM proteins presence causes [[oscillations]] in their own and other genes' expression, which is the basis for circadian rhythmicity.&lt;ref name="Drosophila DBT" /&gt;

The transcription of ''dbt'' mRNA and the levels of the DBT protein are consistent throughout the day and not controlled by PER/TIM levels. However, the location and concentration of DBT protein within the cell changes throughout the day.&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite web | author = Brody T |title=Discs Overgrown: Regulation|url=http://www.sdbonline.org/fly/neural/doubltm4.htm|publisher=The Interactive Fly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is consistently present in the nucleus at varying levels, but in the cytoplasm it is predominantly present in the late day and early night, when PER and TIM levels are peaking&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

Before DBT begins phosphorylating PER, a different protein called NEMO/NLK kinase begins phosphorylating PER at its per-short domain. This phosphorylation stimulates DBT to begin phosphorylating PER at multiple nearby sites. In total, there are about 25-30 phosphorylation sites on PER.&lt;ref name="NEMO"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiu JC, Ko HW, Edery I | title = NEMO/NLK phosphorylates PERIOD to initiate a time-delay phosphorylation circuit that sets circadian clock speed | journal = Cell | volume = 145 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–70 |date=April 2011 | pmid = 21514639 | pmc = 3092788 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phosphorylated PER binds to the [[F-box protein]] SLIMB, and it is then targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.&lt;ref name="Kinetics" /&gt; Therefore, the phosphorylation of PER by DBT leads to a decrease in PER abundance, which is a necessary step in the function of the organism's internal clock.&lt;ref name="Kinetics" /&gt;

The activity of DBT on PER is aided by the activity of the proteins CKII and SGG, and it is antagonized by a rhythmically expressed protein phosphatase. It is possible, but currently unknown, if DBT regulates other functions of PER or of other circadian proteins.&lt;ref name="Drosophila DBT" /&gt; There has been no evidence that suggests that DBT binds directly to TIM.&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; Rather, the only kinase known to directly phosphorylate TIM is the SHAGGY (SGG) kinase protein, but this does not majorly affect TIM stability, suggesting the presence of a different kinase or phosphatase.&lt;ref name="pmid17575052"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fang Y, Sathyanarayanan S, Sehgal A | title = Post-translational regulation of the Drosophila circadian clock requires protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 1506–18 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17575052 | pmc = 1891428 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1541607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DBT does play a role in recruiting other kinases into PER repression complexes. These kinases phosphorylate the transcription factor CLK, which releases the CLK-[[Cycle (gene)|CYC]] complex from the [[E-Box]] and represses transcription.&lt;ref name="k2" /&gt;

=== Mutant alleles ===

There are three primary mutant alleles of ''dbt'': ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'', which shortens the organism's free-running period (its internal period in constant light conditions); ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'', which lengthens the free-running period; and ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;'', which causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling proteins and ''per'' and ''tim'' transcription.&lt;ref name="Double-Time1" /&gt; All mutants except for ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' produce differential PER degradation that directly correspond with their phenotypic behavior. ''Dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' PER degradation resembles wild-type DBT, which suggests that ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not affect the clock through this degradation mechanism. It has been suggested that ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' works by acting as a repressor or producing a different phosphoylation pattern of the substrate. ''Dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' causes early termination of ''per'' transcription.&lt;ref name="Kinetics" /&gt;

The ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'' mutation causes the period of PER and TIM [[oscillation]]s, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours. This extended rhythm is caused by a decreased rate of phosphorylation of PER due to lower DBT kinase activity levels. This mutation is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80→Ile mutation). The ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18–20 hours. There is no current evidence for the mechanism affected by the mutation, but it is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Pro-47→ Ser mutation).&lt;ref name = "Kinetics" /&gt;

Another ''dbt'' mutation is ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;AR&lt;/sup&gt;'', which causes arrhythmic activities in Drosophila. It a [[hypermorphic]] allele that is the result of a His 126→Tyr mutation. Homozygous flies with this mutation are viable but arrhythmic, whereas ''dbtAR/+'' heterozygotes have extra-long periods of about 29 hours, and their DBT kinase activity is reduced to the lowest rate of all of the DBT alleles.&lt;ref name = "Kinetics" /&gt;

=== Noncircadian ===

Clock gene mutations, including those to Drosophila's ''dbt'', alter the sensitivization of drug-induced locomotor activity after repeated exposure to [[psychostimulants]]. Drosophila with mutant alleles of ''dbt'' failed to display locomotor sensitivization in response to repeated [[cocaine]] exposure.&lt;ref name="Circadian"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosenwasser AM | title = Circadian clock genes: non-circadian roles in sleep, addiction, and psychiatric disorders? | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 1249–55 |date=July 2010 | pmid = 20307570 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.03.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is experimental evidence for this gene to function in 13 unique biological processes, including biological regulation, phosphorus metabolic process, establishment of planar polarity, positive regulation of biological process, cellular process, single-organism developmental process, response to stimulus, response to organic substance, sensory organ development, macromolecule modification, growth, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and rhythmic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene Dmel\dco|url=http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0002413.html|publisher=FlyBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene's alternative name, discs overgrown, refers to its role as a cell growth regulating gene that has strong effects of cell survival and growth control in [[imaginal disc]]s, an attribute of the [[larvae]] fly stage. The protein is necessary in the mechanism linking cell survival during [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] and growth arrest.&lt;ref name=Brody /&gt;

=== Noncatalytic ===

The DBT protein may play a noncatalytic role in attracting kinases that phosphorylate [[CLOCK]] ([[CLK1|CLK]]), an activator of transcription.&lt;ref name="k2" /&gt; DBT has a noncatalytic role in recruiting kinases, some of which have not yet been discovered, into the transcription translation feedback loop (TTFL).&lt;ref name="kelse"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | pmc = 2885980 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DBT's catalytic activity is not affiliated with the phosphorylation CLK or its transcriptional repression. PER phosphorylation by DBT is integral in repressing CLK-dependent transcription. The DBT protein plays a noncatalytic role in recruiting additional kinases that phosphorylate CLK indirectly, thus downregulating transcription. A similar pathway exists in mammals due to the mechanistic conservation of the CKI homolog.&lt;ref name="k2" /&gt; In 2004, In ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and ''dbt''&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt; mutants, ''Drosphila'' cells has reduced [[Casein kinase 1|CKI-7]] activity.&lt;ref name = "k2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Preuss F, Fan JY, Kalive M, Bao S, Schuenemann E, Bjes ES, Price JL | title = Drosophila doubletime mutations which either shorten or lengthen the period of circadian rhythms decrease the protein kinase activity of casein kinase I | journal = Mol.

== Mammalian homologs ==

=== Casein kinase I ===

The [[casein kinase 1]] (CKI) family of kinases is a highly conserved group of proteins that are found in organisms from [[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]], to Drosophila, to humans.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eide EJ, Virshup DM | title = Casein kinase I: another cog in the circadian clockworks | journal = Chronobiol. Int. | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 389–98 |date=May 2001 | pmid = 11475410 | doi = 10.1081/CBI-100103963| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because dbt is a member of this family, questions arose about the role of these related genes in other model systems. Within mammals, there are seven CKI [[protein isoform|isoforms]], all with various roles surrounding the phosphorylation of proteins. [[CSNK1E|CKIε]] was found to be most [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to dbt, with a similarity of 86%.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Along with this genetic similarity, the proteins have been found to be functionally homologous. Just as phosphorylation by dbt in Drosophila targets PER proteins for proteasome degradation, CKIε phosphorylation reduces the stability of mammalian PER proteins, labeling them for degradation.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanselow_Kramer_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanselow K, Kramer A | title = Role of phosphorylation in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Cold Spring Harb.

Biol. | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 167–76 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18419274 | doi = 10.1101/sqb.2007.72.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virshup_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Virshup DM, Eide EJ, Forger DB, Gallego M, Harnish EV | title = Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates circadian rhythms | journal = Cold Spring Harb.

Biol. Rhythms | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18258753 | doi = 10.1177/0748730407311652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the functions are extremely similar. Specifically, CKIε has been shown to reduce the half-life of mPER1, one of the three mammalian PER homologs.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; In addition, nuclear localization of the mPER proteins is related to phosphorylation, adding another essential role to the activity of the CKIε protein.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Overall, the genetic similarity of dbt and CKIε is not the end of the story; the roles they play within the circadian clock in their respective systems are almost identical. Both are involved with periodic phosphorylation, regulating the oscillations of the circadian clocks.

=== Role of CKIε ===

Initially, the role of CKIε within the circadian clock of mammals was discovered as the result of a mutation in hamsters. The tau mutation in the Syrian [[golden hamster]] was the first to show a [[Heritability|heritable]] abnormality of circadian rhythms in mammals.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Hamsters with the mutation exhibit a shorter period than the wild-type. [[Zygosity|Heterozygotes]] have a period of about 22h while the period of homozygotes is even shorter, at about 20h.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt; Because of previous research indicating the role of dbt in establishing period, the tau mutation was found to be at the same locus as the CKIε gene.&lt;ref name="Lowrey_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lowrey PL, Shimomura K, Antoch MP, Yamazaki S, Zemenides PD, Ralph MR, Menaker M, Takahashi JS | title = Positional syntenic cloning and functional characterization of the mammalian circadian mutation tau | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5465 | pages = 483–92 |date=April 2000 | pmid = 10775102 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5465.483| url = | bibcode = 2000Sci...288..483L | pmc = 3869379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this mutation relates to the mutations ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'', which both effect the internal period of the fly. However, it seems that the forces driving these changes in period are different. It was found that the point mutation resulting in the tau mutant decreased the activity of the CKIε kinase [[in vitro]]. In flies, on the other hand, the ''dbt&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'' mutation is associated with a decrease in dbt activity and a longer period. This is consistent with another experiment done on hamsters that showed a lengthening of the period caused by CKI inhibition.&lt;ref name="Virshup_2007"/&gt; To investigate this discrepancy, researchers studied the [[half-life]] of PER2 under the influence of wild-type CKIε, CKIεtau, and CKIε (K38A) which is a kinase-inactive mutant.&lt;ref name="Virshup_2007"/&gt; The results indicated that the tau mutation was actually a gain-of-function mutation, instead of loss-of-function, that caused the more rapid degradation of the PER proteins. Therefore, the tau mutation in hamsters can be seen as similar to mutations in dbt that change the internal period.

=== Importance of rhythmic phosphorylation ===

A role of CKIε has also been seen in humans related to [[FASPS|Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome]], in which individuals have a much shorter period than the typical human. In this case, it does not seem to be a mutation of the CKIε protein itself, but instead in the [[binding site]] for phosphorylation of the PER2 protein.&lt;ref name="Eide_Virshup_2001"/&gt;

In addition, kinase activity has been shown to be involved in the [[Nuclear transport|nuclear localization]] of PER and other genes involved in circadian rhythmicity.&lt;ref name="pmid17452453"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nawathean P, Stoleru D, Rosbash M | title = A small conserved domain of Drosophila PERIOD is important for circadian phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transcriptional repressor activity | journal = Mol. Cell. Biol. | volume = 27 | issue = 13 | pages = 5002–13 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17452453 | pmc = 1951469 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.02338-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is this phosphorylation that allows PER to repress its own [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and place a delay on the circadian system. Without the phosphorylation of PER, by dbt in Drosophila or by CKIε in mammals, there would be no oscillations because the [[Feedback|feedback loop]] would be broken.

It has even been proposed that this rhythmic phosphorylation itself might be a driving factor of circadian clocks. Up to this point, the transcription-translation negative feedback loop has been identified as the source of oscillations and rhythms in biological clocks. But, experiments with phosphorylation of the [[cyanobacteria]]l protein [[KaiC]] in vitro showed that rhythms persisted without the presence of any transcription or translation.&lt;ref name="pmid15831759"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, kinases like dbt and CKIε might play even more important roles within circadian clocks than just targeting proteins for degradation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">'''Ecological indicators''' are used to communicate information about [[ecosystem]]s and the impact human activity has on ecosystems to groups such as the public or [[government]] [[policy]] makers. Ecosystems are complex and ecological indicators can help describe them in simpler terms that can be understood and used by non-scientists to make management decisions. For example, the number of different [[beetle]] [[taxon|taxa]] found in a field can be used as an [[Diversity index|indicator]] of [[biodiversity]].{{ref|Gird}}{{ref|Niem}}{{ref|Osi}}

Many different types of indicators have been developed.  They can be used to reflect a variety of aspects of ecosystems, including biological, chemical and physical.  Due to this variety, the development and selection of ecological indicators is a complex process.{{ref|Kurt}}

Using ecological indicators is a pragmatic approach since direct documentation of changes in ecosystems as related to management measures, is cost and time intensive.{{ref|Bert}}{{ref|Osi}} For example, it would be expensive and time-consuming to count every [[bird]], [[plant]] and [[animal]] in a newly [[Restoration ecology|restored]] [[wetland]] to see if the restoration was a success. Instead, a few [[indicator species]] can be monitored to determine the success of the restoration.

:''"It is difficult and often even impossible to characterize the functioning of a complex system, such as an eco-agrosystem, by means of direct measurements.  The size of the system, the complexity of the interactions involved, or the difficulty and cost of the measurements needed are often crippling"''{{ref|Gird}}

The terms ecological indicator and [[environmental indicator]] are often used interchangeably. However, ecological indicators are actually a sub-set of environmental indicators.  Generally, environmental indicators provide information on pressures on the [[Ecosystem|environment]], environmental conditions and societal responses.  Ecological indicators refer only to [[ecology|ecological]] processes; however, sustainability indicators are seen as increasingly important for managing humanity's coupled human-environmental systems&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R. R. (2018). A mega-index for the Americas and its underlying sustainable development correlations. Ecological Indicators, 89, 466-479. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.050&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Policy evaluation==

Ecological indicators play an important role in evaluating policy regarding the environment.

===Contributions===

Indicators contribute to evaluation of policy development by:{{ref|Pior}}
*Providing decision-makers and the general public with relevant information on the current state and trends in the environment.
*Helping decision-makers better understand cause and effect relationships between the choices and practices of businesses and policy-makers versus the environment.
*Assisting to monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to increase and enhance [[ecological goods and services]].

Based on the [[United Nations]] [[convention to combat desertification]] and [[convention for biodiversity]], indicators are planned to be built in order to evaluate the evolution of the factors.  For instance, for the CCD, the [[Unesco]]-funded [[Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel]] (OSS) has created the Réseau d'Observatoires du Sahara et du Sahel ([[ROSELT]]) (website [http://www.roselt-oss.teledection.fr]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) as a network of cross-Saharan observatories to establish ecological indicators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Limitations===

There are limitations and challenges to using indicators for evaluating policy programs.

For indicators to be useful for policy analysis, it is necessary to be able to use and compare indicator results on different scales (local, regional, national and international).  Currently, indicators face the following spatial limitations and challenges:

# Variable availability of data and information on local, regional and national scales.
# Lack of methodological standards on an international scale.
# Different ranking of indicators on an international scale which can result in different legal treatment.
# Averaged values across a national level may hide regional and local trends.
# When compiled, local indicators may be too diverse to provide a national result.{{ref|Pior}}

Indicators also face other limitations and challenges, such as:

# Lack of reference levels, therefore it is unknown if trends in environmental change are strong or weak.
# Indicator measures can overlap, causing over estimation of single parameters.
# Long-term monitoring is necessary to identify long-term environmental changes.
# Attention to more easily handled measurable indicators distracts from indicators less quantifiable such as aesthetics, ethics or cultural values. {{ref|Pior}}

The '''Eladio Velez Art School''',&lt;ref&gt;http://antioquia.gov.co/  Antioquia  Government&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Eladio Vélez School''', is a high [[Art school]] technology [[Colombia]], private character.

It was founded on February 2, 1979, by the ''Society of Public Improvements'' of [[Itagüí]]. It is a school specializing in the artistic and cultural world. It also provides various social activities that help strengthen the art and culture of the city.

== Headquarters ==
Currently has 1 headquarters in [[Itagüí]]. It is in honor of the distinguished painter [[Eladio Vélez]].

== Initiation==
In 1979 is launched the idea of creating an art school private. All with the intention of offering a different alternative in town. Since 1979 ''Eladio Vélez School'' has become the city's heritage not only by the artist but by representing the possibility offered to the population of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70298">{{For|the condition characterized by [[comorbidity]] of a specific set of impairments to executive functioning|Dysexecutive syndrome}}

In [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], '''executive dysfunction''', or '''executive function deficit''', is a disruption to the efficacy of the [[executive functions]], which is a group of [[cognitive processes]] that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin. (65); 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction can refer to both [[neurocognitive]] deficits and behavioural [[symptom]]s. It is implicated in numerous [[Psychopathology#As a descriptive term|psychopathologies]] and [[mental disorder]]s, as well as short-term and long-term changes in non-clinical executive control.

Executive dysfunction is not the same as [[dysexecutive syndrome]], a term coined by [[Alan Baddeley]] to describe a common pattern of dysfunction in executive functions, such as deficiencies in [[planning]], abstract thinking, [[Cognitive flexibility|flexibility]] and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;Wilson, B.A., Evans, J.J., Emslie, H., Alderman, N., &amp; Burgess, P. (1998). The development of an ecologically valid test for assessing patients with a dysexecutive syndrome. ''Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 8'', 213-228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Baddeley, A."&gt;Baddeley, A., &amp; Wilson, B. (1988). Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome. ''Brain and Cognition, 7'', 212-230.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of symptoms, usually resulting from brain damage, tend to occur together.&lt;ref&gt;Halligan, P.W., Kischka, U., &amp; Marshall, J.C. (2004). ''Handbook of clinical neuropsychology.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of dysexecutive syndrome is [[Dysexecutive syndrome#Controversy|controversial]].&lt;ref name="Stuss et. al"&gt;Stuss, D.T. &amp; Alexander, M.P. (2007). Is there a dysexecutive syndrome? ''Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, 362'' (1481), 901-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Executive functioning]] is a theoretical construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning is not a unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Executive processes are integral to higher [[brain function]], particularly in the areas of goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, [[self-monitoring]], [[attention]], response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance.&lt;ref name="Jurado Rosselli"&gt;Jurado MB, Rosselli M (2007). The elusive nature of executive functions: a review of our current understanding. Neuropsychol Rev, 17(3):213–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.

Executive dysfunction does occur to a minor degree in all individuals on both short-term and long-term scales. In non-clinical populations, the activation of executive processes appears to inhibit further activation of the same processes, suggesting a mechanism for normal fluctuations in executive control.&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2007"&gt;Schmeichel, BJ (2007). Attention Control, memory updating, and emotion regulation temporarily reduce the capacity for executive control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136(2):241–55&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in executive functioning is also associated with both normal and clinical aging.&lt;ref name="Zelazo et al"&gt;Zelazo PD, Craik FI, Booth L (2004). Executive function across the life span. Acta Psychol (Amst), 115 (2–3):167–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which also points to the general role of memory in executive functioning.&lt;ref name="Bisiacchi"&gt;Bisiacchi PS, Borella E, Bergamaschi S, Carretti B, Mondini S (2008). Interplay between memory and executive functions in normal and pathological aging. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 30(6):723–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction appears to consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive control in the inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation.&lt;ref name="Nieuwen"&gt;Nieuwenhuis S, Broerse A, Nielen MM, de Jong R (2004). A goal activation approach to the study of executive function: an application to antisaccade tasks. Brain Cogn. 56(2):198–214. Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"/&gt; Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;Avila C, Barros A, Ortet G, Parcet MA &amp; Ibanez M I (2003). Set-shifting and sensitivity to reward: A possible dopamine mechanism for explaining disinhibitory disorders. Cognition and Emotion, 17, 951–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and [[aggressive behaviour]] in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in [[working memory]] capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[hyperemotionality]].&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2008"&gt;Schmeichel BJ, Volokhov RN &amp; Demaree HA (2008). Working memory capacity and the Self-Regulation of Emotional Expression and Experience" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 95(6), 1526–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Barkley]] proposed a hybrid model of the role of behavioural disinhibition in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;

Other common and distinctive symptoms of executive dysfunction include utilization behaviour, which is compulsive manipulation/use of nearby objects due simply to their presence and accessibility (rather than a functional reason); and [[imitation]] behaviour, a tendency to rely on imitation as a primary means of [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann MW, &amp; Bill PLA (1992). The environmental dependency syndrome, imitation behaviour and utilization behaviour as presenting symptoms of bilateral frontal lobe infarction due to moyamoya disease. South African Medical Journal, 81(5): 271–73&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that executive set shifting is a co-mediator with [[episodic memory]] of [[Children's use of information#Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)|feeling-of-knowing]] (FOK) accuracy, such that executive dysfunction may reduce FOK accuracy.&lt;ref name="Perrotin"&gt;Perrotin A, Tournell L, Isingrini M (2008). Executive functioning and memory as potential mediators of the episodic feeling-of-knowing accuracy" ''Brain and Cognition'' 67:76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=A |last2=Windmann |first2=S |last3=McKenna |first3=P |last4=Güntürkün |first4=O |date=May 2007 |title=Creative thinking in schizophrenia: the role of executive dysfunction and symptom severity |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17453904 |doi=10.1080/13546800601046714}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm [[etiology]] for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of [[psychosis]] are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/[[schizotypy]] due to [[dopamine]] overlap.&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;Keshavan MS, Sujata M, Mehra A, Montrose DM, Sweeney JA (2003). Psychosis proneness and ADHD in young relatives of schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia Research, 59(1), 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
The cause of executive dysfunction is heterogeneous,&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"&gt;Nigg JT (2006). What causes ADHD?: Understanding what goes wrong and why. New York, NY: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-267-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as many [[neurocognitive]] processes are involved in the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term memory play a role in the severity of executive dysfunction through dynamic interaction with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.

Executive processes are closely integrated with memory retrieval capabilities for overall cognitive control; in particular, goal/task-information is stored in both short-term and long-term memory, and effective performance requires effective storage and retrieval of this information.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"&gt;Verbruggen F, Logan GD. (2008). Long-term aftereffects of response inhibition: memory retrieval, task goals, and cognitive control. J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform, 34(5):1229–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction characterizes many of the symptoms observed in numerous [[#Executive dysfunction in clinical populations|clinical populations]]. In the case of [[acquired brain injury]] and neurodegenerative diseases there is a clear neurological etiology producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, [[syndromes]] and [[Mental disorder|disorders]] are defined and diagnosed based on their symptomatology rather than etiology. Thus, while Parkinson's disease, a [[neurodegenerative]] condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as [[ADHD|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
As previously mentioned, executive functioning is not a unitary concept.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to pinpoint the exact regions of the brain that lead to executive dysfunction, producing a vast amount of often conflicting information indicating wide and inconsistent distribution of such functions. A common assumption is that disrupted executive control processes are associated with pathology in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] brain regions.&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark C, Gallo J, Glosser G, Grossman M (2002). Memory encoding and retrieval in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychology. 16(2); 190–96&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported to some extent by the primary literature, which shows both pre-frontal activation and communication between the pre-frontal cortex and other areas associated with executive functions such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berquin 1998"&gt;Berquin PC, Giedd JN, Jacobsen LK, Hamburger SD, Krain AL, Rapoport JL, Castellanos FX (1998). Cerebellum in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A morphometric MRI study" ''Neurology'' 50, 1087–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases of executive dysfunction, deficits are attributed to either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]] has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter P, Just M &amp; Reichle E (2000). Working memory and executive function: evidence from neuroimaging. Current Opinion in Neurobiology. 10; 195–99&lt;/ref&gt; Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to be the primary site of cortical activation during these tasks.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"&gt;Dougherty D, Ottowitz W, Savage C (2002).

Harvard Review of Psychology. 10(2); 86–99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson's disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the [[globus pallidus]]&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; and appear to be the genuine result of [[basal ganglia]] damage.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt;

With substantial cognitive load, fMRI signals indicate a common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Caparelli E, Chang L, Ernst T et al. (2006). Different activation patterns for working memory load and visual attention load. Brain Research. 158–65&lt;/ref&gt; This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both a direct and an indirect circuit.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; This main circuit originates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex and then projects through the [[striatum]] and [[thalamus]] to return to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt;

Not surprisingly, plaques and tangles in the frontal cortex can cause disruption in functions as well as damage to the connections between prefrontal cortex and the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Clark"/&gt; Another important point is in the finding that structural [[MRI]] images link the severity of white matter lesions to deficits in cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner, R. (2004). Memory and executive function in aging and AD: multiple factors that cause decline and reserve factors that compensate" ''Neuron'' 44;195–208&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging view suggests that cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt; A challenge for future research will be to map the multiple brain regions that might combine with each other in a vast number of ways, depending on the task requirements.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Certain genes have been identified with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman ''et al.'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;Friedman, et al (2008). Individual differences in executive functions are almost entirely genetic in origin. Journal of experimental psychology, 137(2), 201–10.&lt;/ref&gt; the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene ([[DRD4]]) with 7'-repeating [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD.&lt;ref name="Langley 2004"&gt;Langley K, Marshall L, Bree M van den, Thomas H, Owen M, O'Donovan M, Thapar A (2004). Association of the dopamine D4 receptor gene 7-repeat allele with neuropsychological test performance of children with ADHD" ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 161(1),133–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene ([[COMT]]) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting&lt;ref name="Tunbridge"&gt;Tunbridge EM, Bannerman DM, Sharp T, Harrison PJ (2004). Catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibition improves set-shifting performance and elevates stimulated dopamine release in the rat prefrontal cortex" ''Journal of Neuroscience'' 24(23):5331–35.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the experience of reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD.&lt;ref name="Sengupta 2008"&gt;Sengupta S, Grizenko N, Schmitz N, Schwartz G, Bellingham J, Polotskaia A, Stepanian MT, Goto Y, Grace AA, Joober R (2008). COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism and the modulation of task-oriented behavior in children with ADHD" ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' 2008, 13:3069–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"&gt;Alfimova MV, Golimbet VE, Gritsenko IK, Lezheiko TV, Abramova LI, Strel'tsova MA, Khlopina IV, Ebstein R (2007). Interaction of dopamine system genes and cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives and in healthy subjects from the general population. Neuroscience Behaviour Physiology, 37(7), 643–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and measurement ==
There are several measures that can be employed to assess the executive functioning capabilities of an individual. Although a trained non-professional working outside of an institutionalized setting can legally and competently perform many of these measures, a trained professional administering the test in a standardized setting will yield the most accurate results.&lt;ref name ="Daghar"&gt;Daghar A, Monchi O, Petre V et al (2001). "Wisconsin card revisited: distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging." ''The Journal of Neuroscience'' 21(19)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock drawing test ===
The Clock drawing test (CDT) is a brief cognitive task that can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test that can easily be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits.&lt;ref name ="Shulman"&gt;Shulman, K (2000). Clock drawing: Is it the ideal cognitive screening test? International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 15(6); 548–61&lt;/ref&gt; Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are not perceived as impacting the utility of the CDT.&lt;ref&gt;Emond J, Galasko D, Hanson L. et al (2008). Spatial deficits predict rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-verified dementia with lewy bodies. Neuropsychology. 22(6); 729–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of the CDT begins with the instruction to the participant to draw a clock reading a specific time (generally 11:10). After the task is complete, the test administrator draws a clock with the hands set at the same specific time. Then the patient is asked to copy the image.&lt;ref name ="Jeste"&gt;Jeste DV, Legendre SA, Rice VA, et al (2004). "The clock drawing test as a measure of executive dysfunction in elderly depressed patients." Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology. 17(190)&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in clock drawing are classified according to the following categories: omissions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, distortions, substitutions and additions.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; Memory, concentration, initiation, energy, mental clarity and indecision are all measures that are scored during this activity.&lt;ref name ="Damasio"&gt;Damasio H, Rudrauf D, Tranel D, Vianna E (2008). Does the clock drawing test have focal neuroanatomical correlates? Neuropsychology. 22(5); 553–62&lt;/ref&gt; Those with deficits in executive functioning will often make errors on the first clock but not the second.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; In other words, they will be unable to generate their own example, but will show proficiency in the copying task.

=== Stroop task ===
The cognitive mechanism involved in the [[Stroop task]] is referred to as directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"&gt;Biederam J, Faraone S, Monutaeux M, et al (2000). Neuropsychological functioning in nonreferred siblings of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder" ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' 109(2); 252–65&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word "red" is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say "blue" when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod C (1991). Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: An integrative review" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 109(20); 163–203&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.&lt;ref&gt;de Young R (2009)." Stroop task: A test of capacity to direct attention." EPLab: Measures. University of Michigan; http://www.snre.umich.edu/eplab/demos/st0/stroopdesc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisconsin card sorting test ===
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]] (WCST) is used to determine an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; These abilities are primarily determined by the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, which are crucial components of executive functioning;&lt;ref&gt;Andermahr I, Gaser C, Hager F et al (1996). Brain activation during cognitive stimulation with the Wisconsin Card Sorting test—a functional MRI study on healthy volunteers and schizophrenics. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging. 75(3); 145–57&lt;/ref&gt; making the WCST a good measure for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The WCST utilizes a deck of 128 cards that contains four stimulus cards.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards. Typically, children between ages 9 and 11 are able to show the cognitive flexibility that is needed for this test.&lt;ref name="Kirkham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkham|first=N.

=== Trail-making test ===
Another prominent test of executive dysfunction is known as the [[Trail-making test]]. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A &amp; Part B). Part B differs from Part A specifically in that it assesses more complex factors of motor control and perception.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"&gt;Arbuthnott K, Frank J (2000). Trail making test, Part B as a measure of executive control: validation using a set-switching paradigm. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 22(4); 518–28&lt;/ref&gt; Part B of the Trail-making test consists of multiple circles containing letters (A-L) and numbers (1-12). The participant's objective for this test is to connect the circles in order, alternating between number and letter (e.g. 1-A-2-B) from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Gaudino E, Geisler M, Squires N (1995). Construct validity in the trail making test: What makes part B harder? Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. 17(4); 529–35&lt;/ref&gt; The participant is required not to lift their pencil from the page. The task is also timed as a means of assessing speed of processing.&lt;ref name ="Conn"&gt;Conn H (1977). Trail-making and number-connection tests in the assessment of mental state in portal systemic encephalopathy. Digestive Diseases. 22(6); 541–50&lt;/ref&gt; Set-switching tasks in Part B have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"/&gt; Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and motor speed.&lt;ref name ="Conn"/&gt;

== In clinical populations ==
The executive system's broad range of functions relies on, and is instrumental in, a broad range of neurocognitive processes. Clinical presentation of severe executive dysfunction that is unrelated to a specific disease or disorder is classified as a [[Dysexecutive Syndrome|dysexecutive syndrome]], and often appears following damage to the [[frontal lobe]]s of the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Chan 2001"&gt;Chan, RC. (2001). Dysexecutive symptoms among a non-clinical sample: a study with the use of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. British Journal of Psychology, Aug., 92 (pt 3):551–65.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Executive dysfunction is implicated [[etiology|etiologically]] and/or [[co-morbidity|co-morbidly]] in many psychiatric illnesses, which often show the same symptoms as the dysexecutive syndrome. It has been assessed and researched extensively in relation to cognitive developmental disorders, [[psychotic disorders]], [[affective disorders]], and [[conduct disorder]]s, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and [[acquired brain injury]] (ABI).

Environmental dependency syndrome is a dysexecutive syndrome marked by significant behavioural dependence on environmental cues and is marked by excessive imitation and utilization behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"&gt;Lhermitte F (1986). Human autonomy and the frontal lobes. Part II: Patient behavior in complex and social situations: the "environmental dependency syndrome" ''Annals of Neurology'' 19(4):335–43.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in patients with a variety of etiologies including ABI, exposure to phendimetrazine tartrate,&lt;ref name="Hoffmann 2007"&gt;Hoffmann M (2007). Transient environmental dependency syndrome due to phendimetrazine tartrate. Eur Neurol, 58(1):49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; stroke, and various frontal lobe lesions.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
[[Schizophrenia]] is commonly described as a mental disorder in which a person becomes detached from reality because of disruptions in the pattern of thinking and perception.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; Although the etiology is not completely understood, it is closely related to dopaminergic activity and is strongly associated with both neurocognitive and genetic elements of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"/&gt; Individuals with schizophrenia may demonstrate [[amnesia]] for portions of their [[episodic memory]]. Observed damage to explicit, consciously accessed, memory is generally attributed to the fragmented thoughts that characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These fragmented thoughts are suggested to produce a similarly fragmented organization in memory during encoding and storage, making retrieval more difficult. However, [[implicit memory]] is generally preserved in patients with schizophrenia.

Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate spared performance on measures of visual and verbal attention and concentration, as well as on immediate digit span recall, suggesting that observed deficits cannot be attributed to deficits in attention or [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name ="Oram"&gt;Oram J, Geffen GM, Geffen LB, Kavanaugh DJ &amp; McGrath JJ (2005). Executive control of working memory in schizophrenia" ''Psychiatry Research'' 135, 8190&lt;/ref&gt; However, impaired performance was measured on psychometric measures assumed to assess higher order executive function. Working memory and multi-tasking impairments typically characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"/&gt; Persons with schizophrenia also tend to demonstrate deficits in response inhibition and cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Thoma &amp; Duam"&gt;Thoma P &amp; Duam I (2008). Working memory and multi-tasking in [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with and without comorbid substance use disorder" ''Addiction'' 103, 774–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients often demonstrate noticeable deficits in the central executive component of working memory as conceptualized by [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch]]. However, performance on tasks associated with the [[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]] are typically less affected.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Radvasnky"&gt;Radvansky GA (2006). Human Memory. United States of America: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, patients with schizophrenia show impairment to the central executive component of working memory, specific to tasks in which the visuospatial system is required for central executive control.&lt;ref name ="Oram"/&gt; The phonological system appears to be more generally spared overall.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity characterize attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with [[ADHD]] often experience problems with organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"&gt;Marchetta N, Hurks P, Krabbendam L &amp; Jolles J (2008). Interference control, working memory, concept shifting, and verbal fluency in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Neruopsychology, 22(1), 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; In both children and adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than matched controls on interference control, mental flexibility and verbal fluency.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"&gt;Barkley RA (1997). Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 121(1), 65–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"&gt;Rosenman S (2006). Reconsidering the attention deficit paradigm. Australasian Psychiatry, 14(2), 127–32&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; However, some research has suggested the possibility that the severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age as they learn to compensate for the aforementioned deficits.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.

Although ADHD has typically been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it has also been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits.&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output).&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.

=== Autism spectrum disorder ===
[[Autism]] is diagnosed based on the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. It is a disorder that is defined according to behaviour as no specific biological markers are known.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt; Due to the variability in severity and impairment in functioning exhibited by persons with autism, the disorder is typically conceptualized as existing along a continuum (or spectrum) of severity.

Individuals with autism commonly show impairment in three main areas of executive functioning:&lt;ref name ="Barnard"&gt;Barnard L, Muldoon K, Hasan R, O'Brien G &amp; Stewart M (2008). Profiling executive dysfunction in adults with autism and comorbid learning disability. Autism, 12(2), 125–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =" Gilotty"&gt;Gilotty L, Kenworthy L, Sirian L, Black D &amp; Wagner A (2002). Adaptive skills and executive function in autism spectrum disorders. Child Neuropsychology, 8(4), 241–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"&gt;Firestone P &amp; Dozois JA (2007). Abnormal Psychology: Perspectives (3rd edition.). Toronto: Pearson Education Canada Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"&gt;Hill EL (2004). Executive dysfunction in autism. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(1), 26–32&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fluency.''' Fluency refers to the ability to generate novel ideas and responses. Although adult populations are largely underrepresented in this area of research, findings have suggested that children with autism generate fewer novel words and ideas and produce less complex responses than matched controls.
* '''Planning.''' Planning refers to a complex, dynamic process, wherein a sequence of planned actions must be developed, monitored, re-evaluated and updated. Persons with autism demonstrate impairment on tasks requiring planning abilities relative to typically functioning controls, with this impairment maintained over time. As might be suspected, in the case of autism comorbid with learning disability, an additive deficit is observed in many cases.
* '''Flexibility.''' Poor mental flexibility, as demonstrated in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some research has suggested that individuals with autism experience a sort of 'stuck-in-set' perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.

Although there has been some debate, inhibition is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism.&lt;ref name ="Barnard"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; However, performance on the [[Stroop task]], for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; In this light, it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.

In general, individuals with autism show relatively spared performance on tasks that do not require [[mentalization]].&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: use of desire and emotion words, sequencing behavioural pictures, and the recognition of basic facial emotional expressions. In contrast, individuals with autism typically demonstrated impaired performance on tasks that do require mentalizing.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: false beliefs, use of belief and idea words, sequencing [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] pictures, and recognizing complex emotions such as admiring or scheming.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
[[Bipolar disorder]] is a mood disorder that is characterized by both highs (mania) and lows (depression) in mood. These changes in mood sometimes alternate rapidly (changes within days or weeks) and sometimes not so rapidly (within weeks or months).&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt; Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"&gt;Robinson LJ, Thompson JM, Gallagher P, Goswami U, Young AH, Ferrier IN &amp; Moore PB (2006). A meta-analysis of cognitive deficits in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder" ''Journal of Affective Disorders'' 93, 105–15&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally,&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt; indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice. Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as being volumetrically different in individuals with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt;

Individuals affected by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that are independent of affective state.&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt;&lt;ref name =" Glahn"&gt;Glahn DC, Bearden CE, Barguil M, Barrett J, Reichenberg A, Bowden CL, Soars JC &amp; Velligan DI (2007). The neurocognitive signature of psychotic bipolar disorder. Journal of Biology Psychiatry, 62, 910–16&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted. It has been suggested that a "stable dys-regulation of prefrontal function or the subcortical-frontal circuitry [of the brain] may underlie the cognitive disturbances of bipolar disorder".&lt;ref name ="Dixon"&gt;Dixon T, Kravariti E, Frith C, Murray RM &amp; McGuire PK (2004). Effect of symptoms on executive function in bipolar illness" ''Psychological Medicine'' 34, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the [[formal thought disorder]] that is a feature of mania.&lt;ref name ="Dixon"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of [[psychosis]] demonstrated greater impairment on measures of executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis&lt;ref name ="Glahn"/&gt; suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.

=== Parkinson's disease ===
[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) primarily involves damage to subcortical brain structures and is usually associated with movement difficulties, in addition to problems with memory and thought processes.&lt;ref name ="Ward"&gt;Ward J (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Persons affected by PD often demonstrate difficulties in [[working memory]], a component of executive functioning. Cognitive deficits found in early PD process appear to involve primarily the fronto-executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"&gt;Schneider JS (2007). Behavioral persistence deficit in Parkinson's disease patients. Journal of Neurology, 14, 300–04&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies of the role of dopamine in the cognition of PD patients have suggested that PD patients with inadequate dopamine supplementation are more impaired in their performance on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Grossman"&gt;Grossman M, Lee C, Morris J, Stern MB &amp; Hurtig H (2002). Assessing resource demands during sentence processing in Parkinson's disease. Brain and Language, 80, 603–16&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that dopamine may contribute to executive control processes. Increased distractibility, problems in set formation and maintaining and shifting attentional sets, deficits in executive functions such as self-directed planning, problems solving, and working memory have been reported in PD patients.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt; In terms of working memory specifically, persons with PD show deficits in the areas of: a) spatial working memory; b) [[central executive]] aspects of working memory; c) loss of [[episodic memories]]; d) locating events in time.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grossman"/&gt;

'''Spatial working memory.'''
PD patients often demonstrate difficulty in updating changes in spatial information and often become disoriented. They do not keep track of spatial contextual information in the same way that a typical person would do almost automatically. Similarly, they often have trouble remembering the locations of objects that they have recently seen, and thus also have trouble with encoding this information into long-term memory.

'''Central executive aspects.'''
PD is often characterized by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one's stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy that may be more appropriate in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter problems of a higher level of difficulty.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt;

'''Loss of episodic memories.'''
The loss of episodic memories in PD patients typically demonstrates a temporal gradient wherein older memories are generally more preserved than newer memories. Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson's than in [[Alzheimer's]], the opposite is true for event data memories.

'''Locating events in time.'''
PD patients often demonstrate deficits in their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.

=== Treatment ===

==== Psychosocial treatment ====
Since 1997 there has been experimental and clinical practice of psychosocial treatment for adults with executive dysfunction, and particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Psychosocial treatment addresses the many facets of executive difficulties, and as the name suggests, covers academic, occupational and social deficits. Psychosocial treatment facilitates marked improvements in major symptoms of executive dysfunction such as time management, organization and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ramsay Rostain 2007"&gt;Ramsay JR &amp; Rostain AL (2007). Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults: Current status and future directions. Journal of Attention Disorders, 11(6), 624–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive-behavioral therapy and group rehabilitation ====
[[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) is a frequently suggested treatment for executive dysfunction, but has shown limited effectiveness. However, a study of CBT in a group rehabilitation setting showed a significant increase in positive treatment outcome compared with individual therapy. Patients' self-reported symptoms on 16 different ADHD/executive-related items were reduced following the treatment period.&lt;ref name="Virta 2008"&gt;Virta M, Vedenpää A, Grönroos N, Chydenius E, Partinen M, Vataja R, Kaski M, Iivanainen M (2008). Adults with ADHD benefit from cognitive-behaviorally oriented group rehabilitation: a study of 29 participants. Journal of Attention Disorders, 12(3), 218–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treatment for patients with acquired brain injury ====
The use of auditory stimuli has been examined in the treatment of dysexecutive syndrome. The presentation of auditory stimuli causes an interruption in current activity, which appears to aid in preventing "goal neglect" by increasing the patients' ability to monitor time and focus on goals. Given such stimuli, subjects no longer performed below their age group average IQ.&lt;ref name="Manly 2001"&gt;Manly T, Hawkins K, Evans J, Woldt K, Robertson IH (2002). Rehabilitation of executive function: facilitation of effective goal management on complex tasks using periodic auditory alerts" ''Neuropsychologia'' 40(3):271–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with acquired brain injury have also been exposed to goal management training (GMT). GMT skills are associated with paper-and-pencil tasks that are suitable for patients having difficulty setting goals. From these studies there has been support for the effectiveness of GMT and the treatment of executive dysfunction due to ABI.&lt;ref name="Levine 2000"&gt;Levine B, Robertson IH, Clare L, Carter G &amp; Hong J (2000).

=== Developmental context ===
An understanding of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their role in shaping the individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"&gt;De Boechorstraat V, Geurts H, Oosterlaan J et al (2001). How specific is a deficit of executive functioning for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"/&gt;

Some research has suggested a link between a child's abilities to gain information about the world around them and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"&gt;Barchfeld P, Kain W, Perner J (2002). Executive control and higher-order theory of mind in children at risk at ADHD. Austria: Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt; One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt; The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of [[theory of mind]] in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt;

Both ADHD and obesity are complicated disorders and each produces a large impact on an individual's social well being.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"&gt;Dempsey A, Dyehouse J (2008). The relationship between executive function, AD/HD, and obesity. Western Journal of Nursing Research. 30(8); 1026–27&lt;/ref&gt; This being both a physical and psychological disorder has reinforced that obese individuals with ADHD need more treatment time (with associated costs), and are at a higher risk of developing physical and emotional complications.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; The cognitive ability to develop a comprehensive self-construct and the ability to demonstrate capable emotion regulation is a core deficit observed in people with ADHD and is linked to deficits in executive function.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; Overall, low executive functioning seen in individuals with ADHD has been correlated with tendencies to overeat, as well as with emotional eating.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; This particular interest in the relationship between ADHD and obesity is rarely clinically assessed and may deserve more attention in future research.

It has been made known that young children with behavioral problems show poor verbal ability and executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor R, Hughes C (2006). Behavioral problems in 2-year-olds: links with individual differences in theory of mind, executive function and harsh parenting" ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry'' 47(5); 488–97&lt;/ref&gt; The exact distinction between parenting style and the importance of family structure on child development is still somewhat unclear. However, in infancy and early childhood, parenting is among the most critical external influences on child reactivity.&lt;ref name ="Dennis"&gt;Dennis T (2006). Self-regulation in preschools: the interplay of child approach reactivity, parenting and control capacities" ''Developmental Psychology'' 42(1); 84–97&lt;/ref&gt; In Mahoney's study of maternal communication, results indicated that the way mothers interacted with their children accounted for almost 25% of variability in children's rate of development.&lt;ref name ="Mahoney"&gt;Mahoney GJ (1988). Maternal communication style with mentally retarded children. American Journal of Mental Retardation, 93; 352–59&lt;/ref&gt; Every child is unique, making parenting an emotional challenge that should be most closely related to the child's level of emotional self-regulation (persistence, frustration and compliance).&lt;ref name ="Dennis"/&gt; A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems.&lt;ref name ="Herman"&gt;Herman B, Mahoney G, Perales F et al (2006). Responsive teaching: early intervention for children with down syndrome and other disabilities. Down Syndrome Research and Practice&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the principle of "active learning",&lt;ref name ="Herman"/&gt; responsive teaching is a method that is currently being applauded as adaptable for individual caregivers, children and their combined needs&lt;ref name ="Mahoney"/&gt; The effect of parenting styles on the development of children is an important area of research that seems to be forever ongoing and altering. There is no doubt that there is a prominent link between parental interaction and child development but the best child rearing technique continues to vary amongst experts.

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The prefrontal lobe controls two related executive functioning domains. The first is mediation of abilities involved in planning, problem solving, and understanding information, as well as engaging in working memory processes and controlled attention. In this sense, the prefrontal lobe is involved with dealing with basic, everyday situations, especially those involving metacognitive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"&gt;Ardila A (2008). On the evolutionary origins of executive functions. Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Florida International University&lt;/ref&gt; The second domain involves the ability to fulfill biological needs through the coordination of cognition and emotions which are both associated with the frontal and prefrontal areas.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt;

From an evolutionary perspective, it has been hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"&gt;Barkley RA (2001). The executive functions and self-regulation: An evolutionary neuropsychological perspective. Neuropsychology Review, 11(1), 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which gave rise to the need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

In a similar vein, some have argued that the unique metacognitive capabilities demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, over the course of the development of self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term social consequences over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

=== Education ===
In the classroom environment, children with executive dysfunction typically demonstrate skill deficits that can be categorized into two broad domains: a) self-regulatory skills; and b) goal-oriented skills.&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;McDougall A (2001).

Teachers play a crucial role in the implementation of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"&gt;Lerner JW &amp; Kline F (2006). Learning disabilities and related disorders: Characteristics and teaching strategies (10th ed.). United States of America: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.

Several factors should be considered in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"/&gt; It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout the course of the day can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.

People with executive dysfunction have a slower cognitive processing speed and thus often take longer to complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be frustrating for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt;

Moreover, some people with ADHD report experiencing frequent feelings of drowsiness.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown TE (2008). Describing Six Aspects of a Complex Syndrome. http://www.drthomasebrown.com/pdfs/Executive_Functions_by_Thomas_Brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can hinder their attention for lectures, readings, and completing assignments. Individuals with this disorder have also been found to require more stimuli for information processing in reading and writing.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Slow processing may manifest in behavior as signaling a lack of motivation on behalf of the learner. However, slow processing is reflective of an impairment of the ability to coordinate and integrate multiple skills and information sources.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main concern with individuals with autism regarding learning is in the imitation of skills.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism tend to be dependent on the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Being attentive and focused for people with Tourette's syndrome is a difficult process. People affected by this disorder tend to be easily distracted and act very impulsively.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt; That is why it is very important to have a quiet setting with few distractions for the ultimate learning environment. Focusing is particularly difficult for those who are affected by Tourette's syndrome comorbid with other disorders such as ADHD or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], it makes focusing very difficult.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;Gaffney GR (2005). Tourette Syndrome. University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329091227/http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html |date=2009-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these individuals can be found to repeat words or phrases consistently either immediately after they are learned or after a delayed period of time.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt;

=== Criminal behaviour ===

Prefrontal dysfunction has been found as a marker for persistent, criminal behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"&gt;Barbosa M, Monteiro L (2008). Recurrent criminal behaviour and executive dysfunction. The Spanish Journal of Psychology, 259–65&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex is involved with mental functions including; affective range of emotions, forethought, and self-control.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Moreover, there is a scarcity of mental control displayed by individuals with a dysfunction in this area over their behavior, reduced flexibility and self-control and their difficulty to conceive behavioral consequences, which may conclude in unstable (or criminal) behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogilvie|first=James M.|last2=Stewart|first2=Anna L.|last3=Chan|first3=Raymond C.

Statistically significant relations have been discerned between anti-social behavior and executive function deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"/&gt; These findings relate to the emotional instability that is connected with executive function as a detrimental symptom that can also be linked towards criminal behavior. Conversely, it is unclear as to the specificity of anti-social behavior to executive function deficits as opposed to other generalized neuropsychological deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"&gt;Lilenfeld S, Morgan A (2000).

Furthermore, some think the dysfunction cannot be entirely to blame.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; There are interacting environmental factors that also have an influence on the likelihood of criminal action. This theory proposes that individuals with this deficit are less able to control impulses or foresee the consequences of actions that seem attractive at the time (see above) and are also typically provoked by environmental factors. One must recognize that the frustrations of life, combined with a limited ability to control life events, can easily cause aggression and/or other criminal activities. Early brain Damage causes dopamine(epigentically) to select for "Seeking" behavior in the very short term...this is the window for existence for these individuals...the future has no meaning so consequences have no meaning

A '''flexible alternating current transmission system''' (FACTS) is a system composed of static equipment used for the [[alternating current|AC]] [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical energy]]. It is meant to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability of the network. It is generally a [[power electronics]]-based system.

FACTS is defined by the [[IEEE]] as "a power electronic based system and other static equipment that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability."&lt;ref&gt;''Proposed terms and definitions for flexible AC transmission system(FACTS)'', IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Volume 12, Issue 4, October 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;1848–1853. {{DOI|10.1109/61.634216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Siemens "FACTS Increase the reliability of AC grids and reduce power delivery costs. They improve transmission quality and efficiency of power transmission by supplying inductive or reactive power to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/power-transmission/facts/ Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) - Siemens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[Image:FACTS theory1.PNG|thumb|Transmission on a no-loss line.]]
[[Image:FACTS theory series compensation.PNG|thumb|Series compensation.]]
[[Image:FACTS theory shunt compensation1.PNG|thumb|Shunt compensation.]]

===Shunt compensation===
In shunt compensation, power system is connected in [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] (parallel) with the FACTS. It works as a controllable [[current source]].  Shunt compensation is of two types:

;Shunt capacitive compensation: This method is used to improve the [[power factor]]. Whenever an inductive load is connected to the transmission line, power factor lags because of lagging load current. To compensate, a shunt capacitor is connected which draws current leading the source [[voltage]]. The net result is improvement in power factor.

;Shunt inductive compensation: This method is used either when charging the [[transmission line]], or, when there is very low load at the receiving end. Due to very low, or no load&amp;nbsp;– very low current flows through the transmission line. Shunt capacitance in the transmission line causes voltage amplification ([[Ferranti effect]]). The receiving end voltage may become double the sending end voltage (generally in case of very long transmission lines). To compensate, shunt inductors are connected across the transmission line. The power transfer capability is thereby increased depending upon the power equation

&lt;math&gt;
P=\left(\frac{EV}{X}\right)\sin(\delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta =&lt;/math&gt; power angle

==Theory==

In the case of a no-loss line, voltage magnitude at the receiving end is the same as voltage magnitude at the sending end: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V.
Transmission results in a phase lag &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; that depends on line reactance X.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\underline{V_s}&amp;=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) +jV \sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
\underline{V_r}&amp;=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)-jV \sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
\underline{I}&amp;=\frac{\underline{V_s}-\underline{V_r}}{jX}=\frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As it is a no-loss line, active power P is the same at any point of the line:

&lt;math&gt;P_s=P_r=P=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}=\frac{V^2}{X}\sin(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;

Reactive power at sending end is the opposite of reactive power at receiving end:

&lt;math&gt;Q_s=-Q_r=Q=V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}{X}=\frac{V^2}{X}(1-\cos \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--Thus, active power is &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{V^2}{X}\sin \delta&lt;/math&gt; whereas reactive power is &lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{V^2}{X}(1-cos \delta)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
As &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is very small, active power mainly depends on &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; whereas reactive power mainly depends on voltage magnitude.

===Series compensation===
FACTS for series compensation modify line impedance: X is decreased so as to increase the transmittable active power. However, more reactive power must be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P&amp;=\frac{V^2}{X-Xc}\sin(\delta)\\
Q&amp;=\frac{V^2}{X-Xc}(1-\cos \delta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Shunt compensation===

Reactive current is injected into the line to maintain voltage magnitude. Transmittable active power is increased but more reactive power is to be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P&amp;=\frac{2V^2}{X}\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
Q&amp;=\frac{2V^2}{X}\left[1-\cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\right]   
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Projects==
The '''Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail''' features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]]. The "trail offers an adventurous opportunity for heritage, recreational, and ecological tourism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Oriskany''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: The largest artificial reef in the world, this wreck was named a Top 25 U.S. Dive Site in 2014 by Scuba Diving magazine.
Depth: 80–212 feet
Sink Date: May 17, 2006
Nicknamed the "Great Carrier Reef," the USS Oriskany, also known as the "Mighty O," was sunk after serving in the Pacific and earning battle stars for service in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Located 22 miles off the coast of Pensacola and submerged in more than 200 feet of water, this shipwreck offers exploration for divers of all skills and a myriad of pelagic and sedentary marine life.

===''YDT-14''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: After years of training US Navy divers, this shipwreck is now a dive destination itself.
Depth: 90 feet
Sink Date: April 2000
Gulf storms have buried this diving tender to her decks, but the upper structure around 65 feet below sea level offers boundless exploration for divers.

===''San Pablo''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: This ship is steeped in a history of foreign spies, espionage and secret military operations.
Depth: 80 feet
Sink Date: August 11, 1944
Launched from Belfast, Ireland, in 1915, San Pablo started her life as a fruit transport running bananas from Central America to the United States. Early during World War II she was sunk by a U-boat in Costa Rica and refloated. In August 1944 amid rampant rumors of foreign spies and espionage, San Pablo exploded off Pensacola's coast, hence her local name "Russian Freighter." Recently declassified documents reveal that San Pablo was actually destroyed in a top-secret U.S. military operation testing an experimental weapon system. American agents sank the freighter with a radio-controlled boat carrying over 3,000 lbs. of explosives. Her wreckage is scattered across the seafloor where divers can explore boilers, refrigeration coils and huge sections of twisted metal, all home to an impressive array of marine life.

===''Pete Tide II''===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Three levels of decks offer boundless exploration in this upright underwater artificial reef.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: 1993
An offshore oilfield supply vessel, this upright wreck boasts three levels of superstructure and an intact pilothouse making it home to mesmerizing schools of fish.

===Three Coal Barges===

City: Pensacola, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Shallow wreckage is ideal for beginning divers to practice.
Depth: 50 feet
Sink Date: 1974
Sunk in an emergency operation to avoid the barges running ashore, these three barges lie end-to-end in less than 50 feet of water, creating a thriving habitat for marine life and a shallow destination for diving and snorkeling.

===''Miss Louise''===

City: Destin, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Shallow waters make for an ideal dive training site.
Depth: 60 feet
Sink Date: 1997
A push tug, Miss Louise sits upright in 60 feet of water, brimming with marine life and serving as a great site for novice and intermediate divers.

===''Black Bart''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Appliances {including the ship's toilet} remain intact in the Head and Galley, offering unique exploration for divers.
Depth: 85 feet
Sink Date: 1993
Sunk in memory of Navy Supervisor of Salvage Captain Charles "Black Bart" Bartholomew, this oilfield supply vessel remains largely intact with its wheelhouse {40 foot depth}, deck {66 foot depth} and open cargo holds {80 foot depth}.

===''Fami Tugs''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Mother Nature rearranged this artificial reef, picking up one of the two tugs and situating it on top of the other for a most unusual diving experience.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: 2003
Once resting bow-to-bow and joined by a 30-foot tether, a storm picked up one of the sunken tugs and placed it directly atop the other, allowing divers to enjoy two shipwrecks at once and serving as a reminder to visitors of the power of the sea.

===USS ''Accokeek''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: With more than 50 years of service around the world, this tug led an exciting career above water before her final destination to the ocean floor.
Depth: 100 feet

Claim to Fame: Another testament to the swirls of the sea, this ship originally laid on her side at the ocean's floor before being righted by a hurricane in 1995.
Depth: 80 feet
Sink Date: May 19, 1987
A World War II minesweeper that survived a midget submarine attack and a kamikaze raid, the USS Strength offers divers a fascinating tour of a large artificial reef, including an impressive goliath grouper.

===USS ''Chippewa''===

City: Panama City Beach, Fla.
Claim to Fame: This tugboat is known for breaking speed records during her U.S. Navy tenure.
Depth: 100 feet
Sink Date: Feb. 8, 1990
Sunk as a Navy training platform for the Panama City Experimental Dive Unit in 1990, the USS Chippewa now sits upright on the bottom in 100 feet of water offering a great dive for spotting marine life.

===''Vamar''===

City: Port St. Joe, Fla.
Claim to Fame: Made famous as a support ship for Admiral Richard Byrd's 1928 Antarctic expedition, the Vamar sunk under mysterious circumstances.
Depth: 25 feet
Sink Date: March 21, 1942
Sunk under mysterious circumstances during a trip to carry lumber to Cuba in 1942, the Vamar now lies in just 25 feet of water, offering a large steam engine, bilge keels and a wide variety of marine life for divers and snorkelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail Media Kit|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/media-kit.html|website=floridapanhandledivetrail.com|publisher=Florida Public Archaeology Network|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mardi Gras Shipwreck===

In May 2007, an expedition, led by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and funded by the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC) under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study a wreck site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the OGGC. As part of the educational outreach [[Nautilus Productions]] in partnership with [[BOEM]], Texas A&amp;M University, the Florida Public Archaeology Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FPAN Home|url=http://www.flpublicarchaeology.org/|website=Florida Public Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Veolia Environmental produced a one-hour HD documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the project, short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition. The [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] was tasked with the conservation and analysis of the material recovered from the wreck site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation Mardi Gras Project|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/mardigras/|website=http://nautarch.tamu.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6099">[[File:HaddaGenius.JPG|thumb|right|The "Genius with flowers", Hadda, Gandhara. 2-3rd century CE. [[Musée Guimet]].]]

'''Haḍḍa''' ({{lang-ps|هډه}}) is a [[Greco-Buddhist]] archeological site located in the ancient region of [[Gandhara]], ten kilometers south of the city of [[Jalalabad]], in the [[Nangarhar Province]] of eastern [[Afghanistan]].

==Background==
Some 23,000 Greco-Buddhist sculptures, both clay and plaster, were excavated in Hadda during the 1930s and the 1970s. The findings combine elements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] in an almost perfect Hellenistic style.

[[Image:HaddaBodhisattva.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Bodhisattva]] and [[Chandeka]], Hadda, 5th century CE]]
{{History of Afghanistan}}
Although the style of the artifacts is typical of the late Hellenistic 2nd or 1st century BCE, the Hadda sculptures are usually dated (although with some uncertainty), to the 1st century CE or later (i.e. one or two centuries afterward). This discrepancy might be explained by a preservation of late Hellenistic styles for a few centuries in this part of the world.  However it is possible that the artifacts actually were produced in the late Hellenistic period.

Given the antiquity of these sculptures and a technical refinement indicative of artists fully conversant with all the aspects of Greek sculpture, it has been suggested that Greek communities were directly involved in these realizations, and that "the area might be the cradle of incipient Buddhist sculpture in [[Indo-Greek]] style".&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, ''The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity'' ({{ISBN|0-691-03680-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of many of the works at Hadda is highly Hellenistic, and can be compared to sculptures found at the [[Bassae|Temple of Apollo in Bassae, Greece]].

The [[toponym]] Hadda has its origins in [[Sanskrit]] haḍḍa n. m., "a bone", or, an unrecorded *haḍḍaka, adj., "(place) of bones". The former - if not a fossilized form - would have given rise to a Haḍḍ in the subsequent vernaculars of northern India (and in the [[Old Indic]] loans in modern Pashto). The latter would have given rise to the form ''Haḍḍa'' naturally and would well reflect the belief that Hadda housed a bone-relic of Buddha. The term haḍḍa is found as a loan in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] haḍḍ, n., id. and may reflect the linguistic influence of the original pre-Islamic population of the area.

==Works of art==
A sculptural group excavated at the Hadda site of Tapa-i-Shotor represents [[Buddha]] surrounded by perfectly Hellenistic [[Herakles]] and [[Tyche]] holding a [[cornucopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg See image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731041835/www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg |date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only adaptation of the Greek iconography is that Herakles holds the thunderbolt of [[Vajrapani]] rather than his usual club.

Other attendants to the Buddha have been excavated which display manifest Hellenistic styles, such as the "Genie au Fleur", today in Paris at the [[Guimet Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1906/19060665.jpg See image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130103001644/www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1906/19060665.jpg |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist scriptures==
It is believed the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts-indeed the oldest surviving Indian manuscripts of any kind-were recovered around Hadda. Probably dating from around the 1st century CE, they were written on bark in [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]] using the [[Kharoṣṭhī]] script, and were unearthed in a clay pot bearing an inscription in the same language and script. They are part of the long-lost canon of the [[Sarvastivadin]] Sect that dominated [[Gandhara]] and was instrumental in Buddhism's spread into central and east Asia via the [[Silk Road]]. The manuscripts are now in the possession of the [[British Library]].

==Destruction==
Hadda is said to have been almost entirely destroyed in the fighting during the civil war in [[Afghanistan]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
There were also many works of art lost as a result of the civil war. One of the worst of the casualties was the loss of two statues. The Red Mountain range in Bamiyan that once housed two giant statues of the Buddha, on cliff faces, besides smaller structures of archaeological significance. The two big statues, dating back to the 5th or 6th century CE, were the largest of all Buddhist statues so far attested in the world. Only remnants of these statues were left behind.

== Origin ==
The horse shoe metaphor was used as early as during the [[Weimar Republic]] to describe the ideology of the [[Black Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Backes|first=Uwe|author-link=Uwe Backes|title=Politischer Extremismus in demokratischen Verfassungsstaaten|trans-title=Political Extremism in Democratic Constitutional States|language=de|location=Wiesbaden|publisher=Springer|date=1989|page=251-252|isbn=978-3-531-11946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
In a 2006 book, political scientist Jeff Taylor wrote: "It may be more useful to think of the Left and the Right as two components of populism, with elitism residing in the Center. The political spectrum may be linear, but it is not a straight line. It is shaped like a horseshoe".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jeff (2006), Where Did the Party Go? (University of Missouri Press), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, the term was used when discussing an alleged resurgent hostility towards Jews and [[new antisemitism]] from both the far-left and the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Tzvi|last = Fleischer|date = 31 October 2006|title = The Political Horseshoe again|url = http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2006/31-11/scribb31-11.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110516212834/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2006/31-11/scribb31-11.htm|archivedate = 16 May 2011|quote = I think Mr. Loewenstein has done a good job demonstrating why many people believe, as the "political horseshoe" theory states, that there is a lot more common ground between the far left, where Loewenstein dwells politically, and the far right views of someone like Betty Luks than people on the left would care to admit.|work = Australia/Israel Review|publisher = [[AIJAC]]|accessdate = 27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, it was left-wing populism ("Die Linke"); in Austria it was a bunch of right-wing parties that garnered almost 30% in the 2008 election.

In 2015, reformist Muslim [[Maajid Nawaz]] invoked the horseshoe theory while lamenting a common tendency on the far-left and far-right towards the compiling and publishing of "[[Blacklisting|lists of political foes]]",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news | title = The left's witchunt against Muslims| date = 2015-12-14|publisher= [[The Daily Beast]] | url = http://maajidnawaz.com/the-lefts-witch-hunt-against-muslims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding:
{{quote|As the political horseshoe theory attributed to Jean-Pierre Faye highlights, if we travel far-left enough, we find the very same sneering, nasty and reckless bully-boy tactics used by the far-right. The two extremes of the political spectrum end up meeting like a horseshoe, at the top, which to my mind symbolizes totalitarian control from above. In their quest for ideological purity, Stalin and Hitler had more in common than modern neo-Nazis and far-left agitators would care to admit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In a recent article for [[Eurozine]] titled "How Right is the Left?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = How Right is the Left?| date = 2018-05-15| publisher = [[Eurozine]]| url = https://www.eurozine.com/how-right-is-the-left/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyrylo Tkachenko wrote about the common cause found recently between the far-left and the far-right in [[Ukraine]]:
{{quote|The pursuit of a common political agenda is a trend discernible at both extremes of the political spectrum. Though this phenomenon manifests itself primarily through content-related overlaps, I believe there are good reasons to refer to it as a red-brown alliance. Its commonalities are based on shared anti-liberal resentment. Of course, there remain palpable differences between far left and the far right. But we should not underestimate the dangers already posed by these left-right intersections, as well as what we might lose if the resentment-driven backlash becomes mainstream.}}

== Criticism ==
The horseshoe theory has been criticized not just by people on both ends of the political spectrum who oppose being grouped with those they consider to be their polar opposites, but also by those who see horseshoe theory as oversimplifying political ideologies and as ignoring fundamental differences between them.

Simon Choat, a senior lecturer in political theory at [[Kingston University]], criticizes horseshoe theory from a leftist perspective. He argues that far-left and far-right ideologies only share similarities in the vaguest sense in that they both oppose the [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] ''[[status quo]]'', but the two sides both have very different reasons and very different aims for doing so. Choat uses the issue of globalization as an example. Both the far-left and the far-right attack [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]] and its elites, but have conflicting views on who those elites are and conflicting reasons for attacking them: {{quote|For the left, the problem with globalisation is that it has given free rein to capital and entrenched economic and political inequality. The solution is therefore to place constraints on capital and/or to allow people to have the same freedom of movement currently given to capital, goods, and services. They want an ''alternative'' globalisation. For the right, the problem with globalisation is that it has corroded supposedly traditional and homogeneous cultural and ethnic communities – their solution is therefore to ''reverse'' globalisation, protecting national capital and placing further restrictions on the movement of people.&lt;ref name=choat&gt;Choat, Simon (May 12, 2017) [https://theconversation.com/horseshoe-theory-is-nonsense-the-far-right-and-far-left-have-little-in-common-77588 "‘Horseshoe theory’ is nonsense – the far right and far left have little in common"] ''The Conversation''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Choat also argues that although proponents of the horseshoe theory may cite examples of alleged history of collusion between [[Fascism|fascists]] and [[Communism|communists]], those on the far-left usually oppose the rise of far-right or fascist regimes in their countries. Instead, he argues that it has been centrists who have supported far-right and fascist regimes that they prefer in power over socialist ones.&lt;ref name=choat /&gt;

[[File:HumanTraces.jpg|thumb|right|First edition (publ. [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]])]]
'''''Human Traces''''' is a 2005 [[novel]] by [[Sebastian Faulks]], best known as the British author of ''[[Birdsong (novel)|Birdsong]]'' and ''[[Charlotte Gray (novel)|Charlotte Gray]]''. The novel took Faulks five years to write. It tells of two friends who set up a pioneering asylum in 19th-century Austria, in tandem with the evolution of psychiatry and the start of the [[First World War]].

==Plot overview==
Tracing the intertwined lives of Doctors Thomas Midwinter, who is English, and Jacques Rebière, from [[Brittany]], France, ''Human Traces'' explores the development of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] in the late 19th century, by way of excursions into first [[psychiatry|alienism]] then [[metaphysics]], [[human evolution]] and [[neuroscience]], before the search for what it means to be human takes us into a brief foray into the [[First World War]]. Central to the plot is the theory of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

Whilst some have criticised ''Human Traces'' as excessively [[expository]], detailed and [[didactic]], it has also been considered wide-ranging, ambitious and well written. It has enjoyed commercial success, having been a bestseller in the United Kingdom.

Faulks himself says of his novel:

'Human Traces was a [[Sisyphus|Sisyphean task]]. After spending five years in libraries reading up on madness, psychiatry and psychoanalysis (my office had charts and timelines and things plastered all over the walls), the act of finishing it felt like a bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21613136-5001986,00.html ''The Australian'', Books, 28 April 2007 'Parting with the art of war]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and mission ==
[[File:Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building.jpg|thumb|Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building]]
The ISP was founded by Yale Law Professor [[Jack Balkin]] in 1997 and celebrated its 15th year in 2012. It now hosts a number of initiatives, including the Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression, the Knight Law and Media Program, and the Thomson Reuters Initiative on Law and Technology. The center is housed on the fourth floor of 40 Ashmun Street in New Haven.

ISP fellows from around the globe come to pursue research and produce scholarship, in the form of books, articles in academic journals and popular publications, blog posts, and policy documents. Yale ISP faculty and fellows have also conducted major public policy reviews of current issues in technology and law, and written amicus briefs for cases appearing before the Supreme Court and US Courts of Appeal.

==Projects and initiatives==

===Access to Knowledge===

For several years, the ISP has collaborated on A2K projects with partner institutions in Egypt, Brazil, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/access-knowledge/ Access to Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt; This work has involved several workshops and conferences organized by ISP fellows, and culminated in a series of books, including ''Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in India"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R_-0-KVs5C0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Ramesh Subramarian]] and [[Lea Shaver]], and ''Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in Brazil"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fEP2smsHVCwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Lea Shaver]].

The '''G. V. Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics (IMP) of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут металофізики ім. Г. В. Курдюмова Національної академії наук України}})  is one of the oldest research institutions of physical science within the Academy.

The research institute was established in 1945 as a laboratory of the Black Metallurgy ([[Ferrous metallurgy|Ferrous Metallurgy]]) Institute. In 1955 it was turned into a separate research institute.

Currently, the Institute employs more than 300 researchers (together with several Full Members and Corresponding Members of the NASU) and around 300 peoples of supporting personnel. It has more than 20 scientific units (including the state-of-the-art hardware) which are grouped around several research programs.

Traditionally, the Institute is focused on fundamental research. At the same time, applied research on metals, their [[alloy]]s, and related nanotechnologies strengthen the Institute's activities.

The IMP is consistently ranked at the top of national academic institutions ranking. Besides, international reputation of IOP is growing constantly as prominent scientists from the Institute expand their activity to leading foreign research centers and universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12941">'''Lichen anatomy and physiology''' is very different from the anatomy and physiology of the [[fungus]] and/or [[algae]] and/or [[cyanobacteria]] that make up the [[lichen]] when growing apart from the lichen, either naturally, or in culture. The fungal partner is called the '''[[mycobiont]]'''. The photosynthetic partner, algae or cyanobacteria, is called the '''[[photobiont]]'''. The body of a lichens that does not contain reproductive parts of the fungus is called the '''[[thallus]]'''. The thallus is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately. The [[fungus]] surrounds the algal cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations. In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall, forming penetration pegs or [[haustoria]] similar to those produced by pathogenic fungi.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;F.S. Dobson (2000) Lichens, an illustrated guide to the British and Irish species. Richmond Publishing Co. Ltd., Slough, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Honegger&gt;R. Honegger (1988) Mycobionts. Chapter 3 in T.H. Nash (ed.) (1996) Lichen Biology. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-45368-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichens are capable of surviving extremely low levels of [[water]] content ([[poikilohydric]]).&lt;ref name="Nash2008-pp5-6"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Nash, Thomas H.|title=Lichen Biology|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-69216-8|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the re-configuration of membranes following a period of dehydration requires several minutes at least.

The algal or cyanobacterial cells are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]], and as in plants they [[redox|reduce]] atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. If a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can [[nitrogen fixation|fix atmospheric nitrogen]], complementing the activities of the green alga.

Although strains of [[cyanobacteria]] found in various [[cyanolichen]]s are often closely related to one another, they differ from the most closely related free-living strains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5580/357 Sciencemag.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The lichen association is a close symbiosis. It extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments, since many of the algal symbionts can live independently. A prominent example is the alga ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'' which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces. Lichen propagules ([[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called "fringe species" rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the “core species.”&lt;ref name="RaiBergman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.N. Rai|author2=B. Bergman|author3=Ulla Rasmussen|title=Cyanobacteria in Symbiosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM8nzztrTbEC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=2 June 2013|date=31 July 2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0777-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichen associations may be examples of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]] or even [[parasitism]],{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} depending on the species. [[Cyanobacteria]] in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen.

==Symbionts==

::''"Lichens are fungi that have discovered agriculture"'' - [[Trevor Goward]]&lt;ref name=LNA&gt;LICHEN BIOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, LICHENS OF NORTH AMERICA, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, [http://www.lichen.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Living as a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]] in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients, as about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life. The fungal partner may be an [[Ascomycete]] or [[Basidiomycete]].&lt;ref name=UCLS&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichensy.html Lichens: Systematics, University of California Museum of Paleontology]&lt;/ref&gt; Common algal partners are ''[[Trebouxia]]'', ''[[Pseudotrebouxia]]'', or ''[[Myrmecia (alga)|Myrmecia]]''. Common [[cyanobacterium]] partners include are ''[[Nostoc]]''&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt; or ''[[Scytonema]]''.&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt;

The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the [[Ascomycota]], with about 40% of species forming such an association.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"&gt;Kirk ''et al''., pp. 378–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as [[saprotroph]]s or [[parasite|plant parasites]] (for example, the [[Leotiales]], [[Dothideales]], and [[Pezizales]]). Other lichen fungi occur in only five [[order (biology)|orders]] in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders [[Graphidales]], [[Gyalectales]], [[Peltigerales]], [[Pertusariales]], and [[Teloschistales]]). Lichenized and nonlichenized fungi can even be found in the same genus or species.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont. Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned [[fungi imperfecti]]. Comparatively few [[Basidiomycetes]] are lichenized, but these include [[agarics]], such as species of ''[[Lichenomphalia]]'', [[clavarioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Multiclavula]]'', and [[corticioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Dictyonema]]''.

The [[autotroph]]ic symbionts occurring in lichens are a wide variety of simple, photosynthetic organisms commonly and traditionally known as algae. These symbionts include both [[prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] organisms. Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40 genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: [[Cyanophyceae]]; eukaryotic: [[Trebouxiophyceae]], [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Chlorophyceae]]) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.&lt;ref name=Friedl1996&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Photobionts |title=Lichen Biology|author=Friedl T, Büdel B. |editor-last=Nash III TH |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prokaryotes belong to the [[Cyanobacteria]], whose representatives are often called bluegreen algae. The bluegreen algae occur as symbionts in about 8% of the known lichens. The most commonly occurring genus is ''[[Nostoc]]''.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rikkinen J. |year=1995 |title=What's behind the pretty colors? A study on the photobiology of lichens |journal=Bryobrothera |volume=4 |pages=1–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the lichens contain eukaryotic autotrophs belonging to the [[Chlorophyta]] (green algae) or to the Xanthophyta ([[yellow-green algae]]). About 90% of all known lichens have a green alga as a symbiont, and among these, ''[[Trebouxia]]'' is the most common genus, occurring in about 40% of all lichens. The second most commonly represented green alga genus is ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]''. Overall, about 100 species are known to occur as autotrophs in lichens. All the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

A particular fungus species and algal species are not necessarily always associated together in a lichen. One fungus, for example, can form lichens with a variety of different algae. The [[thalli#thallus|thalli]] produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners will be similar, and the secondary metabolites identical, indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. Further, the same algal species can occur in association with different fungal partners. Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species. Rarely, the reverse can occur, and two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

Both the lichen and the fungus partner bear the same scientific name, and the lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungi.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt;

===Fungus component===

Depending on context, the entire lichen, or just the fungus that is part of the lichen. Both the lichen and the fungus that is a part of the lichen are currently (2014) given the same species name, which creates an ambiguity. An example of when "lichenized fungus" refers to just the fungus is when the fungus is grown in culture without a phycobiont. An example where "lichenized fungus" refers to the entire lichen is in a list of classified lichens.

Some fungi can only be found living on lichens ([[obligate]] [[parasite]]s), but are not considered part of the lichen. These are referred to as [[lichenolous fungi]].

===Photosynthetic component===

The photosynthetic component of a lichen is called the '''[[photobiont]]''' or '''[[phycobiont]]'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt; Sometimes the photobiont is a green algae ([[chlorophyta]]), sometimes a blue-green aglae ([[cyanobacteria]], not really an algae), and sometimes both. The layer of tissue containing the cells of the photobiont is called the "photobiontic layer".&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;

"[[Clorococcoid]]" means a green algae (Chlorophyta) that has single cells that are [[globose]], which is common in lichens.&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (a-f), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; This was once classified in the order [[Chlorococcales]], which you may find stated in older literature, but new DNA data shows many independent lines of evolution exist among this formerly large taxonomic group. [[Chlorococcales]] is now a relatively small order and may no longer include any lichen photobionts. [[Trebuxia]], once included here, is now considered to be in a separate class, [[Trebouxiophyceae]]. "[[trebouxioid]]" refers to members of this class or algae resembling them.

"'''[[Trebouxioid]]'''" means a clorococcoid green algae photobiont is in the genus ''[[Trebouxia]]'', or resembles a member of that genus, and is therefore presumably a member of the class [[Trebouxiophyceae]].&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (p-z), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyanolichens===

A [[cyanolichen]] is a lichen with a [[cyanobacteria]] as its main photosynthetic component ([[photobiont]]).&lt;ref name=ASLGAF/&gt;
Many cyanolichens are small and black, and have [[limestone]] as the substrate. Another cyanolichen group, the [[jelly lichen]]s ( e.g., from the genera ''[[Collema]]'' or ''[[Leptogium]]'') are large and [[foliose]] (e.g., species of ''[[Peltigera]]'', ''[[Lobaria]]'', and ''[[Degelia]]''. These lichen species are grey-blue, especially when dampend or wet. Many of these [[characterize]] the [[Lobarion]] communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the [[Celtic Rainforest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">'''Louis-Hugues Vincent''' (31 August 1872 - 30 December 1960) was a French [[Archeologist]], [[monk]] of the [[Dominican Order]], who was educated at Jerusalem's [[École Biblique]]. He undertook important archaeological research in [[Palestine (region)]], primarily during the [[Mandatory Palestine]] period.

==Biography==
He was born in 1872 in [[Isère]] in the commune of [[Vernioz]], near [[Lyon]]. Immediately after his Dominican [[Novitiate]] training, in 1891, he was sent to Jerusalem at the Biblical School ("[[École Biblique]]") of [[St. Stephen's Basilica, Jerusalem|St. Stephen's Basilica]], founded a year before by [[Joseph-Joseph Lagrange]]. Vincent remained there all his life, with the exception of long stays in France during the World Wars.
 
At the École Biblique, Louis Vincent studied and was ordained a Catholic priest. Soon he became one of the most learned scholars in the field of biblical archeology, including ceramics and ancient objects, lecturing on archeology at the school. He came to know all the archaeological sites in the Holy Land.

He carried out excavations with Father [[Roland de Vaux]] in [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]], now in the [[West Bank]].

He published many articles in the ''[[Revue Biblique]]'' journal, of which he was the editor-in-chief between 1931 and 1938.

His tomb is in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] in the courtyard of the Dominican convent near the [[Damascus Gate]].

==History==
Following the founding of an apprenticeship-training program in librarianship in 1897, the McGill Summer Library School was formally founded in 1904 under the jurisdiction of the University Library Committee to offer education in library administration. It was the first formal library education program in Canada, and one of the first university programs in librarianship outside of the United States. The School was renamed the Graduate School of Library Science in 1965, the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies in 1985, and the School of Information Studies in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15916">'''Methanogenesis''' or '''biomethanation''' is the formation of [[methane]] by [[microbe]]s known as [[methanogen]]s. Organisms capable of producing methane have been identified only from the [[Domain (biology)|domain]] [[Archaea]], a group [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] distinct from both [[eukaryote]]s and [[bacteria]], although many live in close association with anaerobic bacteria. The production of methane is an important and widespread form of microbial [[metabolism]]. In [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] environments, it is the final step in the decomposition of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]].  Methanogenesis is responsible for significant amounts of natural gas accumulations, the remainder being thermogenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Katz B.| title = ''Microbial processes and natural gas accumulations'' | journal = The Open Geology Journal | year = 2011 | volume = 5| pages = 75&amp;ndash;83|doi=10.2174/1874262901105010075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The origin, source, and cycling of methane in deep crystalline rock biosphere|year=2015|journal=Front.

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Methanogenesis cycle.png|thumb|320px|Cycle for methanogenesis, showing intermediates.]]

Methanogenesis in microbes is a form of [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thauer, R. K.|title=Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson|journal=Microbiology|year=1998|volume=144|pages=2377–2406|doi=10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methanogens do not use oxygen to respire; in fact, oxygen inhibits the growth of methanogens.  The terminal [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptor]] in methanogenesis is not oxygen, but carbon.  The carbon can occur in a small number of organic compounds, all with low molecular weights.  The two best described pathways involve the use of [[acetic acid]] or inorganic [[carbon dioxide]] as terminal electron acceptors:
:{{CO2|link=yes}} + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

During anaerobic respiration of carbohydrates, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acetate are formed in a ratio of 2:1 or lower, so H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes only ca. 33% to methanogenesis, with acetate contributing the greater proportion. In some circumstances, for instance in the [[rumen]], where acetate is largely absorbed into the bloodstream of the host, the contribution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanogenesis is greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Rolf|date=1999|title=Contribution of hydrogen to methane production and control of hydrogen concentrations in methanogenic soils and sediments|url=http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/3/193.abstract|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=28|pages=193–202|doi=10.1016/s0168-6496(98)00086-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, depending on pH and temperature, methanogenesis has been shown to use carbon from other small organic compounds, such as [[formic acid]] (formate), [[methanol]], [[methylamines]], [[tetramethylammonium]], [[dimethyl sulfide]], and [[methanethiol]].  The catabolism of the methyl compounds is mediated by methyl transferases to give methyl coenzyme M.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt;

===Proposed mechanism===
The biochemistry of methanogenesis involves the following coenzymes and cofactors: [[Coenzyme F420|F420]], [[coenzyme B]], [[coenzyme M]], [[methanofuran]], and [[methanopterin]].

The mechanism for the conversion of {{chem|CH|3|–S}} bond into methane involves a ternary complex of methyl coenzyme M and coenzyme B fit into a channel terminated by the axial site on nickel of the cofactor F430.  One proposed mechanism invokes electron transfer from Ni(I) (to give Ni(II)), which initiates formation of {{chem|CH|4}}.  Coupling of the coenzyme M [[thiyl radical]] (RS&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;) with HS coenzyme B releases a proton and re-reduces Ni(II) by one-electron, regenerating Ni(I).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Finazzo C, Harmer J, Bauer C, etal |title=Coenzyme B induced coordination of coenzyme M via its thiol group to Ni(I) of F&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; in active methyl-coenzyme M reductase |journal=J.

===Reverse methanogenesis===
Some organisms can oxidize methane, functionally reversing the process of methanogenesis, also referred to as the [[anaerobic oxidation of methane]] (AOM). Organisms performing AOM have been found in multiple marine and freshwater environments including methane seeps, hydrothermal vents, coastal sediments and sulfate-methane transition zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruff|first=S.

: SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; +  CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  + HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krüger M, Meyerdierks A, Glöckner FO, etal |title=A conspicuous nickel protein in microbial mats that oxidize methane anaerobically |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6968 |pages=878–81 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14685246 |doi=10.1038/nature02207 |bibcode = 2003Natur.426..878K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance in carbon cycle===
Methanogenesis is the final step in the decay of organic matter.  During the decay process, [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptors]] (such as [[oxygen]], [[ferric]] [[iron]], [[sulfate]], and [[nitrate]]) become depleted, while [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon dioxide]] accumulate.  Light organics produced by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also accumulate.  During advanced stages of organic decay, all electron acceptors become depleted except carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is a product of most catabolic processes, so it is not depleted like other potential electron acceptors.

Only methanogenesis and fermentation can occur in the absence of electron acceptors other than carbon.  Fermentation only allows the breakdown of larger organic compounds, and produces small organic compounds.  Methanogenesis effectively removes the semi-final products of decay: hydrogen, small organics, and carbon dioxide.  Without methanogenesis, a great deal of carbon (in the form of fermentation products) would accumulate in anaerobic environments.

==Natural occurrence==

===In ruminants===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1898 Testing Sheep for Methane Production.jpg|thumb|Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), [[CSIRO]]]]
[[Enteric fermentation]] occurs in the gut of some animals, especially ruminants. In the [[rumen]], anaerobic organisms, including methanogens, digest cellulose into forms nutritious to the animal.  Without these microorganisms, animals such as cattle would not be able to consume grasses. The useful products of methanogenesis are absorbed by the gut, but methane is released from the animal mainly by belching (eructation). The average cow emits around 250 liters of methane per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/innovations/stories/s1159618.htm ''Radio Australia'': "Innovations – Methane In Agriculture."] 15 August  2004. Retrieved 28 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, ruminants contribute about 25% of anthropogenic [[methane emissions]]. One method of methane production control in ruminants is by feeding them [[3-Nitrooxypropanol|3-nitrooxypropanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Hristov, A. N., et al., "An inhibitor persistently decreased enteric methane emission from dairy cows with no negative effect on milk production", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015, volume 112, 10663-10668. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.1504124112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Some humans produce [[flatulence|flatus]] that contains methane.  In one study of the [[feces]] of nine adults, five of the samples contained [[archaea]] capable of producing methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Miller TL|author2=Wolin MJ |author3=de Macario EC |author4=Macario AJ | title=Isolation of Methanobrevibacter smithii from human feces| journal=Appl Environ Microbiol| year=1982| volume=43| pages=227–32 |pmid=6798932 |pmc=241804 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6798932| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar results are found in samples of gas obtained from within the [[rectum]].

Even among humans whose flatus does contain methane, the amount is in the range of 10% or less of the total amount of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In plants===
Many experiments have suggested that [[leaf]] tissues of living plants emit methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kepler F, etal | title = ''Methane emissions from terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions'' | journal = Nature | year = 2006 | volume = 439 | issue = 7073 | pmid = 16407949| pages = 187&amp;ndash;191 | doi=  10.1038/nature04420 | bibcode=2006Natur.439..187K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has indicated that the plants are not actually generating methane; they are just absorbing methane from the soil and then emitting it through their leaf tissues.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/114/1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
Methanogens are observed in anoxic soil environments, contributing to the degradation of organic matter.  This organic matter may be placed by humans through landfill, buried as sediment on the bottom of lakes or oceans as sediments, and as residual organic matter from sediments that have formed into sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Le Mer, J.|author2=Roger, P.|title=Production, oxidation, Emission and Consumption of Methane by Soils: A Review|journal=European Journal of Soil Biology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=25–50|doi=10.1016/S1164-5563(01)01067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in global warming==
[[Atmospheric methane]] is an important [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[global warming potential]] 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (averaged over 100 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-2-5.html |contribution=Global Warming Potentials |title=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007  |year=2007 |accessdate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and methanogenesis in [[livestock]] and the decay of organic material is thus a considerable contributor to global warming. It may not be a net contributor in the sense that it works on organic material which used up atmospheric carbon dioxide when it was created, but its overall effect is to convert the carbon dioxide into methane which is a much more potent greenhouse gas.

Methanogenesis can also be beneficially exploited, to treat [[organic waste]], to produce useful compounds, and the methane can be collected and used as [[biogas]], a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-07/news/60902488_1_wet-waste-waste-management-household-waste|title=After Freedom Park, waste to light up Gandhinagar in Bengaluru
|last=Nair|first=Athira|work=Economic Times|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary pathway whereby most organic matter disposed of via [[landfill]] is broken down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ayoung/landfill.html DoE Report CWM039A+B/92] Young, A. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-terrestrial life==
{{See also|Methane#Extraterrestrial methane}}
The presence of atmospheric methane has a role in the scientific search for [[extra-terrestrial life]]. The justification is that methane in the atmosphere will eventually dissipate, unless something is replenishing it. If methane is detected (by using a [[spectrometer]] for example) this may indicate that life is, or recently was, present.
This was debated&lt;ref&gt;BBC article about methane as sign of life http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4295475.stm&lt;/ref&gt; when methane was discovered in the Martian atmosphere by M.J. Mumma of NASA's Goddard Flight Center, and verified by the [[Mars Express Orbiter]] (2004)&lt;ref&gt;European Space Agency, Methane in Martian Atmosphere http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMZ0B57ESD_0.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s atmosphere by the [[Huygens probe]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Space.Com article about methane on Huygens http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_huygens_update_050127.html&lt;/ref&gt; This debate was furthered with the discovery of 'transient', 'spikes of methane' on Mars by the [[Curiosity Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11297326/Life-on-Mars-Nasa-finds-first-hint-of-alien-life.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that [[atmospheric methane]] can come from volcanoes or other fissures in the planet's crust and that without an [[isotopic signature]], the origin or source may be difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist article about atmospheric methane https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7059&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Article about methane as sign of life http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1007_041007_mars_methane.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2017, NASA confirmed that the dive of the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini orbiter]] spacecraft on 28 October 2015 discovered the [[Enceladus]] plume which has all the ingredients for methanogenesis-based life forms to feed from. Previous results, published in March 2015, suggested hot water is interacting with rock beneath the sea; the new findings support that conclusion and add that the rock appears to be reacting chemically. From these observations scientists have determined that nearly 98 percent of the gas in the plume is water, about 1 percent is hydrogen and the rest is a mixture of other molecules including carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system|title=NASA Missions Provide New Insights into 'Ocean Worlds'|last=Northon|first=Karen|date=2017-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wurlitzer model 112 electric piano 1956.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Wurlitzer model 112 [[electric piano]] plugged into an [[instrument amplifier]].]] 
'''Electric music technology''' refers to [[musical instrument]]s and [[Sound recording|recording device]]s that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical [[electric piano]] (invented in 1929), the [[electric guitar]] (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical [[Hammond organ]] (developed in 1934) and the [[electric bass]] (invented in 1935). All of these electric instruments do not produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker cabinet]]s, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a [[guitar amplifier]]), electric bass (which uses a [[bass amplifier]]) and some electric organs (which use a [[Leslie speaker]] or similar cabinet) and most electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument.

Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small [[microphone]] diaphragm that can record sound waves on a [[phonograph]] (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record) or [[magnetic tape]]. The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE Publication Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone disc]] in 1889. For much of the 20th century, records were the most common way of selling sound recordings. The widespread availability of records and the development of [[radio broadcasting]] enabled a much larger proportion of people to listen to songs and pieces performed by the top artists, enabling the development of national and even international musical stars. In the 1970s, the [[compact cassette]] became a major consumer audio format. Advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979, which allowed consumers to listen to their favourite albums outside of their home.

==Electric instruments==

===Electric piano===
[[File:Rhodes Mk II 73 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Fender Rhodes|Rhodes Mark II Stage 73]] electric piano. It has to be plugged into an [[instrument amplifier]] or [[guitar amp]] to be heard by the performer and audience.]]
An [[electric piano]] is an electric [[musical instrument]] which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]]. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by [[Pick up (music technology)|magnetic pickups]], which are then connected to an [[instrument amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]] to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a [[synthesizer]], the electric piano is not an [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s; the 1929 ''Neo-[[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]]'' [[electric grand piano]] was among the first. Probably the earliest stringless model was [[Lloyd Loar]]'s [[Vivi-Tone]] Clavier. A few other noteworthy producers of electric pianos include Baldwin Piano and Organ Company and the [[Wurlitzer]] company.

Early electric piano recordings include [[Duke Ellington]]'s in 1955 and [[Sun Ra]]'s ''India'' as well as other tracks from the 1956 sessions included on his second album ''Super Sonic Jazz'' (aka ''Super Sonic Sounds''). The popularity of the electric piano began to grow in the late 1950s after [[Ray Charles]]'s 1959 hit record "[[What'd I Say]]", reaching its height during the 1970s, after which they were progressively displaced by more lightweight electronic pianos capable of piano-like sounds without the disadvantages of electric pianos' heavy weight and [[moving parts|moving mechanical parts]]. Another factor driving their development and acceptance was the progressive electrification of popular music and the need for a portable keyboard instrument capable of high-volume amplification. Musicians adopted a number of types of domestic electric pianos for rock and pop use. This encouraged their manufacturers to modify them for stage use and then develop models primarily intended for stage use.

Digital electronic [[stage piano]]s have largely replaced most of the original electro-mechanical instruments in the 2000s, due to the small size, low weight and versatility of digital instruments, which can produce a huge range of tones besides piano tones (e.g., emulations of [[Hammond organ]] sounds, synthesizer sounds, etc.). However, some performers still perform and record with vintage electric pianos. In 2009, [[Fender Rhodes]] produced a new line of electro-mechanical pianos, known as the Rhodes Mark 7 followed by an offering from [[Vintage Vibe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/vintage-vibe-electric-pianos/150018|title=Vintage Vibe Electric Pianos|author=Jon Regen|date=21 November 2012|publisher=[[Keyboard Magazine]]|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103122218/http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/vintage-vibe-electric-pianos/150018|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric guitar===
[[File:Kramer_XKG-20_sm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] XKG-20 electric guitar circa 1980.]]
An [[electric guitar]] is a [[guitar]] that uses a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct [[electromagnetic induction]]. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a [[loudspeaker]], so it is [[Guitar amplifier|amplified]] before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using [[Effects unit|electronic effect]]s such as [[reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|distortion]].

Invented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as [[jazz]] guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the [[big band]] format. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record included [[Les Paul]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[T-Bone Walker]], and [[Charlie Christian]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in [[pop music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology, Volume 2 |first1=Colin |last1=Hempstead |first2=William E. |last2=Worthington |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005 |isbn=1-57958-464-0|page=793 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wkIlnNjDWcC&amp;pg=PA793}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles. It served as a major component in the development of [[electric blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[rock music]], and many other genres of music.

Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars have a fixed [[bridge (guitar)|bridge]] or a spring-loaded hinged bridge that lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a [[vibrato]]. The sound of a guitar can be modified by [[extended technique|new playing techniques]] such as [[string bending]], [[tapping]], [[Hammer-on|hammering on]], using [[audio feedback]], or [[slide (guitar technique)|slide]] guitar playing. There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar, various types of hollow-body guitars, the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E, and the twelve-string electric guitar, which has six pairs of strings.

[[Popular music]] and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles: as a [[rhythm guitar]], which provides the [[Chord (music)|chord]] sequence or [[Chord progression|progression]] and sets the [[Beat (music)|beat]] (as part of a [[rhythm section]]), and as a [[lead guitar]], which is used to perform [[melody]] lines, melodic [[fill (music)|instrumental fill passages]], and [[guitar solo|solos]].

===Hammond organ===
[[File:Hammond c3 Emilio Muñoz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hammond C-3 electric organ.]]

The [[Hammond organ]] is an [[electronic organ#Early electric organs|electric organ]], invented by [[Laurens Hammond]] and John M. Hanert{{sfn|Bush|Kassel|2006|p=168}} and first manufactured in 1935.{{sfn|Corbin|2006|p=151}} Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal [[tonewheel]] near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the [[Leslie speaker]].

The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to [[Church (building)|churches]] as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven [[pipe organ]], or instead of a [[piano]]. It quickly became popular with professional [[jazz]] musicians, who found it a cheaper alternative to the [[big band]]. [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]'s use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[reggae]], as well as being an important instrument in [[progressive rock]].

The Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using [[integrated circuits]]. These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been, and the company went out of business in 1985. The Hammond name was purchased by the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation]], which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs. This culminated in the production of the "New B-3" in 2002, which provided an accurate recreation of the original B-3 organ using modern digital technology.

Hammond-Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as [[Korg]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] and [[Clavia]], have also achieved success in providing [[Clonewheel organ|emulations]] of the original tonewheel organs. The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as [[Native Instruments]] B4.

===Electric bass===
[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Two electric basses and a [[bass amplifier]]. This amplification setup is a "bass stack" approach, in which an amplifier (in this case a Hartke 5000) is plugged into separate speaker cabinets.]]

The [[electric bass]] (or bass guitar) is a [[stringed instrument]] played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, [[Slapping (music)|slapping]], popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or [[guitar pick|picking]] with a [[plectrum]], often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an [[electric guitar]], but with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[scale (string instruments)|scale]] length, and four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]],&lt;ref&gt;Bass guitar/Double Bass tuning E1=41.20&amp;nbsp;Hz, A1=55&amp;nbsp;Hz, D2=73.42&amp;nbsp;Hz, G2=98&amp;nbsp;Hz + optional low B0=30.87&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).&lt;ref&gt;Standard guitar tuning E2=82.41&amp;nbsp;Hz, A2=110&amp;nbsp;Hz, D3=146.8&amp;nbsp;Hz, G3=196&amp;nbsp;Hz, B3=246.9&amp;nbsp;Hz, E4=329.6&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; The bass guitar is a [[transposing instrument]], as it is notated in [[Clef#Bass clef|bass clef]] an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive [[ledger line]]s. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]] for live performances.

Since the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]] as the bass instrument in the [[rhythm section]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jim (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1m2kRBQscfoC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' p. 56] "The surf/instrumental rock genres of the early 1960s were crucial proving grounds of the still-newfangled electric bass&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; While types of [[bass line]]s vary widely from one style of music to another, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the [[chord progression|harmonic framework]] and establishing the beat. Many styles of music utilise the bass guitar, including [[rock music|rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[country music|country]], [[reggae]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]]. It is often a solo [[musical instrument|instrument]] in jazz, [[jazz fusion]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[funk]], [[progressive rock]] and other rock and metal styles.

==Electric sound recording and reproduction==
{{Main article|Sound recording and reproduction}}
Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small [[microphone]] diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure ([[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker]] diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves. Electrically generated signals may also be recorded directly from devices such as an [[Pick up (music technology)|electric guitar pickup]], without the use of acoustic sounds or amplifiers in the recording process (other than the need for musicians to hear herself playing during [[recording session]]).

|description= This 1860 [[phonautogram]] by [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]] is the earliest known recording of a person singing.}}

The first device that could record actual [[sound]]s as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the [[phonautograph]], patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]]. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called "phonautograms", made in 1857. They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it.

===Phonograph===
{{Main article|Phonograph}}

====Phonograph cylinder====
{{listen
|filename=Kham Hom - Sweet Words.ogg
|title="Kham Hom" ("Sweet Words")
|description= [[Phonograph cylinder]] recording of [[Siam]]ese (Thai) musicians visiting Berlin, Germany in 1900.}}

The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE Publication Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.

====Disc phonograph====
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell's Voice.ogg|thumb|Recording of Bell's voice on a wax disc in 1885, identified in 2013 [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Bell.27s voice|[more details]]] ]]
[[File:Emile Berliner with phonograph.jpg|thumb|Emile Berliner with disc record gramophone]]
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone disc]], generally credited to [[Emile Berliner]] and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably Alexander Graham Bell in 1881.&lt;ref name=smiths1&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Sound Recording Collection and Sound Recovery Project|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/early-sound-recording-collection-and-sound-recovery-project|work=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.

The long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record, or "[[LP record|LP]]", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the "78" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact "45" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as "unbreakable" compared to wax cylinders.

===Electrical recording===
[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]

Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the advent of digital media, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the "horn sound" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.

Sound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[Valdemar Poulsen|Telegraphone]],&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[Telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is that of a contemporary telephone.&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the 1920s, when several recent radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the ''Audion'' [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the 1950s.

===Magnetic tape===
{{Main article|Magnetic tape sound recording}}

[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]

An important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=4&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concrète]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]].

The ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.

===Stereo and hi-fi===
{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}

Magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938.

The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the "[[Fantasound]]" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a "control" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&amp;nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the "[[Cinemascope]]" four-track magnetic sound system.

EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the US. Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many Sixties pop albums now available only in stereo were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the "stereo" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape.

Magnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl&lt;!-- avoids BE/AE differences --&gt; record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.

'''The National Institute for Trial Advocacy''' (referred to as "NITA") is a not for profit organization that was initially formed in 1969 in an effort to provide lawyers with better trial skills training, and was spurred on by criticisms within the judicial system of the apparent lack of trial preparation occurring within law schools. This initial group of law professors and lawyers worked with the intention of addressing this problem and came to the conclusion that [[Experiential learning|learning-by-doing]] trial training was the best approach. This group spent two more years improving their trial material and in 1972 NITA's inaugural National Session was held at the University of Colorado in Boulder. This program brings together participants from all across the country who are taught through a learning by doing approach how to better represent their clients in the courtroom. The national session has been held every year since 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/page.asp?id=7&amp;catid=32&amp;prodid=362 NITA Web Site | Building Trial Skills: National Session&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and NITA has since expanded its scope, holding public service trial training sessions in a variety of specialties across the country as well as other skills courses including deposition and courtroom technology skills.

The '''New Orleans Jazz Museum''' is a music museum in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|U.S.]], dedicated to preserving and celebrating the history of [[jazz]] music. Originally a separate museum, the collection is now affiliated with the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. The New Orleans Jazz Museum is located in the [[New Orleans Mint|Old U.S. Mint]] building on 400 [[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]], bordering the historic [[French Quarter]] neighborhood.

== History ==
Plans for a museum commemorating New Orleans jazz began in the 1950s by a collaborative group of New Orleans [[jazz]] collectors and enthusiasts of the New Orleans Jazz Club, which was founded in 1949.  Key movers were [[Doc Souchon|Edmond "Doc" Souchon]], Myra Menville, and Helen Arlt. The museum opened in 1961, at 1017 Dumaine Street in the [[French Quarter]], with Clay Watson as curator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Collier's Encyclopedia, with Bibliography and Index|last=Halsey|first=William Darach|publisher=P.F. Collier|year=1986|isbn=|page=439|doi=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the collection has since moved, the original location is maintained today as part of the [[Hotel St. Pierre]], including [[Commemorative plaque|commemorative plaques]] on the property.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, the museum relocated to the Royal Sonesta Hotel. In the early 1970s, however, the Sonesta changed ownership, and the museum subsequently relocated to 833 Conti Street in 1973. Soon after its relocation, the museum closed again due to [[bankruptcy]]. On September 15, 1977, the entire collection of the New Orleans Jazz Museum was donated to the people of Louisiana and became The New Orleans Jazz Club Collections of the Louisiana State Museum.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bush, Tori. "The New Orleans Jazz Museum." 12 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, the Louisiana State Museum's Jazz Collection exhibit opened on the second floor of the [[New Orleans Mint|Old U.S. Mint]] building under the curatorship of Don Marquis. The New Orleans Jazz Museum now resides permanently at the Old U.S. Mint.[[File:New_Orleans_Jazz_Museum_at_Old_U.S._Mint.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DNMaurer/File:New_Orleans_Jazz_Museum_at_Old_U.S._Mint.jpg|thumb|The facade of the [[New Orleans Mint|Old U.S. Mint]] building as viewed from Esplanade Avenue. This is the current location of the New Orleans Jazz Museum.]]
[[File:20111102 MG 9967 (1).jpg|thumb|Interior of New Orleans Jazz Museum.]]
In 2005, both the U.S. Mint and the jazz collection sustained damage during [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The New Orleans Jazz Museum collections have been displayed in a number of exhibits since the Mint reopened in 2008. In 2015, efforts were underway to transform most of the Mint building into the New Orleans Jazz Museum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://louisianastatemuseum.org/museums/the-old-us-mint/ Old U.S. Mint museum] Accessed 28 Apr 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">'''Partial stroke testing''' (or PST) is a technique used in a control system to allow the user to test a percentage of the possible failure modes of a [[shut down valve]] without the need to physically close the valve.  PST is used to assist in determining that the safety function will operate on demand.  PST is most often used on high integrity emergency shutdown valves (ESDVs) in applications where closing the valve will have a high cost burden yet proving the integrity of the valve is essential to maintaining a safe facility.  In addition to ESDVs PST is also used on high integrity pressure protection systems or HIPPS.  Partial stroke testing is not a replacement for the need to fully stroke valves as proof testing is still a mandatory requirement.

==Standards==
Partial stroke testing is an accepted [[petroleum industry]] standard technique and is also quantified in detail by regulatory bodies such as the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the [[Instrument Society of Automation]] (ISA). The following are the standards appropriate to these bodies.

:*'''[[IEC61508]]''' – Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems
:*'''[[IEC61511]]''' – Functional safety – Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector
:*'''ANSI/ISA-84.00.01''' – Functional safety: Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector (an [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard)

These standards define the requirements for safety related systems and describe how to quantify the performance of PST systems

==Measuring safety performance==
IEC61508 adapts a [[safety life cycle]] approach to the management of plant safety. During the design phase of this life cycle of a safety system the required safety performance level is determined using techniques such as [[Markov analysis]], [[Failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]], [[fault tree analysis]] and [[Hazard and operability study|Hazop]]. These techniques allow the user to determine the potential frequency and consequence of hazardous activities and to quantify the level of risk. A common method for this quantification is the [[safety integrity level]]. This is quantified from one to four with level four being the most hazardous.

Once the SIL level is determined this specifies the required performance level of the safety systems during the operational phase of the plant. The metric for measuring the performance of a safety function is called the average probability of failure on demand (or PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) and this correlates to the SIL level as follows

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! SIL !! PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| 4 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 3 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 2 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 1 || ≥10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

One method of calculating the PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; for a basic safety function with no [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] is using the formula

:'''PFD&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; = [(1-PTC)×λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;×(TI&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt;/2)] + [PTC×λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;×(TI&lt;sub&gt;PST&lt;/sub&gt;/2)]'''

Where:

:PTC = Proof test coverage of the partial stroke test.

:λ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = The dangerous failure rate of the safety function.

:TI&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt; = The full closure interval, i.e. how often the valve must be full closed for testing.

:TI&lt;sub&gt;PST&lt;/sub&gt; = The partial stroke test interval.

The proof test coverage is a measure of how effective the partial stroke test is and the higher the PTC the greater the effect of the test.

==Benefits==
The benefits of using PST are not limited to simply the safety performance but gains can also be made in the production performance of a plant and the capital cost of a plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=73686 Web Exclusive: Valve failure not an option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092829/http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=73686 |date=2011-07-18 }}. ISA (2009-01-01). Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus-nuclear.com/actuation/ShowPage.aspx?pageID=564 Partial stroking]. Focus-nuclear.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt; These are summarised as follows

===Safety benefits===
Gains can be made in the following areas by the use of PST.
:* Reducing the probability of failure on demand.

===Production benefits===
There are a number of areas where production efficiency can be improved by the successful implementation of a PST system.
:* Extension of the time between compulsory plant shutdowns.
:* Predicting potential valve failures facilitating the pre-ordering of spare parts.
:* Prioritisation of maintenance tasks.

==Drawbacks==
The main drawback of all PST systems is the increased probability of causing an accidental activation of the safety system thus causing a plant shutdown, this is the primary concern of PST systems by operators and for this reason many PST system remain dormant after installation.  Different techniques mitigate for this issue in different manners but all systems have an inherent risk

In addition in some cases, a PST cannot be performed due to the limitations inherent in the process or the valve being used. Further, as the PST introduces a disturbance into the process or system, it may not be appropriate for some processes or systems that are sensitive to disturbances.

Finally, a PST cannot always differentiate between different faults or failures within the valve and actuator assembly thus limiting the diagnostic capability.

==Techniques==
There are a number of different techniques available for partial stroke testing and the selection of the most appropriate technique depends on the main benefits the operator is trying to gain.

===Mechanical Jammers===
Mechanical jammers are devices where a device is inserted into the valve and actuator assembly that physically prevents the valve from moving past a certain point. These are used in cases where accidentally shutting the valve would have severe consequences, or any application where the end user prefers a mechanical device.

Typical benefits of this type of device are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B5PSPJfG9S5kYTRhMDVhYjAtNTViMy00ZGQ5LWE2ZmItYzY3MjU4NDM3Nzk1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CM77sJIP D-Stop Partial Stroke Test Device. Manual/Local and Remote Operated Mechanical Partial Stroke Valve Testing]. Cameron. Docs.google.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The devices assure metal-to-metal prevention of stroke past the specified set point.
*Unlike some electronic systems, there is no need to commission and calibrate controls or continually train personnel, resulting in additional significant cost savings.
*The devices are vibration resistant, making them highly reliable.
*The risk associated with having an ESD event occur at time of manual mechanical PST may be considered statistically insignificant and allows a rational consideration of the advantages mechanical devices offer.
*Modular design allows for addition of limit switches, potentiometers, remote control operation, etc.
*The test is a comprehensive test of the logic solver and all final elements, only the sensing elements of the safety function are not tested.
*The valve is tested at the designed operating speed as it simulates an ESD event
*Jammers have a very low probability of causing a spurious trip.

However, opinions differ whether these devices are suitable for functional safety systems as the safety function is offline for the duration of the test.

Modern mechanical PST devices may be [http://www.netherlocks.com/partial-stroke-testing/netherlocks-develops-remote-operation-for-faith-pst-system/ automated].

Examples of this kind of device include direct interface products that mount between the valve and the actuator and may use cams fitted to the valve stem. 
An example of such a mechanical PST system:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netherlocks.com/products/partial-stroke-testing/faith-overview/ Netherlocks mechanical PST system FAITH - known as the industry standard.] Retrieved on 2013-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods include adjustable actuator end stops.

===Pneumatic valve positioners===
The basic principle behind partial stroke testing is that the valve is moved to a predetermined position in order to determine the performance of the shut down valve. This led to the adaptation of pneumatic positioners used on [[flow control valve]] for use in partial stroke testing. These systems are often suitable for use on shutdown valves up to and including SIL3.
The main benefits are : 
* Elimination of the cost of manual testing
* Tracking and records of the PST tests for an optimum Safety monitoring. When the positioner is connected to the Safety System, the date and result of the test are registered in the Sequence of Events, for Insurance purposes. 
* Remote access to valve diagnostics from the control room, with action oriented reports for predictive maintenance.

The main benefit of these systems is that positioners are common equipment on plants and thus operators are familiar with the operation of these systems, however the primary drawback is the increased risk of spurious trip caused by the introduction of additional control components that are not normally used on on/off valves.  These systems are however limited to use on pneumatically actuated valves.

===Electrical relay systems===
These systems use an electrical switch to de-energise the solenoid valve and use an electrical relay attached to the actuator to re-energise the solenoid coil when the desired PST point is reached.

===Electronic control systems===
Electronic control systems use a configurable electronic module that connects between the supply from the ESD system and the [[solenoid valve]]. In order to perform a test the timer de-energises the solenoid valve to simulate a shutdown and re-energises the soleniod when the required degree of partial stroke is reached. These systems are fundamentally a miniature [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]] dedicated to the testing of the valve.

Due to their nature these devices do not actually form part of the safety function and are therefore 100% fail safe. With the addition of a pressure sensor and/or a position sensor for feedback timer systems are also capable of providing intelligent diagnostics in order to diagnose the performance of all components including the valve, actuator and solenoid valves.

In addition timers are capable of operating with any type of fluid power actuator and can also be used with subsea valves where the solenoid valve is located top-side.

===Integrated solenoid valve systems===
Another technique is to embed the control electronics into a solenoid valve enclosure removing the need for additional control boxes.  In addition there is no need to change the control schematic as no dedicated components are required.

The '''[[Paul Scherrer]] Institute''' (PSI) is a multi-disciplinary research institute which belongs to the [[ETH Domain|Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain]] covering also [[ETH Zurich]] and [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]]. It was established in 1988 through the merger of EIR (''Eidgenössisches Institut für Reaktorforschung'', Federal Institute for Reactor Research, established in 1960) and SIN (''Schweizerisches Institut für Nuklearphysik'', Swiss Institute for Nuclear Physics, established in 1968). It is based in [[Villigen]] and [[Würenlingen]].

The PSI is a multi-disciplinary research centre for the natural sciences and technology. In national and international collaboration with universities, other research institutes and industry, PSI is active in solid-state physics, materials sciences, elementary particle physics, life sciences, nuclear and non-nuclear energy research, and energy-related ecology.

It is the largest Swiss national research institute with about 1,900 members of staff {{asof|2014|lc=y}}, and is the only one of its kind in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=PSI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/facts-and-figures |title=Overview: Facts and figures of the Paul Scherrer Institute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Paul Scherrer Institute |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PSI is a User Laboratory, offering access to its facilities to researchers affiliated to many different institutions, and it runs several [[particle accelerator]]s. The 590&amp;nbsp;MeV [[cyclotron]], with its 72&amp;nbsp;MeV companion pre-accelerator, is one of them. {{asof|2011}}, it delivers a proton beam of up to 2.2&amp;nbsp;mA, which is the world record for such proton cyclotrons. It drives the spallation neutron source complex. The [[Swiss Light Source]] (SLS), built in 2001, is a [[synchrotron light]] source with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GeV electron [[storage ring]]. It is one of the world's best with respect to electron beam brilliance and stability.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Aerial view of the PSI.jpg|thumb|422px|Aerial view of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psi.ch/media/schweizer-spitzenforschung-allemand]&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt; An X-ray [[free-electron laser]] called [[SwissFEL]] is currently under construction and is slated to begin operation in 2016.&lt;ref name=swissfel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/media/overview-swissfel |title=Overview: SwissFEL – the new large-scale facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Paul Scherrer Institute |accessdate=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917084615/http://www.psi.ch/media/overview-swissfel|archive-date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proton accelerators are also used for the [[proton therapy]] program.

Injector 1 is a variable energy cyclotron built by the Dutch company [[Philips]] Gloeilampen-Fabrieken. Its one-piece magnet has an azimuthally varying magnetic field for vertical focusing even at relativistic energies. The beam energy goes up to 72 MeV for protons and 120 MeV Z2/A for ions with charge Z and mass number A. Equipped with several ion sources, Injector 1 offers a wide variety of beams ranging from protons and deuterons to light and heavy ions. Polarized beams of protons and deuterons are also available. In 1994 an ECR ion source was installed to extend its ability to accelerate heavy ions. This machine has been decommissioned on 1 December 2010.

The Injector 2 cyclotron has been built to replace the multiparticle variable energy Injector 1. It provides high intensity, high quality beams of 72&amp;nbsp;MeV protons to be injected into the 590 MeV Ring cyclotron.

The Injector 2 is itself a ring cyclotron, but with 4 sectormagnets and with an extremely low injection energy of 870&amp;nbsp;keV. The 870&amp;nbsp;keV proton beam is achieved by extracting protons from an [[ion source]] with 60&amp;nbsp;kV and additional acceleration of the particles by means of a [[Cockcroft Walton|Cockcroft-Walton]] type accelerator operated at 810&amp;nbsp;kV.

It was put in operation in 1984.

The Ring Cyclotron is a separated sector cyclotron with a fixed beam energy of 590&amp;nbsp;MeV, built by PSI and commissioned in 1974. The 72&amp;nbsp;MeV beam from either one of two injector cyclotron enters from the back of the cyclotron, is injected into an orbit in the center of the Ring, accelerated over about 186 revolutions and extracted at the full energy.

The design is based on criteria that allow operation at very high beam intensities: an open structure of four large and powerful RF-cavities providing a high acceleration voltage, and a flat-top cavity operating at the third harmonic of the accelerating RF-voltage. The resulting strong, phase-independent energy gain per revolution gives good turn separation and hence beam extraction with low beam losses. This is a mandatory condition for high current operation in a cyclotron. Presently, a continuous beam current of 2.2&amp;nbsp;mA at 590&amp;nbsp;MeV can be extracted from the ring cyclotron. This corresponds to a beam power of approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;MW turning the PSI-proton facility into the world's most powerful accelerator complex at the moment.{{When|date=March 2016}}

==Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ)==
[[Neutron scattering]] is one of the most effective ways to obtain information on both the structure and the dynamics of condensed matter. A wide scope of problems, ranging from fundamental to solid state physics and chemistry, and from materials science to biology, medicine and environmental science, can be investigated with neutrons. Aside from the scattering techniques, non-diffractive methods like imaging techniques can also be applied with increasing relevance for industrial applications.

The spallation neutron source [http://www.psi.ch/sinq SINQ] is a continuous source – the first of its kind in the world – with a flux of about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s. Beside thermal neutrons, a cold moderator of liquid deuterium (cold source) slows neutrons down and shifts their spectrum to lower energies. These neutrons have proved to be particularly valuable in materials research and in the investigation of biological substances. SINQ is a user facility. Interested groups can apply for beamtime on the various instruments by using the SINQ proposal system.

==Spallation Ultracold Neutron Source (UCN)==

Neutrons from the spallation target are brought to [[Thermal neutron|thermal energies]] by means of a [[heavy water]]. Some of the neutrons are further cooled down to [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energies]] below 300&amp;nbsp;neV by means of a solid [[deuterium]] moderator.&lt;ref&gt;http://ucn.web.psi.ch/posters/UCN-Source08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucn.web.psi.ch/ucn_source_project.htm |title=UCN Home Page |publisher=Ucn.web.psi.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ultra cold neutrons are used by the nEDM experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nedm.web.psi.ch/ |title=EDM Home Page |publisher=Nedm.web.psi.ch |date=2001-09-12 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to probe the [[Neutron electric dipole moment]] at scales below the current upper limit

{{wide image|Panorama sls.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the [[Swiss Light Source]]}}

==Swiss Muon Source (SμS)==

Thanks to the high proton current (2200&amp;nbsp;μA), the Swiss Muon Source is the world's most intense continuous beam muon source today.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) :: Large Scale Facilities {{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/science/large-scale-facilities |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429220301/http://www.psi.ch/science/large-scale-facilities |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}, retrieved 2011-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main applications of these intense muon beams is [[Muon spin spectroscopy]]. [[Mu to E Gamma]] and [[Mu3e]] use the beam as well.

== Proton Therapy Programme ==
Since 1984 PSI operates the OPTIS facility for treatment of eye tumours. It was the first such installation in Western Europe, developed by PSI physicists. In close cooperation with the 'Hôpital Opthalmique' of the University of Lausanne by March 2008 nearly 5000 patients have been treated at PSI with this unique method, in which a proton beam is directed accurately onto the eye tumour.

Since 1996 PSI has also operated the only compact scanning gantry in the world for proton radiation therapy of deep-seated tumours. The spot-scanning technique developed at PSI enables malignant tumours to be targeted with high precision deep inside in the body, and their growth successfully stopped, without damaging healthy tissue around the target area. By March 2008, 320 patients, suffering from brain, head and neck, skull-base, spinal cord or abdominal tumours, had been treated at Gantry 1.

The excellent and promising results of patient treatment have led to the (Project [http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/proscan.html PROSCAN]) with the objectives to install a dedicated and compact [[superconducting]] proton accelerator
and to develop a new Gantry ([http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/forschung.html Gantry 2]) with advanced 2-dimensional and fast parallel scanning features. The new compact superconducting cyclotron has been in operation since February 2007, and patient treatment at Gantry 2 began in November 2013. With these expansions, PSI is able to offer year-round treatment at its Center for Proton Therapy (CPT). {{asof|2015}}, work is ongoing on a third gantry with a similar specification to Gantry 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psi.ch/protontherapy/proton-therapy-at-psi |title= Proton Therapy at PSI |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of these developments are to increase radiation precision of even moving tumours and to transfer the knowledge and proton therapy technology into hospital-based projects.

With the expansion of the facility, PSI will be able to strengthen the clinical research program and to treat more than 500 patients per year, including those with eye tumours.

[[Image:Polygonum amphibium (4973671699).jpg|thumb|200px|right|This above-ground stem of ''[[Polygonatum]]'' has lost its leaves, but is producing [[adventitious roots]] from the nodes.]]
{{About|the stem part of a plant|the use of stem node in phylogenetics and cladistics|Phylogenetic nomenclature}}
A '''stem''' is one of two main structural axes of a [[vascular plant]], the other being the [[root]]. The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes:
* The nodes hold one or more leaves, as well as [[bud]]s which can grow into branches (with [[leaf|leaves]], [[conifer cone]]s, or [[inflorescence]]s (flowers)). [[Adventitious roots]] may also be produced from the nodes.
* The internodes distance one node from another.

The term "[[shoot]]s" is often confused with "stems"; "shoots" generally refers to new fresh plant growth including both stems and other structures like leaves or flowers. In most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have [[underground stems]].

Stems have four main functions which are:&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Peter H., Ray Franklin Evert, and Helena Curtis. 1981. ''Biology of plants.'' New York, N.Y.: Worth Publishers.{{ISBN|0-87901-132-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for and the elevation of leaves, [[flower]]s and [[fruit]]s. The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits.
* Transport of fluids between the roots and the shoots in the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]
* Storage of nutrients
* Production of new living tissue. The normal lifespan of plant cells is one to three years. Stems have cells called [[meristem]]s that annually generate new living tissue.

== Specialized terms ==
Stems are often specialized for storage, asexual reproduction, protection or photosynthesis, including the following:
* [[Glossary of botanical terms#A|Acaulescent]] – used to describe stems in plants that appear to be stemless. Actually these stems are just extremely short, the leaves appearing to rise directly out of the ground, e.g. some [[Viola (plant)|''Viola'']] species.
* Arborescent – tree like with woody stems normally with a single trunk.
* [[Axillary bud]] – a bud which grows at the point of attachment of an older leaf with the stem. It potentially gives rise to a shoot. 
* [[Branch]]ed – aerial stems are described as being branched or unbranched
* [[Bud]] – an embryonic shoot with immature stem tip.
* [[Bulb]] – a short vertical underground stem with fleshy storage leaves attached, e.g. [[onion]], [[daffodil]], [[tulip]]. Bulbs often function in reproduction by splitting to form new bulbs or producing small new bulbs termed bulblets. Bulbs are a combination of stem and leaves so may better be considered as leaves because the leaves make up the greater part.
* Caespitose – when stems grow in a tangled mass or clump or in low growing mats.
* Cladode (including [[phylloclade]]) – a flattened stem that appears more-or-less leaf like and is specialized for photosynthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goebel, K.E.v. |origyear=1905|year=1969 |title= Organography of plants, especially of the Archegoniatae and Spermaphyta|publisher=Hofner publishing company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. [[cactus]] pads.
* [[Vine|Climbing]] – stems that cling or wrap around other plants or structures.
* [[Corm]] – a short enlarged underground, storage stem, e.g. [[taro]], [[crocus]], [[gladiolus]].
[[File:Cucurbita_maxima_Zapallo_Plomo_semillería_Costanzi_-_vine_detail_decumbent_shoot_and_tendril.jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|Decumbent stem in ''[[Cucurbita maxima]]''.]]
* Decumbent – stems that lie flat on the ground and turn upwards at the ends.
* Fruticose – stems that grow shrublike with woody like habit.
* [[Herbaceous]] – non woody, they die at the end of the growing season.
* Internode – an interval between two successive nodes. It possesses the ability to elongate, either from its base or from its extremity depending on the species.
* Node – a point of attachment of a leaf or a [[twig]] on the stem in seed plants. A node is a very small growth zone.
* [[Pedicel (botany)|Pedicel]] – stems that serve as the stalk of an individual flower in an [[inflorescence]] or [[infrutescence]].
* [[Peduncle (botany)|Peduncle]] – a stem that supports an [[inflorescence]]
* [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|Prickle]] – a sharpened extension of the stem's outer layers, e.g. [[rose]]s.
* {{anchor|pseudostem}}Pseudostem – a false stem made of the rolled bases of leaves, which may be 2 or 3 m tall as in [[banana]]
* [[Rhizome]] – a horizontal underground stem that functions mainly in reproduction but also in storage, e.g. most [[fern]]s, [[iris (plant)|iris]]
* [[Runner (plant part)]] – a type of stolon, horizontally growing on top of the ground and rooting at the nodes, aids in reproduction. e.g. [[garden strawberry]], ''[[Chlorophytum comosum]]''.
* [[Scape (botany)|Scape]] – a stem that holds flowers that comes out of the ground and has no normal leaves. [[Hosta]], [[Lily]], [[Iris (plant)|Iris]], [[Garlic]].
* [[Stolon]] – a horizontal stem that produces rooted plantlets at its nodes and ends, forming near the surface of the ground.
* [[Thorn (botany)|Thorn]] – a [[Aerial stem modification|modified stem]] with a sharpened point.
* [[Tuber]] – a swollen, underground storage stem adapted for storage and reproduction, e.g. [[potato]].
* [[Woody plant|Woody]] – hard textured stems with secondary xylem.

== Stem structure ==

{{See also|Stele (biology)}}

Stem usually consist of three tissues, [[Epidermis (botany)|dermal tissue]], [[ground tissue]] and [[vascular tissue]]. The dermal tissue covers the outer surface of the stem and usually functions to waterproof, protect and control gas exchange. The ground tissue usually consists mainly of parenchyma cells and fills in around the vascular tissue. It sometimes functions in photosynthesis. Vascular tissue provides long distance transport and structural support. Most or all ground tissue may be lost in woody stems. The dermal tissue of aquatic plants stems may lack the waterproofing found in aerial stems. The arrangement of the vascular tissues varies widely among plant species.

=== Dicot stems ===
[[Dicot]] stems with primary growth have [[pith]] in the center, with vascular bundles forming a distinct ring visible when the stem is viewed in cross section. The outside of the stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain [[stomata]] for gas exchange and multicellular stem hairs called [[trichomes]]. A cortex consisting of [[hypodermis]] (collenchyma cells) and [[endodermis]] (starch containing cells) is present above the [[pericycle]] and vascular bundles.

Woody dicots and many nonwoody dicots have [[secondary growth]] originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the [[vascular cambium]] and the [[cork cambium]] or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects to form a continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce [[secondary xylem]] to the inside and [[secondary phloem]] to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the [[periderm]], which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.

Secondary [[xylem]] is commercially important as [[wood]]. The seasonal variation in growth from the [[vascular cambium]] is what creates yearly tree rings in temperate climates. Tree rings are the basis of [[dendrochronology]], which dates wooden objects and associated artifacts. [[Dendroclimatology]] is the use of tree rings as a record of past climates. The aerial stem of an adult [[tree]] is called a [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]. The dead, usually darker inner wood of a large diameter trunk is termed the [[heartwood]] and is the result of [[Tylosis (Botany)|tylosis]]. The outer, living wood is termed the sapwood.

=== Monocot stems ===
[[File:Royal Palm Trunk.jpg|250px|thumb |right |Stems of two ''[[Roystonea regia]]'' palms showing characteristic bulge, leaf scars and fibrous roots, [[Kolkata, India]] ]]

Vascular bundles are present throughout the [[monocot]] stem, although concentrated towards the outside. This differs from the dicot stem that has a ring of vascular bundles and often none in the center. The shoot apex in monocot stems is more elongated. Leaf sheathes grow up around it, protecting it. This is true to some extent of almost all monocots. Monocots rarely produce [[secondary growth]] and are therefore seldom woody, with [[Arecaceae|Palms]] and [[Bamboo]] being notable exceptions. However, many monocot stems increase in diameter via anomalous secondary growth.

=== Gymnosperm stems ===
[[Image:Redwood M D Vaden.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The trunk of this [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] tree is its stem.]]
[[Image:Ferns.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Tasmanian]] [[tree fern]]]]

All [[gymnosperms]] are woody plants. Their stems are similar in structure to woody dicots except that most gymnosperms produce only [[tracheid]]s in their xylem, not the vessels found in dicots. Gymnosperm wood also often contains [[resin]] ducts. Woody dicots are called hardwoods, e.g. [[oak]], [[maple]] and [[walnut]]. In contrast, softwoods are gymnosperms, such as [[pine]], [[spruce]] and [[fir]].

=== Fern stems ===
Most [[fern]]s have [[rhizome]]s with no vertical stem. The exception is [[Cyatheales|tree ferns]], with vertical stems up to about 20 metres. The stem anatomy of ferns is more complicated than that of dicots because fern stems often have one or more leaf gaps in cross section. A leaf gap is where the vascular tissue branches off to a [[frond]]. In cross section, the vascular tissue does not form a complete cylinder where a leaf gap occurs. Fern stems may have [[Stele (biology)|solenosteles]] or [[Stele (biology)|dictyosteles]] or variations of them. Many fern stems have phloem tissue on both sides of the xylem in cross-section.

== Economic importance ==
[[Image:Asparagus produce-1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|White and green [[asparagus]] – crispy stems are the edible parts of this vegetable]]
There are thousands of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as [[potato]] and [[taro]]. [[Sugarcane]] stems are a major source of sugar. [[Maple sugar]] is obtained from trunks of [[maple]] trees. [[Vegetable]]s from stems are [[asparagus]], [[bamboo shoot]]s, cactus pads or [[nopalito]]s, [[kohlrabi]], and [[Eleocharis dulcis|water chestnut]]. The spice, [[cinnamon]] is bark from a tree trunk. [[Gum arabic]] is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of ''[[Acacia senegal]]'' trees. [[Chicle]], the main ingredient in [[chewing gum]], is obtained from trunks of the chicle tree.

Medicines obtained from stems include [[quinine]] from the bark of [[cinchona]] trees, [[camphor]] distilled from wood of a tree in the same genus that provides cinnamon, and the muscle relaxant [[curare]] from the bark of tropical vines.

[[Wood]] is used in thousands of ways, e.g. [[building material|buildings]], [[furniture]], [[boat]]s, [[airplane]]s, [[wagon]]s, [[car]] parts, [[musical instrument]]s, [[sports equipment]], [[railroad tie]]s, [[utility pole]]s, fence posts, [[Deep foundation|pilings]], [[toothpick]]s, [[match]]es, [[plywood]], [[coffin]]s, [[Shake (shingle)|shingles]], [[barrel]] staves, [[toy]]s, [[tool]] handles, [[picture frame]]s, [[wood veneer|veneer]], [[charcoal]] and [[firewood]]. [[Wood pulp]] is widely used to make [[paper]], [[paperboard]], [[cellulose]] sponges, [[cellophane]] and some important [[plastic]]s and [[textile]]s, such as [[cellulose acetate]] and [[rayon]]. [[Bamboo]] stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, [[fishing pole]]s, [[water pipe]]s, plant stakes, and [[bamboo scaffolding|scaffolding]]. Trunks of [[palm trees]] and [[tree fern]]s are often used for building. Stems of [[Phragmites|Reed]] are an important building material for use in [[thatching]] in some areas.

[[Tannin]]s used for tanning [[leather]] are obtained from the wood of certain trees, such as [[Quebracho tree|quebracho]]. [[Cork (material)|Cork]] is obtained from the bark of the [[cork oak]].  [[Rubber]] is obtained from the trunks of ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]].'' [[Rattan]], used for furniture and baskets, is made from the stems of tropical vining palms. [[Bast fiber]]s for textiles and rope are obtained from stems include [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]] and [[ramie]]. The earliest paper was obtained from the stems of [[papyrus]] by the ancient Egyptians.

[[Amber]] is fossilized sap from tree trunks; it is used for [[jewelry]] and may contain ancient animals. Resins from conifer wood are used to produce [[turpentine]] and [[rosin]]. Tree bark is often used as a [[mulch]] and in growing media for container plants. It also can become the natural [[habitat]] of [[lichen]]s.

Some ornamental plants are grown mainly for their attractive stems, e.g.:
* White bark of [[paper birch]]
* Twisted branches of [[Corkscrew Willow|corkscrew willow]] and [[hazel|Harry Lauder's walking stick]] (''Corylus avellana'' 'Contorta')
* Red, peeling bark of [[paperbark maple]]

The '''Political Economy Club''' was founded by [[James Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090755/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm |archivedate=2008-04-03 |df= }} James Mill, 1773-1836&lt;/ref&gt; and a circle of friends in 1821 in [[London]], for the purpose of coming to an agreement on the fundamental principles of [[political economy]].  [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], [[Thomas Malthus]] (the only one holding an academic post at the time), and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] were among the original luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;Elie Halévy, ''The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism,'' tr. Mary Morris. Boston, Beacon Press, 1955, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century there were no academic societies or professional associations for [[economists]].  The Political Economy Club was a way to establish a scientific community, test ideas, and provide peer review for their  work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829010046/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}   D.

==History==
The club was founded in 1821 and supported [[free trade]]. On 18 April 1821, Swinton Holand held the first meeting at his house. A second larger meeting was held at [[Freemasons' Tavern]], London on the 30th April.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=PEC&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently members of the society are [[David Willetts]], [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Charles Dumas, [[Adam Ridley]], Diana Choyleva, [[Tim Congdon]] and Gabriel Stein.  The Club now meets on a monthly basis in [[Brooks's]] to hear papers presented by members of the club and a discussion over dinner.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Discussions ==

The participants soon found substantial difficulties in formulating and reaching agreement on their fundamental propositions.  Ricardo felt that none of their views was safe from criticism.  Reflecting on their theoretical discussions in 1823, Ricardo privately expressed his famous opinion about the "non-existence of any measure of absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo to Malthus, August 15, 1823. Quoted by Halevy, ''Ibid.,'' p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23363">'''Post-expressionism''' is a term coined by the German [[art critic]] [[Franz Roh]] to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by [[expressionism]] but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, "Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism", to contrast to [[Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub]]'s "[[New Objectivity]]", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw "post-expressionism" and "[[Magic Realism (painting)|magic realism]]" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend.

==Background==

Leading up to [[World War I]], much of the art world was under the influence of [[Futurism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Both movements abandoned any sense of order or commitment to objectivity or tradition.

The sentiment of Futurists was most vocally expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]] in the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', where he called for a rejection of the past, a rejection of all imitation &amp;mdash; of other artists or of the outside world &amp;mdash; and praised the virtue of originality and triumph of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, along these lines, said “After seeing electricity, I lost interest in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Zaller, and Roberts 1997, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti and other Futurists glorified war and violence as a way to revolution &amp;ndash; bringing freedom, establishing new ideas, and rallying one to fight for one's own people &amp;ndash; and as war was shaping up in Europe, many saw it and encouraged a way to “purify” the culture and destroy old, obsolete elements of society.

Expressionists, likewise abandoning imitation nature, sought to express emotional experience, but often centered their art around [[angst]] &amp;mdash; inner turmoil; whether in reaction to the modern world, to alienation from society, or in the creation of personal identity. In concert with this evocation of angst, expressionists also echoed some of the same feelings of revolution as did Futurists. This is evidenced by a 1919 anthology of expressionist poetry titled ''[[Menschheitsdämmerung]]'', which translates to “Dawn of Humanity” &amp;mdash; meant to suggest that humanity was in a 'twilight'; that there was an imminent demise of some old way of being and beneath it the urgings of a new dawning.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Both futurism and expressionism were always met by opposition, but the destruction that occurred in the war had heightened the criticism against them. Following the war, in and throughout different artistic circles there was a call for a [[Return to Order|return to order]] and re-appreciation of tradition and of the natural world. In Italy, this was encouraged by the magazine ''[[Valori Plastici]]'' and came together in the [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]], a group that exhibited in the Venice Biennale and was joined by many Futurists who had rejected their former work. [[Mario Sironi]], a member of this group, stated that they “would not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it.” The “New Objectivity” or ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', as coined by Hartlaub, described the developments in Germany and became the title of an exhibition that he staged in 1925. ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' was influenced not only by the “return to order” but also a call to arms among more left-leaning artists who wanted to use their art in a forward, political manner that expressionism didn't enable them to do. In Belgium, there was another vein in the common trend, which would later be referred to as a “retour à l’humain”.

==Movements==

When Hartlaub defined the idea of the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', he identified two groups: the ''verists'', who “[tore] the objective form of the world of contemporary facts and represent current experience in its tempo and fevered temperature,” and the ''classicists'', who “[searched] more for the object of timeless ability to embody the external laws of existence in the artistic sphere.”

Although Roh originally meant the term 'Magic Realism' to be more or less synonymous with ''Neue Sachlichkeit'', the artists identified by Hartlaub as 'classicists' later became associated with Roh's term. These 'Magic Realists' were all influenced by the classicism developed in Italy by the Novecento, and in turn by [[de Chirico]]'s concept of ''[[metaphysical art]]'', which had also branched into surrealism. Art critic [[Wieland Schmeid]] in 1977 posited that despite the fact that the terms were meant to refer to the same thing, the understanding of them as different groups derives from the fact that the movement had a right and left wing, with the Magic Realists on the right &amp;mdash; many later supporting fascism or accommodating to it&amp;mdash; and the ''verists'' we associate as the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' on the left &amp;mdash; fighting against fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Crockett 1998, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups in addition to having different political philosophies likewise had different artistic philosophies.

The third movement that is important to include in post-expressionism, and which Roh excluded, is the reaction to [[Flemish Expressionism]], as opposed to strains of German expressionism and Italian futurism. This is typically referred to as ''animism''.

===Magic Realism===

{{Main|Magic Realism (painting)}}
[[File:Donghi antonio-due canarini in gabbia-reduced size.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''Due canarini in gabbia'' by Antonio Donghi, 1932]]
[[File:Anton Raderscheidt, 1926, Tulpen auf der Fensterbank.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Tulpen auf der Fensterbank'' by Anton Räderscheidt, 1926]]
'Magic Realism' for Roh, as a reaction to expressionism, meant to declare “[that] the autonomy of the objective world around us was once more to be enjoyed; the wonder of matter that could crystallize into objects was to be seen anew.”&lt;ref&gt;Zamora and Ferris 1995&lt;/ref&gt; With the term, he was emphasizing the “magic” of the normal world as it presents itself to us &amp;mdash; how, when we really look at everyday objects, they can appear strange and fantastic.

In Italy, the style that Roh identified was created by a confluence of a renewed focus on harmony and technique called for by the “return to order” and ''metaphysical art'', a style which had been developed by Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, two members of the Novecento. Carrà described his purpose as to explore the imagined inner life of familiar objects when represented out of their explanatory contexts: their solidity, their separateness in the space allotted to them, the secret dialogue that may take place between them.

The leading painter in Italy associated with this style is perhaps [[Antonio Donghi]], who kept to traditional subject matter &amp;mdash; popular life, landscapes, and still life &amp;mdash; but presented it with strong composition and spatial clarity to give it gravity and stillness. His still lifes often consist of a small vase of flowers, depicted with the disarming symmetry of [[naive art]]. He also often painted birds carefully arranged for display in their cages, and dogs and other animals ready to perform for circus acts, to suggest an artificial arrangement placed on top of nature. In Germany, [[Anton Räderscheidt]] followed a style similar to Donghi, turning to magic realism after abandoning constructivism. [[Georg Schrimpf]] is somewhat like the two, working in a style influenced by [[primitivism]].

[[Filippo De Pisis]], who is often associated with ''metaphysical art'', can also be seen as a magic realist. Like Donghi, he often painted traditional subjects, but rather than developing a strict classical style, used a more painterly brush to bring out the intimacy of the objects, similar to the Belgian ''animists''. His association with ''metaphysical art'' comes from the fact that he would often contrapose objects in his still lifes, and set them in a scene that gave them context.

Another artist in Italy considered a [[magic realism|magic realist]] is [[Felice Casorati]], whose paintings are rendered with fine technique but often distinguished by unusual perspective effects and bold colorfulness. In 1925, Rafaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art — “The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite.”

Other German artists who worked within this style are [[Alexander Kanoldt]] and [[Carl Grossberg]]. Kanoldt painted still lifes and portraits, while Grossberg painted urban landscapes and industrial sites rendered with chilly precision.

===New Objectivity and Verism===

{{Main|New Objectivity}}
[[File:George grosz-the eclipse of the sun.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''The Eclipse of the Sun'' by George Grosz, 1926]]
The artists most associated with the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' today are those Hartlaub identified as 'verists'. These artists tended to oppose expressionism, but did not so much exemplify the “return to order” as much as they opposed what they saw as the political impotence of expressionist art. They sought to involve themselves into revolutionary politics and their form of realism distorted appearances to emphasize the ugly, as they wanted to expose what they considered the ugliness of reality. The art was raw, provocative, and harshly satirical.

[[Bertolt Brecht]], a German dramatist, was an early critic of Expressionism, referring to it as constrained and superficial. Just like in politics Germany had a new parliament but lacked parliamentarians, he argued, in literature there was an expression of delight in ideas, but no new ideas, and in theater a 'will to drama', but no real drama. His early plays, ''Baal'' and ''Trommeln in der Nacht'' (Drums in the Night) express repudiations of fashionable interest in Expressionism. Opposed to the focus on individual emotional experience in expressionist art, Brecht began a collaborative method to play production, starting with his ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' project.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the ''verist'' critique of expressionism was influenced by [[Dadaism]]. The early exponents of Dada had been drawn together in Switzerland, a neutral country in the war, and in common cause, they wanted to use their art as a form of moral and cultural protest &amp;mdash; shaking off not only the constraints of nationality, but also of artistic language, in order to express political outrage and encourage political action.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Expressionism, to Dadaists, expressed all of the angst and anxieties of society, but was helpless to do anything about it.

Out of this, Dada cultivated a “satirical hyperrealism”, as termed by [[Raoul Hausmann]], and of which the best known examples are the graphical works and photo-montages of [[John Heartfield]]. Use of collage in these works became a ''compositional'' principle to blend reality and art, as if to suggest that to record the facts of reality was to go beyond the most simple appearances of things.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley 2000, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This later developed into portraits and scenes by artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]]. Portraits would give emphasis to particular features or objects that were seen as distinctive aspects of the person depicted. Satirical scenes often depicted a madness behind what was happening, depicting the participants as cartoon-like.

Other ''verist'' artists, like Christian Schad, depicted reality with a clinical precision, which suggested both an empirical detachment and intimate knowledge of the subject. Schad's paintings are characterized "an artistic perception so sharp that it seems to cut beneath the skin", according to Schmied.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied 1978, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Often, psychological elements were introduced in his work, which suggested an underlying unconscious reality to life.

===Animism===

{{Main|Animism (art)}}
[[File:Wolvens, Bont strandzicht, reduced size.jpg|thumb|430px|left|''Bont strandzicht'' by Henri-Victor Wolvens, 1959. Wolvens began his style in the 1920s but worked until his death in 1977.]]
In Belgium, expressionism had been influenced by artists like [[James Ensor]] and [[Louis Pevernagie]] who had combined expressionism with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Ensor, known for his paintings of people in masks, carnival outfits, and side-by-side with skeletons, also often painted realistic scenes, but imbued them with a fevered brush, garish colors, and strong contrasts to suggest a strange unreality present in them, as did Pevernagie. Expressionism was also exhibited in the [[Latemse School]], where adherents like [[Constant Permeke]] and [[Hubert Malfait]] used brushwork in painting and loose form in sculpture to show a mystic reality behind nature.

In what had been called a “retour à l’humain” (return to the human), many artists working in Belgium after the war had kept the expressive brush of their forebearers, but had rejected what they had seen as the anti-human, unreal distortions in their subject matter. The goal was to use the expressive brush to depict the soul or spirit of the objects, people, and places they were painting, rather than a hyperbolic, externalized, displaced angst of the artist. These artists were often characterized as 'introverts', as opposed to the 'extroverts' of expressionism.
[[File:Jespers, floris-still life with coffeepot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Stillleben mit Kaffeekanne'' by Floris Jespers, 1932. Jespers was influenced by animism after the war.]]
Belgian art critic [[Paul Haesaerts]] later gave this movement the title ''animism'', which he took from anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]]'s book ''Primitive Culture'' (1871) describing '[[animism]]' as primitive religion that based itself on the idea a soul inhabited all objects. Later, Haesaerts, driven by criticism to do so, also used the terms ''réalisme poétique'' and ''intimism'', although ''animism'' is still most commonly used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumhermandecuyper.be/evolutie_animisme_en.htm|title= ''Artistic evolution: animism'' |publisher = Museum Herman De Cuyper}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intimism'' will more often refer to the art practiced by some members of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/291874/Intimism|title= ''Intimism'' |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized painter of these artists is [[Henri-Victor Wolvens]], who painted many scenes of the beach and ocean at [[Oostende]]. In his beach scenes, harsh waves are painted with a rough brush, clouds in patches &amp;mdash; rougher when in storm &amp;mdash; and the sand with a scraped quality. Figures are painted as simply as possible, often as stick figures, and given translucency and movement &amp;mdash; so his bathers show the activity of the beach and it the activity of the bathers blend in with the motion of the waves crashing ashore.

The work of [[Floris Jespers]] was strongly influenced by an animist spirit after the war. He uses form and color to give different degrees of vividness to the subjects in his paintings, each to the degree that one would associate them with in life.

Other painters associated with this movement are [[Anne Bonnet]], [[Albert Dasnoy]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Mayou Iserentant]], [[Jacques Maes]], [[Marcel Stobbaerts]], [[Albert Van Dyck]], [[Louis Van Lint]], [[War Van Overstraeten]] and [[Jozef Vinck]].

Filippo De Pisis, referenced above, exhibited animist tendencies.

[[George Grard]] is the sculptor most associated with animism. Like expressionists, he went against both naturalism and classical tendencies, but used exaggerations from his models to heighten the feeling and sensuality of the form, and chose lyrical subjects. Grard was friends with [[Charles LePlae]], who had a similar style, but kept more in line with natural and classical forms.

[[Herman De Cuyper]] is also associated with animism, and abstracted to a more extreme degree than did Grard or LaPlae, and in some ways is more similar to [[Henry Moore]].

==Counter-movements==

An early revolt against the imposed classicism that was popular in the Novecento took place with the founding of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]''.

===Romantic Expressionism===

{{Main|Scuola Romana}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mafai, fantasia no 9 , 1942.jpg|thumb|400px|right|''Fantasia n.9 &amp;mdash; Fucilazione'' by Mario Mafai, 1942]] --&gt;
[[Corrado Cagli]] was a member of this group, and identified himself and others whom he met as members of the “New Roman School of Painting”, or ''nuovi pittori romani'' (new Roman painters).&lt;ref&gt;''Anticipi sulla Scuola di Roma (Anticipations on the School of Rome)'' on "Quadrante" (I, 1933 n.6)&lt;/ref&gt; Cagli spoke of a spreading sensitivity and an ''Astro di Roma'' (Roman Star) which guided them, affirming it as the poetic basis of their art:
{{quote|''In a primordial dawn all has to be reconsidered, and Imagination relives all wonders and trembles for all mysteries.''}}

Sometimes referred to as ''romantic expressionism'', art from this group exhibits a wild painting style, expressive and disorderly, violent and with warm ochre and maroon tones. Contrary to early expressionism, the focus isn't on angst and turmoil, but rather seeing the world anew, as Cagli described, through romantic imagination. Yet, the formal rigour of the Novecento was replaced by a distinctly expressionist visionariness.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Barilli, ''L'arte contemporanea: da [[Cézanne]] alle ultime tendenze'', Feltrinelli, 2005, p.248: "... a savage and reductive raffiguration dominates, which recalls distant baroque trends, or even closer to the expressionist furores of artists such as [[Chagall]], made viable to them thanks to Antonietta Raphaël, who had known him in [[Paris]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione]] brought to life a sort of Roman baroque expressionism, where often decadent landscapes appear of Rome's historical baroque centre, populated by priests and cardinals, seen with a vigorously expressive and hallucinated eye.

[[Mario Mafai]] painted many scenes of Rome and its suburbs, and used warm chromatic colors to convey a sense of freshness and pictorial curiosity. This bent is particularly emphasised in his 1936-1939 work, in a series paintings entitled ''Demolitions'', where in order to make a political statement he painted urban restructuring being carried out by the fascist regime. During the Second World War he painted a series of ''Fantasies'' depicting horrors committed by the fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Negri Arnoldi, ''Storia dell'Arte Moderna'', [[Milan]] 1990, pp.613-616&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonietta Raphaël]], Mafai's wife and a sculptor, was also a member of this group.

Another member was [[Renatto Guttuso]], who like Mafai made paintings which denounced the fascist regime. Guttuso's works are generally bright, lively, and verging on abstraction.

[[Emanuele Cavalli]] and [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] have associations both with the ''Scuola Romana'' and with Magic Realism.

'''Reconciliation ecology''' is the branch of [[ecology]] which studies ways to encourage [[biodiversity]] in [[Human ecosystem|human-dominated]] [[ecosystem]]s. [[Michael Rosenzweig]] first articulated the concept in his book ''[[Win-Win Ecology]]'',&lt;ref name=winwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Win-win Ecology, How the Earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the theory that there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated [[nature preserve]]s. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a "[[win-win]]" situation for both human use and native biodiversity. The science is based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.

==Theoretical basis==

===Human land use trends===
{{Main|List of environmental issues}}
Traditional conservation is based on "reservation and restoration"; reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside for the sole purpose of maintaining biodiversity, and restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems to their natural state. However, reconciliation ecologists argue that there is too great a proportion of land already impacted by humans for these techniques to succeed.

While it is difficult to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%.  This includes [[agricultural]] land, [[pasture]]land, [[urban area|urban]] areas, and heavily harvested [[forest]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M. |author2=H. A. Mooney |author3=J. Lubchenco |author4=J. M. Melillo|title=Human Domination of Earth's Ecosystems|journal=Science|year=1997|volume=277|pages=494–499| doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.494|issue=5325}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 50% of [[arable land]] is already under cultivation.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=R. E.|author2=S. J. Cornell |author3=J. P. W. Scharlemann |author4=A. Balmford |title=Farming and the fate of wild nature|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=307|pages=550–557 | doi = 10.1126/science.1106049|issue=5709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land transformation has increased rapidly over the last fifty years, and is likely to continue to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and Human Well-Being|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond direct transformation of land area, humans have impacted the global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s, leading to human caused change in even the most remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M.|author2=J. D. Aber |author3=R. W. Howarth |author4=G. E. Likens |author5=P. A. Matson |author6=D. W. Schindler |author7=W. H. Schlesinger |author8=D. G. Tilman |title=Human alterations of the global nitrogen cycle: sources and consequences|journal=Ecological Applications|year=1997|volume=7|pages=737–750|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0737:haotgn]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include addition of nutrients such [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], [[acid rain]], [[ocean acidification]], redistribution of water resources, and increased [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and [[speciation]] events caused by formation of [[land bridge]]s and colliding of continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooney|first=H. A|author2=E. E. Cleland |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2001|volume=98|pages=5446–5451|doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398|pmid=11344292|issue=10|pmc=33232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species-area relationships===
[[File:SAR(Species-area curve).gif|250px|thumb|The species-area relationship for a contiguous habitat]]
The need for reconciliation ecology was derived from patterns of species distribution and diversity. The most relevant of these patterns is the [[species-area curve]] which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity. This relationship has been supported by so large a body of research that some scholars consider it to be an ecological law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lomolino|first=M. V.|title=Ecology's most general, yet protean pattern: the species-area relationship|journal=Journal of Biogeography|year=2000|volume=27|pages=17–26|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main reasons for the relationship between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity|journal=Oryx|year=2003|volume=37|pages=194–206|doi=10.1017/s0030605303000371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of [[island biogeography]] as described by [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur, R. H. and E. O. Wilson|title=The Theory of Island Biogeography|year=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.

The species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by [[Frank W. Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=F. W.|title=Time and Space and the Variation of Species|journal=Ecology|year=1960|volume=41|pages=612–627|doi=10.2307/1931793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cA&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;  where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see [[SLOSS debate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desmet|first=P|author2=R. Cowling |title=Using the species-area relationship to set baseline targets for conservation|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Species diversity in space and time|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

Taken together, proponents of reconciliation ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination of a large percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt; For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic [[fertilizer]] is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Countryside biogeography and the provision of ecosystem services.in Forum on Biodivesity.|year=1997|publisher=National Academy Press|location=National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable [[socio-ecological system]] and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.

===Beyond natural history===
[[File:Lanius excubitor 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|thumb|The life history of the [[great grey shrike]] is better understood as a result of focused natural history and reconciliation ecology.]]
How can understanding of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems?  Humans often conduct activities that allow for the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or as a result of a focus on nature.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt;  Traditional [[natural history]] can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically.  However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated [[ecosystems]], through what is known as focused natural history.  Rosenzweig &lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt; cites four examples: [[shrikes]] (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable [[steel fence post]]s contributed to their decline.  Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes.  Additionally, the [[cirl bunting]] (''Emberiza cirlus'') thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, [[natterjack toads]] (''Bufo calamatus'') declined when reductions in [[sheep]] grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and [[longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris'') declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of [[wildfires]] prevented its return after [[timbering]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenzweig | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Avoiding mass extinction: basic and applied challenges | url = | journal = The American Midland Naturalist | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2005)153[0195:amebaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noss 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noss | first1 = R.F. | last2 = Beier | first2 = P. | last3 = Covington | first3 = W.W. | last4 = Grumbine | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Lindenmayer | first5 = D.B. | last6 = Prather | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Schmiegelow | first7 = F. | last8 = Sisk | first8 = T.D. | last9 = Vosick | first9 = D.J. | year = 2006 | title = Recommendations for integrating restoration ecology and conservation biology in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern united states | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 4–10 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.

The emerging concept of [[ecosystem services]] (coined by the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] in 2005) changed the way ecologists perceived so-called "ordinary species" : as abundant species represent the bulk of biomass and biological processes, even if they don't appear directly threatened their conservation constitutes as a major concern for maintaining these services on which rely both human societies and rarer species.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt; Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Reconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes will help to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation because it does not impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; However, not only will it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.

===Habitat connectivity benefits===
Increasing wildlife habitat in human-dominated systems not only increases ''in situ'' biodiversity, it also aids in conservation of surrounding protected areas by increasing connectivity between habitat patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anand|first=M. O|author2=J. Krishnaswamy |author3=A. Kumar |author4=A. Bali |title=Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in Western Ghats: Remnant forests matter|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2010|volume=143|pages=2363–2374|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.01.013|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lombard|first=A.

===Educational benefits===
Placing importance on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J. R|title=Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2005|volume=20|pages=430–434|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in [[outdoor education]] programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogner|first=F. X|title=The influence of short-term outdoor ecology education on long-term variables of environmental perspective|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|year=1998|volume=29|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/00958969809599124|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon|first=J. |author2=M.

===Psychological benefits===
The results of reconciliation ecology can also improve human well-being. [[E. O. Wilson]] has hypothesized that humans have an innate desire to be close to nature (see [[biophilia hypothesis|Biophilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E O|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R. S.|author2=R. F. Simons |author3=B. D. Losito |author4=E. Fiorito |author5=M. A. Miles |author6=M. Zelson |title=Stress recovery during exposures to natural and urban environments|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1991|volume=11|pages=201–230|doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80184-7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of native plants and animals taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology. Others are intentional redesigns of human landscapes to better accommodate native biodiversity. These have been going on for many hundreds of years including examples within agricultural systems, urban and suburban systems, marine systems, and even industrial areas.

===Historical examples===
While Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the [[Czech Republic]], a system of human-engineered [[aquaculture]] ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. Many cities in Europe take pride in their local population of [[storks]], which nest on roofs or in church towers that replace the trees they would naturally nest in.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient [[Mesopotamia]], with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=X.|author2=J. Wu |title=Sustainable landscape architecture: implications of the Chinese philosophy of "unity of man with nature" and beyond|journal=Landscape Ecology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=1015–1026|doi=10.1007/s10980-009-9350-z|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural systems===
[[File:Faidherbia albida.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Agroforestry]] in [[Burkina Faso]] allows [[sorghum]] crop to be grown under native tree species, preserving biodiversity.]]
[[Agroforestry]] provides many examples of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as [[coffee]] or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas.&lt;ref name=bhagwat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhagwat|first=S. A. |author2=K. J. Willis |author3=H. J. B. Birks |author4=R. J. Whittaker|title=Agroforestry: a refuge for tropical biodiversity?|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2008|volume=23|pages=261–268|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.01.005|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correia|first=M|author2=M. Diabate |author3=P. Beavogui |author4=K. Guilavogui |author5=N. Lamanda |author6=H. d. Foresta |title=Conserving forest tree diversity in Guinee Forestiere (Guinea, West Africa): the role of coffee-based agroforests|journal=Biodiversity Conservation|year=2010|volume=19|pages=1725–1747|doi=10.1007/s10531-010-9800-6|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products.&lt;ref name=bhagwat /&gt;  The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving [[fallow]]lands alongside farmed areas can enhance [[understory]] plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="Bobo 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bobo | first1 = K.S. | last2 = Waltert | first2 = M. | last3 = Sainge | first3 = N.M. | last4 = Njokagbor | first4 = J. | last5 = Fermon | first5 = H. | last6 = Muhlenberg | first6 = M. | year = 2006 | title = From forest to farmland: species richness patterns of trees and understorey plants along a gradient of forest conversion in Southwestern Cameroon | url = | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 4097–4117 | doi=10.1007/s10531-005-3368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis'') provides another example of the potential of reconciliation ecology.  It is one of the most important and rapidly expanding tropical crops,&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt; so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native [[biodiversity]], perhaps even more so than logging.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Koh | first2 = L.P. | year = 2010 | title = Addressing the threats to biodiversity from oil-palm agriculture | url = | journal = Conservation of Biodiversity | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 999–1007 | doi=10.1007/s10531-009-9760-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry.  As a [[monoculture]], oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Can oil palm plantations be made more hospitable for forest butterflies and birds? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1002–1009 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01491.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Birds defend oil palms from herbivorous insects | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 821–825 | doi=10.1890/07-1650.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies are attempting an [[integrated pest management]] approach which encourages the planting of species that support [[Predation|predators]] and [[parasitoids]] of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt; Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;  Thus, oil palm plantation managers can participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to [[insectivorous]] birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities.  Additionally, steps such as maintaining [[riparian buffer zones]] or natural forest patches can help to slow the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] within oil palm plantation landscapes.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010" /&gt;  By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;

There are many grazing practices that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book he uses the example of a rancher in [[Arizona]] who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened [[leopard frog]]s (''Rana chiricahuensis''), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle,&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma californiense'') in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining [[vernal pool]]s would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyke|first=C. R.|author2=J. Marty |title=Cattle Grazing Mediates Climate Change Impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1619–1625|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C. A. |author2=C. Villanueva |author3=J. Villacís |author4=M. Chacón |author5=D. Muñoz |author6=M. López |author7=M. Ibrahim |author8=R. Gómez |author9=R. Taylor |author10=J. Martinez |author11=A.

===Urban systems===
[[File:MEC's green roof among others.jpg|250px|thumb|Green roofs can help maintain species diversity in urban landscapes.]]
[[Urban ecology]] can be included under the umbrella of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=L. R.|title=Eco-Economy: building an economy for the Earth|year=2001|publisher=Norton|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the [[urban heat island]] effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=N. B.|author2=S. H. Faeth |author3=N. E. Golubiewski |author4=C. L. Redman |author5=J. Wu |author6=X. Bai |author7=J. M. Briggs |title=Global Change and the Ecology of Cities|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=319|pages=756–760 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150195|issue=5864|pmid=18258902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing trend among city managers to take biodiversity into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species.&lt;ref name=Grimm /&gt; However, these species are often not native, and a large part of the total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=G |author2=G. Jiang |author3=Y. Zhou |author4=Q. Liu |author5=Y. Ji |author6=S. Wang |author7=S. Chen |author8=H. Liu|title=Biodiversity conservation in a fast-growing metropolitan area in China: a case study of plant diversity in Beijing|journal=Biodiversity Conservation|year=2007|volume=16|pages=4025–4038|doi=10.1007/s10531-007-9205-3|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because cities are so highly impacted by human activities, restoration to the pristine state is not possible, however there are modifications that can be made to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the [[flood control]] and water supply services.&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=R. A.|title=Perspectives on the potential for reconciliation ecology in urban riverscapes|journal=CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources|year=2009|volume=4|pages=1–20|doi=10.1079/pavsnnr20094073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured [[lawn]]s, as is seen in the [[National Wildlife Federation]]’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufts, C. and P. Loewer|title=Gardening for wildlife|year=1995|publisher=Rodale Press|location=Emmaus, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), which were once endangered by [[pesticide]] use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced [[rock dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cade|first=T|author2=D. Bird |title=Peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, nesting in an urban environment: a review|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|year=1990|volume=104|pages=209–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.

===Industrial systems===
{{further|industrial ecology}}
In Florida, the [[Florida manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus latirostris'') uses warm water discharged from power plants as a refuge when the temperature of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laist|first=D. W.|author2=J. E. Reynolds |title=Florida manatees, warm-water refuges, and an uncertain future|journal=Coastal Management|year=2005|volume=33|pages=279–295|doi=10.1080/08920750590952018|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These warm areas replace the warm springs that manatees once naturally used in the winter. These springs have been drained or cut off from open water by human uses. [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus'') have a similar habitat in the cooling canals of the [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station|Turkey Point]] power plant, where an estimated 10% of the total North American population of the species lives.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

[[Wastewater treatment]] systems have shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the [[Everglades]] in Florida are used as breeding sites for a number of birds, including the endangered [[wood stork]] (''Mycteria americana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frederick|first=P. C|author2=S. M. McGhee. |title=Wading bird use of wastewater treament wetlands in central Florida, USA|journal=Colonial Waterbirds|year=1994|volume=17|pages=50–59|doi=10.2307/1521381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stormwater treatment ponds can provide important breeding habitat for amphibians, especially where natural wetlands have been drained by human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brand|first=A. B.|author2=J. W. Snodgrass |title=Value of artificial habitats for amphibian reproduction in altered landscapes|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=295–301|pmid=19681986|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean systems===
[[Coral reefs]] have been intensively impacted by human use, including [[overfishing]] and mining of the reef itself. One reconciliation approach to this problem is building [[artificial reef]]s that not only provide valuable habitat for aquatic species, but also protect nearby islands from storms when the natural structure has been mined away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=S|author2=A. J. Edwards |title=An evaluation of artificial reef structures as tools for marine habitat rehabilitation in the Maldives|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|year=1998|volume=9|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0755(199901/02)9:1&lt;5::aid-aqc330&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even structures as simple as scrap metal and automobiles can be used as habitat, providing added benefits of freeing space in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=R. E|author2=J. E. Norris |title=An analysis of four artificial reef designs in tropical waters|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|year=1989|volume=44|pages=934–941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Governmental intervention can aid in encouraging private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' [[Endangered Species Act]] requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, which is a disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; To help mediate this problem, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcove|first=D. S|author2=J. Lee |title=Using economic and regulatory incentives to restore endangered species: lessons learned from three new programs|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2004|issue=3|pages=639–645|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00250.x|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has already led to an increase in [[aplomado falcon]]s (''Falco femoralis'') in [[Texas]] and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s (''Picoides borealis'') in the Southeastern US.

Another example is the [[US Department of Agriculture]]’s [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP). The CRP was originally put in place to protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity.  In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, [[erosion control]]ling vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=C. P|author2=F. Stearns |author3=G. R. Guntenspergen |author4=D. M. Sharpe |title=Ecological benefits of the Conservation Reserve Program|journal=Conservation Biology|year=1993|volume=7|pages=132–139|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010132.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
While reconciliation ecology attempts to modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates may be seen as "untidy" and a sign of poor management by residents.&lt;ref name=Francis /&gt; Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=P|author2=A. Polderman |author3=T. Birkenholtz |title=Lawns and Toxins: An Ecology of the City|journal=Cities|year=2001|volume=18|pages=369–380|doi=10.1016/S0264-2751(01)00029-4|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially [[predator]]s such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual risk of loss or injury resulting from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=K. M|title=Carnivore-Livestock Conflicts: Effects of Subsidized Predator Control and Economic Correlates on the Sheep Industry|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00336.x|pmid=16909568|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even with cooperation of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of [[waterfowl]], show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=J. A|author2=K. Norris |author3=W. J. Sutherland |title=Why behavioral responses may not reflect the population consequences of human disturbance|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2001|volume=97|pages=265–268|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00002-1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=S. P. D|author2=J. P. Pollinger |author3=R. M. Savajot |author4=E. C. York |author5=C. Bromley |author6=T. Fuller |author7=R. K. Wayne |title=A southern California freeway is a physical and social barrier to gene flow in carnivores|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2006|volume=15|pages=1733–1741|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02907.x|pmid=16689893|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These animals will require undisturbed land set aside for them.

There is hence a double social challenge for reconciliation ecology : making people's perception of biodiversity evolve, and then changing relating norms and policies so as to better consider biodiversity as a positive component in our habitat.&lt;ref name="Couvet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couvet|first=Denis|last2=Ducarme|first2=Frédéric|title=Reconciliation ecology, from biological to social challenges|journal=Revue d'ethnoécologie|year=2014|volume=6|pages=|doi=10.4000/ethnoecologie.1979 |pmid=|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker.

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16146">In [[computability theory]], '''super-recursive algorithms''' are a generalization of ordinary [[algorithm]]s that are more powerful, that is, compute more than [[Turing machines]]. The term was introduced by Mark Burgin, whose book "Super-recursive algorithms" develops their theory and presents several mathematical models. Turing machines and other mathematical models of conventional algorithms allow researchers to find properties of recursive algorithms and their computations. In a similar way, mathematical models of super-recursive algorithms, such as [[#Inductive Turing machines|inductive Turing machines]], allow researchers to find properties of super-recursive algorithms and their computations.

Burgin, as well as other researchers (including [[Selim Akl]], Eugene Eberbach, Peter Kugel, [[Jan van Leeuwen]], [[Hava Siegelmann]], Peter Wegner, and Jiří Wiedermann) who studied different kinds of super-recursive algorithms and contributed to the theory of super-recursive algorithms, have argued that super-recursive algorithms can be used to disprove the [[Church-Turing thesis]], but this point of view has been criticized within the mathematical community and is not widely accepted.

== Definition ==

Burgin (2005: 13) uses the term '''recursive algorithms''' for [[algorithm]]s that can be implemented on Turing machines, and uses the word ''algorithm'' in a more general sense. Then a '''super-recursive class of algorithms''' is "a class of algorithms in which it is possible to compute functions not computable by any [[Turing machine]]" (Burgin 2005: 107).

Super-recursive algorithms are closely related to [[hypercomputation]] 
in a way similar to the relationship between ordinary computation and ordinary algorithms. Computation is a process, while an algorithm is a finite constructive description of such a process. Thus a super-recursive algorithm defines a "computational process (including processes of input and output) that cannot be realized by recursive algorithms." (Burgin 2005: 108). A more restricted definition demands that  [[hypercomputation]] solves a [[supertask]] (see Copeland 2002; Hagar and Korolev 2007).

Super-recursive algorithms are also related to '''algorithmic schemes''', which are more general than super-recursive algorithms. Burgin argues (2005: 115) that it is necessary to make a clear distinction between super-recursive algorithms and those algorithmic schemes that are not algorithms. Under this distinction, some types of hypercomputation are obtained by super-recursive algorithms, e.g., inductive Turing machines, while other types of hypercomputation are directed by algorithmic schemas, e.g., infinite time Turing machines. This explains how works on super-recursive algorithms are related to hypercomputation and vice versa. According to this argument, super-recursive algorithms are just one way of defining a hypercomputational process.

== Examples ==

Examples of super-recursive algorithms include (Burgin 2005: 132):
* '''limiting recursive functions''' and '''limiting partial recursive functions''' (E.M. Gold 1965)
* '''trial and error predicates''' (Hilary Putnam 1965) 
* '''inductive inference machines''' (Carl Smith)
* '''inductive Turing machines''', which perform computations similar to computations of [[Turing machines]] and produce their results after a finite number of steps (Mark Burgin)
* '''limit Turing machines''', which perform computations similar to computations of Turing machines but their final results are limits of their intermediate results (Mark Burgin)
*  '''trial-and-error machines''' (Ja. Hintikka and A. Mutanen 1998)
* '''[[#Schmidhuber's generalized Turing machines|general Turing machines]]''' (J. Schmidhuber)
* '''Internet machines''' ([[Jan van Leeuwen|van Leeuwen, J.]] and Wiedermann, J.)
* '''evolutionary computers''', which use DNA to produce the value of a function (Darko Roglic)
* '''fuzzy computation''' (Jirí Wiedermann 2004)
* '''evolutionary Turing machines''' (Eugene Eberbach 2005)

Examples of algorithmic schemes include:

* '''Turing machines with arbitrary oracles''' (Alan Turing)
* '''Transrecursive operators''' (Borodyanskii and Burgin)
* '''machines that compute with real numbers''' (L. Blum, F. Cucker, M. Shub, and S. Smale 1998)
* '''neural networks based on real numbers''' (Hava Siegelmann 1999)

For examples of practical '''super-recursive algorithms''', see the book of Burgin.

== Inductive Turing machines ==

'''Inductive Turing machines''' implement an important class of super-recursive algorithms. An inductive Turing machine is a definite list of well-defined instructions for completing a task which, when given an initial state, will proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually giving the final result. The difference between an inductive Turing machine and an ordinary [[Turing machine]] is that an ordinary Turing machine must stop when it has obtained its result, while in some cases an inductive Turing machine can continue to compute after obtaining the result, without stopping. Kleene called procedures that could run forever without stopping by the name ''calculation procedure or algorithm'' (Kleene 1952:137). Kleene also demanded that such an algorithm must eventually exhibit "some object" (Kleene 1952:137). Burgin argues that this condition is satisfied by inductive Turing machines, as their results are exhibited after a finite number of steps. The reason that inductive Turing machines cannot be instructed to halt when their final output is produced is that in some cases inductive Turing machines may not be able to tell at which step the result has been obtained.

Simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent to other models of computation such as general Turing machines of Schmidhuber, trial and error predicates of Hilary Putnam, limiting partial recursive functions of Gold, and trial-and-error machines of Hintikka and Mutanen (1998). More advanced inductive Turing machines are much more powerful. There are hierarchies of inductive Turing machines that can decide membership in arbitrary sets of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] (Burgin 2005). In comparison with other equivalent models of computation, simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines give direct constructions of computing automata that are thoroughly grounded in physical machines. In contrast, trial-and-error predicates, limiting recursive functions, and limiting partial recursive functions present only syntactic systems of symbols with formal rules for their manipulation. Simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines are related to limiting partial recursive functions and trial-and-error predicates as Turing machines are related to partial recursive functions and lambda calculus.

The non-halting computations of inductive Turing machines should not be confused with infinite-time computations (see, for example, Potgieter 2006). First, some computations of inductive Turing machines do halt. As in the case of conventional Turing machines, some halting computations give the result, while others do not. Even if it does not halt, an inductive Turing machine produces output from time to time. If this output stops changing, it is then considered the result of the computation.

There are two main distinctions between ordinary Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines. The first distinction is that even simple inductive Turing machines can do much more than conventional Turing machines. The second distinction is that a conventional Turing machine will always determine (by coming to a final state) when the result is obtained, while a simple inductive Turing machine, in some cases (such as when "computing" something that cannot be computed by an ordinary Turing machine), will not be able to make this determination.

== Schmidhuber's generalized Turing machines ==
A symbol sequence is '''computable in the limit''' if there is a finite, possibly non-halting program on a [[universal Turing machine]] that incrementally outputs every symbol of the sequence. This includes the dyadic expansion of &amp;pi; but still excludes most of the real numbers, because most cannot be described by a finite program. Traditional [[Turing machine]]s with a write-only output tape cannot edit their previous outputs; generalized [[Turing machines]], according to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], can edit their output tape as well as their work tape. He defines the constructively describable symbol sequences as those that have a finite, non-halting program running on a generalized Turing machine, such that any output symbol eventually converges, that is, it does not change any more after some finite initial time interval.  Schmidhuber (2000, 2002) uses this approach to define the set of formally describable or constructively computable universes or constructive [[theory of everything|theories of everything]]. Generalized Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines are two classes of super-recursive algorithms that are the closest to recursive algorithms (Schmidhuber 2000).

== Relation to the Church–Turing thesis ==

The Church–Turing thesis in recursion theory relies on a particular definition of the term ''algorithm''. Based on definitions that are more general than the one commonly used in recursion theory, Burgin argues that super-recursive algorithms, such as '''inductive Turing machines''' disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. He proves furthermore that super-recursive algorithms could theoretically provide even greater efficiency gains than using [[quantum algorithms]].

Burgin's interpretation of super-recursive algorithms has encountered opposition in the mathematical community. One critic is logician [[Martin Davis]], who argues that Burgin's claims have been well understood "for decades". Davis states, 
:"The present criticism is not about the mathematical discussion of these matters but only about the misleading claims regarding physical systems of the present and future."(Davis 2006: 128)
Davis disputes Burgin's claims that sets at level &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_2&lt;/math&gt; of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] can be called computable, saying
:"It is generally understood that for a computational result to be useful one must be able to at least recognize that it is indeed the result sought." (Davis 2006: 128)

The '''Systems Biology Ontology''' (SBO) is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in [[Systems Biology]], and in particular in computational modeling. SBO is part of the [http://www.biomodels.net/ BioModels.net] effort.

==Motivation==

The rise of Systems Biology, seeking to comprehend biological processes as a whole, highlighted the need to not only develop corresponding quantitative models, but also to create standards allowing their exchange and integration. This concern drove the community to design common data format such as [[SBML]] and [[CellML]]. SBML is now largely accepted and used in the field.  However, as important as the definition of a common syntax is, it is also necessary to make clear the semantics of models. SBO is an attempt to provide the means of annotating models with terms that indicate the intended semantics of an important subset of models in common use in computational systems biology.&lt;ref&gt;Le Novère N. BioModels.net, tools and resources to support Computational Systems Biology. Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Computation of Biochemical Pathways and Genetic Networks (2005), Logos, Berlin, pp. 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Novère N., Courtot M., Laibe C. Adding semantics in kinetics models of biochemical pathways. Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on experimental standard conditions of enzyme characterizations (2007), 137-153. [http://www.beilstein-institut.de/index.php?id=196 Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The development of SBO was first discussed  at the 9th SBML Forum Meeting in Heidelberg Oct. 14–15, 2004. During the forum, [[Pedro Pedrosa Mendes|Pedro Mendes]] mentioned that modellers possessed a lot of knowledge that was necessary to understand the model, and more importantly to simulate it,  but this knowledge was not encoded in SBML. [[Nicolas Le Novère]] proposed to create a controlled vocabulary to store the content of Pedro Mendes' mind before he wandered out of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Le Novère, personal communication&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the ontology was  announced more officially in a message from Le Novère to Michael Hucka and Andrew Finney on October 19.

==Structure==

SBO is currently made up of seven different vocabularies:
* systems description parameter (catalytic constant, thermodynamic temperature...)
* participant role (substrate, product, catalyst...)
* modelling framework (discrete, continuous...)
* mathematical expression (mass-action rate law, Hill-type rate law...)
* occurring entity representation (biochemical process, molecular or genetic interaction...)
* physical entity representation (transporter, physical compartment, observable...)
* metadata representation (annotation)

==Resources==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SBO small.jpg|frame|right|The Systems Biology Ontology Browser|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
To curate and maintain SBO, a dedicated resource has been developed and the public interface of the SBO browser can be accessed at [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo].
A relational database management system ([[MySQL]]) at the back-end is
accessed through a web interface based on [[Java Server Pages]] (JSP) and [[JavaBeans]].  Its
content is encoded in [[UTF-8]], therefore supporting a large set of
characters in the definitions of terms.  Distributed curation is made possible
by using a custom-tailored locking system allowing concurrent access.
This system allows a continuous update of the ontology with immediate
availability and suppress merging problems.

Several exports formats ([http://www.godatabase.org/dev/doc/obo_format_spec.html OBO] flat file, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/docs/sboxml_schema.xsd SBO-XML] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ OWL]) are generated daily or on request and can be downloaded from the web interface.

To allow programmatic access to the resource, [[Web Services]] have been implemented based on [http://ws.apache.org/axis/ Apache Axis] for the communication layer and [http://www.castor.org/ Castor] for the validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li C, Courtot M, Le Novère N, Laibe C |title=BioModels.net Web Services, a free and integrated toolkit for computational modelling software |journal=Brief. Bioinformatics |volume= 11|issue= 3|pages= 270–7|date=November 2009 |pmid=19939940 |pmc=2913671 |doi=10.1093/bib/bbp056 |url=http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19939940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries, full documentation, samples and tutorial are available [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/SBOWSLib/ws.html online].

The sourceforge project can be accessed at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbo/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbo/].

==SBO and SBML==

Since [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71971&amp;package_id=76633 Level 2 Version 2] [[SBML]] provides a mechanism to annotate model components with SBO terms, therefore increasing the semantics of the
model beyond the sole topology of interaction and mathematical expression.  Modelling tools such as SBMLsqueezer use SBO terms too. Simulation tools can check the consistency of a rate law, convert reaction from one modelling framework to another (e.g., continuous to discrete), or distinguish between identical mathematical expressions based on different assumptions (e.g., Henri-Michaelis-Menten Vs. Briggs-Haldane).  Other tools such as [http://www.semanticsbml.org/ semanticSBML]&lt;ref&gt;Krause F, Uhlendorf J., Lubitz T., Schulz M., Klipp E., Liebermeister W. (2010), Annotation and merging of SBML models with semanticSBML, Bioinformatics 26 (3), 421-422&lt;/ref&gt; can use the SBO annotation to integrate individual models into a larger one.  The use of SBO is not restricted to the development of models. Resources providing quantitative experimental information such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20061117195025/http://sabio.villa-bosch.de/SABIORK/ SABIO Reaction Kinetics] will be able to annotate the parameters (what do they mean exactly, how were they calculated) and determine relationships between them.

==SBO and SBGN==

All the graphical symbols used in the [[SBGN]] languages are associated with an SBO term. This permits, for instance, to help generate [[SBGN]] maps from [[SBML]] models.

==SBO and BioPAX==

The Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX) allows SBO terms to be added to [[BioPAX|Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)]]. This links BioPAX to information useful for modelling, especially by adding quantitative descriptions described by SBO.

==Organization of SBO development==

SBO is built in collaboration by the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur Computational Neurobiology Group] (Nicolas Le Novère, [[EMBL]]-[[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]], United-Kingdom) and the [[SBML]]Team (Michael Hucka, [[Caltech]], USA).

==Funding for SBO==
SBO has benefited from the funds of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] and the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">'''Teichoscopy''' or teichoscopia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm Teichoscopy&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "viewing from the walls," is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's ''[[Iliad]],'' Book 3, lines 121-244.

The passage begins with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] approached in her chamber by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], disguised as her sister-in-law [[Laodice (mythology)|Laodice]], the daughter of [[Priam]]. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between [[Menelaus]] and [[Paris]].  Helen identifies [[Agamemnon]], [[Odysseus]], [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian (Greater) Ajax]], and [[Idomeneus]].  She also mentions that she does not see her brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to [[Zeus]] and the rest of the gods on [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to open the action.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to Ancient Narratives''.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the 'author' of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors."&lt;ref&gt;Pantelia, Maria C. ''Helen and the Last Song for Hector.'' Transactions of the American Philological Association 132.1-2 (2002) 21-27 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/transactions_of_the_american_philological_association/v132/132.1pantelia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Menelaus]], would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/iliad3.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although [[Homer]] is not at the beginning of the [[Trojan War]], he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.

Although teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen.  Helen’s open admiration of both the Greek and [[Troy|Trojan]] warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint.  He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”&lt;ref&gt;Remarks on Counterpoint Characterization in Euripides.  Frederic Will.  ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 8. (May, 1960), pp. 338-344.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3294564].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in [[dramaturgy]].

Natural phenomena, too, may be conveyed by this device. Far-off drama such as the sun rising, or a description of stars across the firmament lend themselves to this treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''The Regenerative Medicine Institute''' (REMEDI), was established in 2003 as a Centre for Science, Technology &amp; Engineering in collaboration with [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].  It obtained an award of €14.9 million from [[Science Foundation Ireland]] over five years.

It conducts basic research and applied research in [[regenerative medicine]], an emerging field that combines the technologies of [[gene therapy]] and adult [[stem cell therapy]].  The goal is to use cells and genes to regenerate healthy tissues that can be used to repair or replace other tissues and organs in a minimally invasive approach.

Centres for Science, Engineering &amp; Technology help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions, foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies, attract industry that could make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy, and expand educational and career opportunities in Ireland in science and engineering. CSETs must exhibit outstanding research quality, intellectual breadth, active collaboration, flexibility in responding to new research opportunities, and integration of research and education in the fields that SFI supports.{{Unreferenced|date=March 2014}}

'''Tolerable weekly intake''' (TWI) estimates the amount per unit body weight of a potentially harmful substance or contaminant in food or water that can be ingested over a lifetime without risk of adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IUPAC Glossary of Terms Used in Toxicology, 2nd Edition – Terms Starting with T|url = http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/iupacglossary/glossaryt.html|website = sis.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimation of Seasonal Risk Caused by the Intake of Lead, Mercury and Cadmium through Freshwater Fish Consumption from Urban Water Reservoirs in Arid Areas of Northern Mexico|journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 1661-7827|pmc = 4344694|pmid = 25658686|pages = 1803–1816|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.3390/ijerph120201803|first = Myrna|last = Nevárez|first2 = Luz O.|last2 = Leal|first3 = Myriam|last3 = Moreno}}&lt;/ref&gt; TWI is generally preceded by "provisional" to indicate insufficient data exists, increasing uncertainty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Background to the ADI/TDI/PTWI|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913351|journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|date = 1999-10-01|pages = S109-S113|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1335|first = J. L.|last = Herrman|first2 = M.|last2 = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The term TWI should be reserved for when there is a well-established and internationally accepted tolerance, backed by sound and uncontested data. Although similar in concept to tolerable daily intake (TDI), which is of the same derivation of [[acceptable daily intake]]s (ADIs), TWI accounts for contaminants that do not clear the body quickly and may accumulate within the body over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  An example is heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = http://koreascience.or.kr/journal/view.jsp?kj=DSHHBQ&amp;py=2012&amp;vnc=v28n3&amp;sp=143|url = http://koreascience.or.kr/journal/view.jsp?kj=DSHHBQ&amp;py=2012&amp;vnc=v28n3&amp;sp=143|journal = Toxicological Research|pages = 143–149|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.5487/tr.2012.28.3.143|first = Ji-Ae|last = Kim|first2 = Seung-Ha|last2 = Lee|first3 = Seung-Hyun|last3 = Choi|first4 = Ki-Kyung|last4 = Jung|first5 = Mi-Sun|last5 = Park|first6 = Ji-Yoon|last6 = Jeong|first7 = Myung-Sil|last7 = Hwang|first8 = Hae-Jung|last8 = Yoon|first9 = Dal-Woong|last9 = Choi|pmc = 3834422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of TWI takes into account daily variations in human consumption patterns.

==Background==
Governments and international organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) generally use the safety factor approach, based on ADI, to determine intake tolerances for substances that exhibit thresholds for toxicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Codex Alimentarius Commission, with the help of independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO, develops and publishes tolerances based on the best available science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CODEX Alimentarius: About Codex|url = http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/en/|website = www.codexalimentarius.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After identifying a substance of concern, researchers and experts then study information the substance's metabolism by humans and animals (as appropriate), the substance's [[toxicokinetics]] and [[toxicodynamics]] (including carry-over of the toxic substance from feed to edible animal tissue/products); and the substance's acute and long term toxicity in order to determine the acceptability and safety of intake levels of the substance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In comparison to TWI, the Codex maximum level (ML) for a food is the maximum concentration of that substance recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) to be legally permitted in that commodity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/agns/pdf/CXS_193e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Sources ==
# The JECFA makes a distinction between acceptable intakes and tolerable intakes. Tolerable is used to demonstrate permissibility, not acceptability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Substances such as [[food additive]]s, veterinary drugs, and pesticides that can be controlled in the food supply relatively easily are assessed an acceptable daily intake, or ADI.  Other substances considered contaminants are assessed a tolerable daily or weekly intake, TDI or TWI, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tolerable intakes, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, should not be confused with [[Reference Daily Intake|reference daily intake]], or RDI.  RDI refers to the amount of a given nutrient individuals should uptake to maintain health.
# When determining TWI, appropriate safety factors are applied to allow for extrapolation of human [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]s (NOAELs). NOAELs are established by toxicological studies in animals, and the appropriate safety factors are applied so human NOAELs can be extrapolated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Precision of Estimates of an ADI (or TDI or PTWI)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913314|journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|date = 1999-10-01|pages = S87-S93|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1331|first = Gerrit J. A.|last = Speijers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For additives that have an observed effect, and it is not known whether or not the effect is negative, ADI is based on a no observed effect level, or NOEL.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   To determine the NOEL, researchers primarily use animals (the species most sensitive to the treatments) and carefully select doses until they determine the highest dose that presents an adverse (toxic, but not deadly) effect not observed in lowest dose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When adverse effects predominate, the JMPR bases the ADI on the NOAELs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Uncertainty factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guidance values for human exposure limits (EHC 170, 1994)|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc170.htm|website = www.inchem.org|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; are applied to account for intra- and inter-species differences.

==Calculations==

Tolerable intake is usually expressed in micrograms or milligrams per kilogram of body weight.  Intake (exposure) is determined using the following formula:

Exposure = ∑&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
(consumption)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x (concentration)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / Body Weight

'''Underwater archaeology''' is [[archaeology]] practiced underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/gprc/docDetail.action?|title=Underwater and Maritime Archeology in Latin America and the Caribbean|page=21 | id=docid 10408690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the [[classical era]] to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.se/~pa/uwa/history.htm |title=A history of underwater archaeology |first=Per |last=Akesson |work=Nordic Underwater Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbins |first1=David |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Adams |first2=Jonathan |title=Shipwrecks and maritime archaeology |journal=World Archaeology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=279–291 |year=2001 |doi=10.1080/00438240120048635}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. Underwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, [[maritime archaeology]]: the scientifically based study of past [[human]] life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under [[Sea water|salt]] or [[fresh water]] or buried beneath water-logged [[sediment]].&lt;ref name="Muckelroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muckelroy |first=K. |title=Maritime archaeology |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-521-29348-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater [[aviation archaeology]] have also emerged as bona fide activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broken Wings|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/maritime-archaeology/treasures-from-the-deep/broken-wings|website=[[Western Australian Museum]]|publisher=[[Government of Western Australia]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in [[sea-level|sea level]] because of local [[seismic]] events such as the earthquakes that devastated [[Port Royal]] and [[Alexandria]] or more widespread [[climatic]] changes on a [[continent]]al scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged.&lt;ref name="PortRoyal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/portroyal/|title=Port Royal Project: Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BouldnerCliff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2007/jul/07_90.shtml|title=:: University of Southampton|author=University of Southampton|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819063330/http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2007/jul/07_90.shtml|archivedate=2007-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the last ice age, the [[North Sea]] was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as [[mammoths]], are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of [[crannogs]],&lt;ref name="crannog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crannog.co.uk/|title=The Scottish Crannog Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; bridges and [[harbours]]) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater [[archaeological]] sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising [[sea level]]s; wells, cenotes, wrecks ([[shipwrecks]]; [[aircraft]]); the remains of structures created in water (such as [[crannogs]], [[bridge]]s or [[harbours]]); other port-related structures; [[refuse]] or [[debris]] sites where people disposed of their [[waste]], garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by [[ocean dumping|dumping]] into the water.

Underwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/wrecks/id-811 |publisher=Shipwreck Databases Western Australian Museum |title= Zuiddorp (Zuytdorp) (1712/06) North of Kalbarri}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/march/shipwrecks/Zuytdorp/Zuytdorp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603062706/http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/march/shipwrecks/Zuytdorp/Zuytdorp.html |archivedate=2004-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research potential ==
There are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual [[shipwreck]]s can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]) or circumstances of loss (''[[USS Housatonic (1861)|Housatonic]]'' was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine).&lt;ref name="Titanic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/|title=TIP – United States Senate Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Housatonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Housatonic i|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/housatonic-i.html|publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipwrecks such as ''[[Mary Rose]]'' can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental [[time capsule]], preserving an assemblage of human [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] at the moment in time when the ship was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml|title=BBC World Service – Documentaries – What Lies Beneath|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maryrose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryrose.org/|title=The Mary Rose|work=The Mary Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]]'', which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (''Hunley'' also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact);&lt;ref name="Housatonic" /&gt; the ''[[Resurgam]]'' ''II'', the first powered submarine;&lt;ref name=ACHW2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee on Historic  Wreck  Sites Annual Report 2005 |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport (United Kingdom)|Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] |accessdate=5 June 2015 |format=pdf |date=June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114115741/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Holland 5]]'', which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.&lt;ref name=DCMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Minister Andrew McIntosh Acts To Protect Wreck Site Of Prototype Submarine|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2005/dcms001_05.htm|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport (United Kingdom)|Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060926083354/http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2005/dcms001_05.htm|archivedate=26 September 2006|date=4 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Convention ==
All traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Convention on the protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comasproject.eu/index.php?lang=en |title=CoMAS project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919052158/http://www.comasproject.eu/index.php?lang=en |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Underwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, [[diving equipment]] and [[Diver training|diving skills]] are necessary. The depths that can be [[scuba diving|accessed by divers]], and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, [[submarines]] or [[remote sensing]] equipment are needed.

For a marine site, while  some form of working platform (typically a [[boat]] or [[ship]]) is  often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by [[logistics]] problems. A working platform for underwater archeology needs to be equipped to provide for  the delivery of air for example,  recompression and medical  facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including [[water dredge]] and [[air lifts]] create additional [[safety|hazards]] and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong [[tidal]] flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.

Underwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by [[Ocean current|currents]], [[Ocean surface wave|surf]], [[storm]] damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make [[in-situ conservation]] infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as [[Pholadidae|piddocks]]. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form [[concretions]]. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from underwater sites need special care.

[[Visibility]] may be poor, because of sediments or [[algae]] in the water and lack of light penetration.&lt;ref name="Cantelas1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=FJ |last1=Cantelas |first2=BA |last2=Rodgers |title=Tools, Techniques, and Zero Visibility Archaeology. |journal=In: EJ Maney, Jr and CH Ellis, Jr (Eds.)

In addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good [[outreach]] possibilities or access for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deepwater Archaeology in Oil and Gas – By Kimberly L. Faulk|url=https://muablog.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/deepwater-archaeology-in-oil-and-gas-by-kimberly-l-faulk-nee-eslinger/|website=Museum of Underwater Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the [[World Wide Web]] for [[webcasting]] projects. An example is  the excavation of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=C |last1=Southerly |first2=J |last2=Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

== Techniques ==
Although specialised techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.&lt;ref name="Muckelroy" /&gt;

An important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the [[logistics]] of operating from a boat and of managing [[diving operations]]. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the ''Mary Rose'' have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.&lt;ref name="Maryrose" /&gt;

As with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualisation).

=== Position fixing ===
Knowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so [[position fixing]] is generally achieved using [[GPS]]. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using [[Navigational transit|transects]]. A site may also be located by visually [[Position fixing|surveying]] some form of marker (such as a [[buoy]]) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding [[sonar]] equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.

=== Site survey ===
[[File:Laevavrakk "Aid".png|thumb|[[Side-scan sonar]] image of shipwreck ''Aid'' in [[Estonia]].]]
The type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.

The simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional [[surveying]] by divers using [[depth gauge]]s and [[tape measure]]ments.&lt;ref name="3H"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/ |title=3D survey resource site from 3H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210160101/http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/ |archive-date=February 10, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land.&lt;ref name="3Htapeerrors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/Downloads/Tape%20Accuracy%20Paper.pdf |title=Research on the accuracy of tape survey methods from 3H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601204853/http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/Downloads/Tape%20Accuracy%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=June 1, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2018 |last=Holt |first=Peter |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, [[Remotely Operated Vehicle]]s (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface.&lt;ref name=NOAAROV&gt;{{cite web|title="ROV" stands for remotely operated vehicle|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/rov.html|website=Ocean Explorer|publisher=[[Office of Ocean Exploration]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning.&lt;ref name="Wessexacoustic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/round2/acoustic-positioning.html|title=The Acoustic Tracking System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROV technology was used during the ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water.&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Remote sensing]] or Marine Geophysics&lt;ref name="WessexGeophysics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/geophysical_survey_methodology.html|title=Geophysical Survey Methodology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is generally carried out using equipment towed from a vessel on the surface and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site.  Sensitive [[sonar]], especially [[side-scan sonar]] or multi-beam sonar&lt;ref name="Wessexmultibeam"&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/multibeam_sonar.html Multibeam sonar evaluated by Wessex Archaeology] as part of ALSF funded "Wrecks on the Seabed" project&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to image an underwater site.  [[Magnetometer|Magnetometry]]&lt;ref name="Wessexmagnetometry"&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/magnetometer.html Magnetometry evaluated by Wessex Archaeology] as part of ALSF funded "Wrecks on the Seabed" project&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to locate metal remains such as metal [[shipwrecks]], [[anchors]] and [[cannon]].  Sub-bottom profiling&lt;ref name="Wessexsubbottom"&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/sub_bottom_profiler.html Sub-bottom profiling sonar evaluated by Wessex Archaeology] as part of ALSF funded "Wrecks on the Seabed" project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gracedieu"&gt;[http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/39914/01/pdf_paper.pdf Sub-bottom profile investigation of the ''Grace Dieu'' from The University of Southampton]&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment.

=== Recording ===
[[File:Diver&amp;shipsbell.jpg|thumb|LAMP archaeologist recording a scaled drawing of the ship's bell discovered on the late 18th century "Storm Wreck" off St. Augustine, Florida]]
A variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. [[Scale drawing]] is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic [[Slate (writing)|dive slates]], or matt [[laminated]] paper.

[[Photography]] and [[videography]] are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. [[Cameras]], including [[video cameras]] can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for [[underwater videography]]. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single [[Photomontage|photomontage or photomosaic]] image of the whole site. 3D [[photogrammetry]] has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Damme |first=T |title=Computer Vision Photogrammetry for Underwater Archaeological Site Recording in a Low-Visibility Environment |url=http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W5/231/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W5-231-2015.pdf |website=The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences |doi=10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-W5-231-2015 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Excavation ===
Where intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a [[water dredge]] or [[airlift (dredging device)|airlift]]. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.

=== Archaeological science ===
A variety of [[archaeological science]]s are used in underwater archaeology. [[Dendrochronology]] is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, [[archaeobotany]] and [[archaeozoology]] have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of [[pollen]] samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through [[X-ray]] of concretions. [[Geology]] can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, [[erosion]] by rivers and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] by rivers or in the sea.

=== Artifact recovery and conservation ===
[[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation.&lt;ref name="denix"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Donny L. |title=Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture |url=http://www.denix.osd.mil/cr/cultural-resources-program-management/archaeology/uploads/basic-methods-of-conserving-underwater-archaeological-material-culture-report-legacy/ |year=1997 |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |location=Washington D. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oregonstate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veilleux|first1=Carol A.|title=Conservation Methods Of Underwater Artifacts|url=http://oregonstate.edu/~veilleuc/UnderwaterArch/UnderwaterArch.htm|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502121500/http://oregonstate.edu/~veilleuc/UnderwaterArch/UnderwaterArch.htm|archivedate=2 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifact either needs to be dried carefully, or the water replaced with some inert medium (as in the case of [[The Mary Rose]]). Artifacts recovered from [[sea water|salt water]], particularly [[metals]] and [[glass]] need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. [[In situ conservation (archaeology)|In-situ conservation]] of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration.

=== Interpretation and presentation of underwater archaeology ===
Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Souter, C., 2006 Cultural Tourism and Diver Education. In Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches. The Springer Series in Underwater Archaeology. Staniforth, M. &amp; Nash, M. (eds) Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One excellent example is the [[Florida Public Archaeology Network]]'s (FPAN) "Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/|website=Florida Panhandle Dive Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or [[academic journal|journal]] articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/|website=uwf.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/|archivedate=2015-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"/&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C Southerly and J Gillman-Bryan. |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

Furthermore, thanks to the adoption of modern technologies, such as Virtual and Augmented reality systems, it is now possible to develop immersive and interactive digital environments for the exploitation of the underwater archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruno, F. et al.|title=Project VISAS: Virtual and augmented exploitation of submerged archaeological sites—Overview and first results|journal=Marine Technology Society Journal|date=2016|volume=50|issue=4|page=119-129|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.50.4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Publication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ.

The specialist journals on [[maritime archaeology]], which include the long established ''[[Nautical Archaeology Society#International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', ''The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology'' (AIMA)  and the recently launched ''Journal of Maritime Archaeology'' publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology.&lt;ref name="JMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/11457|title=Journal of Maritime Archaeology|work=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals.  Some institutions also make their unpublished  reports, often called  'Grey Literature',  accessible thereby allowing access to  far more detail and a wider range of  archaeological data than is otherwise the case with  books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the  [[Western Australian Museum]].&lt;ref name="WAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/#maritime-archaeology/maritime-archaeology-publications|title=Research Areas|publisher=Western Australian Museum|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of [[Jacques Cousteau]].

The techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks,&lt;ref name="IHUA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/978-0-306-46345-7|title=International Handbook of Underwater Archaeology|work=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AU1"&gt;Archaeology Underwater, The NAS Guide to Principles and Practice; eds Martin dean, Ben Ferrari, Ian Oxley, Mark Redknap and Kit Watson. Published by Nautical Archaeology Society, Archetype Press, 1992 {{ISBN|1-873132-25-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keith Muckelroy|Muckelroy]]'s classic work on Maritime Archaeology.&lt;ref name="Muckelroy" /&gt;
