'''Acoustical oceanography''' is the use of [[underwater sound]] to study the [[sea]], its boundaries and its contents.

[[File:Fish0204 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|A 38 kHz hydroacoustic tow fin used to conduct acoustic surveys by NOAA. Alaska, Southeast.]]

==History==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

The earliest efforts at [[bathymetry]], or study of the contours of the ocean's floor, were made by the ancient Greeks in the Mediterranean. They made a [[depth sounding]] by lowering a rope with a stone tied to the end over the side of a ship, until it hit bottom. The process was very time consuming, and not always accurate.&lt;ref name="Garrison, Tom 2012. p. 79."&gt;Garrison, Tom. Essentials of Oceanography. 6th ed. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole, 2012. p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in developing echo ranging systems began in earnest following the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic]] in 1912. By sending a sound wave ahead of a ship, the theory went, a return echo bouncing off the submerged portion of an iceberg should give early warning of collisions. By directing the same type of beam downwards, the depth to the bottom of the ocean could be calculated.&lt;ref name="Garrison, Tom 2012. p. 79."/&gt;

The first practical deep-ocean echo sounder was invented by Harvey C. Hayes, a U.S. Navy physicist. For the first time, it was possible to create a quasi-continuous profile of the ocean floor along the course of a ship. The first such profile was made by Hayes on board the U.S.S. Stewart, a Navy destroyer that sailed from Newport to Gibraltar between June 22 and 29, 1922. During that week, 900 deep-ocean soundings were made.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzig, Robert. Mapping the Deep: The Extraordinary Story of Ocean Science. New York: Norton 2000. p. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a refined echo sounder, the [[German survey ship Meteor]] made several passes across the South Atlantic from the equator to Antarctica between 1925 and 1927, taking soundings every 5 to 20 miles. Their work created the first detailed map of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It showed that the Ridge was a rugged mountain range, and not the smooth plateau that some scientists had envisioned. Since that time, both naval and research vessels have operated echo sounders almost continuously while at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Robert. Introduction to Physical Oceanography, University Press of Florida, 2009 p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Important contributions to acoustical oceanography have been made by:

* [[Walter Munk]]
* [[Herman Medwin]]
* [[John L Spiesberger]]
* [[C C Leroy]]
* [[David E. Weston]]
* [[D. Van Holliday]]
* [[Charles Greenlaw]]

==Equipment used==
The earliest and most widespread use of sound and [[sonar]] technology to study the properties of the sea is the use of an [[rainbow echo sounder]] to measure water depth. Sounders were the devices used that mapped the many miles of the Santa Barbara Harbor ocean floor until 1993.

[[Fathometers]] measure the depth of the waters. It works by electronically sending sounds from ships, therefore also receiving the sound waves that bounces back from the bottom of the ocean. A paper chart moves through the fathometer and is calibrated to record the depth.

As technology advances, the development of high resolution sonars in the second half of the 20th century made it possible to not just detect underwater objects but to classify them and even image them. [[Electronic sensors]] are now attached to ROVs since nowadays, ships or robot submarines have Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). There are cameras attached to these devices giving out accurate images. The oceanographers are able to get a clear and precise quality of pictures. The 'pictures' can also be sent from sonars by having sound reflected off ocean surroundings. Oftentimes sound waves reflect off animals, giving information which can be documented into deeper animal behaviour studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/oceanography|title=Oceanography|work=Scholastic Teachers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinebio.net/marinescience/01intro/tomeas.htm|title=Tools of the Oceanographer|work=marinebio.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noc.ac.uk/science-technology/life-oceans/technology-used|title=Technology used|work=noc.ac.uk|access-date=2015-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121073238/http://noc.ac.uk/science-technology/life-oceans/technology-used|archive-date=2015-01-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcide Charles Victor Marie Dessalines d'Orbigny''' (6 September 1802 – 30 June 1857) was a French [[Natural history|naturalist]] who made major contributions in many areas, including [[zoology]] (including [[malacology]]), [[palaeontology]], [[geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]].

D'Orbigny was born in [[Couëron]] ([[Loire-Atlantique]]), the son of a ship's physician and amateur naturalist. The family moved to [[La Rochelle]] in 1820, where his interest in natural history was developed while studying the marine fauna and especially the microscopic creatures that he named "[[foraminifera]]ns".

In Paris he became a disciple of the geologist [[Louis Cordier|Pierre Louis Antoine Cordier]] (1777–1861) and [[Georges Cuvier]]. All his life, he would follow the theory of Cuvier and stay opposed to [[Lamarckism]].

==South American era==
D'Orbigny travelled on a mission for the Paris Museum, in South America between 1826 and 1833. He visited Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia and returned to France with an enormous collection of more than 10,000 natural history specimens. He described part of his findings in ''La Relation du Voyage dans l'Amérique Méridionale pendant les annés 1826 à 1833'' (Paris, 1824–47, in 90 [[fascicle (book)|fascicles]]). The other specimens were described by zoologists at the museum.

His contemporary, [[Charles Darwin]], arrived in South America in 1832, and on hearing that he had been preceded, grumbled that D'Orbigny had probably collected "the cream of all the good things".&lt;ref name="letter: 192"&gt;{{cite web | title= letter: 192, Darwin, C. R. to Henslow, J. S. [26 Oct–] 24 Nov 1832 | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-192#back-mark-192.f3 | accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin later called D'Orbigny's Voyage a "most important work".&lt;ref name="letter: 391"&gt;{{cite web | title= letter: 391, Darwin, C. R. to Jenyns, Leonard, 3 Dec [1837]  | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-391 | accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to correspond, with D'Orbigny describing some of Darwin's specimens.

He was awarded the [[Grande Médaille d'Or des Explorations|Gold Medal]] of the [[Société de Géographie]] of Paris in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socgeo.org/grande-medaille-dor-des-explorations-et-voyages-de-decouverte/ |title=GRANDE MÉDAILLE D'OR DES EXPLORATIONS ET VOYAGES DE DÉCOUVERTE (in French) |publisher=Société de géographie |accessdate=1 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206004240/http://www.socgeo.org/grande-medaille-dor-des-explorations-et-voyages-de-decouverte/ |archivedate=6 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The South American Paleocene [[Pantodonta|pantodont]] ''[[Alcidedorbignya]]'' was named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==1840 and later==
[[Image:Orbigny2.jpg|thumb|On the shore of Rio Magdalen. Image from ''Voyages pittoresque dans les deux Amériques'']]

In 1840, d'Orbigny started the methodical description of French [[fossil]]s and published ''La Paléontologie Française'' (8 vols). In 1849 he published a closely related ''Prodrome de Paléontologie Stratigraphique'', intended as a "Preface to Stratigraphic Palaeontology", in which he described almost 18,000 species, and with biostratigraphical comparisons erected [[Stage (stratigraphy)|geological stage]]s, the definitions of which rest on their stratotypes.

In 1853 he became professor of palaeontology at the Paris [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], publishing his ''Cours élémentaire'' that related [[paleontology]] to [[zoology]], as a science independent of the uses made of it in [[stratigraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conception et suites de la ''Paléontologie française'' d'Alcide d'Orbigny", ''Comptes Rendus Paleologiques'' '''1'''.7 (December 2002) pp 599–613.&lt;/ref&gt; The chair of paleontology was created especially in his honor. The d'Orbigny collection is housed in the ''Salle d'Orbigny'' and is often visited by experts.&lt;ref&gt;Agnès Lauriat-Rag, "La collection d'Invertébrés fossiles d'Alcide d'Orbigny et la salle d'Orbigny", ''Comptes Rendus Paleologiques'' '''1'''.7 (December 2002) pp 615–627.&lt;/ref&gt;

He described the geological timescales and defined numerous geological strata, still used today as [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] reference such as Toarcian, Callovian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, [[Aptian]], [[Albian]] and [[Cenomanian]]. He died in the small town of [[Pierrefitte-sur-Seine]], near Paris.

==Catastrophism==

D'Orbigny a disciple of Georges Cuvier was a notable advocate of [[catastrophism]].&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Richard J. (1998). ''Catastrophism: Asteroids, Comets and Other Dynamic Events in Earth History''. Verso. p. 95. {{ISBN|1-85984-129-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He recognized twenty-seven catastrophes in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;[[Charles Singer|Singer, Charles Joseph]]. (1931). ''The Story of Living Things: A Short Account of the Evolution of the Biological Sciences''. Harper &amp; Bros. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the "doctrine of successive creations".&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prothero"&gt;[[Donald R. Prothero|Prothero, Donald R]]. (2013). ''Bringing Fossils to Life: An Introduction to Paleobiology''. Columbia University Press. p. 223. {{ISBN|978-0-231-15893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to reconcile the fossil record with the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. Both [[Uniformitarianism|uniformitarian]] geologists and theologians rejected his idea of successive creations.&lt;ref name="Prothero"/&gt; 

Palaeontologist [[Carroll Lane Fenton]] has noted that his idea of twenty-seven world-wide creations was "absurd", even for creationists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carroll Lane Fenton|Fenton, Carroll Lane]]. (1933). [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.534241/2015.534241.The-World#page/n177/mode/2up ''The World Of Fossils'']. D. Appleton-Century Company. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Sprague de Camp]] has written that "Alcide d'Orbigny, carried the idea to absurdity. Dragging in the supernatural, d'Orbigny argued that, on twenty-seven separate occasions, God had wiped out all life on earth and started over with a whole new creation."&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp|De Camp, Lyon Sprague]]. (1968). ''[[The Great Monkey Trial]]''. Doubleday p. 184. {{ISBN|0-385-04625-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]

'''Andreev reflection''' ('''AR'''), named after the Russian physicist [[Alexander F. Andreev]], is a type of particle [[scattering]] which
occurs at interfaces between a [[superconductor]] (S) and a normal state material (N).  It is a charge-transfer process by which normal current in N is converted to [[supercurrent]] in S. Each Andreev reflection transfers a charge ''2e'' across the interface, avoiding the forbidden single-particle transmission within the superconducting [[energy gap]].

== Overview ==
The process involves an electron (hole) incident on the interface from the normal state material at energies less than the superconducting [[energy gap]]. The incident electron (hole) forms a [[Cooper pair]] in the superconductor with the retroreflection of a hole (electron) of opposite spin and velocity but equal momentum to the incident electron (hole), as seen in the figure. The barrier transparency is assumed to be high, with no oxide or tunnel layer which reduces instances of normal electron-electron or hole-hole scattering at the interface. Since the pair consists of an up and down [[spin (physics)|spin]] electron, a second electron (hole) of opposite spin to the incident electron (hole) from the normal state forms the pair in the superconductor, and hence the retroreflected hole (electron). Through time-reversal symmetry, the process with an incident electron will also work with an incident hole (and retroreflected electron).

The process is highly spin-dependent – if only one spin band is occupied by the conduction electrons in the normal-state material (''i.e.'' it is fully spin-polarized), Andreev reflection will be inhibited due to inability to form a pair in the superconductor and impossibility of single-particle transmission. In a [[ferromagnet]] or material where spin-polarization exists or may be induced by a magnetic field, the strength of the Andreev reflection (and hence conductance of the junction) is a function of the spin-polarization in the normal state.

The spin-dependence of AR gives rise to the [[Point Contact Andreev Reflection]] (or PCAR) technique, whereby a narrow superconducting tip (often [[niobium]], [[antimony]] or [[lead]]) is placed into contact with a normal material at temperatures below the [[critical temperature]] of the tip. By applying a voltage to the tip, and measuring differential conductance between it and the sample, the spin polarization of the normal metal at that point (and magnetic field) may be determined. This is of use in such tasks as measurement of spin-polarized currents or characterizing spin polarization of material layers or bulk samples, and the effects of magnetic fields on such properties.

In an AR process, the phase difference between the electron and hole is &amp;minus;π/2 plus the phase of the superconducting [[order parameter]].

==Crossed Andreev reflection==

Crossed Andreev reflection, or CAR, also known as non-local Andreev reflection occurs when two spatially separated normal state material electrodes form two separate junctions with a superconductor, with the junction separation of the order of the BCS superconducting coherence length of the material in question. In such a device, retroreflection of the hole from an Andreev reflection process, resulting from an incident electron at energies less than the superconducting gap at one lead, occurs in the second spatially separated normal lead with the same charge transfer as in a normal AR process to a Cooper pair in the superconductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[Guiseppe Falci]]|author2=[[Denis Feinberg]]|author3=[[Frank Hekking]]|date=April 2001|title=Correlated tunneling into a superconductor in a multiprobe hybrid structure|journal=[[Europhysics Letters]]|volume=54|issue=2|pages=255–261|doi=10.1209/epl/i2001-00303-0|arxiv=cond-mat/0011339|bibcode=2001EL.....54..255F}}&lt;/ref&gt; For CAR to occur, electrons of opposite spin must exist at each normal electrode (so as to form the pair in the superconductor). If the normal material is a ferromagnet this may be guaranteed by creating opposite spin polarization via the application of a magnetic field to normal electrodes of differing [[coercivity]].

CAR occurs in competition with elastic cotunelling or EC, the quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons between the normal leads via an intermediate state in the superconductor. This process conserves electron spin. As such, a detectable CAR potential at one electrode on the application of current to the other may be masked by the competing EC process, making clear detection difficult. In addition, normal Andreev reflection may occur at either interface, in conjunction with other normal electron scattering processes from the normal/superconductor interface.

The process is of interest in the formation of solid-state [[quantum entanglement]], via the formation of a spatially separated entangled electron-hole (Andreev) pair, with applications in [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computing]].

'''Anomalous diffraction theory''' (also '''van de Hulst approximation''', eikonal approximation, high energy approximation, soft particle approximation) is an approximation developed by Dutch astronomer [[Hendrik C. van de Hulst|van de Hulst]] describing light scattering for optically soft spheres.

The anomalous diffraction approximation for [[extinction efficiency]] is valid for optically soft particles and large [[size parameter]], x = 2π''a''/λ:
:&lt;math&gt; Q_{ext} = 2 - \frac{4}{p} \sin{p} + \frac{4}{p^2} (1-\cos{p})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;Q_{ext}=Q_{abs}+Q_{sca}=Q_{sca}&lt;/math&gt; in this derivation since the refractive index is assumed to be real, and thus there is no absorption (&lt;math&gt;Q_{abs}=0&lt;/math&gt;). &lt;math&gt;Q_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency factor of extinction, which is defined as the ratio of the [[extinction cross section]] and geometrical cross section π''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;br/&gt; ''p'' = 4π''a''(''n'' – 1)/λ has a physical meaning of the phase delay of the wave passing through the center of the sphere;&lt;br/&gt; a is the sphere radius, ''n'' is the ratio of refractive indices inside and outside of the sphere, and λ the wavelength of the light.

This set of equations was first described by van de Hulst.&lt;ref&gt;van de Hulst H., ''Light scattering by small particles'', 1957, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY.&lt;/ref&gt; There are extensions to more complicated geometries of scattering targets.

The anomalous diffraction approximation offers a very approximate but computationally fast technique to calculate [[light scattering by particles]]. The absolute value of the refractive index has to be close to 1, and the size parameter should be large. However, semi-empirical extensions to small size parameters and larger refractive indices are possible. The main advantage of the ADT is that one can (a) calculate, in closed form, extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies for many typical size distributions; (b) find solution to the inverse problem of predicting size distribution from light scattering experiments (several wavelengths); (c) for parameterization purposes of single scattering (inherent) optical properties in radiative transfer codes.

Another limiting approximation for optically soft particles is [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is valid for small size parameters.

[[Image:Schistes bleus.jpg|thumb|right|Blueschist, Ile de Groix, France.]] 
[[Image:Sivrihisar blueschist2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Photomicrograph]] of a [[thin section]] of blueschist facies metamorphosed [[basalt]], from Sivrihisar, Turkey]]
'''Blueschist''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|b|l|uː|ʃ|ɪ|s|t}}), also called [[glaucophane]] [[schist]], is a [[metavolcanic rock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blueschist|url = http://geology.about.com/od/rocks/ig/metrockindex/rocpicblueschist.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that forms by the [[metamorphism]] of [[basalt]] and rocks with similar composition at high [[pressure]]s and low [[temperature]]s (200 to ~500 degrees Celsius), approximately corresponding to a depth of 15 to 30 kilometers. 
The blue color of the rock comes from the presence of the predominant minerals [[glaucophane]] and [[lawsonite]].

Blueschists are typically found within [[orogeny|orogenic belts]] as [[terrane]]s of lithology in faulted contact with [[greenschist]] or rarely [[eclogite]] facies rocks.

==Petrology==
'''Blueschist''', as a rock type, is defined by the presence of the minerals [[glaucophane]] + ( [[lawsonite]] or [[epidote]] ) +/- [[jadeite]] +/- [[albite]] or [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] +/- [[garnet]] +/- [[white mica|muscovite]] in a rock of roughly basaltic composition.&lt;br&gt;
Blueschist often has a [[lepidoblastic]], [[nematoblastic]] or [[schist]]ose [[Texture (crystalline)|rock microstructure]] defined primarily by chlorite, phengitic white [[mica]], glaucophane, and other minerals with an elongate or platy shape. 

Grain size is rarely coarse, as mineral growth is retarded by the swiftness of the rock's metamorphic trajectory and perhaps more importantly, the low temperatures of metamorphism and in many cases the anhydrous state of the basalts. However, porphyritic varieties do occur. Blueschists may appear blue, black, gray, or blue-green in outcrop.

==Blueschist facies==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Talc]] --&gt;

[[Image:Sivrihisar blueschist1.jpg|thumb|right|Photomicrograph of garnet-lawsonite-glaucophane blueschist from Sivrihisar, Turkey. Field of view = 3 mm.]]
Blueschist facies is determined by the particular temperature and pressure conditions required to metamorphose basalt to form blueschist. [[Felsic]] rocks and [[Pelite|pelitic]] sediments which are subjected to blueschist facies conditions will form different mineral assemblages than metamorphosed basalt. Thereby, these rocks do not appear blue overall in color.

Blueschist mineralogy varies by rock composition, but the classic equilibrium assemblages of blueschist facies are:

* Basalts: ''glaucophane + lawsonite and/or epidote + albite + [[titanite]] +/- garnet +/- quartz'' ''jadeite + quartz'' - diagnostic of pressures ~&gt; 10 kbar
* [[Ultramafic]] rocks: ''[[serpentinite]]/[[lizardite]] +/- [[talc]] +/- [[zoisite]]''
* [[Pelite]]s:  ''Fe-Mg-carpholite +/- [[chloritoid]] +/- [[kyanite]] + zoisite +/- [[pargasite]] or [[phengite]] +/- albite +/- quartz +/- talc +/- garnet''
* [[Granite]]s: ''[[kyanite]] +/- [[paragonite]] +/- chlorite +/- albite +/- quartz +/- pargasite or phengite''
* [[Calc-silicate]]s: Various
* [[Limestone]]s and [[marble]]: [[calcite]] transforms to [[aragonite]] at high pressure, but typically reverts to calcite when exhumed

Blueschist facies generally is considered to form under pressures of &gt;0.6 [[gigapascal|GPa]], equivalent to depth of burial in excess of 15–18&amp;nbsp;km, and at temperatures of between 200 and 500 °C. This is a 'low temperature, high pressure' prograde metamorphic path and is also known as the ''Franciscan facies series'', after the west coast of the United States where these rocks are exposed. Well-exposed blueschists also occur in Greece, Turkey, Japan, New Zealand and New Caledonia.
[[Image:Sivrihisar blueschist3.jpg|thumb|right|Photomicrograph of blueschist facies quartz sediment, Sivrihisar, Turkey]]
Continued [[subduction]] of blueschist facies [[oceanic crust]] will produce [[eclogite]] facies assemblages in metamorphosed basalt (garnet + omphacitic clinopyroxene). Rocks which have been subjected to blueschist conditions during a prograde trajectory will gain heat by conduction with hotter lower crustal rocks if they remain at the 15–18&amp;nbsp;km depth. Blueschist which heats up to greater than 500 °C via this fashion will enter [[greenschist]] or [[eclogite]] facies temperature-pressure conditions, and the mineral assemblages will metamorphose to reflect the new facies conditions. 

Thus in order for blueschist facies assemblages to be seen at the Earth's surface, the rock must be exhumed swiftly enough to prevent total thermal equilibration of the rocks which are under blueschist facies conditions with the typical [[geothermal gradient]]. 

Blueschists and other high-pressure subduction zone rocks are thought to be exhumed rapidly by flow and/or faulting in [[accretionary wedge]]s or the upper parts of subducted crust, or may return to the Earth's surface in part owing to buoyancy if the metabasaltic rocks are associated with low-density continental crust (marble, metapelite, and other rocks of continental margins).

It has been held that the absence of blueschist dating to before the [[Neoproterozoic|Neoproterozoic Era]] indicates that currently [[exhumation (geology)|exhumed]] rocks never reached blueschist facies at [[subduction]] zones before 1,000 million years ago. This assertion is arguably wrong because the earliest [[oceanic crust]] would have contained more [[magnesium]] than today's crust and, therefore, would have formed greenschist-like rocks at blueschist facies.&lt;ref name=PaWh2016&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palin |first1=Richard M. |last2=White |first2=Richard W.|date=2016 |title=Emergence of blueschists on Earth linked to secular changes in oceanic crust composition |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2605 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=60–64 |doi=10.1038/ngeo2605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==

In 1962, [[Edgar Bailey]] of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] introduced the concept of "blueschist" into the subject of metamorphic [[geology]]. His carefully constructed definition established the pressure and temperature conditions which produce this type of metamorphism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">The '''Crimean Submediterranean forest complex''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate mixed forest]] [[biome]] of [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]].

==Distribution==
The ecoregion consists of two  coastal enclaves on northern coast of the [[Black Sea]]; one occupies the central coast of [[Crimea]], extending into the [[Crimean Mountains]], the other occupies the Black Sea coast of [[Krasnodar Kray]], extending eastward along the northwest flank of the [[Caucasus]].

==Description==
The ecoregion's climate and vegetation resemble that of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], with a hot dry summer and a mild, rainy winter. 

At elevations below 400 meters, woodlands and [[maquis shrublands]] predominate with: 
*oak,
*[[Christ's Thorn]] ''(Paliurus spina-christi)'',
*[[Mastic tree]] ''(Pistacia lenticulus)'',
*''[[Pyracantha]]'',
*[[sclerophyll]] shrubs

Between 400 and 800 meters are forests predominate with:
*[[Pitsundian Pine]] ''(Pinus brutia)'',
*[[Downy Oak]] ''(Quercus pubescens)'',
*[[Hornbeam|Oriental Hornbeam]] ''(Carpinus orientalis)'',
*[[European Ash]] ''(Fraxinus excelsior)''.

From 800 to 1300 meters elevation forests predominate with: 
*[[Scots Pine]] ''(Pinus sylvestris)''
*[[Oriental Beech]] ''(Fagus orientalis)'',
*[[juniper]] woodlands

==Culture==
The warm summers and mild winters of the region make it a popular resort destination. Cities and towns in the ecoregion include [[Yalta]], [[Alupka]], [[Alushta]], [[Sevastopol]], and [[Novorossiysk]].

'''''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure''''' (''On the [[Magnet]] and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth'') is a scientific work published in 1600 by the English physician and scientist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] and his partner [[Aaron Dowling]]. A highly influential and successful book, it exerted an immediate influence on many contemporary writers, including [[Francis Godwin]] and [[Mark Ridley (physician)|Mark Ridley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Poole |first=William |contribution=Introduction |title=The Man in the Moone |year=2009 |editor-last=Poole |editor-first=William |pages=13–62 |publisher=Broadview |isbn=978-1-55111-896-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
In his work, Gilbert described many of his experiments with his model Earth called the ''[[terrella]]''. (Previously, it was thought that [[Polaris]] or a large magnetic island at the [[North Pole]] attracted the compass). Gilbert also made the claim that gravity was due to the same force and he believed that this held the Moon in orbit around the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;James Burke Connections episode 2&lt;/ref&gt; While incorrect by modern standards, this claim was still far closer to the truth than the ancient [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] theory, which held that the heavenly bodies consist of a special fifth element which naturally moves in circles, while the earthly elements naturally move downward. [[Johannes Kepler]] accepted Gilbert's theory and used it as a working basis for his famous [[laws of planetary motion]].

In ''De Magnete'', Gilbert also studied [[static electricity]] produced by [[amber]]. Amber is called ''elektron'' in Greek, and ''electrum'' in Latin, so Gilbert decided to refer to the phenomenon by the adjective ''electricus'', giving rise to the modern terms "electric" and "[[electricity]]".

''De Magnete'' was influential because of the inherent interest of its subject matter, but also for the rigorous way in which Gilbert described his experiments and his rejection of ancient theories of magnetism.  Gilbert nevertheless acknowledged his debt to [[Peter of Maricourt]] and incorporated this 13th-century scientist's experiments on magnetism into his own treatise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Gimpel |title=The medieval machine : the industrial revolution of the Middle Ages |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1976 |isbn=978-0140045147|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Gilbert's thinking was influenced by the [[mysticism]] of his time he is regarded as a pioneer of experimental science.

==Summary==

''De Magnete'' consists of six books.

===Book 1===
Historical survey of magnetism and theory of Earth's magnetism. The [[loadstone]] in antiquity from Plato onwards and the gradual identification of iron ores. The south pole of a loadstone points to the north pole of the earth and vice versa as the terrestrial globe is magnetic.

===Book 2===
[[File:Gilbert De Magnete Illo032.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Versorium]]  Distinction between electricity and magnetism. An amber stick when rubbed affects a rotating needle made of any type of metal (a [[versorium]]) and attracts paper, leaves and even water. But electricity is different from heat and to magnetism which only attracts iron-bearing materials (he calls it coition). He shows the effects of cutting a spherical loadstone (which he calls a ''[[terrella]]'') through the poles and equator and the direction of attraction at different points. Magnets act at a distance but the force has no permanent presence and is not hindered like light. Materials including gold, silver and diamonds are not affected by magnets, nor can one produce [[perpetual motion]].

===Book 3===
[[File:Gilbert De Magnete Illo040.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cutting a terrella]] The earth's normal magnetism. He proposes (incorrectly) that the angle of the [[ecliptic]] and [[precession of the equinoxes]] are caused by magnetism. A loadstone cut out of rock and floated in water returns to the same direction. Iron heated to white heat and cooled lying along a meridian also acquires magnetism. But stroking with other materials fails—he proved this with an experiment with 75 diamonds in front of witnesses. The best way to magnetize a compass (magnetized versorium).

===Book 4 === 
[[Magnetic declination|Declination]]. The compass does not always point to true north. There is considerable variation. Using the terella he shows that variations in the height of the surface can lead to differences but insists that variation is a global issue. In the midst of the ocean or continent there is no variation. He shows how to measure variation and the sources of common errors.

===Book 5=== 
[[File:Gilbert De Magnete Illo044.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Angles of force on the terrella]] [[Magnetic dip]]. The angle of inclination (dip) of a compass to the horizon differs according to [[latitude]]. He shows how to construct a [[Dip circle|dip instrument]]. At the equator it is level and increases towards the poles as he has shown earlier with his terrella.

===Book 6=== 
[[Earth's rotation|Terrestrial rotation]]. [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] and others held that the earth rotates from west to east and this is supported by Copernicus (the "restorer of astronomy"), but Aristotle said otherwise. "If the rotations of the earth seems headlong and not to be permitted by nature because of its rapidity, then worse than insane, both as regards itself and the whole universe is the motion of the [[primum mobile]]." He rejects the idea of a sphere of the fixed stars for which no proof has been offered and leaves aside the question of other movements of the earth but "infers not with mere probability, but with certainty the diurnal revolution of the earth." He states that "the cause of the diurnal motion are to be found in the magnetic energy and the alliance of bodies" but offers no further guidance. The inclination of the earth's pole to the ecliptic produces the seasons. He explains the [[Precession of the equinoxes]] as the movement of the earth's axis.

In Chapter III, Gilbert argues in favor of the Copernican System. He posits that due to the inordinate distance of the celestial spheres, if in fact the spheres exist at all, it is an absurd idea that they would rotate every 24 hours, as opposed to the rotation of the relatively tiny sphere of the Earth. He states, "How far away from the earth are those remotest of stars: they are beyond the reach of eye, or man's devices, or man's thought. What an absurdity is this motion (of spheres)". He also argues for the extreme variability of the distance to the various heavenly bodies and states that situated "in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity&amp;nbsp;– how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|1893|pp=319–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dzungaria''' ({{IPAc-en|(|d|)|z|ʊ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|ɛər|i|ə}}; also spelled '''Zungaria''', '''Dzungharia''' or '''Zungharia''', '''Dzhungaria''' or '''Zhungaria''', or '''Djungaria''' or '''Jungaria''') is a [[geographical region]] in [[northwest China]] corresponding to the northern half of [[Xinjiang]], also known as '''Beijiang''' ({{zh |c = 北疆 |p = Běijiāng |l = Northern Xinjiang}}).&lt;ref name="Starr2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3192-3|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bounded by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range to the south and the [[Altai Mountains]] to the north, it covers approximately {{convert|777000|km2|abbr=on}}, extending into western [[Mongolia]] and eastern [[Kazakhstan]].  Formerly the term could cover a wider area, conterminous with the [[Dzungar Khanate]], a state led by the [[Oirats]] in the 18th century which was based in the area.

Although geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Tarim Basin]] area, the [[Qing dynasty]] and subsequent Chinese governments integrated both areas into one province, Xinjiang. As the center of Xinjiang's heavy industry, generator of most of Xinjiang's GDP, as well as containing its political capital [[Ürümqi]] ("beautiful pasture" in [[Oirat language|Oirat]]), northern Xinjiang continues to attract intraprovincial and interprovincial migration to its cities. In comparison to southern Xinjiang (''Nanjiang'', or the Tarim Basin), Dzungaria is relatively well integrated with the rest of China by rail and trade links.&lt;ref name="Stahle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/item/etd-Stahle-2942.pdf|title=Ethnic Resistance and State Environmental Policy: Uyghurs and Mongols|first=Laura N|last=Stahle|date=August 2009|publisher=University of southern California}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Dzungaria or Zungharia is a corruption of the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] term "Zűn Gar" or "Jüün Gar" depending on the dialect of Mongolian used. "Zűn"/"Jüün" means "left" and "Gar" means "hand". The name originates from the notion that the Western Mongols are on the left-hand side when the Mongol Empire began its division into East and West Mongols. After this fragmentation, the western Mongolian nation was called "Zuun Gar".

[[Xinjiang]] consists of two main geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct regions, Dzungaria north of the Tianshan Mountains and the [[Tarim Basin]] south of the Tianshan Mountains, before [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] unified them into one political entity called [[Xinjiang]] province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Dzungar people]], while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, [[Turkic languages|Turkic speaking]] [[Muslim]] farmers, now known as the [[Uyghur people]].

The Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tianshan and Turkic Muslim south of the Tianshan, and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing and it was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way, but rather it was the Chinese who held that point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing rule, no sense of "regional identity" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui, and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate parts be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dzungarian Basin==
[[File:Altai, Tienschan-Orte.png|thumb|250px|Right|Physical map showing the separation of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Taklamakan) by the Tien Shan Mountains]]

The core of Dzungaria is the triangular Dzungarian Basin, also known as '''Jungar Basin''', or in Chinese as {{zh
|s=准噶尔盆地
|t=準噶爾盆地
|p=Zhǔngá'ěr Péndì}}, with its central [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]].
It is bounded by the [[Tian Shan]] to the south, the [[Altai Mountains]] to the northeast and the [[Tarbagatai Mountains]] to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The three corners are relatively open. The northern corner is the valley of the upper [[Irtysh River]]. The western corner is the [[Dzungarian Gate]], a historically important gateway between Dzungaria and the Kazakh Steppe; presently, a highway and a [[Lanxin Railway|railway]] (opened in 1990) run through it, connecting China with Kazakhstan. The eastern corner of the basin leads to [[Gansu]] and the rest of China. In the south, an easy pass leads from [[Ürümqi]] to the [[Turfan Depression]]. In the southwest, the tall [[Borohoro Mountains]] branch of the [[Tian Shan]] separates the basin from the upper [[Ili River]].

The basin is similar to the larger [[Tarim Basin]] on the southern side of the Tian Shan Range. Only a gap in the mountains to the north allows moist air masses to provide the basin lands with enough moisture to remain semi-desert rather than becoming a true desert like most of the Tarim Basin and allows a thin layer of vegetation to grow. This is enough to sustain populations of wild [[Bactrian camel|camel]]s, [[jerboa]]s, and other wild species.&lt;ref name=nationalgeo&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion

The Dzungarian Basin is a structural basin with thick sequences of Paleozoic-Pleistocene rocks with large estimated oil reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dzungarian basin does not have a single [[drainage basin|catchment]] center. The northernmost section of Dzungaria is part of the basin of the [[Irtysh River]], which ultimately drains into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The rest of the region is split into a number of [[endorheic basins]]. In particular, south of the Irtysh, the [[Ulungur River]] ends up in the (presently) [[endorheic]] [[Lake Ulungur]]. The Southwestern part of the Dzungarian basin drains into the 
[[Aibi Lake]]. In the west-central part of the region, streams flow into (or toward) a group of endorheic lakes that include [[Lake Manas]] and [[Lake Ailik]]. During the region's geological past, a much larger lake (the "Old Manas Lake") was located in the area of today's Manas Lake; it was fed not only by the streams that presently flow toward it but also by the Irtysh and Ulungur, which too were flowing toward the Old Manas Lake at the time.&lt;ref name=arid&gt;{{citation|journal=Journal of Arid Land|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=167–173|title=Tectonic geomorphological characteristics for evolution of the Manas Lake

The cold climate of nearby Siberia influences the climate of the Dzungarian Basin, making the temperature colder—as low as {{convert|-4|°F}}—and providing more precipitation, ranging from {{convert|3|to|10|in}}, compared to the warmer, drier basins to the south. Runoff from the surrounding mountains into the basin supplies several lakes. The ecologically rich habitats traditionally included meadows, marshlands, and rivers. However, most of the land is now used for agriculture.&lt;ref name=nationalgeo/&gt;

It is a largely [[steppe]] and semi-desert basin surrounded by high mountains: the [[Tian Shan]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]) in the south and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] in the north. Geologically it is an extension of the Paleozoic [[Kazakhstan Block]] and was once part of an independent continent before the Altai mountains formed in the late Paleozoic. It does not contain the abundant minerals of Kazakhstan and may have been a pre-existing continental block before the Kazakhstan Block was formed.

[[Ürümqi]], [[Yining (city)|Yining]] and [[Karamai]] are the main cities; other smaller [[oasis]] towns dot the piedmont areas.

===Paleontology===
Dzungaria and its derivatives are used to name a number of pre-historic animals&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group, Norman Lockyer, 1869&lt;/ref&gt; hailing from the rocky outcrops located in the Dzungar Basin:
*''[[Dsungaripterus]] weii'' ([[pterosaur]])
*''[[Junggarsuchus]] sloani'' ([[crocodylomorph]])

A recent notable find, in February 2006, is the oldest [[tyrannosaur]] fossil unearthed by a team of scientists from [[George Washington University]] who were conducting a study in the Dzungarian Basin. The species, named ''[[Guanlong]]'', lived 160 million years ago, more than 90 million years before the famed ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Ecology==
Dzungaria is home to a semi-desert [[steppe]] [[ecoregion]] known as the '''Dzungarian Basin semi-desert'''. The vegetation consists mostly of low scrub of ''[[Anabasis brevifolia]]''. Taller shrublands of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] bush ''(Haloxylon ammodendron)'' and ''[[Ephedra przewalskii]]'' can be found near the margins of the basin. Streams descending from the Tian Shan and Altai ranges support stands of [[Populus|poplar]] ''(Populus diversifolia)'' together with ''Nitraria roborovsky, N. sibirica, [[Achnatherum splendens]],'' [[tamarisk]] ''(Tamarix sibirimosissima)'', and [[willow]] ''([[Salix ledebouriana]])''.

The northeastern portion of the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert lies within [[Great Gobi National Park]], and is home to herds of [[Onager]]s ''(Equus hemionus)'', [[goitered gazelle]]s ''(Gazella subgutturosa)'' and [[Wild Bactrian camel]]s ''(Camelus ferus)''.

The basin was one of the last [[habitat]]s of [[Przewalski's horse]] ''(Equus przewalskii)'', also known as Dzungarian horse, which was once [[extinct]] in the wild, though it has since been reintroduced in areas of Mongolia and China.

==History==
{{Main|History of Xinjiang}}
[[File:Renat map.jpg|thumb|A map of the Dzungar Khanate, by a [[Johan Gustaf Renat|Swedish officer]] in captivity there in 1716-1733, which include the region known today as [[Zhetysu]]]]
The first people to inhabit the region were [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] peoples such as the [[Tocharians]] in prehistory and the [[Jushi Kingdom]] in the first millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=35, 37, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the 21st century, all or part of the region has been ruled or controlled by the [[Xiongnu Empire]], [[Han dynasty]], [[Xianbei state]], [[Rouran Khaganate]], [[Turkic Khaganate]], [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]], [[Mongol Empire]], [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Chagatai Khanate]], [[Moghulistan]], [[Qara Del]], [[Northern Yuan Dynasty|Northern Yuan]], [[Four Oirat]], [[Dzungar Khanate]], [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] and, since 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]].

One of the earliest mentions of the Dzungaria region occurs when the [[Han dynasty]] dispatched an explorer to investigate lands to the west, using the northernmost [[Silk Road]] trackway of about {{convert|2600|km}} in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of [[Xi'an]] to the west over the [[Wushao Ling Pass]] to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]] and emerged in [[Kashgar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China'', C.Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Istämi]] of the [[Göktürks]] received the lands of Dzungaria as an inheritance after the death of his father in the latter half of the sixth century [[AD]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia'', By René Grousset&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzungaria is named after a [[Mongols|Mongolian]] kingdom which existed in [[Central Asia]] during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It derived its name from the [[Dzungars]], who were so called because they formed the left wing (''züün'', left; ''gar'', hand) of the Mongolian army, self-named [[Oirats]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dzungaria|volume=8|page=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dzungar power reached its height in the second half of the 17th century, when [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan]] repeatedly intervened in the affairs of the [[Kazakhs]] to the west, but it was completely destroyed by the [[Kazakhs]] about 1757–1759. It has played an important part in the history of [[Mongolia]] and the great migrations of Mongolian stems westward. Its widest limit included [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], [[Khotan]], the whole region of the [[Tian Shan]], and the greater proportion of that part of Central Asia which extends from 35° to 50° N and from 72° to 97° E.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

After 1761, its territory fell mostly to the [[Qing dynasty]] during [[Ten Great Campaigns|the campaign against the Dzungars]] ([[Xinjiang]] and north-western Mongolia) and partly to [[Russian Turkestan]] (the earlier Kazakh state provinces of [[Zhetysu]] and Irtysh river).

After the [[Dzungar genocide]], the Qing subsequently began to repopulate the area with Han and Hui people from China Proper.

The population in the 21st century consists of [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongols]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] and [[Han Chinese]]. Since 1953, northern Xinjiang has attracted skilled workers from all over China—who have mostly been [[Han Chinese]]—to work on water conservation and industrial projects, especially the [[Karamay]] oil fields. Intraprovincial migration has mostly been directed towards Dzungaria also, with immigrants from the poor Uyghur areas of southern Xinjiang flooding to the provincial capital of [[Ürümqi]] to find work.

As a political or geographical term ''Dzungaria'' has practically disappeared from the map; but the range of mountains stretching north-east along the southern frontier of the Zhetysu, as the district to the southeast of [[Lake Balkhash]] preserves the name of [[Dzungarian Alatau]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It also gave name to [[Djungarian hamster]]s.

===Dzungaria and the Silk Road===
A traveller going west from China must go either north of the Tian Shan mountains through Dzungaria or south of the mountains through the Tarim Basin. Trade usually took the south side and migrations the north. This is most likely because the Tarim leads to the Ferghana Valley and Iran, while Dzungaria leads only to the open steppe. The difficulty with south side was the high mountains between the Tarim and Ferghana. There is also another reason. The Taklamakan is too dry to support much grass, and therefore nomads when they are not robbing caravans. Its inhabitants live mostly in oases formed where rivers run out of the mountains into the desert. These are inhabited by peasants who are unwarlike and merchants who have an interest in keeping trade running smoothly. Dzungaria has a fair amount of grass, few towns to base soldiers in and no significant mountain barriers to the west.  Therefore, trade went south and migrations north.&lt;ref&gt;Grosset, 'The Empire of the Steppes', p xxii,&lt;/ref&gt; Today most trade is north of the mountains ([[Dzungarian Gate]] and [[Khorgas]] in the Ili valley) to avoid the mountains west of the Tarim and because Russia is currently more developed.

==Economy==
[[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[sugar beet]]s are grown, and [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[horse]]s are raised. The fields are irrigated with melted snow from the permanently white-capped mountains.

Dzungaria has deposits of [[coal]], [[iron]], and [[gold]], as well as large [[oil field]]s.

The '''EF86'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetubestore.com/Tubes/EF86-Tube-Types&lt;/ref&gt; is a high [[transconductance]] sharp cutoff [[pentode]] [[vacuum tube]] with [[Tube socket#Noval|Noval (B9A) base]] for [[audio-frequency]] applications.

It was introduced in the late 1950s and was produced by [[Philips]], [[Mullard]], [[Telefunken]], Valvo, and GEC among others. It is very similar electrically to the [[Tube socket|octal base]] EF37A and the [[Tube socket#Rimlock|Rimlock base]] EF40. Unlike many pentodes it was designed specifically for audio applications, low noise and low [[microphony]] being claimed advantages, although a rubber-mounted vibration-resistant base was still recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aai0113.htm National valve museum: EF86]&lt;/ref&gt; It has much higher stage gain than any triode, which makes it susceptible to microphony. The EF86 was used in many [[preamplifier]] designs during the last decades of vacuum tube [[hi-fi]] development. An industrial variant of the tube is known as '''6267'''. In the former [[Soviet Union]] a variant was also produced as type '''6Zh32P''' (Russian: '''6Ж32П'''.)  {{As of|2012}} EF86s were being produced in [[Russia]] in two versions under the [[Electro-Harmonix]] brand and in the [[Slovak Republic]] as [[JJ Electronic]] (formerly [[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|Tesla]]).

== Characteristics ==
6.3 [[Volt]], 200 mA indirectly-heated A.F. miniature pentode with Noval (B9A) base with an EIA 9CQ (or 9BJ&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj7p.org/Tube4.php?tube=EF86&lt;/ref&gt;) basing diagram.
* Transconductance: 2.2 mA/V at I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=3.0&amp;nbsp;mA, I&lt;sub&gt;g2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.6&amp;nbsp;mA, V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=250&amp;nbsp;V, V&lt;sub&gt;g1&lt;/sub&gt;=-2.2&amp;nbsp;V, V&lt;sub&gt;g2&lt;/sub&gt;=140&amp;nbsp;V, V&lt;sub&gt;g3&lt;/sub&gt;=0&amp;nbsp;V
* Voltage gain: 185 (45[[Decibel|dB]]) at V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt;=250&amp;nbsp;V, I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=0.9&amp;nbsp;mA, R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=2.2&amp;nbsp;kilohm, R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=220&amp;nbsp;kilohm, R&lt;sub&gt;g1&lt;/sub&gt;=1&amp;nbsp;megohm, Vout&lt;44&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;

Special precautions have been taken in the design to reduce:
* [[Mains hum|Hum]] (through a [[bifilar]]-wound twisted pair of heater wires),
* [[Noise (electronic)|noise]], and
* microphony (through a rigid internal structure to reduce resonances).

The EF86 is much less noisy than other pentodes, but slightly noisier than some [[triode]]s at about 2 µV equivalent input noise to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Although used in circuits such as tape recorder input stages and instrument amplifiers, microphony can be a problem, even when mounted in a vibration-reducing valve holder.

== Equivalent and similar devices ==
* 6267 * Z729 * CV2901 * 6BK8 * 6CF8 * 6F22 * CV8068 * CV10098

Special quality:
* EF86SQ * M8195 * CV4085 * EF806S

Different heater requirements:
* PF86, 300&amp;nbsp;mA (4.5&amp;nbsp;V)
* UF86, 100&amp;nbsp;mA (12.6&amp;nbsp;V)

The rarely used EF83 is a remote-cutoff pentode&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aaa0527.htm National Valve Museum: EF83]&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise similar to the EF86; the remote cutoff (variable mu) makes it suitable for applications such as [[automatic gain control]] (agc) in tape recorders.

In observational [[astronomy]] an '''Einstein ring''', also known as an '''Einstein–Chwolson ring''' or '''Chwolson ring''', is the deformation of the light from a source (such as a [[galaxy]] or [[star]]) into a ring through [[gravitational lens]]ing of the source's light by an object with an extremely large mass (such as another galaxy or a [[black hole]]).&lt;ref name="NYT-20150305-video"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Drakeford |first1=Jason |last2=Corum |first2=Jonathan |last3=Overbye |first3=Dennis |title=Einstein’s Telescope - video (02:32) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000003552687/out-there-einsteins-telescope.html |date=March 5, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150305"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis

== Introduction ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Gravitational lensing is predicted by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]. Instead of light from a source traveling in a straight line (in three dimensions), it is bent by the presence of a massive body, which distorts [[spacetime]]. An Einstein Ring is a special case of gravitational lensing, caused by the exact alignment of the source, lens, and observer. This results in a symmetry around the lens, causing a ring-like structure.

[[Image:Gravitational lens geometry.svg|500px|thumb|The geometry of a gravitational lens]]
The size of an Einstein ring is given by the [[Einstein radius]]. In [[radian]]s, it is

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_1 = \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{c^2}\;\frac{d_{LS}}{d_L d_S}},&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]],
: &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the lens,
: &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]],
: &lt;math&gt;d_L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular diameter distance]] to the lens,
: &lt;math&gt;d_S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular diameter distance]] to the source, and
: &lt;math&gt;d_{LS}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular diameter distance]] between the lens and the source.

Note that, over cosmological distances &lt;math&gt;d_{LS}\ne d_S-d_L&lt;/math&gt; in general.

== History ==
[[File:ALMA image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81..jpg|thumb|Gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81 taken by [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ALMA at Full Stretch Yields Spectacular Images|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15028/|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=ESO Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The bending of light by a gravitational body was predicted by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1912, a few years before the publication of [[general relativity]] in 1916 (Renn et al. 1997). The ring effect was first mentioned in the academic literature by [[Orest Khvolson]] in a short article in 1924, in which he mentioned the “halo effect” of gravitation when the source, lens, and observer are in near-perfect alignment.&lt;ref name="Early History of Gravitational Lensing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~hps/turner.pdf|title=The Early History of Gravitational Lensing|first=Christina|last=Turner|date=February 14, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085534/http://www.nd.edu/%7Ehps/turner.pdf|archivedate=July 25, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein remarked upon this effect in 1936 in a paper prompted by a letter by a Czech engineer, R W Mandl [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/beamline/31/1/31-1-maurer.pdf], but stated

{{quote|Of course, there is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly. First, we shall scarcely ever approach closely enough to such a central line. Second, the angle β will defy the resolving power of our instruments.|''Science'' vol 84 p 506 1936}}
(In this statement, β is the Einstein Radius currently denoted by &lt;math&gt;\theta_1,&lt;/math&gt; as in the expression above.) However, Einstein was only considering the chance of observing Einstein rings produced by stars, which is low – the chance of observing those produced by larger lenses such as galaxies or black holes is higher since the angular size of an Einstein ring increases with the mass of the lens.

There have apparently not been any observations of a star forming an Einstein ring with another star, but there is a 45% chance of this happening in early May, 2028 when [[Alpha Centauri]] A passes between us and a distant red star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=P. Kervella et al.|title=Close stellar conjunctions of α Centauri A and B until 2050|arxiv=1610.06079|date=Oct 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of gravitational lenses are currently known. About half a dozen of them are partial Einstein rings with diameters up to an [[arcsecond]], although as either the mass distribution of the lenses is not perfectly [[Axial symmetry|axially symmetrical]], or the source, lens, and observer are not perfectly aligned, we have yet to see a perfect Einstein ring. Most rings have been discovered in the radio range. The degree of completeness needed for an image seen through a gravitational lens to qualify as an Einstein ring is yet to be defined.

The first Einstein ring was discovered by Hewitt et al. (1988), who observed the radio source [[MG1131+0456]] using the [[Very Large Array]]. This observation saw a [[quasar]] lensed by a nearer galaxy into two separate but very similar images of the same object, the images stretched round the lens into an almost complete ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2000/vla20/background/ering/ | title=Discovery of the First "Einstein Ring" Gravitational Lens | publisher=[[NRAO]] | date=2000 | accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dual images are another possible effect of the source, lens, and observer not being perfectly aligned.

The first complete Einstein ring to be discovered was [[B1938+666]], which was found by King et al. (1998) via optical follow-up with the Hubble Space Telescope of a gravitational lens imaged with [[MERLIN]].&lt;ref name="Bullseye"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906EFDF103BF932A05750C0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title='Einstein Ring' Caused by Space Warping Is Found | first=Malcolm W. | last=Browne | date=1998-03-31 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The galaxy causing the lens at B1938+666 is an ancient [[elliptical galaxy]], and the image we see through the lens is a dark [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf]] [[satellite galaxy]], which we would otherwise not be able to see with current technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vegetti|first1=Simona|display-authors=etal|title=Gravitational detection of a low-mass dark satellite at cosmological distance|journal=Nature|date=January 2012|volume=481|issue=7381|pages=341–343|arxiv = 1201.3643 |bibcode = 2012Natur.481..341V |doi = 10.1038/nature10669|pmid=22258612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Einstein Rings (Cropped).jpg|thumb|Some observed Einstein rings by SLACS]] 
In 2005, the combined power of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) with the Hubble Space Telescope was used in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey to find 19 new gravitational lenses, 8 of which showed Einstein rings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolton|first1=A|display-authors=etal|title=Hubble, Sloan Quadruple Number of Known Optical Einstein Rings|url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2005/32/|website=Hubblesite|accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are the 8 shown in the adjacent image. As of 2009 this survey has found 85 confirmed gravitational lenses, there is not yet a number for how many show Einstein rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Auger|first1=Matt|display-authors=etal|title=The Sloan Lens ACS Survey.

*[[FOR J0332-3557]], discovered by Remi Cabanac et al. in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cabanac|first1=Remi |display-authors=etal |title=Discovery of a high-redshift Einstein ring|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2005-04-27|volume=436|issue=2|pages=L21-L25|arxiv = astro-ph/0504585 |bibcode = 2005A&amp;A...436L..21C |doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:200500115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notable for its high [[redshift]] which allows us to use it to make observations about the [[early universe]].
*The "[[Cosmic Horseshoe]]" is a partial Einstein ring which was observed through the gravitational lens of LRG 3-757, a distinctively large Luminous Red Galaxy. It was discovered in 2007 by V. Belokurov et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belokurov|first1=V.|display-authors=etal|title=The Cosmic Horseshoe: Discovery of an Einstein Ring around a Giant Luminous Red Galaxy|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=December 2007|volume=671|issue=1|pages=L9-L12|arxiv = 0706.2326 |bibcode = 2007ApJ...671L...9B |doi = 10.1086/524948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[SDSSJ0946+1006]], the "double Einstein ring" was discovered by Raphael Gavazzi and Tomasso Treu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavazzi|first1=Raphael|display-authors=etal|title=The Sloan Lens ACS Survey.

Another example is the radio/X-Ray Einstein ring around PKS 1830-211, which is unusually strong in radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathur|first1=Smita|last2=Nair|first2=Sunita|title=X-Ray Absorption toward the Einstein Ring Source PKS 1830-211|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 July 1997|volume=484|pages=140–144|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/484/1/140/fulltext/35563.text.html|accessdate=16 July 2014|arxiv = astro-ph/9703015 |bibcode = 1997ApJ...484..140M |doi=10.1086/304327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in X-Ray by Varsha Gupta et al. at the Chandra X-Ray observatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Varsha|title=Chandra Detection of AN X-Ray Einstein Ring in PKS 1830-211|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252412929_Chandra_Detection_of_AN_X-Ray_Einstein_Ring_in_PKS_1830-211|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also notable for being the first case of a quasar being lensed by an almost face-on [[spiral galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Courbin|first1=Frederic|title=Cosmic alignment towards the radio Einstein ring PKS 1830-211 ?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=August 2002|volume=575|issue=1|pages=95–102|arxiv = astro-ph/0202026 |bibcode = 2002ApJ...575...95C |doi = 10.1086/341261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a radio ring around galaxy MG1654+1346, the image in the ring is that of a quasar [[Radio galaxy|radio lobe]], discovered in 1989 by G.Langston et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langston|first1=G.I.|display-authors=etal|title=MG 1654+1346 - an Einstein Ring image of a quasar radio lobe|journal=Astronomical Journal|date=May 1989|volume=97|pages=1283–1290|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989AJ.....97.1283L|accessdate=16 July 2014|bibcode = 1989AJ.....97.1283L |doi = 10.1086/115071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extra rings ==
[[Image:SDSSJ0946+1006.jpg|thumb|left|SDSSJ0946+1006 is a Double Einstein Ring. Credit: [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]]/[[NASA]]/[[ESA]]]]

Using the Hubble Space Telescope, a double ring has been found by Raphael Gavazzi of the [[STScI]] and Tommaso Treu of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. This arises from the light from three galaxies at distances of 3, 6, and 11 billion light years. Such rings help in understanding the distribution of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], the nature of distant galaxies, and the [[curvature of the universe]]. The odds of finding such a double ring are 1 in 10,000. Sampling 50 suitable double rings would provide astronomers with a more accurate measurement of the dark matter content of the universe and the equation of state of the dark energy to within 10 percent precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/04/full/ |title=Hubble Finds Double Einstein Ring |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work=Hubblesite.org |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A simulation ===
[[Image:EnsteinRingZoomOptimised.gif|thumb|200px|right|Einstein rings near a black hole]]
To the right is a simulation depicting a zoom on a [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole]] in the plane of the [[Milky Way]] between us and the centre of the galaxy. The first Einstein ring is to the most distorted region of the picture and shows the [[Disc (galaxy)|galactic disc]]. The zoom then reveals a series of 4 extra rings, increasingly thinner and closer to the black hole shadow. They are multiple images of the galactic disk. The first and third correspond to points which are behind the black hole (from the observer's position) and correspond here to the bright yellow region of the galactic disc (close to the galactic center), whereas the second and fourth correspond to images of objects which are behind the observer, which appear bluer since the corresponding part of the galactic disc is thinner and hence dimmer here.

'''Embodied energy''' is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services, considered as if that energy was incorporated or 'embodied' in the product itself. The concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy-producing or energy-saving devices, or the "real" replacement cost of a building, and, because energy-inputs usually entail [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, in deciding whether a product contributes to or mitigates [[global warming]]. One fundamental purpose for measuring this quantity is to compare the amount of energy produced or saved by the product in question to the amount of energy consumed in producing it.

Embodied energy is an accounting method which aims to find the sum total of the energy necessary for an entire product life-cycle. Determining what constitutes this life-cycle includes assessing the relevance and extent of energy into raw material extraction, transport, manufacture, assembly, installation, disassembly, deconstruction and/or decomposition as well as human and secondary resources.

==History==
The history of constructing a system of accounts which records the energy flows through an environment can be traced back to the origins of [[accounting]] itself. As a distinct method, it is often associated with the [[Physiocrat]]'s "substance" theory of value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Philip |last1=Mirowski |title=More Heat Than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmVhZnHId-oC&amp;pg=PA154 |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42689-3 |pages=154–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the agricultural energetics of [[Sergei Podolinsky]], a Ukrainian physician,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. |last1=Martinez-Alier |title=Ecological Economics: Energy Environment and Society |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1990 |isbn=0631171460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ecological energetics of [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Douglas R. |last1=Weiner |title=Models of Nature: Ecology, Conservation, and Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8_2PvhwnO8C&amp;pg=PA70 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre |isbn=978-0-8229-7215-0 |pages=70–71, 78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main methods of embodied energy accounting as they are used today grew out of [[Wassily Leontief]]'s [[input-output model]] and are called ''Input-Output Embodied Energy analysis''. Leontief's input-output model was in turn an adaptation of the [[Neoclassical economics|neo-classical]] theory of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] with application to "the empirical study of the quantitative interdependence between interrelated economic activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. |last1=Leontief |title=Input-Output Economics |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1966 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tennenbaum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Tennenbaum |first=Stephen E. |title=Network Energy Expenditures for Subsystem Production |type=MS |url=http://www.esnips.com/doc/ac5215f1-e91d-4c30-8648-2eee1f31488c/Network_Energy_Thesis.pdf |year=1988 |docket=CFW-88-08 |oclc=20211746 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190108/http://www.esnips.com/doc/ac5215f1-e91d-4c30-8648-2eee1f31488c/Network_Energy_Thesis.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leontief's Input-Output method was adapted to embodied energy analysis by Hannon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=B. |last1=Hannon |title=The Structure of ecosystems |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=535–546 |date=October 1973 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90060-X |url=http://urizen-geography.nsm.du.edu/~psutton/Sutton_Courses/Geog_3890_Ecological_Economics/SeminalEEpapers/B_HannonStructureOfEcosystems.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe ecosystem energy flows. Hannon's adaptation tabulated the total direct and indirect energy requirements (the ''energy intensity'') for each output made by the system. The total amount of energies, direct and indirect, for the entire amount of production was called the ''embodied energy''.

==Methodologies==
Embodied energy analysis is interested in what energy goes to supporting a consumer, and so all energy depreciation is assigned to the final demand of consumer. Different methodologies use different scales of data to calculate energy embodied in products and services of nature and human civilization. International consensus on the appropriateness of data scales and methodologies is pending. This difficulty can give a wide range in embodied energy values for any given material. In the absence of a comprehensive global embodied energy public dynamic database, embodied energy calculations may omit important data on, for example, the rural road/highway construction and maintenance needed to move a product, human marketing, advertising, catering services, non-human services and the like. Such omissions can be a source of significant methodological error in embodied energy estimations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenzen|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an estimation and declaration of the embodied energy error, it is difficult to calibrate the [[Sustainability#Sustainability definition as a ratio: please do not change spelling - see note|sustainability index]], and so the [[Value theory|value]] of any given material, process or service to environmental and human economic processes.

===Standards===
The SBTool, UK [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] and USA LEED  are methods in which the embodied energy of a product or material is rated, along with other factors, to assess a building's [[environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]]. Embodied energy is a concept for which scientists have not yet agreed absolute universal values because there are many variables to take into account, but most agree that products can be compared to each other to see which has more and which has less embodied energy. Comparative lists (for an example, see the University of Bath ''Embodied Energy &amp; Carbon Material Inventory''&lt;ref name="ICE Database"&gt;G.P.Hammond and C.I.Jones (2006) ''[http://www.circularecology.com/embodied-energy-and-carbon-footprint-database.html Embodied energy and carbon footprint database]'', Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;) contain average absolute values, and explain the factors which have been taken into account when compiling the lists.

Typical embodied energy units used are MJ/kg (mega[[joules]] of energy needed to make a kilogram of product), t{{CO2}} (tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] created by the energy needed to make a kilogram of product). Converting MJ to t{{CO2}} is not straightforward because different types of energy (oil, wind, solar, nuclear and so on) emit different amounts of carbon dioxide, so the actual amount of carbon dioxide emitted when a product is made will be dependent on the type of energy used in the manufacturing process. For example, the Australian Government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmit.csiro.au/brochures/tech/embodied/ CSIRO on embodied energy: Australia's foremost scientific institution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225154902/http://www.cmit.csiro.au/brochures/tech/embodied/ |date=2006-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a global average of 0.098 t{{CO2}} = 1 GJ. This is the same as 1 MJ = 0.098&amp;nbsp;kg{{CO2}} = 98 g{{CO2}} or 1&amp;nbsp;kg{{CO2}} = 10.204 MJ.

===Related methodologies===
In the 2000s drought conditions in [[Australia]] have generated interest in the application of embodied energy analysis methods to water. This has led to use of the concept of [[embodied water]].

== In transportation ==
Theoretically, embodied energy stands for the energy used to extract materials from mines, to manufacture vehicles, assemble, transport, maintain, transform them and to transport energy, and ultimately to recycle these vehicles. Besides, the energy needed to build and maintain transport networks, whether road or rail, should be taken into account as well. The process to be implemented is so complex that no one dares to put forward a figure.

According to the [[:fr:Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales]], in the field of transportation, "it is striking to note that we consume more embodied energy in our transportation expenditures than direct energy [...]. Put in other words, we consume less energy to move around in our personal vehicles than we consume the energy we need to produce, sell and transport the cars, trains or buses we use "&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.iddri.org/Publications/L-energie-grise-la-face-cachee-de-nos-consommations-d-energie L’énergie grise : la face cachée de nos consommations d’énergie] website iddri. org&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Jean-Marc Jancovici]] advocates a carbon footprint analysis of any transportation infrastructure project, prior to its construction&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://jancovici.com/publications-et-co/articles-de-presse/pour-un-bilan-carbone-des-projets-dinfrastructures-de-transport/ Pour un bilan carbone des projets d’infrastructures de transport] website jancovici. com&lt;/ref&gt;.

===In automobiles===
[[File:Car life cycle.svg|thumb|lang=en|upright=1.5|Car life cycle]]

==== Manufacturing ====
According to  [[Volkswagen]], the embodied energy contents of a Golf A3 with a [[petrol engine]] amounts to 18 000 kWh (i.e. 12%  of  545 GJ as shown in the report&lt;ref name="VW"&gt;(de) [http://www.volkswagen.de/content/medialib/vwd4/de/Volkswagen/Nachhaltigkeit/service/download/umweltberichte/umweltbericht_20012002deutsch48mb/_jcr_content/renditions/rendition.file/umweltberichte_par_0009_file.pdf Volkswagen environmental report 2001/2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192010/http://www.volkswagen.de/content/medialib/vwd4/de/Volkswagen/Nachhaltigkeit/service/download/umweltberichte/umweltbericht_20012002deutsch48mb/_jcr_content/renditions/rendition.file/umweltberichte_par_0009_file.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} see page 27&lt;/ref&gt;). A  Golf A4 (equipped with a [[turbocharged direct injection]]) will show an embodied energy amounting to 22 000 kWh (i.e. 15% of 545 GJ as shown in the report&lt;ref name="VW" /&gt;). According to the French energy and environment agency ADEME &lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.ademe.fr/sites/default/files/assets/documents/90511_acv-comparative-ve-vt-resume.pdf Life cycle assessment]  website www.ademe.fr see page 9&lt;/ref&gt; a motor car has an embodied energy contents of 20 800 kWh whereas an [[electric vehicle]] shows an embodied energy contents amounting to 34 700 kWh.

==== Fuel ====
As regards energy itself, the factor [[energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) of fuel can be estimated at 8, which means that to some amount of useful energy provided by fuel should be added 1/7 of that amount in embodied energy of the fuel. In other words, the fuel consumption should be augmented by 14% due to the fuel EROEI.

==== Road construction ====
We have to work here with figures, which prove still more difficult to obtain. In the case of road construction, the embodied energy would amount to 1/18 of the fuel consumption (i.e. 6%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pavementinteractive.org/2012/02/21/energy-and-road-construction-whats-the-mileage-of-roadway/  energy-and-road-construction] website www.pavementinteractive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other figures available ====
Treloar, ''et al.'' have estimated the embodied energy in an average automobile in Australia as 0.27 [[Joule#Multiples|terajoules]] (i.e. 75 000 kWh) as one component in an overall analysis of the energy involved in road transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Love2/publication/228770848_Hybrid_life-cycle_inventory_for_road_construction_and_use/links/02bfe50f8f59609519000000.pdf Hybrid life-cycle inventory for road construction and use] website resaerchgate.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== In buildings ==
Although most of the focus for improving energy efficiency in buildings has been on their operational emissions, it is estimated that about 30% of all energy consumed throughout the lifetime of a building can be in its embodied energy (this percentage varies based on factors such as age of building, climate, and materials).  In the past, this percentage was much lower, but as much focus has been placed on reducing operational emissions (such as efficiency improvements in heating and cooling systems), the embodied energy contribution has come much more into play. Examples of embodied energy include: the energy used to extract raw resources, process materials, assemble product components, transport between each step, construction, maintenance and repair, deconstruction and disposal. As such, it is important to employ a whole-life carbon accounting framework in analyzing the carbon emissions in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ibn-Mohammed|first = T.|last2 = Greenough|first2 = R.|last3 = Taylor|first3 = S.|last4 = Ozawa-Meida|first4 = L.|last5 = Acquaye|first5 = A.|date = 2013-11-01|title = Operational vs. embodied emissions in buildings—A review of current trends|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813004143|journal = Energy and Buildings|volume = 66|pages = 232–245|doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the energy field ==
=== EROEI ===
[[EROEI]] provides a basis for evaluating the embodied energy due to energy.

Final energy  has to be multiplied by &lt;math&gt; \frac  {\hbox{1}} {\hbox{EROEI}}&lt;/math&gt; in order to get the embodied energy.

Given an EROEI amounting to eight e.g., an eighth of the final energy corresponds to the embodied energy.

Not only that, for really obtaining overall embodied energy, embodied energy due to the construction and maintenance of power plants should be taken into account, too. Here, figures are badly needed.
=== Electricity ===
In the [[BP]] ''Statistical Review of World Energy June 2018'', [[Tonne of oil equivalent|toe]] are converted into [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] "on the basis of thermal equivalence assuming 38% conversion efficiency in a modern thermal power station".

In [[France]], by convention, the ratio between  primary energy and final energy in electricity amounts to 2.58,&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000788395 Decree of 15th September 2006 on the energy performance diagnosis of existing buildings for sale in mainland France], website legifrance.gouv.fr&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to  an efficiency of 0.3875 or 38.8%.

In [[Germany]], on the contrary, because of the swift development of the renewable energies, the ratio between  primary energy and final energy in electricity amounts to only 1.8,&lt;ref&gt;(de) [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/enev_2007/BJNR151900007.html laws in Internet] site web gesetze-im-internet.de see section 2.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to an efficiency of 55.5%.

== Data processing ==
According to [[association négaWatt]], embodied energy related to digital services amounted to 3.5 TWh/a for networks and 10.0 TWh/a for data centres (half for the servers per se, i. e. 5 TWh/a, and the other half for the buildings in which they are housed, i. e. 5 TWh/a), figures valid in France, in 2015. The organization is optimistic about the evolution of the energy consumption in the digital field, underlining the technical progress being made&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://decrypterlenergie.org/la-revolution-numerique-fera-t-elle-exploser-nos-consommations-denergie Will digital revolution increase our energy consumption?] website decrypterlenergie.org, website of [[association négaWatt]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Energy in Cameroon''' is a growing [[industry]] with tremendous potential, especially with the hydroelectric industry. With a total installed capacity of 1,292 MW, the mix of energy production of Cameroon consists of 57% of hydraulic power source, 21% of thermal springs in the gas, 10% of heat source to light fuel oil and 13% of heat source to heavy fuel oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cameroonweb.com/CameroonHomePage/NewsArchive/Electricity-The-contribution-of-renewable-energy-323611?lang= Electricity: The contribution of renewable energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil==
[[Cameroon]] began off shore oil production in 1977. Annual production has gradually fallen since 1985, and the decline is expected to continue as existing reserves are depleted. Output amounted to {{convert|76,600|oilbbl/d}} in 2001, down from {{convert|100,000|oilbbl/d}} in 1999. However, Cameroon is [[sub-Sahara]]n Africa's sixth-largest crude oil producer, with output in 2003 at {{convert|67,000|oilbbl/d}}, and estimated reserves at {{convert|400|Moilbbl}} as of January 1, 2004, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA). Field development and production began in the Kribi-Campo basin in the mid-1990s, and the Ebome field came online in 1996. As of 2002, the major operators were [[ExxonMobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Total S.A.]]  The oil sector is managed by the national oil company ''[[Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures]]''.

Work was under way on development of the Doba basin oil fields and construction of a [[Chad–Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|pipeline between Cameroon and Chad]], with the aid of a US$93&amp;nbsp;million loan from the [[World Bank]]. Production was expected to have begun in early 2004. In October 2002, Cameroon and [[Nigeria]], both of whom claimed the potentially oil-rich [[Bakassi Peninsula]], received a ruling on the dispute from the [[International Court of Justice]], which granted the peninsula to Cameroon. Cameroon's petroleum consumption in 2001 was {{convert|22,000|oilbbl/d}}.

==Natural gas==
The country reportedly has large reserves of [[liquid petroleum]] gas, which are largely untapped. According to the EIA, Cameroon's natural gas reserves stood at {{convert|3.9|Gcuft}} as of January 1, 2004, with no known production in 2002.  In cooperation with [[GDF Suez]], ''Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures'' is planning to build a [[LNG train|liquefied natural gas plant]].&lt;ref name=upstream280610&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydroelectricity==
Hydroelectric resources remain the most readily exploitable form of energy in Cameroon, which, together with the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], is considered to have the greatest hydroelectric potential in Africa. Electrical energy is produced primarily by two hydroelectric stations on the [[Sanaga River]]. Nearly 60% of the power from these stations goes to the [[aluminum smelter]] at [[Edéa]]. Cameroon's electrical capacity was 810&amp;nbsp;MW in 2002, for which output for that year was 3.249&amp;nbsp;TWh, of which about 90% was from hydropower and the remainder from fossil fuels. Consumption amounted to 3.022&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2002. In the 1980s, hydroelectric capacity was expanded by an additional complex on the Sanaga River (Song-Loulou) and a 72&amp;nbsp;MW generator (built with Chinese aid) on the [[Bénoué River]]. However, despite Cameroon's impressive waterpower resources, the national electricity grid runs principally from [[Douala]] to [[Yaoundé]] and from Douala to [[Bafoussam]]. Most other areas are served by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]-generated electricity or have no electricity at all. Cameroon's National Energy Plan attempts to prepare for a diminishing petroleum output. [[Hydro-Québec]] of [[Canada]] conducted a feasibility study of the [[Nachtigal Power Station]], which could provide 280&amp;nbsp;MW of hydroelectric power on the Sananga River north of Yaoundé. In 1998, [[Hydro-Québec]] was awarded a contract to upgrade the [[Song Loulou Hydroelectric Power Station]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8689">{{About|the term energy intensity as used in [[economics]]|the [[physics]] concept of [[radiant energy]] per unit area|radiant exposure | energy use intensity in buildings|Energy efficiency (disambiguation){{!}}Energy efficiency}}

[[File:GDP per unit of energy use.png|thumb|400px|The World Bank : PPP $ per kg of oil equivalent (2011)]]

'''Energy intensity''' is a [[Measurement|measure]] of the [[efficient energy use|energy inefficiency]] of an [[Economic system|economy]]. It is calculated as units of [[energy]] per unit of [[GDP]].

* High energy intensities indicate a high price or cost of converting energy into GDP.
* Low energy intensity indicates a lower price or cost of converting energy into GDP.

High energy intensity means high industrial output as portion of GDP. Countries with low energy intensity signifies labor intensive economy. 

==Overview==
Many factors influence an economy's overall energy intensity. It may reflect requirements for general [[standards of living]] and weather conditions in an economy. It is not atypical for particularly cold or hot climates to require greater [[Domestic energy consumption|energy consumption]] in homes and workplaces for heating ([[furnace]]s, or [[electric heater]]s) or cooling ([[air conditioning]], [[fan (mechanical)|fans]], [[refrigeration]]). A country with an advanced standard of living is more likely to have a wider prevalence of such consumer goods and thereby be impacted in its energy intensity than one with a lower standard of living.

Energy efficiency of appliances and buildings (through use of building materials and methods, such as [[Building insulation|insulation]]), fuel economy of vehicles, vehicular distances travelled (frequency of travel or larger geographical distances), better methods and patterns of [[transportation]], capacities and utility of [[mass transit]], [[energy rationing]] or [[energy demand management|conservation efforts]], 'off-grid' energy sources, and stochastic economic shocks such as disruptions of energy due to [[natural disaster]]s, wars, massive [[power outage]]s, unexpected new sources, efficient uses of energy or energy subsidies may all impact overall energy intensity of a nation.

Thus, a nation that is highly economically productive, with mild and temperate weather, demographic patterns of work places close to home, and uses fuel efficient vehicles, supports carpools, mass transportation or walks or rides bicycles, will have a far lower energy intensity than a nation that is economically unproductive, with extreme weather conditions requiring heating or cooling, long commutes, and extensive use of generally poor fuel economy vehicles. Paradoxically, some activities that may seem to promote high energy intensities, such as long commutes, could in fact result in lower energy intensities by causing a disproportionate increase in GDP output.

Figures of energy consumption used in statistics are energy sources marketed through major energy industries. Therefore, some small scale but frequent consumption of energy source like [[firewood]], [[charcoal]]  [[peat]], [[water wheel]], [[wind mill]] are not in its count.
In countries, which does not have such developed energy industries or people with highly self energy efficient life style, report smaller energy consumption figures.

==Examples==

[[File:Energy intensity comparison (2004).svg|thumb|right|350px|'''Energy Intensity of different economies''' The graph shows the amount of energy it takes to produce a US $ of GNP for selected countries. GNP is based on 2004 purchasing power parity and 2000 dollars adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1p.xls Energy Information Administration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206021602/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/international/iealf/tablee1p.xls |date=2007-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* [[United States|U.S.]] energy consumption from all sources in 2004 was estimated at {{convert|99.74|quad|PJ|lk=on|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/total.html (US DoE]&lt;/ref&gt; Total GDP that year was $11.75 trillion, with per-capita GDP at $40,100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html CIA Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; Using a population of 290,809,777,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/popest/states/NST-EST2003-ann-est.html US Census Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; this would produce an Energy Intensity of {{convert|8553|BTU|abbr=on}} per dollar.

Various nations have significantly higher or lower energy intensities.

* [[Bangladesh]], with a population of 144 million and a GDP of $275.5 billion therefore has a GDP per capita of approximately $2,000. Its annual energy consumption was only {{convert|0.61|quad|abbr=on}}, making its Energy Intensity a mere {{convert|2113|kJ|BTU|disp=flip|abbr=on|lk=on}} per dollar—a quarter of the US rate. Low standards of living and economic performance primarily accounts for such a meager number.
* [[Russia]], with a population of 143 million and a GDP of $1.408 trillion therefore has a GDP per capita of approximately $9,800. Its annual energy consumption was {{convert|29.6|quad|abbr=on}}, for an Energy Intensity of {{convert|20676|kJ|BTU|disp=flip|abbr=on}} per dollar, or more than double that of the US. This may be due to harsh climatic conditions in most of Eastern Russia and the country's vast territorial space.
* [[Italy]], with a population of 60 million and a GDP of $1.8 trillion therefore has a GDP per capita of approximately $31,000. Its annual Energy Intensity of 122.8 tons of oil equivalent makes it the most energy efficient country in the G8 and one of the most energy efficient in the industrial world, largely due to traditionally high energy prices which have resulted in more efficient company and consumer behaviours.

Of course, these numbers were produced with a mix of 2003 and 2004 figures, many of which are estimates. Actual mathematical models should use precise data of appropriate matching periods of study.

Several countries, like Sweden, Norway, France, and Canada, have made the transition to operating on low-carbon utilities. Norway and Canada have made the switch to hydro power; France relies on nuclear power.  Since these countries have made the shift, they produce about a fifth of the carbon emissions in comparison to 13 other countries, like some including USA, Japan, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Carbon dioxide emissions in OECD service sectors: the critical role of electricity use|last = Krackeler|first = Tom|date = Dec 1998|journal = Energy Policy|volume = 26|issue = 15|pages = 1137|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/S0301-4215(98)00055-X|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic energy efficiency==
[[Image:Gdp-energy-efficiency.jpg|thumb|GDP per capita vs. 'Economic Energy Efficiency' plotted for the top 40 national economies.]]

An inverse way of looking at the issue would be an 'economic energy efficiency,' or economic rate of return on its consumption of energy: how many economic units of GDP are produced by the consumption of units of energy.

* Referring to the above examples, 1 million [[Btu]]s consumed with an energy intensity of 8,553 produced $116.92 of GDP for the US. Whereas, each million Btus of energy consumed in Bangladesh with an Energy Intensity of 2,113 produced $473 of GDP, or over four times the effective US rate. Russia, on the other hand, produced only $48.37 GDP per 1 million Btu based on an energy intensity of 20,676. Thus, Bangladesh could be perceived as having nearly ten times the economic energy efficiency of Russia.

It is not directly causal that a high GDP per capita must have lower economic energy efficiencies. See the accompanying chart for examples based on the top 40 national economies.

Energy intensity can be used as a comparative measure between countries; whereas the change in energy consumption required to raise GDP in a specific country over time is described as its [[energy elasticity]].

In the study of the physics of [[granular material]]s, a '''force chain''' consists of a set of particles within a compressed granular material that are held together and [[jamming (physics)|jammed into place]] by a network of mutual compressive forces.&lt;ref name=Peters2005&gt;{{Cite journal

Between these chains are regions of low stress whose grains are shielded for the effects of the grains above by [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] and [[arch]]ing.

The '''Fuchskaute''' is an extinct [[volcano]] and, at {{Höhe|657.3|DE-NHN|link=true}}{{GeoQuelle|DE-RP|LANDIS-Karte}}, the highest [[mountain]] of the [[Westerwald]] and the county of [[Westerwaldkreis]] in the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].

The name ''Fuchskaute'' ("foxhole") refers to a place where the fox (''Fuchs'') had its den (''Kaute'').

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The Fuchskaute rises in the High Westerwald, a [[plateau]] of the Westerwald which, in turn, is part of the [[Rhenish Massif]]. It is about half way between [[Bad Marienberg (Westerwald)|Bad Marienberg]] in the west and [[Breitscheid (Westerwald)|Breitscheid]] in the east and lies in the parish of [[Willingen (Westerwald)|Willingen]]. The state boundary with [[Hesse]] runs along its eastern slopes and that with [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] lies a few kilometres to the north. Just under 3&amp;nbsp;km north-northeast is the [[tripoint]] of the states of Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. Several streams rise on its flanks, including the [[Nister (Sieg)|Nister]] (''Große Nister'').

== Towers ==
There used to be an observation tower on the Fuchskaute from where views of the Westerwald and other local countryside could be enjoyed.

[[Amateur radio]] services operate two [[transmission tower]]s on the south top of the Fuchskaute.

===Early life===
Hal Roth was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1927.  He was an aviator during World War II and the Korean War.  During the course of his lifetime, Roth was also an author, sailor, mountaineer, and photographer.  He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Journalism, and became a free-lance writer and photographer.

===Marriage===
In 1959, Roth met Margaret Hale-White from Oxford, England who was visiting a friend in San Francisco, California.   Margaret was born in Bombay, India and was the daughter of an English engineer.  According to Roth, she worked in Paris for six and a half years as a dual language secretary for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). They married in 1960.

===Photography and journalism===
Roth studied photography with Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. He was a member of the  American Society of Magazine Photographers and worked from a base in Sausalito, California, producing imagery of life in the surrounding area of California during the late 1950s and into the late 1960s.  Roth's free-lance works of note include magazine titles such as Colliers, Fortune, The Saturday Evening Post, and The New York Times.  Themes of his work include: California landscapes and wildlife, San Francisco (including Fisherman's Wharf), Winter Olympics, Dr. Suess, and Native American wildland firefighters of the Southwest.

Hal was also engaged in photographic study of human life as represented by his "Time and Place" album and his Chinatown exhibit.  In 1964, the San Francisco Museum of Art exhibited 40 of Roth's black and white photographic images titled "The Faces of Chinatown."  Roth's first published book, ''Pathway in the Sky'' (1965) displays his passion for the John Muir Trail and the Sierra Mountains.  The associated images of the John Muir Trail also reflect people enjoying the trail and document its use in the early 1960s.

===Sailing and writing===
Even though neither was a sailor, their friends shared a love of sailing and introduced them to the sport in 1962.  The couple chartered a boat in the West Indies where they learned a great deal from the captain.  Later, they chartered another boat in Greece, then took sailing lessons in Scotland.   After purchasing a home in Sausalito in 1964, they took a trip (1966) north along the west coast and purchased a fiberglass Spencer 35, built in Vancouver, British Columbia and designed by John Brandlmayr in Seattle, Washington.  They named her ''Whisper'', and sailed her home to California.  The Roths began sailing on their own in 1966 and completed several voyages in ''Whisper''.  Destinations included Japan, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, Canadian islands, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Cape Horn, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Mediterranean, and Canary Islands.

The success of his first book, about the John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, prompted him and his wife to try the precarious worlds of adventuring and writing. They quit their jobs, and began a 19-month voyage around the Pacific in a {{convert|35|ft|m|sing=on}} sloop.&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Hal |date=1972 |title=Two on a big ocean : the story of the first circumnavigation of the Pacific basin in a small sailing ship |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |lccn=70171991 |oclc=278135 |isbn=0393032167 |ol=2011446W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their vast journey culminated in the publication of his first sailing book, ''Two on a Big Ocean.''  He and his wife, Margaret, subsequently made a life of sailing and writing about it, including sailing around South America and a circumnavigation via Panama, the Torres Strait, and Suez.

In 1978, they relocated to Maine.

The couple sold ''Whisper'' and purchased the ''American Flag'' (later renamed ''Sebago'') and Roth then sailed solo in the Brin's or [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race#The BOC Challenge 1986-87|British Oxygen Company (BOC) Challenge Race of 1986-7]].  He completed the race 4th in his class of 14, taking 171 days. ''Chasing the Long Rainbow'' (1990) is his account of this BOC race.  In 1990, he tried the race again in the same Santa Cruz 50 now named ''Sebago'' (his sponsor), but due to capsizing, the voyage took 211 days.  ''Chasing the Wind'' (1994) is his account of the second race.  In 1992, they sold ''Sebago'', purchased a Pretorien 35, named her ''Whisper'', and the couple spent two years together tracing Odysseus' voyage through the Mediterranean.  ''We Followed Odysseus'', ''How to Sail Around the World'', and ''Handling Storms at Sea'' represent books that he wrote based on the couple's final unique voyages.

Roth published hundreds of articles in his lifetime.  Although, his book publications appear to be his dominate body of work and document the couple's voyages and growing knowledge of sailing.  The 1972 account of their first circumnavigation of the Pacific Basin (1967-8) resulted in the publication ''Two on a Big Ocean''.  The Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America was awarded to the Hal Roth, and Margaret was noted as the sole crew, for this voyage.  ''After 50,000 Miles'' (1977) describes technical aspects of sailing.  The 1978 book ''Two against Cape Horn'' describes their journey from California to Maine via Cape Horn.  ''Always a Distant Anchorage''   (1988) describes their four-year (1981–1985) circumnavigation west through the Panama Canal, Torres Strait, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal.

===Death and afterward===
Roth recorded reminisces and continued to draft manuscripts throughout his life.  His last two works, ''The Paradise Book'' and ''Graf Spee'' were completed but never published.  He worked on these manuscripts during his later years and during his two and half year battle with lung cancer.  He died October 18, 2008, while living in Maryland with his wife, Margaret, who survives him.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roth |first1=Hal |others=Call number HDC1613 (SAFR 22822)|date=2011 |title=Hal Roth Papers |location=San Francisco |publisher=San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, National Park Service |isbn= |lccn= |oclc=731045386 |url=http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/maritime/safr_22822_hdc1613.pdf |accessdate=2016-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hercynite''' is a [[spinel group|spinel]] [[mineral]] with the formula FeAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

It occurs in high-grade [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] iron rich [[argillaceous]] [[sediment]]s as well as in [[mafic]] and [[ultramafic]] [[igneous rock]]s. Due to its hardness it also is found in [[placer deposit|placers]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

It was first described in 1847 and its name originates from the Latin name for the [[Harz]], Silva Hercynia, where the species was first found.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;

Hercynite is a spinel of regular symmetry and  normal cation distribution, but some disorder occurs in its structure. It consists of ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions and aluminium ions (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), however some ferric ions (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) may be located in the structure of hercynite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Crystal structure and Mössbauer study of FeAl2O4|last = Jastrzębska|first = Ilona|journal = Nukleonika-Journal of Nuclear Research|doi = 10.1515/nuka-2015-0012|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Szczerba J.|publisher = Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology|issue = 60(1)|year = 2015|department = Department of Ceramics and Refractories|pages = 47–49|last3 = Stoch P.|last4 = Błachowski A.|last5 = Ruebenbauer K.|last6 = Prorok R.|last7 = Snieżek E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hisaki''', also known as the '''Spectroscopic Planet Observatory for Recognition of Interaction of Atmosphere''' ('''SPRINT-A''') is a [[Japan]]ese [[ultraviolet astronomy]] satellite operated by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA). The first mission of the [[Small Scientific Satellite]] programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/article/interview/vol56/p2_e.html|title=Shujiro Sawai, "Semi-Made-To-Order" Satellites: Faster, Cheaper, More Advanced|publisher=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was launched in September 2013 on the maiden flight of the [[Epsilon (rocket)|Epsilon]] rocket.

Hisaki remains operational as of 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/index.html Astronomical Observation Satellites
In Operation]. JAXA - MIssions. Accessed 23 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and is performing joint observations with [[Juno (spacecraft)|''Juno'']] orbiter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL071675/full Response of Jupiter's inner magnetosphere to the solar wind derived from extreme ultraviolet monitoring of the Io plasma torus].

Hisaki was named after a cape {{nihongo |Hisaki |火崎 | literally Cape Fire}} used by local fishermen to pray for safe travels in the eastern part of [[Kimotsuki, Kagoshima]] near the [[Uchinoura Space Center]], but has the additional meaning of "beyond the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2013/09/20130914_hisaki_e.html | title= SPRINT-A: Solar Array Paddles Deployment and Nickname Decided | publisher=JAXA|date=September 14, 2013|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/news/20130914-OYT1T00684.htm| script-title=ja:イプシロン観測衛星、愛称は「ひさき」と命名|work=Yomiuri Online|publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]-sha|date=September 14, 2013|language=Japanese|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An old name for the mission was '''EXCEED''' (Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroscope for Exospheric Dynamics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012DPS....4421511T  F. Tsuchiya, et al. - Earth-orbiting Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Mission SPRINT-A/EXCEED]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

Hisaki carries an [[extreme ultraviolet]] [[spectrometer]] which will be used to study the composition of
the [[atmosphere]]s and the behavior of the [[magnetosphere]]s of the planets of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/sprint-a.htm|title=SPRINT A (EXCEED)| first=Gunter| last=Krebs| work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed for a one-year mission, Hisaki will be operated in a [[low Earth orbit]] with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|950|km|mi|abbr=on}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|1150|km|mi|abbr=on}}, 31&amp;nbsp;degrees of [[orbital inclination|inclination]] and a [[orbital period|period]] of 106&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/sprint_a/index_e.html|title=Spectroscopic Planet Observatory for Recognition of Integration of Atmosphere (SPRINT-A)| publisher=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency| accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] declared 2008 as the '''International Year of Planet Earth''' to increase awareness of the importance of [[Earth science]]s for the advancement of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES60192"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-60-192 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=60 |resolution_number=192 |accessdate=2008-09-17|date=22 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] was designated as the lead agency. The Year's activities spanned the three years 2006-2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yearofplanetearth.org/content/downloads/FAQs25May.pdf International Year of Planet Earth: FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The Year aimed to raise $20 million from industry and governments, of which half was to be spent on co-funding research, and half on "outreach" activities.  It was intended to be the biggest ever international effort to promote the Earth sciences.

Apart from researchers, who were expected to benefit under the Year's Science Programme, the principal target groups for the Year's broader messages were:

* Decision makers and politicians, to better inform them about the how Earth scientific knowledge can be used for sustainable development
* The voting public, to communicate to them how Earth scientific knowledge can contribute to a better society
* Geoscientists, to help them use their knowledge of various aspects of the Earth for the benefit of the world’s population.

The research themes of the year, set out in ten science prospectuses, were chosen for their societal relevance, multidisciplinary nature, and outreach potential. The Year had twelve founding partners, 23 associate partners, and was backed politically by 97 countries representing 87% of the world’s population. The Year was promoted politically at [[UNESCO]] and at the [[United Nations headquarters|United Nations in New York]] by the People’s Republic of [[Tanzania]].

The Year encouraged contributions from researchers within ten separate themes. The outreach programme worked in a similar way, receiving bids for support from individuals and organisations worldwide.

The Year's Project Leader was former [[IUGS]] President Professor Eduardo F J de Mulder. The Year's Science Committee was chaired by Professor Edward Derbyshire ([[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]]) and its Outreach Committee by Dr Ted Nield ([[Geological Society of London]]).

The International Year of Planet Earth project was initiated jointly by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation ([[UNESCO]]). The UN press release reads: "By a draft on the International Year of Planet Earth, 2008, which the Committee approved without a vote on 11 November, the Assembly would declare 2008 the International Year of Planet Earth.  It would also designate the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to organize activities to be undertaken during the Year, in collaboration with [[UNEP]] and other relevant United Nations bodies, the International Union of Geological Sciences and other Earth sciences societies and groups throughout the world.  Also by that draft, the Assembly would encourage Member States, the United Nations system and other actors to use the Year to increase awareness of the importance of Earth sciences in achieving sustainable development and promoting local, national, regional and international action."

== Background ==

== Objectives ==
The Year's stated objective was to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reduce risks for society caused by natural and human-induced [[hazard]]s, reduce health problems by improving understanding of the medical aspects of [[Earth science]], discover new [[natural resource]]s and make them available in a [[sustainable]] manner, build safer structures and expand [[urban area]]s, utilizing natural subsurface conditions, determine the non-human factor in climatic change, enhance understanding of the occurrence of natural resources so as to contribute to efforts to reduce political tension, detect deep and poorly accessible [[groundwater]] resources, improve understanding of the [[evolution of life]], increase interest in the Earth sciences in society at large, encourage more young people to study Earth science in university.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Themes ==

Research themes for the Year included: 
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Groundwater]]: reservoir for a thirsty planet?
*[[Natural disaster|Hazard]]s: minimizing risk, maximizing awareness
*Earth and [[Health]]: building a safer environment
*[[Climate change]]: the ‘stone tape’
*[[Natural resource|Resource]] Issues: towards sustainable use
*[[Megacities]]: going deeper, building safer
*Deep [[Earth]]: from [[Crust (geology)|crust]] to [[inner core|core]]
*[[Ocean]]: abyss of time
*[[Soil]]: Earth’s living skin
*Earth and [[Life]]: origins of diversity {{div col end}}

== Output and Legacy ==

As part of the IYPE legacy, 80 National and Regional IYPE Committees were set up to bring together key figures from various organisations into a single campaign dedicated to raising awareness of the Earth sciences among decision makers and the public.

The [[Network YES|Young Earth-Science Initiative (YES)]] was also created, providing a platform for young professionals in the [[Earth sciences]]. Initiated by two Italian geoscientists, [[David Govoni]] and [[Luca Micucci]], it started in 2007 and grew rapidly at the Global Launch Event of the IYPE in Paris in 2008, during which many young geoscientists were invited to participate. From there, the YES Initiative expanded, eventually adopting a formal structure, a network of supporting organisations (including IYPE) and an invitation by the Chinese government to host the first International YES Conference in October 2009 in [[Beijing]]. 

An international collaborative project known as [[OneGeology]] was launched, aiming to bring together geological data from all nations into a digital database and thus transform them into a single computer language, providing free access to the online digital geological world map in the scale of 1:1 million. That initiative, spearheaded by Ian Jackson of the [[British Geological Survey]], came under the IYPE banner in 2007.

'''''Iron Sky: The Coming Race''''' is a Finnish-German [[comic science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Timo Vuorensola]]. It is the long-awaited sequel to Vuorensola's 2012 film ''[[Iron Sky]]''. The film was [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] through [[Indiegogo]]. Release was originally announced for 14 February 2018,&lt;ref name="Indiegogo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iron-sky-the-coming-race--2#home |title=''Iron Sky: The Coming Race'' |publisher=[[Indiegogo]] |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had been postponed to 22 August 2018 in Finland followed by the rest of the world soon after, if not the same time.&lt;ref name="Indiegogo3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iron-sky-the-coming-race--3/x/9294574#/updates/all |title=''Iron Sky: The Coming Race Updates'' |publisher=[[Indiegogo]] |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to reports in the Finnish press the release date of 22 August 2018 has been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://muropaketti.com/elokuvat/elokuvauutiset/jo-kolme-vuotta-sitten-kuvattu-iron-sky-2-myohastyy-taas-ongelmien-takana-raha/ |title=Jo kolme vuotta sitten kuvattu Iron Sky 2 myöhästyy taas – ongelmien takana raha |publisher=Muropaketti |date=24 April 2018 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced that the film is scheduled to be released on 16 January 2019 as the Fan World Premiere in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ironsky.net/release/ |title=Release Dates &amp; Info |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major inspiration of the content (and the title) is the [[Vril]] conspiracy theory.

== Plot ==
Over 20 years after the nuclear war that had been triggered by the invasion of the [[Nazi UFOs|Moon Nazis]], Earth has become an [[Nuclear holocaust|inhospitable place]]. The last survivors have rallied together on the former Nazi moon base, with many refugees from Earth among them. Over the years a large human colony has formed, with its own fascist government and religions, including the [[Apple evangelist|Jobists]], a cult that formed around the teachings of [[Steve Jobs]] and their leader ([[Tom Green]]).

But the aging base is deteriorating and due to the damage the moon received in the nuclear war, its time is running out. Obi Washington ([[Lara Rossi]]), the daughter of Renate Richter ([[Julia Dietze]]) and [[Iron Sky|James Washington]], finds out that there may be other survivors hidden in an [[Agartha|underground city]] at the [[Hollow Earth|center of the earth]] with the means to save the base and decides to travel to earth to seek help.

But the survivors, she and a ragtag band of explorers find at the center of the earth are not even human—they stumble upon a prehuman world of dinosaurs ruled by the [[Vril]], a race of reptilians led by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his true reptilian form among other former human rulers, all of whom were [[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilians]] under their human skins all along.

== Production ==
On 20 May 2012, Tero Kaukomaa, producer of the first film, announced that there were plans for a prequel and a [[sequel]] but refused to disclose details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/blind-spot-plans-prequel-and-sequel-to-iron-sky/5042267.article Blind Spot plans prequel and sequel to Iron Sky] 20 May 2012. Geoffrey Macnab. ScreenDaily&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Vuorensola announced that ''Iron Sky'' will have a sequel titled ''Iron Sky The Coming Race''. He also mentioned that unlike the first film, this installment will be completely [[Crowdfunding|funded by fans]] via [[Indiegogo]], with an estimated budget of US$15 million. A promo video was shot for the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]] and the final draft of the script is scheduled to be published by the end of 2014. Filming is expected to begin in 2015.&lt;ref name="Indiegogo" /&gt; In July 2013, Vuorensola revealed [[Croatia]] as one of the proposed shooting locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Vuorensola, Timo; Karinen, Kalle (photographer) |date=2 July 2013 |title=Director's Update – From the Center of the Earth! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgxYhbw-Ozk |medium=Web video |trans_title= |publisher=Energia Productions |location=Croatia |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=9 December 2014 |time=01:50 |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Dalan Musson signed in to write the screenplay. The Finnish Film Foundation and Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg have come on board to finance the US$13 million project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/berlin-dalan-musson-to-write-sequel-to-iron-sky-exclusive-1201088661/ |title=Berlin: Dalan Musson to Write Sequel to 'Iron Sky' (EXCLUSIVE) |author=Keslassy, Elsa |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=5 February 2014 |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 2014, Energia Productions launched another crowdfunding campaign to raise US$500,000 before 20 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afm-iron-sky-coming-race-746923 |title=AFM: 'Iron Sky: The Coming Race' Launches Crowd Funding Campaign |author=Roxborough, Scott |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the closing of the campaign on 5 January, contributors pledged a grand total of US$560,949.&lt;ref name="Indiegogo" /&gt;

On 22 November 2014, [[Lloyd Kaufman]] of [[Troma Entertainment]] confirmed having a cameo role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Vuorensola, Timo (director) |date=22 November 2014 |title=Message from a living legend – Support ''Iron Sky The Coming Race'' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3HpbWC929I |medium=Web video |trans_title= |publisher=Energia Productions |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=9 December 2014 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2015, Vuorensola announced that filming will commence at [[AED Studios]] in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Vuorensola, Timo (director) |date=18 September 2015 |title=Invest in Victory with Iron Sky Bonds! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXXWm2V6uR0 |medium=Web video |trans_title= |publisher=Energia Productions |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=18 September 2015 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Timo Vuorensola launched a new crowdfunding campaign to fund special effects for out-of-budget scenes that were in danger of being left out from the final cut of the movie. The scenes included the deaths of reptilian [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Pope Urban II]].

== Marketing ==
On 6 November 2014, the official ''Iron Sky'' [[YouTube]] channel published the film's first teaser trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Vuorensola, Timo (director) |date=6 November 2014 |title=''Iron Sky: The Coming Race'' – Teaser #1 (Official) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jLaf5qj8cs |medium=Web video |trans_title= |publisher=Energia Productions |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=9 December 2014 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December, two more teasers were released, the first featuring [[Kari Ketonen]] as [[Vladimir Putin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Vuorensola, Timo (director) |date=1 December 2014 |title=''Iron Sky'' presents: Dance, Vladimir Putin! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSHaVH9HhfI |medium=Web video |trans_title= |publisher=Energia Productions |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=9 December 2014 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second featuring [[Jukka Hilden]] as [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Vuorensola, Timo (director) |date=1 December 2014 |title=''Iron Sky'' presents: Jesus Attack! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM13yXlW-Vs |medium=Web video |trans_title= |publisher=Energia Productions |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=9 December 2014 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/22033/20141213/iron-sky-the-coming-race-hitler-riding-a-t-rex-and-jesus-with-high-powered-rifles-is-too-controversial.htm |title=Iron Sky: The Coming Race – Hitler Riding a T-Rex and Jesus with High-Powered Rifles is too Controversial? |author=McKalin, Vamien |publisher=Tech Times |date=13 December 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/iron-sky-the-coming-race-trailer/ |title='Iron Sky The Coming Race' Trailers: Zombie Jesus Goes Scarface and Adolf Hitler On A T-Rex |author=Sciretta, Peter |publisher=[[/Film]] |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film is due to be released on 16 January 2019 in [[Finland]].

== Symbolism ==
Like its predecessor, the movie refers to several motifs of post-war [[Esoteric Nazism]], such as the [[Hollow Earth]] theory. The movie's title is most likely a reference to [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s novel ''[[Vril|The Coming Race]]'' (1871) that is commonly regarded as the origin of the so-called Vril myth. The film teaser features the Vril symbol that was designed by the [[Neo-völkisch movements#Tempelhofgesellschaft|Tempelhofgesellschaft]] in the 1990s.

== Copyright dispute ==
In the summer of 2017 a number of original ''Iron Sky'' VFX artists filed a suit in Finland against Iron Sky Universe Oy and Blind Spot Pictures Oy. "The plaintiffs claim their creative contribution to the Iron Sky franchise is such that they should also be considered as joint copyright holders of the original movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/animators-file-copyright-suit-iron-sky-producers-1036144 |title=Animators File Copyright Suit Against 'Iron Sky' Producers |author=Roxborough, Scott |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=8 September 2017 |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, the Finnish market court dismissed the case, finding that the artists have no copyright claim to ''Iron Sky'' nor its sequel. The court awarded copyright to the artists only in the case of a Japanese ship design used in the film, but ruled that the copyright had legally transferred to Blind Spot Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/iron-sky-producers-win-copyright-suit-finland-1116079?utm_source=twitter |title=Court Sides With 'Iron Sky' Producers in Copyright Suit |first=Scott |last=Roxborough |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=31 May 2018 |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2283">The '''Jaramillo reversal''' was a [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversal]] and [[Geomagnetic excursion|excursion]] of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] that occurred approximately one million years ago. In the geological time scale it was a "short-term" positive reversal in the then-dominant Matuyama reversed magnetic chronozone; its beginning is widely dated to 990,000 years before the present ([[Before Present|BP]]), and its end to 950,000 BP (though an alternative date of 1.07 million years ago to 990,000 is also found in the scientific literature).&lt;ref&gt;Herrero-Bervera, Emilio, and S. Keith Runcorn. "Transition Fields during the Geomagnetic Reversals and Their Geodynamic Significance." ''Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences,'' Vol. 355 No. 1730 (September 15, 1997), pp. 1713–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and mechanisms of short-term reversals and excursions like the Jaramillo, as well as the major field reversals like the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]], are subjects of study and dispute among researchers. One theory associates the Jaramillo with the [[Lake Bosumtwi|Bosumtwi impact event]], as evidenced by a [[tektite]] [[strewnfield]] in the [[Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;Glass, B. P., Swincki, M. B., &amp; Zwart, P. A. (1979).

The '''''Kalpa Sūtra''''' ({{lang-sa|कल्पसूत्र}}) is a [[Jain text]] containing the biographies of the [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]]s, notably [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann |author2=Ed. F. Max Müller | title =Kalpa Sutra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22 | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1884 | location =Oxford | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally ascribed to [[Bhadrabahu]], which would place it in the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;"Mahavira." Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 2006. Answers.com 28 Nov. 2009. http://www.answers.com/topic/mahavira&lt;/ref&gt;, it was probably put to writing only after 980 or 993 years after the ''Nirvana''(''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'') of [[Mahavira]]. 

==History==
Within the six sections of the Jain literary corpus belonging to the [[Svetambara]] school, it is classed as one of the Cheda Sūtras. This Sutra contains detailed life histories and, from the mid-15th century, was frequently illustrated with miniature painting. The oldest surviving copies are written on paper in western India in the 14th century.

Kalpasutra is ascribed to [[Bhadrabahu]], traditionally said to have composed it some 150 years after the ''Nirvāṇa'' (death) of Mahavira.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; It was compiled probably during the reign of [[Dhruvasena]], 980 or 993 years after the ''Nirvana'' of Mahavira.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=75}}

==Importance==
The book is read and illustrated in an eight-day-long festival of [[Paryushan]] by Jain monks for general people. Only Monks can read this scriptures as in Jainism, this book has very high spiritual values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11388">'''Laser Doppler velocimetry''' ('''LDV'''), also known as '''laser Doppler anemometry''' ('''LDA'''), is the technique of using the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] in a [[laser]] beam to measure the [[velocity]] in transparent or semi-transparent [[fluid]] flows, or the linear or vibratory motion of opaque, reflecting, surfaces. The measurement with LDA is absolute, linear with velocity and requires no pre-calibration.
[[Image:LDA LTG.JPG|thumb|230px|LDA facility operating at Laboratory of Gas Technology ([[Poznań University of Technology]]).]]

==Technology origin==
With the development of the [[helium–neon laser]] (He-Ne) at the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1962, the optics community had available a source of [[continuous wave]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] highly concentrated at a [[wavelength]] of 632.8 [[nanometer]]s (nm), in the red portion of the [[visible spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;White, A. D., and J. D. Rigden, "Continuous Gas Maser Operation in the Visible". ''Proc IRE'', vol. 50, p. 1697: July 1962, p. 1697. {{US Patent|3242439}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon shown fluid flow measurement could be made from the [[Doppler effect]] on a He-Ne beam scattered by very small [[polystyrene]] spheres entrained in the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1753925|title=Localized Fluid Flow Measurements with an He-Ne Laser Spectrometer|date=1964|last1=Yeh|first1=Y.|last2=Cummins|first2=H. Z.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=4|issue=10|pages=176|bibcode = 1964ApPhL...4..176Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Research Laboratories of Brown Engineering Company (later Teledyne Brown Engineering), this phenomenon was used in developing the first laser Doppler flowmeter using heterodyne signal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1754319|title=Measurement of Localized Flow Velocities in Gases with a Laser Doppler Flowmeter|date=1965|last1=Foreman|first1=J. W.|last2=George|first2=E. W.|last3=Lewis|first3=R. D.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=7|issue=4|pages=77|bibcode = 1965ApPhL...7...77F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument was soon called the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) and the technique laser Doppler velocimetry, also abbreviated LDV. Another application name is laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Early LDV applications ranged from measuring and mapping the exhaust from [[rocket engine]]s with speeds up to 1000&amp;nbsp;m/s to determining flow in a near-surface blood artery. A variety of similar instruments were developed for solid-surface monitoring, with applications ranging from measuring product speeds in production lines of [[paper mill|paper]] and [[steel mill|steel]] mills, to measuring vibration frequency and amplitude of surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watson, R. C., Jr., Lewis, R. D. and Watson, H. J. |title=Instruments for Motion Measurement Using Laser Doppler Heterodyning Techniques|journal=ISA Trans.|volume=8|issue=1|date=1969|pages=20–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating principles==
Doppler velocimeters work on the priniciple of [[Optical heterodyne detection]].

In its simplest and most presently used form, LDV crosses two beams of [[collimated light|collimated]], [[monochromatic light|monochromatic]], and [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] laser light in the flow of the fluid being measured. The two beams are usually obtained by splitting a single beam, thus ensuring coherence between the two. Lasers with wavelengths in the visible spectrum (390–750&amp;nbsp;nm) are commonly used; these are typically He-Ne, [[ion laser|Argon ion]], or [[laser diode]], allowing the beam path to be observed. A transmitting optics focuses the beams to intersect at their waists (the focal point of a laser beam), where they [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] and generate a set of straight fringes. As particles (either naturally occurring or induced) entrained in the fluid pass through the fringes, they reflect light that is then collected by a receiving optics and focused on a [[photodetector]] (typically an [[avalanche photodiode]]).

The reflected light fluctuates in intensity, the frequency of which is equivalent to the Doppler shift between the incident and scattered light, and is thus proportional to the component of particle velocity which lies in the plane of two laser beams. If the sensor is aligned to the flow such that the fringes are perpendicular to the flow direction, the electrical signal from the photodetector will then be proportional to the full particle velocity. By combining three devices (e.g.; He-Ne, Argon ion, and laser diode) with different wavelengths, all three flow velocity components can be simultaneously measured.&lt;ref&gt;Drain, L. E. (1980) ''The Laser Doppler Technique'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-27627-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of LDV, particularly used in early device developments, has a completely different approach akin to an [[interferometer]]. The sensor also splits the laser beam into two parts; one (the measurement beam) is focused into the flow and the second (the reference beam) passes outside the flow. A receiving optics provides a path that intersects the measurement beam, forming a small volume. Particles passing through this volume will scatter light from the measurement beam with a Doppler shift; a portion of this light is collected by the receiving optics and transferred to the photodetector. The reference beam is also sent to the photodetector where [[optical heterodyne detection]] produces an electrical signal proportional to the Doppler shift, by which the particle velocity component perpendicular to the plane of the beams can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Durst, F; Melling, A. and Whitelaw, J. H. (1976) ''Principles and Practice of Laser Doppler Anemometry'', Academic Press, London, {{ISBN|0-12-225250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar arrangements using optical heterodyning are also used in laser Doppler sensors for measuring the linear velocity of solids and for measuring vibrations of surfaces; the latter sensor is usually called a [[laser Doppler vibrometer]], also abbreviated LDV.

==Applications==
In the decades since the LDV was first introduced, there has been a wide variety of laser Doppler sensors developed and applied.

===Flow research===
Laser Doppler velocimetry is often chosen over other forms of [[flow measurement]] because the equipment can be outside of the flow being measured and therefore has no effect on the flow. Some typical applications include the following:
*Wind tunnel velocity experiments for testing aerodynamics of aircraft, missiles, cars, trucks, trains, and buildings and other structures
*Velocity measurements in water flows (research in general hydrodynamics, ship hull design, rotating machinery, pipe flows, channel flow, etc.).
*Fuel injection and spray research where there is a need to measure velocities inside engines or through nozzles
*Environmental research (combustion research, wave dynamics, [[coastal engineering]], tidal modeling, river hydrology, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Dantec Dynamics, [http://www.dantecdynamics.com/Default.aspx?ID=653 ”Laser Doppler Anemometry”].&lt;/ref&gt;
One disadvantage has been that LDV sensors are range-dependent; they have to be calibrated minutely and the distances where they measure has to be precisely defined. This distance restriction has recently been at least partially overcome with a new sensor that is range independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moir, Christopher I|doi=10.1117/12.819324|chapter=&lt;title&gt;Miniature laser doppler velocimetry systems&lt;/title&gt;|title=Optical Sensors 2009|series=Optical Sensors 2009|date=2009|editor1-last=Baldini|editor1-first=Francesco|editor2-last=Homola|editor2-first=Jiri|editor3-last=Lieberman|editor3-first=Robert A|volume=7356|pages=73560I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automation ===
Laser Doppler velocimetry can be useful in automation, which includes the flow examples above. It can also be used to measure the speed of solid objects, like [[conveyor belt]]s. This can be useful in situations where attaching a [[rotary encoder]] (or a different mechanical speed measurement device) to the conveyor belt is impossible or impractical.

===Medical applications===
Laser Doppler velocimetry is used in [[hemodynamics]] research as a technique to partially quantify [[blood flow]] in human tissues such as skin. Within the clinical environment, the technology is often referred to as laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The beam from a low-power laser (usually a [[laser diode]]) penetrates the skin sufficiently to be scattered with a Doppler shift by the [[red blood cell]]s and return to be concentrated on a detector. These measurements are useful to monitor the effect of exercise, drug treatments, environmental, or physical manipulations on targeted micro-sized [[vascular]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stern, Michael D.|doi=10.1364/AO.24.001968|title=Laser Doppler velocimetry in blood and multiply scattering fluids: Theory|date=1985|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|issue=13|pages=1968|pmid=18223825|bibcode = 1985ApOpt..24.1968S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laser Doppler vibrometer is being used in clinical [[otology]] for the measurement of [[eardrum|tympanic membrane]] (eardrum), [[malleus]] (hammer), and [[prosthesis]] head displacement in response to sound inputs of 80- to 100-dB [[Sound pressure level|sound-pressure level]].

The following is a list of [[state forest]]s in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. The [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] manages the largest state forest system in the nation (3.9 million acres (16,000 km²)), administered by the Forest Resources Division.  

In literature describing recreational uses of state forest lands, six state forests are identified. However, state forest lands are administered by fifteen DNR Forest Management Units (FMU).  There is no state forest land in the southern portion of the Lower Peninsula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">This is a list of [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Northumberland]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteList.aspx?countyCode=32|title=Designated Sites View - Northumberland|publisher=Natural England|website=Natural England website|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[English Nature]], the designating body for SSSIs in [[England]], uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974-1996 county system]], and this list follows the same approach. Some sites one may expect to find here could therefore be in the [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in County Durham|County Durham]] or [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Tyne and Wear|Tyne and Wear]] lists.

For other counties, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

[[File:Mount Whitney 2003-03-25.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Whitney]] is the highest summit of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[State of California]], and the [[contiguous United States]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''16 [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of the U.S. [[California|State of California]] with at least {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic elevation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.

[[Elevation|Topographic elevation]] is the vertical distance above the reference [[geoid]], a mathematical model of the Earth's [[sea level]] as an [[equipotential]] [[Gravity|gravitational]] surface.  The [[topographic prominence]] of a [[summit]] is the elevation difference between that summit and the highest or key [[col]] to a higher summit.  The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the minimum [[great-circle distance]] to a point of equal elevation.

This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  There are [[List of the ultra-prominent summits of the United States|126 ultra-prominent summits in the United States]].

All elevations include an adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].

If an elevation or prominence is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.

The '''Microvariability and Oscillations of STars''' telescope, better known simply as '''MOST''', is [[Canada]]'s first [[space telescope]]. Up until nearly 10 years after its launch it was also the smallest space telescope in orbit (for which its creators nicknamed it the "Humble Space Telescope", in reference to one of the largest, the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Strauss |first1=Stephen |title='Humble' Canadian space telescope set for launch |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/humble-canadian-space-telescope-set-for-launch/article25286724/ |accessdate=29 June 2018 |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=30 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOST is the first spacecraft dedicated to the study of [[asteroseismology]], subsequently followed by the now-completed [[COROT]] and [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] missions. It was also the first Canadian science satellite launched since [[ISIS (satellite)|ISIS II]], 32 years previously.

==Description==
As its name suggests, its primary mission is to monitor variations in star light, which it does by observing a single target for a long period of time (up to 60 days). Typically, larger space telescopes cannot afford to remain focused on a single target for so long due to the demand for their resources.

This places it in the [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellite]] category.

MOST was developed as a joint effort of the [[Canadian Space Agency]], Dynacon Enterprises Limited (now [[Www.mscinc.ca|Microsatellite Systems Canada Inc]]), the Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) at the [[University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies]], and the [[University of British Columbia]]. Led by Principal Investigator [[Jaymie Matthews]], the MOST science team's plan is to use observations from MOST to use [[asteroseismology]] to help date the age of the universe, and to search for visible-light signatures from [[extrasolar planet]]s.

MOST features an instrument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.ubc.ca/MOST/papers/walker.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226125236/http://www.astro.ubc.ca/MOST/papers/walker.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df=}} Walker et al., "The MOST Asteroseismology Mission: Ultraprecise Photometry from Space," Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific , Vol.115, No.811 (September 2003), pp.1023-1035,
[https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/377358 DOI: 10.1086/377358].&lt;/ref&gt; comprising a visible-light dual-[[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera, fed by a 15-cm aperture [[Maksutov telescope]]. One CCD gathers science images, while the other provides images used by star-tracking software that, along with a set of four reaction wheels (computer-controlled motorized flywheels that are similar to [[gyroscope]]s) maintain pointing with an error of less than 1 [[arc-second]], better pointing by far than any other microsatellite to date.

The design of the rest of MOST was inspired by and based on microsatellite bus designs pioneered by [[AMSAT]], and first brought to commercial viability by the microsatellite company [http://www.sstl.co.uk/ SSTL] (based at the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]); during the early stages of MOST development, the core group of AMSAT microsatellite satellite designers advised and mentored the MOST satellite design team, via a know-how transfer arrangement with UTIAS. This approach to satellite design is notable for making use of commercial-grade electronics, along with a "small team," "early prototyping" engineering development approach rather different from that used in most other space-engineering programs, to achieve relatively very low costs: MOST's life-cycle cost (design, build, launch and operate) is less than $10 million in Canadian funds (about 7 million [[Euro]]s or 6 million [[USD]], at exchange rates at time of launch).

==Operation history==
Development of the satellite was managed by the [[Canadian Space Agency]]'s Space Science Branch, and was funded under its Small Payloads Program; its operations are currently (as of 2012) managed by the CSA's Space Exploration Branch. It is operated by SFL (where the primary MOST ground station is located) jointly with Microsat Systems Canada Inc. (since the sale of Dynacon's space division to MSCI in 2008). As of ten years after launch, despite failures of two of its components (one of the four reaction wheels and one of the two CCD driver boards), the satellite is still operating well, as a result of both on-going on-board software upgrades as well as built-in hardware redundancy, allowing improvements to performance and to reconfigure around failed hardware units.

In 2008, the MOST Satellite Project Team won the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute's Alouette Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casi.ca/assets/docs/alouette_recipients_2011.pdf The Alouette Award, The recipients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514125500/http://www.casi.ca/assets/docs/alouette_recipients_2011.pdf |date=14 May 2012 }} Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute website, retrieved 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://utias-sfl.net/?p=39 MOST Team Wins Alouette Award 2008] UTIAS SFL website.&lt;/ref&gt; which recognizes outstanding contributions to advancement in Canadian space technology, applications, science or engineering.

===Termination of operations funding by CSA===
On 30 April 2014, the Canadian Space Agency announced that funding to continue operating MOST would be withdrawn as of 9 September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2014/0430.asp CSA announces termination of MOST operations funding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506234332/http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2014/0430.asp |date=6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently as a result of funding cuts to the Canadian Space Agency's budget by the Harper government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/most-space-telescope-eyes-crowdfunding-to-stay-in-orbit-1.2629994 CBC story, "MOST space telescope eyes crowdfunding to stay in orbit"]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the satellite continues to be fully operational and capable of making on-going science observations. P.I. Jaymie Matthews responded by saying that "he will consider all options to keep the satellite in orbit, and that includes a direct appeal to the public."

===Current operations===
In October 2014, the MOST Satellite was acquired by Microsatellite Systems Canada Inc. (MSCI), who has operated the satellite since launch in 2003. MSCI engineers have monitored the satellite's health over the years and have performed numerous upgrades to the software.  MSCI has commenced commercial operation of the satellite and offers a variety of potential uses including continuing the original MOST mission in partnership with Dr. Matthews, but also other planetary studies, attitude control system algorithm R&amp;D, and Earth observation.  MSCI is also the prime contractor for the NEOSSat spacecraft.

==Discoveries==
The MOST team has reported a number of discoveries.  In 2004 they reported that the star [[Procyon]] does not oscillate to the extent that had been expected,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/most/most_discovery.asp CSA - Small Satellite Makes Big Discovery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been [[Procyon#Oscillations controversy|disputed]].&lt;ref name=nature432_7015&gt;{{citation |display-authors=1 |last1=Bouchy |first1=François |last2=Maeder |first2=Andreé |last3=Mayor |first3=Michel |last4=Mégevand |first4=Denis |last5=Pepe |first5=Francesco |last6=Sosnowska |first6=Danuta |title=Brief Communications Arising: Oscillations on the star Procyon |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7015 |pages=2 |date=2004 |bibcode=2004Natur.432....2B |doi=10.1038/nature03165 |pmid=15568216 |arxiv=astro-ph/0510303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa432&gt;{{citation |display-authors=1 |last1=Bedding |first1=T.

In 2006 observations revealed a previously unknown class of variable stars, the "slowly pulsating B supergiants" (''SPBsg'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606712 [astro-ph/0606712&amp;#93; Most Detects G- and P-Modes in the B Supergiant HD 163899 (B2Ib/II)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, MOST detected transits by exoplanet [[55 Cancri e]] of its primary star, based on two weeks of nearly continuous photometric monitoring, confirming an earlier detection of this planet, and allowing investigations into the planet's composition.

'''Mineralization''' in [[soil science]] is the [[decomposition]], i. e. [[oxidation]], of the [[chemical compound]]s in [[organic matter]], by which the nutrients in those compounds are released in soluble inorganic forms that may be available to [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Mineralization is the opposite of [[Immobilization (soil science)|immobilization]].

Mineralization increases the  [[bioavailability]] of the nutrients that were in the decomposing organic compounds, most notably, because of their quantities, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]]. Whether the decomposition of an organic compound will result in mineralization or immobilization is dependent on its concentration proportionate to that of the carbon in the organic matter. If the concentration of a specific element  exceeds the needs of the decomposer for [[biosynthesis]] or storage then it will mineralize.

==Ratio of carbon to nitrogen==

Whether [[nitrogen]] mineralizes or immobilizes depends on the [[carbon-to-nitrogen ratio]] (C:N ratio) of the decomposing [[organic matter]].&lt;ref&gt;R.G. McLaren &amp; K. Cameron ''Soil Science: Sustainable production and environmental protection'' (2nd edition), Oxford University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-19-558345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general organic matter contacting soil has too little nitrogen to support the biosynthetic needs of the decomposing [[Soil biology|soil microbial population]]. If the C:N ratio of the decomposing organic matter is above circa 30:1 then the decomposing microbes may absorb nitrogen in mineral form as, e. g., [[ammonium]] or [[nitrate]]s. This mineral nitrogen is said to be immobilized. This may reduce the concentration of inorganic nitrogen in the soil and thus the nitrogen available to plants.

As [[carbon dioxide]] is released during the generation of energy in decomposition, a process denominated "[[catabolism]]", the C:N ratio of the organic matter decreases. When the C:N ratio is less than circa 25:1, further decomposition causes mineralization by the simultaneous release of inorganic nitrogen as [[ammonium]]. When the decomposition of organic matter is complete, the mineralized nitrogen therefrom adds to that already present in the soil, and therefore increases the total mineral nitrogen in the soil.

The '''Muskwa-Slave Lake forests''' is a [[taiga]] [[ecoregion]] in [[Canada]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion is located in northwestern [[Alberta]], northeastern [[British Columbia]] and a large portion of the southwestern [[Northwest Territories]] around the [[Mackenzie River]] valley and the [[Great Slave Lake]] for which the ecoregion is named. Specific areas include the boreal forest to the east of the MacKenzie (between [[Mackenzie Mountains|Mackenzie]] and [[Franklin Mountains (Northwest Territories)|Franklin Mountains]]; the land along the [[Horn River]] west to the Mackenzie; the [[Liard River]] basin; and the [[Caribou Mountains (Alberta)|Caribou Mountains]] in north-central Alberta.  

The landscape consists of wide, flat plains and lowlands broken by low mountains and plateaus, such as the Caribou Mountains. Almost half of the area is covered in [[wetland]]s and [[bog]]s such as [[Zama Lake]] in Alberta. The ecoregion is in the zone of discontinuous permafrost and has a [[subarctic climate]], with summer temperatures averaging around {{convert|12.5|°C|°F}}, and winter temperatures averaging from {{convert|-18|°C|°F}} to {{convert|-24.5|°C|°F}}. Annual average temperatures are between {{convert|-2.0|°C|°F}} and {{convert|-6.5|°C|°F}}. Precipitation is moderately low, averaging between {{convert|250|mm|in}} and {{convert|500|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0610|name=Muskwa-Slave Lake forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Vegetation consists mainly of dense forests of trembling aspen (''[[Populus tremuloides]]''), white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'') and balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]''), with smaller populations of balsam poplar (''[[Populus balsamifera]]''), black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]'') and [[birch]].

==Fauna==
This ecoregion is rich in wildlife including large herds (numbering in the thousands) of [[Migratory Woodland Caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus caribou'') and other large mammals such as [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[Wood Bison]] (''Bison bison athabascae'') ([[Wood Buffalo National Park]] is in this region), [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis'') and [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemonius'') along with smaller animals such as [[snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus''). The predators that feed on all this wildlife include [[Canada Lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis''), [[grizzly bear]] (''Ursos arctos horriblus''), [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus'') and [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''). Birds include the [[waterfowl]] of the many wetlands along with prairie birds such as [[grouse]].

==Threats and preservation==
This ecoregion is well preserved, with an estimated 75% intact. Protected areas include western parts of Wood Buffalo National Park in [[Northern Alberta]] the south-central Northwest Territories, and [[Maxhamish Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area]] in northeastern British Columbia. Logging is the greatest threat to the region's ecological integrity along with potential for mining, the effect of the [[Mackenzie Highway]] and oil pipelines.

Research projects include:

*Boron nitride nano tubes (BNNT) research and development for aerospace and public safety applications. In collaboration with NASA Langley, and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, NIA has developed a neutron shielding material  using boron-containing nanomaterials, which include boron nanoparticles, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), and boron nitride nano-platelets, as well as the polymer composites thereof. This is proposed for advanced radiation shielding and for shielding against high kinetic energy penetrators (i.e. bulletproof vests, protection against micrometeoroids, etc.)&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://technologygateway.nasa.gov/docs/TOA_LARC107_Radiation4.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Field research in the Republic of Tyva in Siberia to validate satellite studies that show longer periods of drought have strengthened the intensity of fires. Amber Soja, NIA Senior Research Scientist based at NASA’s Langley Researcher Center, conducted research that has shown that these more destructive fires have started to impair the growth of pine-dominated forests after fires and are causing some pine forest areas to transition to steppe that stores far less carbon from the atmosphere.  Likewise, the research shows that the burns cause more destruction when they occur. According to Soja, in other areas where precipitation is limited to begin with, such as the savannas of Australia, longer droughts might actually reduce the number of wildfires because less vegetation would be available to burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voiland|first=Adam|title=A Look Back at a Decade of Fires|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/fires/main/modis-10.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nato wood''' is a collective name for wood from ''[[Mora (plant)|Mora]]'' trees (the best-known species are ''Mora excelsa'' (Mora) and ''Mora gonggrijpii'' (Morabukea). This should not be confused with [[Nyatoh]] (an Asian hardwood from the [[Sapotaceae]] family with a very similar look and characteristic to [[Honduras Mahogany]], though totally unrelated).

Mora may vary in appearance, with reddish brown being the dominant color, but with varying shades and often with darker or lighter streaks. It has a similar appearance to [[mahogany]], and as such it is often referred to as "eastern mahogany". Despite this, the two are unrelated. The [[heartwood]] is light to medium reddish brown. Wide pale yellow-brown sapwood is clearly demarcated from heartwood. It has a straight to interlocked grain, with a medium to coarse texture and good natural luster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mora {{!}} The Wood Database – Lumber Identification (Hardwoods)|url=http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/mora/|publisher=wood-database.com|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wood is dense and it is not particularly easy to dry or to work, although it finishes well.

The '''Neolithic Subpluvial''', or the '''Holocene Wet Phase''', was an extended period (from about 7500–7000 BCE to about 3500–3000 BCE) of wet and rainy conditions in the [[climate]] history of northern Africa. It was both preceded and followed by much drier periods.

The Neolithic Subpluvial was the most recent of a number of periods of "'''Wet Sahara'''" or "'''Green Sahara'''", during which the Sahara region was much moister and supported a richer [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] and human population than the present-day [[desert]].

== Date ranges ==

The [[Neolithic]] Subpluvial began during the [[7th millennium BC|7th millennium BCE]] and was strong for about 2,000 years; it waned over time and ended after the [[5.9 kiloyear event]] (3900 BCE). Then the drier conditions that prevailed prior to the Neolithic Subpluvial returned; [[desertification]] advanced, and the [[Sahara Desert]] formed (or re-formed). Arid conditions have continued through to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Sources differ on specific date ranges, which necessarily varied over such a wide geographic expanse. One (Bard, Kathryn A. (1999), ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt.'' London, Routledge, pg 863) gives "9000&amp;ndash;5000 BP," or 7000&amp;ndash;3000 BCE, for the duration of the subpluvial. Another (Wilkinson, Toby A. H. (1999), ''Early Dynastic Egypt.'' London, Routledge, pg 372) places the end of the subpluvial c. 3300 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and hydrography ==

During the Neolithic Subpluvial, large areas of [[North Africa|North]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[East Africa]] had [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] profiles significantly different from later norms. Existing lakes had surfaces tens of meters higher than today, sometimes with alternative drainages: [[Lake Turkana]], in present-day [[Kenya]], drained into the [[Nile River]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloszies|first=C.|last2=Forman|first2=S. L.|last3=Wright|first3=D.

Some shallower lakes and river systems existed in the subpluvial era that later disappeared entirely, and are detectable today only via [[radar]] and [[satellite imagery]].

The event is argued to have ended quickly in some places&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=deMenocal|first=Peter|last2=Ortiz|first2=Joseph|last3=Guilderson|first3=Tom|last4=Adkins|first4=Jess|last5=Sarnthein|first5=Michael|last6=Baker|first6=Linda|last7=Yarusinsky|first7=Martha|date=2000-01-01|title=Abrupt onset and termination of the African Humid Period:: rapid climate responses to gradual insolation forcing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379199000815|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=19|issue=1–5|pages=347–361|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(99)00081-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more slowly in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589402923562|title=Late Quaternary Climate and Vegetation of the Sudanian Zone of Northeast Nigeria - ScienceDirect|language=en|access-date=2017-03-10|doi=10.1006/qres.2002.2356|volume=58|issue=1|journal=Quaternary Research|pages=73–83 | last1 = Salzmann | first1 = Ulrich|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lézine|first=Anne-Marie|last2=Hély|first2=Christelle|last3=Grenier|first3=Christophe|last4=Braconnot|first4=Pascale|last5=Krinner|first5=Gerhard|date=2011-10-01|title=Sahara and Sahel vulnerability to climate changes, lessons from Holocene hydrological data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379111002101|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=30|issue=21–22|pages=3001–3012|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2011.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local feedbacks between vegetation and the atmosphere may explain the variability in the records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kutzbach|first=J.E.|year=1996|title=Potential role of vegetation feedback in the climate sensitivity of high-latitude regions : A case study at 6000 years B.P.|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2511027|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=10|issue=4|pages=|issn=0886-6236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agents of initial devegetation are unknown since they seem to occur rapidly in some areas and slowly in others, out of phase with changing [[Apsidal precession|orbital precession]].{{Clarification needed|date=July 2018}} The introduction of domesticated animals correlates in many places to a rapid change from grassland to scrubland vegetation, and it is hypothesized that [[Neolithic]] humans may have potentially played a role in stripping vegetation from the landscape, which induced cascading effects to the ecosystem and climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=David K.|date=26 January 2017|title=Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period|journal=Frontiers in Earth Science|language=English|volume=5|pages=|doi=10.3389/feart.2017.00004|issn=2296-6463}}&lt;/ref&gt; For thousands of years, the Sahara ecosystem supported rich and varied flora and fauna, as well as large populations of [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]]. Researchers in 2018 demonstrated through a climate-vegetation model that abundant biota persisted longer than expected in regions where ancient pastoral societies once flourished, concluding that pastoral environment management contributed to regional delays of up to 500 years in the advancement of the Sahara's desertification between 6000 and 7000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brierley|first=Chris|last2=Manning|first2=Katie|last3=Maslin|first3=Mark|date=1 October 2018|title=Pastoralism may have delayed the end of the green Sahara|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06321-y|journal=[[Nature Communications]]|volume=9|issue=1|pages=4018|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06321-y|pmid=30275473|pmc=6167352|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==

North Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a [[savanna]] type of ecosystem, with [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the [[Sahel]] region south of the desert, along with some now extinct [[megafauna]] such as ''[[Sivatherium]]'' and ''[[Pelorovis]]''. Historian and Africanist [[Roland Oliver]] has described the scene as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] the highlands of the central Sahara Desert beyond the [[Libyan Desert]],... in the great [[massif]]s of the [[Tibesti]] and the [[Hoggar]], the mountaintops, today bare rock, were covered at this period with forests of [[oak]] and [[walnut]], [[Tilia|lime]], [[alder]] and [[elm]]. The lower slopes, together with those of the supporting bastions — the [[Tassili]] and the [[Tadrart Acacus|Acacus]] to the north, [[Ennedi]] and [[Aïr Mountains|Air]] to the south — carried [[olive]], [[juniper]] and [[Aleppo pine]]. In the valleys, perennially flowing rivers teemed with fish and were bordered by seed-bearing grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Oliver|Oliver, Roland]] (1999), ''The African Experience: From Olduvai Gorge to the 21st Century'' (Series: History of Civilization), London: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|Phoenix Press]], revised edition, pg 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Cultures ==

{{Main|Prehistoric North Africa}}

Clement and fertile conditions during the Neolithic Subpluvial supported increased human settlement of the Nile Valley in [[Egypt]], as well as [[neolithic]] societies in [[Sudan]] and throughout the present-day Sahara. Cultures producing [[Saharan rock art|rock art]] (notably that at [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] in southeastern [[Algeria]]) flourished during this period.

The practical consequences of these changes took the form of increased abundance of fish, waterfowl, freshwater mollusks, rodents, hippopotamus and crocodiles. The riches of this increased aquatic biomass were exploited by humans with rafts, boats, weirs, traps, harpoons, nets, hooks, lines and sinkers. This "riparian" (river) way of life supported much larger communities than could that of typical hunting bands.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, pg 37.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, along with the local development of pottery (whereby liquids could be both stored and heated) resulted in a "culinary revolution" consisting of soup, fish stew and [[porridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sutton | first1 = John E.G. | year = 1974 | title = The Aquatic Civilization of Middle Africa | url = | journal = [[Journal of African History]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 527–546 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700013864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last mentioned implies the cooking of gathered cereals.

The classic account of the riparian lifestyle of this period comes from investigations in Sudan during World War II by British archeologist [[Anthony Arkell]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, A.J. (1949), ''Early Khartoum'', [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Arkell's report described a Late Stone Age settlement on a sandbank of the [[Blue Nile]] which was then about {{convert|12|ft}} higher than its present flood stage. The countryside was clearly savanna, not the present-day desert, as evidenced by the bones of the most common species found in the middens — antelope, which require large expanses of seed-bearing grasses. These people probably lived mainly on fish, however, and Arkell concluded, based on the totality of the evidence, that rainfall at the time was at least three times that of today. The physical characteristics derived from skeletal remains suggested that these people were related to modern [[Nilotic]] peoples, such as the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and [[Dinka]]. Subsequent radiocarbon dating firmly established Arkell's site to between 7000 and 5000 BCE. Based on common patterns at his site and at French-excavated sites already reported from [[Chad]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] (e.g., bone harpoons and a characteristic "wavy line" pottery), Arkell inferred "a common fishing and hunting culture spread by negroid people right across Africa at about the latitude of [[Khartoum]] at a time when the climate was so different that it was not desert." The originators of the wavy line pottery are as yet unidentified.

In the 1960s, the archeologist [[Gabriel Camps]] investigated the remains of a hunting and fishing community dating from about 6700 BCE in southern [[Algeria]]. These pottery-making people (the "wavy line" motif again) were black African rather than Mediterranean in origin and (according to Camps) evidenced definite signs of deliberate cultivation of grain crops as opposed to simply the gathering of wild grains.&lt;ref&gt;Camps, Gabriel (1974), ''Les civilisation prehistoriques de l'Afrique du Nord et du Sahara'', Paris, pp 22 and 225–226. The site is [[Amekni]] near [[Tamanrasset]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies at the site have shown the culture to be hunter-gatherers and not agriculturalists, as all the grains were morphologically wild, and the society was not sedentary.

Human remains were found by archaeologists in 2000 at a site known as [[Gobero]] in the [[Ténéré|Ténéré Desert]] of northeastern [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="scidaily"&gt;{{cite web

Dotted wavy line pottery and fishing cultures have also been located in the [[Lake Turkana]] region in poorly dated contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=David K.|last2=Forman|first2=Steven L.|last3=Kiura|first3=Purity|last4=Bloszies|first4=Christopher|last5=Beyin|first5=Amanuel|date=2015-06-01|title=Lakeside View: Sociocultural Responses to Changing Water Levels of Lake Turkana, Kenya|journal=African Archaeological Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=335–367|doi=10.1007/s10437-015-9185-8|issn=0263-0338}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3000 BCE, it does not appear that the [[Turkana Basin]] was populated with harpoon and dotted wavy line pottery users, but fishing remained an important part of peoples' diets into the late Holocene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Nephele''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|f|ə|l|i}}; {{lang-el|Νεφέλη}}, from νέφος ''nephos'' "cloud";&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]]ized to ''Nubes'') was a cloud [[nymph]] who figured prominently in the story of [[Phrixus]] and [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#20 Hyginus (Mary Grant translation): The Ram], ([[Aries (constellation)|Aries]])&lt;/ref&gt; Nephele was also the goddess of hospitality.

== Mythology ==
Greek myth also has it that Nephele is the cloud whom [[Zeus]] created in the image of [[Hera]] to trick [[Ixion]] to test his integrity after displaying his lust for Hera during a feast as a guest of Zeus. Ixion failed in restraining his lust for Hera, thus fathering the [[Centaur]]s.

Nephele married [[Athamas]], but he divorced her for [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]]. [[Phrixus]] and [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the son and daughter of Athamas and Nephele, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby [[oracle]] for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Before he was killed though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother.

Phrixus and Helle were instructed to not look down to Earth for the duration of their flight. Helle, though, did look down, and fell off the ram into the [[Hellespont]] (which was named after her, meaning ''Sea of Helle'') and drowned, but Phrixus survived all the way to [[Colchis]], where King [[Aeetes]] took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, [[Chalciope]], in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the [[Golden Fleece]] of the ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom. The Golden Fleece would later be taken by [[Jason]] and his [[Argonauts]].{{Greek myth (nymph)}}

The '''PDC Order of Merit''' is a world ranking system used by one of the darts organisations, the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC). Following the [[2007 PDC World Darts Championship]] it superseded a world ranking system based on points being awarded for performances in ranking tournaments.

==How it works==
The Order of Merit is similar to that employed in golf's [[PGA European Tour|European Tour]]. Prize money won during the previous two seasons is calculated and the rankings are determined from this money list.
The Professional Darts Corporation adopted an Order of Merit system in 2007, which is based on prize money won over two years for the main Order of Merit and separate one-year rankings for other PDC Pro Tour events.

==PDC Top 32 Order of Merit==
{{PDC Order of Merit}}

==PDC ProTour Order of Merit==
The ProTour Order of Merit counts prize money won in Players Championship events, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events over a 12-month period. Players are seeded based on the ProTour Order of Merit to all Player Championship and European Tour events. It also is a main way to qualify to the major TV tournaments.

* The top 16 players in the ProTour Order of Merit not already qualified gain entry to the [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]].
* The top 16 players in the ProTour Order of Merit not already qualified gain entry to the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]].
* The top 32 players in the ProTour Order of Merit not already qualified gain entry to the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]].

Besides ProTour Order of Merit there is also the Players Championship Order of Merit and the European Tour Order of Merit. Both of these are based solely on the prize money won in that year's Players Championship or European Tour events respectively. The top 64 players on the Players Championship Order of Merit after the last Player Championship event are the only qualifiers to the [[Players Championship Finals]]. The top 32 players on the European Tour Order of Merit after the last European Tour event are the only qualifiers to the [[European Championship (darts)|European Championship]].

==Player exemptions==
The PDC rankings determine exemptions from the qualifying competitions from each major event:
*The top 16 in '''early July''' get an automatic entry to the first round of the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]] &lt;small&gt;(as a seeded player)&lt;/small&gt;.
*The top 16 in '''late September''' get an automatic entry to the first round of the [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] &lt;small&gt;(top-8 as seeded players)&lt;/small&gt;.
*The top 32 in '''early December''' get an automatic entry to the first round of the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]] &lt;small&gt;(as a seeded player)&lt;/small&gt;.
*The top 4 '''after the World Championship''' get an automatic entry to the [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]].

==Televised Ranking Tournaments==
There is often a lot of confusion with televised tournaments and knowing which ones count towards the PDC Order of Merit. While a lot of televised tournaments are ranked, some are not, usually due to the tournament in question having restricted places e.g.  Premier League.

==Previous world ranking system==
Under the previous ranking points system, [[Colin Lloyd]] was the world number one player in the PDC for most of 2005 and 2006, despite most of the major titles being shared between [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]], [[Raymond van Barneveld]] and [[John Part]]. Although Lloyd also won two major titles, he often accumulated ranking points in the less prestigious non-televised events, in which Taylor did not always compete. Similarly, Alan Warriner was world number one on four separate occasions before ever winning his first and only PDC major, the 2001 Grand Prix, while Taylor won eight world championships and a host of other titles during that period.

==First WDC/PDC rankings==
Following the [[Professional Darts Corporation|World Darts Council]] (now PDC) split from the [[British Darts Organisation]] during 1992-94 the WDC drew up its first ranking list in the run-up to its inaugural [[1994 PDC World Darts Championship|1994 World Championship]]. [[Mike Gregory (darts player)|Mike Gregory]] and [[Chris Johns (darts player)|Chris Johns]] later went back to the BDO set up and [[Bobby George]] and many of the non-UK players never competed in the early days of the WDC.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Peatland rewetting significantly reduces environmental impacts caused by drainage.

==Arguments for the preservation of peatlands, and cultivation of crops thereon==
* Due to the drainage of soils in many areas (for agricultural purposes), the soil height has dropped significantly over the years, and water quality has lowered as well. By making these areas wetter again, these problems are corrected to a large extent. As such, they can avoid the need of installations against [[rising sea level]]s ([[levee]]s, pumps)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landschapnoordholland.nl/project/omhoog-met-het-veen Omhoog met het veen]&lt;/ref&gt;
* By making soils waterlogged, carbon is unable to bind to oxygen, and hence will not escape into the atmosphere as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, January 2017, De voordelen van natte akkers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Leon Lamers, one hectare of drained marshland emits 20 to 25 tons of CO2 per year&lt;/ref&gt;
* The preservation of the remaining peatlands is important for [[biodiversity]].
* The growing of crops extracts [[phosphate]] from the land, which is important in wetlands; it also helps to extract other nutrients from water, making it suitable for [[post-water treatment]] purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Collaboration-and-partnerships/CALM/research-1/freshwater.ecosystems.htm This purpose was demonstrated in the Aquafarm project by Wageningen University]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''perfect storm''' is an event in which a rare combination of circumstances drastically aggravates the event.&lt;ref name="Rts20080101"/&gt; The term is used by analogy to an unusually severe [[storm]] that results from a rare combination of [[Meteorology|meteorological phenomena]].

==Origin==
The Oxford English Dictionary has published references going back to 1718 for "perfect storm", though the earliest citations use the phrase in the sense of "absolute" or "complete", or for emphasis, as in "a perfect stranger".

The phrase appears in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'':
{{cquote|I have heard a brother of the story-telling trade at Naples preaching to a pack of good-for-nothing honest, lazy fellows by the sea-shore, work himself up into such a rage and passion with some of the villains whose wicked deeds he was describing and inventing, that the audience could not resist it; and they and the poet together would burst out into a roar of oaths and execrations against the fictitious monster of the tale, so that the hat went round, and the bajocchi tumbled into it, in the midst of a perfect storm of sympathy.||author=William Makepeace Thackeray|source=Vanity Fair}}

The first use of the expression in the meteorological sense comes from the March 20, 1936, issue of the ''Port Arthur News'' in Texas: "The weather bureau describes the disturbance as "the perfect storm" of its type. Seven factors were involved in the chain of circumstances that led to "the flood".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=May 8th, 2008 |url=http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2008/05/the-imperfect-storm.html |title=The Grammarphobia Blog: The imperfect storm |publisher=Grammarphobia.com |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, journalist and author [[Sebastian Junger]] planned to write a book about the [[1991 Perfect Storm|1991 Halloween Nor'easter]] storm. Technically, this storm was an [[extratropical cyclone]]. In the course of his research, he spoke with [[Robert Case|Bob Case]], who had been a deputy [[meteorologist]] in the Boston office of the [[National Weather Service]] at the time of the [[storm]]. Case described to Junger the confluence of three different weather-related phenomena that combined to create what Case referred to as the "perfect situation" to generate such a storm:
* warm air from a low-pressure system coming from one direction
* a flow of cool and dry air generated by a high-pressure from another direction
* tropical moisture provided by [[Hurricane Grace (1991)|Hurricane Grace]]

From that, Junger keyed on Case's use of the word ''perfect'' and coined the phrase ''perfect storm'', choosing to use ''The Perfect Storm'' as the title of his book.

Junger published his book ''[[The Perfect Storm (book)|The Perfect Storm]]'' in 1997 and its success brought the phrase into popular culture. Its adoption was accelerated with the release of the [[The Perfect Storm (film)|2000 feature film adaptation]] of Junger's book.
Since the release of the movie, the phrase has grown to mean any event where a situation is aggravated drastically by an exceptionally rare combination of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Rts20080101"/&gt; 
 
Although the [[1991 Perfect Storm|1991 Halloween Nor'easter]] was a powerful storm by any measure, there have been other storms that have exceeded its strength. 
According to Case, the type of convergence of weather events to which he was referring, while unusual, is not exceptionally rare or unique, despite the way the phrase is commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;(2000, June 29). "[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/06/000628101549.htm Meteorologists Say "Perfect Storm" "(Not So Perfect)", ''[[Science Daily]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, James. (2000, July 6). "[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/movies/ps/psname.htm The naming of ("The Perfect Storm"), ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term "perfect storm" is nearly synonymous with "worst-case scenario", although the latter carries more of a hypothetical connotation.

"Perfect storm" has also been used as a metaphor for a relationship such as in the popular hit songs "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]" by [[Katy Perry]], "[[Blank Space (Taylor Swift song)|Blank Space]]" by [[Taylor Swift]], "[[Perfect Storm (song)|Perfect Storm]]" by [[Brad Paisley]], "[[Invincible (Kelly Clarkson song)|Invincible]]" by [[Kelly Clarkson]], and "[[Should've Been Us]]" by [[Tori Kelly]].

From the beginning, the phrase was in heavy use during the [[financial crisis of 2007–2012]], even to the point of pundits anticipating "another perfect storm".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.moneymanagement.com.au/article/Prepare-for-another-perfect-storm/520467.aspx Prepare for another perfect storm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727211443/http://www.moneymanagement.com.au/article/prepare-for-another-perfect-storm/520467.aspx |date=2010-07-27 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was awarded the top prize by [[Lake Superior State University]] in their 2007 list of words that deserve to be banned for overuse.&lt;ref name="Rts20080101"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0160393320080101 |title=Wordsmiths, avoid these words. |publisher=Reuters |author=Andrew Stern |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fertilize the [[Field (agriculture)|fields]], pieces of heath or grass including roots and [[humus]] ("plaggen") were cut and used as bedding for cattle. In springtime, this bedding, enriched with [[slurry]] was then spread over the fields near the village as [[manure]]. The long term practice of this form of agriculture created a rich agricultural soil to a depth of between 40 [[centimeter|cm]] and over 1.50 m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/soil-agriculture/soil-science/soil-of-the-year|title=2013 Soil of the Year: plaggic anthrosol|publisher=Umweltbundesamt}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike modern arable soils, which tend to be just 30&amp;nbsp;centimetres deep. The raised fields give rise to a typical landscape with sharp breaks in elevation and are called '''Plaggenesche''' in Germany or ''Es'' in Dutch. This form of agriculture stopped around 1900 with the introduction of [[fertilizer]]s.

In [[Orkney]] these soils were created already in the 12th to 13th centuries, and on some islands in [[Shetland]] these methods continued to be used until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson Donald A. and Stephen P. Carter. ''Micromorphological Evidence of Past Agricultural Practices in Cultivated Soils: The Impact of a Traditional Agricultural System on Soils in Papa Stour, Shetland''. Department of Environmental Science, University of Stirling, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maori of New Zealand's agriculture included plaggen soil forming practices that increased drainage for [[sweet potato|kumara]] crops.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/17360/plaggen-soils&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Blob was first detected in the autumn of 2013 and the early months of 2014 by [[Nicholas Bond (Climatologist)|Nicholas Bond]] of the [[Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean]] of the [[University of Washington]], and his colleagues, when a large circular body of sea-water did not cool as expected and remained much warmer than the average normal temperatures for that location and season.&lt;ref name="CNN-22Apr15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/22/us/pacific-ocean-blob/ |title=Blob of warm Pacific water threatens ecosystem, may intensify drought |author1=Almasy, Steve |author2=Hennen, Dave |author3=Gray, Jennifer  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=22 April 2015 |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond, who is the State Climatologist for Washington, coined the term "The Blob", with the term  first appearing in an article in the monthly newsletter of the [[Office of the Washington State Climatologist]] for June 2014.&lt;ref name="OWSC-03Jun14"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=Nicholas |last2= |first2= |title=The Blob: Warm Water off the Coast of the PNW and What it May Mean for Our Summer Weather - A message from the State Climatologist |journal=Monthly newsletter |publisher=Office of the Washington State Climatologist |date= 3 June 2014  |pages=2–4 |url=http://www.climate.washington.edu/newsletter/2014Jun.pdf |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A NOAA scientist noted in September 2014, based on ocean temperature records, that the North Pacific Ocean had not previously experienced temperatures so warm since climatologists began taking recordings.&lt;ref name="NFSCNorthPacFoodChain"/&gt;
&lt;!--Please add info about the disappearance of the blob--&gt;

==Cause==
The immediate cause of the phenomenon is the lower than normal rates of heat loss from the sea to the atmosphere, compounded with lower than usual water circulation resulting in a static upper layer of water. Both of these are attributed to a static high pressure region in the atmosphere, termed the [[Ridiculously Resilient Ridge]], which has existed since spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morin|first1=Monte|title=Wedge of warm seawater known as 'the blob' blamed for marine havoc|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-wetter-days-20150419-story.html|accessdate=17 October 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of air movement impacts the wind-forced currents and the wind-generated stirring of surface waters. These in turn have influenced the weather in the Pacific Northwest from the winter of 2013–2014 onwards and may have been associated with the unusually hot summer experienced in the continental Pacific Northwest in 2014.&lt;ref name="Bond2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bond, Nicholas A. |author2=Cronin, Meghan F. |author3=Freeland, Howard |author4=Mantua, Nathan |year=2015 |title=Causes and Impacts of the 2014 Warm Anomaly in the NE Pacific |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1002/2015GL063306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the phenomenon is unclear. Some experts consider that the wedge of warm water portends a cyclical change with the surface waters of the mid-latitude Pacific Ocean flipping from a cold phase to a warm phase in a cycle known as the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]] (PDO).&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt; This poorly-understood change happens at irregular intervals of years or decades. During a warm phase, the west Pacific becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms; during the cool phase, these changes reverse.&lt;ref name="Mantua1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mantua |first=Nathan J. |last2=Hare |first2=Steven R. |last3=Zhang |first3=Yuan |last4=Wallace |first4=John M. |last5=Francis |first5=Robert C. |year=1997 |title=A Pacific interdecadal climate oscillation with impacts on salmon production |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=1069–1079 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078&lt;1069:APICOW&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists believe a cold phase started in the late 1990s and the arrival of the Blob may be the start of the next warm phase. The PDO phases may also be related to the likelihood of [[El Niño|El Nino]] events.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt;

NASA climatologist William Patzert predicts that if the PDO is at work here, there will be widespread climatological consequences and southern California and the American South may be in for a period of high precipitation, with an increase in the rate of [[global warming]]. Another climatologist, Matt Newman of the [[University of Colorado]], does not think the Blob fits the pattern of a shift in the PDO. He believes the unusually warm water is due to the persistent area of high pressure stationary over the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Dan Cayan of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] is unsure about the ultimate cause of the phenomenon, but states "there's no doubt that this anomaly in sea surface temperature is very meaningful".&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt;

==Effects==
===Marine life===
Sea surface temperature anomalies are a physical indicator which adversely affect the [[zooplankton]] (mainly [[copepod]]s) in the Northeast Pacific and specifically in the Coastal Upwelling Domain. Warm waters are much less nutrient-rich than the cold upwelling waters which were the norm till recently off the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name="NFSC"/&gt; This results in reduced [[phytoplankton]] productivity with knock on effects on the zooplankton which feed on it and the higher levels of the food chain.&lt;ref name="Bond2015"/&gt; The Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Seattle has predicted reduced catches of [[Coho salmon|coho]] and [[Chinook salmon]], a major contributing factor being the raised temperatures of seawater in the Blob.&lt;ref name="NFSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fe/estuarine/oeip/g-forecast.cfm |title=Forecast of Adult Returns for Coho salmon and Chinook Salmon (2014-2016) |publisher=Northwest Fisheries Science Center |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon catches in 2015 have dropped as the fish migrated away having found low levels of zooplankton.&lt;ref name="CNN-22Apr15"/&gt; Thousands of sea lion pups are starving in California leading to forced beachings.&lt;ref name="NatGeo-11Apr15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150411-Pacific-ocean-sea-lions-birds-climate-warming-drought/ |title=Warming Pacific Makes for Increasingly Weird Ocean Life |author=Welch, Craig |date=11 April 2015 |publisher=National Geographic.com |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thousands of [[Cassin's auklet]]s in Oregon have starved due to lack of food.&lt;ref name="NatGeo-11Apr15"/&gt;

In addition, animals which favour warm waters and which have never been seen as far north as Alaska, have been spotted, examples being the warm water [[thresher shark]]s (''Alopias'' spp) and [[ocean sunfish]] (''Mola mola'').&lt;ref name="NFSCNorthPacFoodChain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unusual North Pacific warmth jostles marine food chain |author=Milstein, Michael |date=September 2014 |website=Northwest Fisheries Science Center |url=http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/news/features/food_chain/index.cfm |accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo-11Apr15"/&gt; In the spring of 2016, acres of [[Velella velella]] were reported in the waters south of the Copper River Delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://alaskapacificblob.wordpress.com/2016/05/20/field-report-sailors-by-the-wind-jellies-spotted-in-the-northern-portion-of-the-gulf-of-alaska-just-south-of-the-copper-river-delta/|title=Field Report: Sailors by the Wind Jellies Spotted In the northern portion of the Gulf of Alaska, Just South of the Copper River Delta|author=Janzen, Carol |date=20 May 2016|publisher=Alaska Ocean Observing System|accessdate= 21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of a [[skipjack tuna]] (''Katsuwonus pelamis''), primarily a fish of warm tropical waters, off [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]], in Alaska, {{convert|200|mi|km}} north of the previous geographic limit, and a  dead sooty storm-petrel (''Oceanodroma tristrami''), a species native to Northern Asia and Hawaii, along with a few [[brown booby|brown boobies]] (''Sula leucogaster'') in the [[Farallon Islands]] of California, besides other such records, has led to worries amongst marine biologists that the [[food web]] across the Pacific is in danger of disruption.&lt;ref name="NatGeo-11Apr15"/&gt;

Biologists from The [[University of Queensland]] observed the first ever mass [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]] event for Hawaiian coral reefs in 2014, and attributed it to the blob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2015/09/rapidly-warming-ocean-threat-hawaiian-coral-reefs|title=Rapidly warming ocean a threat to Hawaiian coral reefs|year=2015|publisher=The University of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather and seasons===
Research from the [[University of Washington]] found positive temperature anomalies in the NE Pacific Ocean (upper ~100 m, greater than 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C, with temperatures at the coast below normal) for the winter period of 2013–2014. Heat loss from the ocean during the winter time was suppressed. During spring and summer 2014 the warmer sea surface temperature anomalies reached coastal waters.  The anomaly may have had a significant effect on the unusually warm summer of 2014, with record high temperatures over parts of land in the Pacific Northwest. Offshore sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the NE Pacific for the month of February were the greatest at least since the 1980s, possibly as early as 1900. Additionally they found anomalous sea surface pressure SSP, with a peak magnitude approaching 10 hPa, a record high value for the years of 1949–2014.&lt;ref name="Bond2015"/&gt;

Canadian senior climatologist [[David Phillips (climatologist)|David Phillips]] noted in May 2015 about the coming winter season, "If that blob continues, if it stays warm ... and then you add to that El Nino, it may complement each other and then it may be the year winter is cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/will-this-become-the-year-winter-is-cancelled-alberta-forecasters-monitor-el-nino-pacific-blob| title=Will this become ‘the year winter is cancelled’?: Alberta forecasters monitor El Nino, Pacific ‘blob’| date= May 2015| author=Paul Parsons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18946">The '''Zonguldak basin''' of North Western Turkey has been mined for [[coal]] since the late 1800s. The [[sedimentary basin|basin]] takes its name after [[Zonguldak, Turkey]], and is approximately 41° N. The Zonguldak basin is the only basin in Turkey with minable coal deposits. Geographically, the Zonguldak is roughly elliptical in shape with its long axis oriented roughly SW – NE, and is adjacent to the [[Black Sea]]. Three main regions have been recognized in the Zonguldak basin. These are the Armutcuk, the Zonguldak, and the Amasra from west to east respectively.&lt;ref name="SinayuçandGümrah2009"&gt;Sinayuç, C., and Gümrah, F. (2009) Modeling of ECBM recovery from Amasra coalbed in Zonguldak Basin, Turkey, International Journal of Coal Geology, 77, 162-174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depositional history==

The Zongdulak basin has undergone two major periods of deposition. The first period of deposition began in the [[Paleozoic]] and the second began in the [[Cretaceous]]. Isolated areas of deposition in the basin occurred during the Late [[Permian]] through the [[Triassic]] and the Latest [[Jurassic]].

===Paleozoic deposition===

The Zonguldak basin first experienced deposition in the [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref name="YalçinandYilmaz2010"&gt;Yalçin, M.N. and Yilmaz, I. (2010). Devonian in Turkey – A review. Geologica Carpathica, 61 (3), 235-253&lt;/ref&gt;  Deposition begins with the lower Ordovician Soḡuksu Formation. The Soḡuksu Fm.  ranges from 700 m – 1100 m thick. At its base it consists of green shale and sandstone and coarsens upwards to arkosic conglomerates. The lower Ordovician Aydos Formation conformably overlies the Soḡuksu. It is a conglomerate of quartzitic sandstone and ranges in thickness from 50–200 m. The Findikli Formation was deposited during the upper Ordovician, [[Silurian]], and lower most Devonian in the Zonguldak basin. It ranges from 300 – 450 m thick. Its [[facies]] are indicative of a mixed siliclastic – carbonate shelf environment that is shallowing through time.

The red crossbedded sandstones of the Ferizli Formation overlie the marly deposits of the Fendikli Formation. The oolitic sandstones contain iron and are an iron ore.&lt;ref name="YalçinandYilmaz2010" /&gt; The formation, like the Findikli Fm., shows a shift toward shallower depositional environments and a shift to higher energy areas of deposition. The younger sediments of the Ferizli Fm. become progressively more enriched in [[calcium carbonate]] and eventually give way to the Yilanli Formation.&lt;ref name="YalçinandYilmaz2010" /&gt;

The Yilanli Formation is [[Visean]] in age and is the beginning of the coal related sequences in the Zonguldak basin.&lt;ref name="Görüretal1997"&gt;Görür, N., Monod, O., Okay, A.I., Sengör, A.M.C., Tüysüz. O., Yiğitbaş, E., Sakinç M., and Akkök, R. (1997) Paleogeographic and tectonic position of the Carboniferous rocks of the western Pontides (Turkey) in the frame of the Variscan belt. Bull. Soc. Géol. France, 168 (2), 195-205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007"&gt;Hoşgörmez, H. (2007). Origin and secondary alteration of coal bed and adjacent rock gasses in the Zonguldak Basin, western Black Sea, Turkey. Geochemical Journal, 41, 201-211&lt;/ref&gt; The Yilanli is a dolomitic [[limestone]] unit with calcareous black and gray shales. It was deposited in a shallow marine passive margin setting. It is conformably overlain by the Alacaagzi Formation, and has accumulated over 1000 m of sediment.&lt;ref name="YalçinandYilmaz2010" /&gt; The Alacaagzi Formation contains economic deposits of coal. It is comprised predominantly of crossbedded black [[shale]]s and silts in the lower sections of the unit and progressively becomes composed of sands, shale bearing coals, and conglomerates towards the top of the formation.&lt;ref name="Görüretal1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt; Facies analysis in the Alacaagzi Formation is suggestive of a coastal environments including: lacustrine, fluviatial, and fan deposits.&lt;ref name="Görüretal1997" /&gt;

Conformably overlaying the Alacaagzi Formation is the Kozlu Formation. The Kozlu contains 19 coal seams totaling 30 – 32 m.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt; The Kozlu is composed of successional conglomerate, sand, silt, mud, and coal deposits. The Karadon Formation conformably overlies the Kozlu. The Karadon formation is lithologically similar to the Kozlu Fm. but contains less coal seams. An angular unconformity spans the top of the Karadon formation and ranges from 46.5 [[wikt:Ma|Ma]] – 194 Ma in duration.&lt;ref name="YalçinandYilmaz2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994"&gt;Yalçin, M.N., Schenk, H.J., and Schaefer, R.G. (1994). Modeling of gas generation in coals of the Zonguldak basin (northwestern Turkey). International Journal of Coal Geology, 25, 195-212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localized deposition===

Deposition resumes in the western portion of the Zonguldak basin with the deposition of the Çakraz Formation. The Çakraz spans the upper Permian through the Lower Jurassic. Unconformably overlying the Çakraz Fm. is the Inalti Formation. The Inalti was deposited during the upper Jurassic and is truncated by an [[unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt; The carbonates of the Inalti are representative of a shallow passive margin setting.&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996"&gt;Channel, J.E.T., Tüysüz, O., Bektas, O., and Sengör, A.M.C. (1996). Jurassic-Cretaceous paleomagnetism and paleography of the Pontides (Turkey). Turkey, 15 (1), 201-212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cretaceous deposition===

During the late Cretaceous, the Zonguldak basin was roughly 25° N,&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996" /&gt; and was experiencing subsidence due to the formation of a back arc, the Black Sea. As a result, the Zonguldak experienced deposition from the early Cretaceous through the [[Eocene]]. Different authors present differing stratigraphic columns of the Zonguldak basin and this analysis will preferentially report more current research. The lithologies deposited during this period of deposition include: limestones, mudstones, siltstones, and [[dolomite]]s.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996" /&gt; The Albian, 105-100 Ma, Zonguldak Formation is predominantly limestone with areas of dolomitization.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002"&gt;Hoşgörmez, H., Yalçin, M.N., Cramer, B., Gerling, P., Faber, E., Schaefer, R.G., and Mann, U. (2002). Isotopic and molecular composition of coal-bed gas in the Amasra region (Zonguldak basin—western Black Sea). Organic Geochemistry,33, 1429-1439&lt;/ref&gt; It is conformably overlain by the Albian, 105-112 Ma, Kilimli Formation. The Kilimli is composed of sandstone and carbonaceous sandstone.

The Kilimli is unconformably overlain by the sandy limestone of the Cemaller Formation.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt; The unconformity lasts at least 6.5 Ma and the Zonguldak basin experiences continuous deposition from the Turonian – Campanian. The Cemaller Fm. is overlain by the siltstone and limestone of the Baþköy formation. The Dinlence Formation overlies the Cemaller and consists of [[andesites]] and andesitic tuffites. It is possible that the Dinlence is the Yemislicay Formation since it too contains andesites and andesitic tuffites.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996" /&gt; The Dinlence is overlain by the marls, and limestones of the Alapý Formation.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt;

==Tectonic history==

===Paleozoic===

During the middle Paleozoic the Zonguldak basin was part of the south facing passive margin of the [[Laurasia]]n plate.&lt;ref name="Görüretal1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoncuogluandKozlu2000"&gt;Goncuoglu, M.C. and Kozlu, H. (2000). Early Paleozoic evolution of the NW Gondwanaland: Data from southern Turkey and surrounding regions. Gondwana Research, 3, 315-324&lt;/ref&gt; During the Carboniferous the temperature of the sediment water interface was near 25&amp;nbsp;°C and heat flow into the Zonguldak basin was about 1.3 heat flow units (HFU).&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt; Backstripping analysis of the Alacaagzi Fm, the lowest coal-bearing formation, reaches a maximum temperature and depth of 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 2.4&amp;nbsp;km respectively in the Zonguldak area during the Carboniferous. Similarly, the base of Kozlu Fm reaches maximum temperatures of 85, 85, and 100&amp;nbsp;°C in the Armutcuk, the Zonguldak, and the Amasra regions respectively.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal2002"&gt;Yalçin M.N., İnan, S., Gülbin, G., Mann, U., and Schaefer, R.G (2002).

The Zonguldak basin was tectonically active during the late Paleozoic and this strongly influenced its structural and burial history due to the [[Hercynian]] [[orogeny]]. The Hercynian orogeny was the result of a continent-continent collision between Laurasia and [[Gondwana]]. This collision created many E-NE/ W-SW striking faults, folds, and tilted the Paleozoic sediments.&lt;ref name="Görüretal1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt; This uplift of the basin, near the end of the [[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]], halted deposition and created the angular unconformity at the top of the Karadon Fm.&lt;ref name="YalçinandYilmaz2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt; Heat flow remained constant in the Zonguldak basin during the Hercynian Orogeny,&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt; while the uplift caused a decrease in the temperatures the sediments experienced. For example, at the end of the Permian the top of the Alacaagzi is roughly 70&amp;nbsp;°C and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km below the sediment surface in the Zonguldak area.

===Mesozoic===

During the Cretaceous the Zonguldak basin experienced general [[subsidence]], [[rift]]ing, and [[fault (geology)|fault]]ing.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt; This led to another period of deposition in the region and faulted the coal seams. This faulting provided a pathway for meteoric water to enter the coal seams.

During the [[Aptian]], the Intrapontide Ocean, the ocean separating the Western Pontides tectonic region of Turkey form the Sakarya Continent, underwent subduction.&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996" /&gt; This led to the formation of a back arc basin, the Black Sea. The start of this subduction is responsible for the unconformity between the Kilimi and Cemaller Fms and marks the beginning of the [[Alpide]] orogeny in the region.&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996" /&gt; The andesitic volcaniclastic sediments of the Yemislicay support the subduction of oceanic crust in the region during this time. The Zonguldak basin was able to sustain deposition after the start of the Alpide orogeny due to rifting in the Black Sea basin. The rifting in the Black Sea also increased heat flow into the Zonguldak basin during the Cretaceous. Heat flows were as high as 1.5-1.75 HFU, and the temperature of the sediment water interface was about 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal2002" /&gt;

===Cenozoic===

The Intra-Pontide Ocean stopped subducting with the collision between the Western Pontides terrain and the Eastern Pontides terrain. The Aplide orogeny stopped deposition and uplifted the Zonguldak basin during the Eocene epoch beginning at 42 Ma.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt; The coal bearing formations experienced the highest temperatures at the onset of the Alpide orogeny. For example, the base of the Kozlu Fm experienced temperatures of 125, 175, and 140&amp;nbsp;°C in the Armutcuk, the Zonguldak, and the Amasra regions respectively.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal2002" /&gt;

The Alpide tectonic provinces in [[Anatolia]], from North to South, are the: Pontides, Anatolides, Tarides, and Border Folds. These provinces have rough East-West strike. The Zonguldak basin is currently being uplifted by the Alpide orogeny.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal2002" /&gt; Progressively older sediments outcrop toward the north of the basin.

==Source rock==

===Coals===

The coals of the Alacaagzi Fm, Kozlu Fm, and Karadon Fm are of bituminous rank.&lt;ref name="Yürümetal2001"&gt;Yürüm, Y., Bozkurt, D., and Yalçin, M.N. (2001). Change of the structure of coals from the Kozlu K20 G borehole of Zonguldak Basin with Burial Depth: 1. chemical structure. Energy Sources, 23, 511-520&lt;/ref&gt; The Alacaagzi, Kozlu, and Karadon Fms contain greater than: 70% total organic carbon (TOC), 81% TOC, and 81% TOC respectively.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt;

===Structure===

The coals of the Zonguldak basin follow the mean evolution of type III [[kerogen]]s.&lt;ref name="Yürümetal2001" /&gt; The coals of the Zonguldak basin show [[vitrinite]] reflectances (Ro) of 0.45 – 1.70%.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal2002" /&gt; Hoşgörmez et al., (2002) determined that the coals of the Kozlu Fm exhibit Ro of 1.0 – 1.2% which gives them a coal rank of high volatile A bituminous.&lt;ref name="Strąpoćetal2011"&gt;Strąpoć, D., Mastalerz, M., Dawson, K., Macalady, J., Callaghan, A.V., Wawrik, B., Turich, C. and Ashby, M. (2011). Biogeochemistry of microbial coal-bed methane. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 39, 617-656&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, coalification increased with depth, and the coals became more aromatic with depth.&lt;ref name="Karayigitetal1998"&gt;Karayigit, A.I., Gayer, R.A., and Demirel, I.H. (1998). Coal rank and petrography of Upper Carboniferous coal seams (Amasra, Turkey). International Journal of Coal Geology, 38, 277-294&lt;/ref&gt; The calorification of the coals also increased with depth.

===Methane===

The two broad scale pathways of [[methane]] production, thermogenic and biogenic generation, account for the majority of methane generation in coals.&lt;ref name="Strąpoćetal2011" /&gt; Thermogenic production of methane in coals begins at temperatures around 80&amp;nbsp;°C and peaks around 0.7 – 1.6% of vitrinite reflectance.&lt;ref name="Strąpoćetal2011" /&gt; Biogenic generation of methane takes place through two chemically distinguishable pathways. These pathways are [[carbon dioxide]] [[redox|reduction]]; and [[acetate]] [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and methanol/methyl utilization.&lt;ref name="Strąpoćetal2011" /&gt; Typically biogenic production takes place early in the maturation of a coal bed, since the temperatures observed during the coalification process are high enough for sterilization.  A coal bed may produce methane later in its history if it is uplifted and fractured. The uplifting of the beds cools them enough for colonization by microbes and fractures and faults provide inoculation pathways by the infiltration of surface water.&lt;ref name="Strąpoćetal2011" /&gt;

The coals of the Zonguldak basin were subjected to a complex depositional and tectonic history, and this influenced the basins methane generation. The Alacaagzi Fm did not pass the 80&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm until it had been buried for 25 Ma.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt; The Kozlu Fm experienced two different conditions during its first 260 Ma. The bottom of the Kozlu was mostly below the 80&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm while the top of the formation was above it. With deposition in the Cretaceous, the Kozlu Fm was buried beneath the 80&amp;nbsp;°C Isotherm. The Alacaagzi, Kozlu were uplifted past the 80&amp;nbsp;°C around 5 Ma. At this point the rocks had been fractured and meteoric water could inoculate the system with methanogenic microbes.

Isotopic data from wells in the Zonguldak basin suggest that the methane is primarily thermogenic in nature. There may have been some initial microbial methane generation in the coal beds or generation after the basin had been uplifted and meteoric water could enter the beds. Reinoculation is supported by the evidence of isotopically lighter gas occurring near cleats in the coal beds.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt;

===Shales===

The organic rich shales of the Yilani contain up to 7.9% TOC, and the shales and siltstones of the coalbearing formations can contain 2 – 26% TOC.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt; The organic matter is found as type II kerogen. While the Yilani entered the gas window, isotopic data suggest that most of the gas in the basin was derived from the Kozlu coal deposits and the associated organic rich shales.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt;

===Summary of source rock===

The predominant source rock in the Zonguldak basin is coal. The most prolific source rock is the Kozlu Fm containing the greatest volume of coal and the greatest amount of methane. This is in corroboration with the Ro values that suggest thermogenic production of methane in the Zonguldak basin would have been high. Methane generated by shale may be contributing a small amount to the total amount of methane found in the basin but the majority is coal derived. Coal derived methane appears to be mostly thermogenic in origin with some biogenic production.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmez2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt;

==Reservoir==

===Coal===

Coal is the primary reservoir lithology in the Zonguldak basin. Coal, since it is a solid hydrocarbon, cannot migrate. Coal is also an important reservoir lithology in the basin for methane. Methane in coal beds is primarily found in a sorbed state, while a very small fraction is found as a free gas.&lt;ref name="SinayuçandGümrah2009" /&gt; The gas is in the micro-porous structure of the coal at near liquid densities.&lt;ref name="Strąpoćetal2011" /&gt; Hoşgörmez et al. (2002) estimated that the coals of the Zongulak basin contain up to 12&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of methane. Additionally, 90% of the methane in the Karadon Fm is adsorbed to the coal while 10% of it is found as free gas.&lt;ref name="SinayuçandGümrah2009" /&gt; The total volume of coal bed methane in the Karadon Fm in the Amasra region has been estimated to be between 862.5-2600 [[million cubic metre]]s.

===Other units===

The dolomites of the Yilani Fm are characterized as potential reservoir units.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt; The sandstone units in the Alacaagzi, Kozlu, and Karadon Fms are also potential reservoirs.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt; Another formation with good reservoir qualities is the Yemislicay or Dinlence Fm.&lt;ref name="Yalçinetal1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt; The base of the Yemislicay is characterized by a red [[pelagic]] limestone interlain with volcaniclastic sediments.&lt;ref name="Channeletal1996" /&gt;

==Seals==

Due to the microporous nature of coal, coal is a significant seal in the Zonguldak basin. Outside of the coal bearing formations, the only other formation that can serve as a seal is the Kilimli Formation.&lt;ref name="Hoşgörmezetal2002" /&gt;

'''Ænon''', more commonly written '''Aenon''', is the site mentioned by the [[Gospel of John]] as the place where [[John the Baptist|John]] was [[baptism|baptising]] after his encounter with [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=BigPic &gt;Nichols, Lorna Daniels (2009). ''Big Picture of the Bible: New Testament''. {{ISBN|1-57921-928-4}}. page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sloyan11 &gt;Sloyan, Gerard Stephen (1987). ''John''. {{ISBN|0-8042-3125-7}}. page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ænon" is the Greek rendition of the Semitic term for "spring" or "natural fountain", like the Hebrew and Arabic ''{{'}}ayn''. In the water-poor Middle East, places owning a spring tend to be named after that water source, so that toponyms consisting of or containing the [[Construct state]] word "ein-" are common. The particular site mentioned in the Gospel of John is therefore closer identified as "Aenon near Salim". {{Bibleref2|John 3:23}} is the only place in the [[Bible]] where the name Aenon is found.&lt;ref name="cb aenon"&gt;John 3:23 is marked with a dagger symbol, used to symbolize the set of all biblical citations of a given word, in Cheyne and Black (1899), ''Encyclopaedia Biblica'', entry for "Aenon." [https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabib01cheyuoft]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Aenon is commonly used amongst [[Baptist]] organizations and churches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Identification attempts==

===Based on the Gospel text===
Both names, "Aenon" and "Salim", are not unique, and the Gospel text offers only two additional hints about where Aenon might be located: the most direct information is that "there was plenty of water there" ({{Bibleref2|John 3:22}}), and the second is that it was west of the River Jordan because at Aenon John's disciples talk of the site where John first encountered Jesus as being "on the other side of the Jordan" ({{Bibleref2|John 3:26}}) which is taken to mean east of the river. We also know from {{Bibleref2|John 3:28}} that that first encounter happened at "Bethany on the other side of the Jordan".&lt;ref name="BibleHub"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://biblehub.com/topical/a/aenon.htm |title= Aenon |work= BibleHub.com |accessdate= 20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible location is near the upper source of the [[Wadi al-Far'a (river)|Wadi Fa'rah]], an open valley extending from [[Mount Ebal]] to the [[Jordan River]] which is full of springs. There is a place called 'Ainun four miles north of the springs (see [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]).&lt;ref name="BibleHub"/&gt;

Another possible location, which is supported by [[Eusebius]]' description in his ''[[Eusebius#Onomasticon|Onomasticon]]'' (written before AD 324), is at "a village in the (Jordan) valley, at the eighth milestone from Scythopolis ([[Beit She'an]]), ... called Salumias."&lt;ref name="OFM"&gt;{{cite web |title= Aenon near Salem which is also Saloumias - (Kh.

This location has numerous springs: I have counted thirteen of them in a small area four by four kilometres and, interestingly, [[Ambrose]] in his writings (II, 1432) claimed that there were twelve springs at 'Ennon'. On the north side of this area is Tell Shalem, which undoubtedly must be Salim/Salumnias (map ref. 2098-1998), and so the place where John baptised at Aenon may have been at any of the springs in the vicinity of Tell Shalem. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nCdvvTsvuVAC&amp;pg=PT245 |accessdate=25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICCS"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. John |series= International Critical Commentary Series |author= John Henry Bernard |year= 2000 |location= |publisher= Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark |page= 128 |isbn= 9780567050243 |quote= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VxB4GqeXjSoC&amp;pg=PA128 |accessdate= 25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Based on the Madaba Map===
The 6th-century [[Madaba Map]] shows the location of Ænon right across the Jordan from [[Bethabara]], near [[Jericho]]. Bethabara is in some, but not all, versions of the Gospel of John the place where John was baptising during his encounter with Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map and archaeological findings at the site indicate that at least during part of the Byzantine period, this was the site venerated as Aenon. The two relevant map inscriptions read

* Αίνών ένθα νύν ό Σαπσαφάς: "Ænon, where now is Sapsaphas"
* Βέθαβαρά το τού άγίου Ιωάννου τού βαπτίσματος: "Bethabara, the place of baptism of St. John"

With the Dead Sea shown on the right side of the map giving context, Bethabara is on the west of the Jordan, while Ænon is on the east.
