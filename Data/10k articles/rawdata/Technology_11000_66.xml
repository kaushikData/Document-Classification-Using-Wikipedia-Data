'''ARINC 818: Avionics Digital Video Bus (ADVB)''' is a video interface and protocol standard developed for high bandwidth, low latency, uncompressed digital video transmission in [[avionics]] systems.  The standard, which was released in January 2007, has been advanced by [[ARINC]] and the aerospace community to meet the stringent needs of high performance digital video. The specification was updated and ARINC 818-2 was released in December 2013, adding a number of new features, including link rates up to 32X fibre channel rates, channel-bonding, switching, field sequential color, bi-directional control, and data only links.

==Background==
In [[aircraft]], an ever-increasing amount of information is supplied in the form of images, this information passes through a complex video system before reaching [[Cockpit display system|cockpit displays]]. Video systems include: [[infrared]] and other wavelength sensors, optical cameras, [[radar]], [[flight recorder]]s, map/chart systems, [[synthetic vision]], [[image fusion]] systems, [[Head-up display|heads-up displays]] (HUD) and heads-down [[Primary flight display|primary flight]] and [[Multi-function display|multifunction]] displays, video concentrators, and other subsystems. Video systems are used for taxi and take-off assist, cargo loading, [[Air navigation|navigation]], target tracking, [[Aircraft collision avoidance systems|collision avoidance]], and other critical functions.

ARINC 818/ADVB is a [[Fibre Channel]] (FC) protocol that builds on FC-AV (Fibre Channel Audio Video, defined in ANSI INCITS 356-2002), which was used extensively on video systems in the [[F-18]] and the [[C-130 Hercules|C-130AMP]]. Although FC-AV has been used on numerous programs, each implementation has been unique.  ARINC 818 provides an opportunity to standardize high-speed video systems and has since been adopted by a number of high-profile commercial and military aerospace programs, including the A400M, A350XWB, B787, KC-46A, [[Comac C919]], and numerous other programs. ARINC 818 is also common in avionics suites, such as Proline Fusion by Rockwell Collins, the TopDeck by Thales.

==Overview of ARINC 818 protocol==
ARINC 818 is a point-to-point, [[8b/10b encoding|8B/10B encoded]] (or 64B/66B for higher speeds) serial protocol for transmission of video, audio, and data. The protocol is packetized but is video-centric and very flexible, supporting an array of complex video functions including the multiplexing of multiple video streams on a single link or the transmission of a single stream over a dual link. Four different classes of video are defined, from simple asynchronous to stringent pixel synchronous systems.

==ADVB packet structure==
The ADVB frame is the basic transport mechanism for ARINC 818. It is important to refer to these packets as “ADVB frames” rather than simply “frames” to eliminate potential confusion with video frames.

The start of an ADVB frame is signaled by a SOFx 4-byte ordered set and terminated with an EOFx ordered set.  Every ADVB frame has a standard Fibre Channel header composed of six 32-bit words.  These header words pertain to such things as the ADVB frame origin and intended destination and the ADVB frames position within the sequence. The Source ID field (SID) in the ADVB frame header allows video from each sensor to be distinguished from the other sensors.

The “payload” contains either video, video parameters or ancillary data. The payload can vary in size, but is limited to 2112 bytes per ADVB frame.  To insure data integrity, all ADVB frames have a 32-bit [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] calculated for data between the SOFx and the CRC word.  The CRC is the same 32-bit polynomial calculation defined for Fibre Channel.

==ADVB container structure==
The ARINC 818 specification defines a “container” as a set of ADVB frames used to transport video. In other words, a video image and data is encapsulated into a “container” that spans many ADVB frames. The “payload” of each ADVB frame contains either data or video. Within a container, ARINC 818 defines objects that contain certain types of data.  That is, certain ADVB frames within the container are part of an object.

An example of how ARINC 818 transmits color [[XGA]] provides a good overview. XGA RGB requires  ~141M bytes/s of data transfer (1024 pixels x 3 bytes per pixel x 768 lines x 60&amp;nbsp;Hz).  Adding the protocol overhead and [[Blanking (video)|blanking]] time, a standard link rate of 2.125Gbit/s is required. ARINC 818 “packetizes” video images into Fibre Channel frames. Each FC frame begins with a 4 byte ordered set, called an SOF (Start of Frame), and ends with an EOF (End of Frame), additionally, a 4 byte CRC is included for data integrity. The payload of the first FC frame in a sequence contains embedded header data that accompanies each video image.

Each XGA video line requires 3072 bytes, which exceeds the maximum FC payload length, so each line is divided into two FC frames.  Transporting an XGA image requires a “payload” of 1536 FC frames.  Additionally, an ADVB header frame is added, making a total of 1537 FC frames.  Idle characters are required between FC frames because they are used for synchronization between transmitters and receivers.

==Applications==
Although ARINC 818 was developed specifically for avionics applications, the protocol is already being used in sensor fusion applications where multiple sensor outputs are multiplexed onto a single high-speed link. Features added in ARINC 818-2 facilitate using ARINC 818 as a sensor interface.

The ARINC 818 specification does not mandate which physical layer is to be used and implementations are done using both copper and fiber. Although the majority of implementation use fiber, low-speed implementations of ARINC 818 (1.0625Gbit/s and 2.125Gbit/s) sometimes use copper (twinax or STP). The most commonly, either 850&amp;nbsp;nm MM fiber (&lt;500m) or 1310&amp;nbsp;nm SM fiber (up to 10&amp;nbsp;km) is used, however, in Russia and India, 1310 multi-mode fiber has also been used. ARINC 818 lends itself to applications that require few conductors ([[slip ring]]s, [[Gun turret|turrets]]), low weight (aerospace), [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] resistance, or long distance transmission (aerospace, ships).

==Flexibility vs. interoperability==
ARINC 818 is flexible and can accommodate many types of video and data applications. It is the intention of the standard that all implementation be accompanied by a small interface control document (ICD) that defines key parameters of the header such as: link speed, video resolution, color scheme, size of ancillary data, timing classification, or bit-packing schemes. Interoperability is only guaranteed among equipment built to the same ICD.

==Implementation considerations==
ARINC 818 uses a FC physical layer that can be constructed from any FC compatible 8B/10B  [[SerDes]], which are common in large [[FPGA]]s such as:&lt;br&gt;
The [[Xilinx#Virtex family|Xilinx Virtex]] 2 Pro, [[Xilinx]] Virtex 5, 6 and 7, Artix 7, Kintex 7&lt;br&gt;
[[Altera]] Cyclone V, ARRIA II GX, ARRIA 5, ARRIA 10, Stratix V and other FPGAs.

ARINC 818 transmitters must assemble valid FC frames, including starting and ending ordered sets, headers, and CRC. This can easily be done with [[VHDL]] [[state machine]]s, and many [[Programmable logic device|PLD]] SerDes include built in CRC calculations.

The flexibility of ARINC 818 allows for receiver implementations using either full image buffers or just display-line buffers. For either, synchronization issues must be considered at the pixel, line, and frame level.

Line buffer or [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]-based receivers will require that the transmitter adhere to strict line timing requirements of the display. Since the display [[Horizontal scan rate|horizontal scanning]] must be precise, the arrival time of lines will also need to be precise. ARINC 818 intends that timing parameters such as these be captured in an ICD specific to the video system.

The authors of ARINC 818 built upon many years of combined experience of using FC to transport different video formats, and key implementation details are included in the specification, including examples of common analog formats.

==ARINC 818-2 updates==
ARINC 818-2, ratified in December 2013, adds features to accommodate higher link rates, support for compression and encryption, networking, and sophisticated display schemes, such as channel bonding used on large area displays (LADs).

Link rates: At the time the original ARINC 818 specification was ratified, the fiber-channel protocol supported link rates up to 8.5 gigabits per second (Gb/s). ARINC 818-2 added rates of 5.0, 6.375 (FC 6x), 12.75 (FC 12x), 14.025 (FC 16x), 21.0375 (FC 24x), and 28.05 (FC 32x) Gb/s. The 6x, 12x, and 24x speeds were added to accommodate the use of high-speed, bi-directional coax with power as a physical medium.  The 5 Gbit/s rate was added to accommodate so implementation specific speeds supported by certain FPGAs.  The specification also provides for non-standard link rates for bi-directional return path for applications such as camera control where high speed video links are not required.

Compression and Encryption: ARINC 818 was originally envisioned as carrying only uncompressed video and audio.  Applications such as high-resolution sensors, UAV/UAS with bandwidth limited downlinks, and data only applications drove the need to compress and/or encrypt a link.  Sticking to a philosophy of maximum flexibility, the ARINC 818-2 calls for the ICD to specify implementation details for compression and encryption. The ARINC 818 protocol does not provide a means for compression and encryption, it simply provides flags to indicate that payload is compressed or encrypted.

Switching: ARINC 818 was designed as a point-to-point protocol.  Since many of the newer implementations of the ARINC 818 have multiple displays and or many channels of ARINC 818 (10 or more), switching has become more important. The new specification requires that active switching can only occur between frames. In effect, to prevent broken video frames, the switch must wait until the vertical blanking.  Again, the ICD controls the implementation details.

Field Sequential Color: A video format code was added to support field sequential color. The color field-sequential mode will typically send each color component in a separate container.

Channel Bonding: To overcome link bandwidth limitations of FPGAs, ARINC 818-2 supports multiple links in parallel.  The video frame is broken into smaller segments and transmitted on two or more links. Each link must transmit a complete ADVB frame with header, and the ICD addresses latency and skew between the links.

Data-only Links: ARINC 818-2 provides for data-only links, typically used in command-and-control channels, such as those needed for bi-directional camera interfaces. These may employ a standard link rate or a non-standard rate specified by the ICD.

Regions of Interest: The ARINC 818-2 protocol provides a means for defining partial images, tiling, and region-of-interest that are important for high-speed sensors and stereo displays.

==History==
Acer was founded by [[Stan Shih]] (施振榮), his wife Carolyn Yeh, and a group of five others as Multitech in 1976, headquartered in [[Hsinchu City]], [[Taiwan]].

The company began with eleven employees and US$25,000 in capital. Initially, it was primarily a distributor of electronic parts and a consultant in the use of microprocessor technologies. It produced the [[Micro-Professor MPF-I]] training kit, then two Apple II clones; the [[Microprofessor II]] and [[Microprofessor III|III]] before joining the emerging IBM PC compatible market, and becoming a significant PC manufacturer. The company was renamed Acer in 1987.

In 1998, Acer reorganized into five groups: Acer International Service Group, Acer Sertek Service Group, Acer Semiconductor Group, Acer Information Products Group, and Acer Peripherals Group. To dispel complaints from clients that Acer competed with its own products and to alleviate the competitive nature of the branded sales vs. contract manufacturing businesses, in 2000 the company spun off the contract business, renaming it Wistron Corporation. The restructuring resulted in two primary units: brand name sales and contract manufacturing. In 2001 the company got rid of its manufacturing units, [[Benq|BenQ]] and [[Wistron]] to focus resources on design and sales.

Acer increased worldwide sales while simultaneously reducing its labor force by identifying and using marketing strategies that best utilized their existing distribution channels. By 2005, Acer employed a scant 7,800 people worldwide. Revenues rose from US$4.9 billion in 2003&lt;ref name="Gianfranco Tutti"&gt;{{cite web

Acer's North American market share has slipped over the past few years, while in contrast, the company's European market share has risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s years, consumer notebooks have been almost the sole growth drivers for the PC industry, and Acer's exceptionally low overheads and dedication to the channel had made it one of the main beneficiaries of this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hexus.net/business/news/corporate/29829-acer-boss-throws-towel/|title=Acer boss throws in the towel - Corporate - News - HEXUS.net|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acer grew quickly in Europe in part by embracing the use of more traditional distribution channels targeting retail consumers when some rivals were pursuing online sales and business customers. In 2007 Acer bought [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] in the USA and Packard Bell in Europe and became the Number 3 world provider of computers and number 2 for notebooks, and achieved significant improvement in profitability. Acer has been striving to become the world's largest PC vendor, in the belief that the goal can help it achieve economy of scale and garner higher margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cens.com/cens/html/en/news/news_inner_35793.html "Acer Should Overhaul Its Operation: Stan Shih"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509093115/http://www.cens.com/cens/html/en/news/news_inner_35793.html |date=9 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But such a reliance on the high-volume, low-value PC market made Acer exposed when buying habits changed.

==2013 Re-Organisation==
In November 2013 Chairman and CEO J.T. Wang, and President Jim Wong, both resigned due to the company's poor financial performance. Wang had been reportedly due to leave Acer at year end, and was supposed to have been succeeded by Wong. Acer co-founder [[Stan Shih]] took over as board chairman and interim president after the departure of Wang and Wong and began to search for new candidates to assume the roles of CEO and president. On 23 December, Acer named [[Jason Chen (businessman)|Jason Chen]], vice president of worldwide sales and marketing at [[Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing]], as its new president and CEO, effective 1 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.pcworld.com/article/2082860/acer-names-semiconductor-veteran-as-new-ceo.html| title =Acer names semiconductor veteran as new CEO| work =[[PC World]]| accessdate = 24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisitions and joint ventures==
* In 1988, Acer acquired Counterpoint Computers.
* In 1990, Acer acquired [[Altos Computer Systems|Altos Computer Corporation]].
* In 1993, Acer acquired the PC division of [[Commodore International]].&lt;ref&gt;PC Dealer and Computer Reseller, Issue 795, Nov. 24, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1997, Acer acquired [[Texas Instruments]] notebook computer business.

==Corporate social responsibility ==
In 2005, Acer published its first environmental report, for which the company used the GRI guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder process and independent institution whose mission is to develop and disseminate globally applicable Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Acer’s tier-one suppliers have acquired ISO 14001 certification.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14001 was released in 1996 with the intent that companies manage all of the activities, products, and services that can significantly impact the environment&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Acer was ranked 4th place out of 15 in [[Greenpeace]]’s re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics, with a score of 5.1 points out of 10. The Guide ranks electronics makers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable.&lt;ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics – Greenpeace International|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenpeace criticized the company for not setting out targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as intended in 2010 and for not providing external verification for the GHG emissions it reports for its operations and business travel. It also scored badly on the products criteria receiving no points on product lifecycle while Greenpeace noted that a higher percentage of its products need to meet or exceed Energy Star standards in order for it to score more points.&lt;ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics"/&gt;

It received some praise for launching new products which are free from polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and the company informed Greenpeace
that the majority of its products will be PVC/BFR free in the near future. Acer also scored well on chemical management for lobbying for restrictions on organo-halogens and was commended for reporting on GHG emissions from its first-tier suppliers and investigating its second tier.&lt;ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics"/&gt;

In its 2012 report on progress relating to [[conflict minerals]], the [[Enough Project]] rated Acer the seventh highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.&lt;ref name='EnoughProject2012'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.enoughproject.org/files/CorporateRankings2012.pdf |title= Taking Conflict Out of Consumer Gadgets: Company Rankings on Conflict Minerals 2012 |accessdate= 2012-08-17 |last= Lezhnev |first= Sasha |author2= Alex Hellmuth |date= Aug 2012 |format= PDF |publisher= [[Enough Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acer has been listed on the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Indices|DJSI’s]] Emerging Markets Index since 2014 and on [[MSCI World|MSCI’s]] Global Sustainability Indexes since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer-group.com/public/News/corporate_news.htm|title=News &amp; Recognition|website=www.acer-group.com|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twopennplaza.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street view of top half of skyscraper against the sky; its outside is dominated by vertical black and white lines|[[Two Penn Plaza]] site of the ACM headquarters in [[New York City]]]]
ACM is organized into over 171 local chapters and 37 [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]].

Many of the SIGs, such as [[ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH]], [[SIGPLAN]], [[SIGCSE]] and [[SIGCOMM]], sponsor regular conferences, which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

*A number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ''ACM Transactions''. Some of the more notable transactions include:
**''ACM Transactions on Computer Systems'' (TOCS)
**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics]]'' (TCBB)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]]'' (TOCL)

Although ''Communications'' no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid [[subscriber]]s online at its [[#Digital Library|Digital Library]] and also has a [[ACM Guide to Computing Literature|Guide to Computing Literature]]. Individual members additionally have access to [[Safari Books Online]] and Books24x7. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.

In 1997, ACM Press published ''Wizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing'' ({{ISBN|0897919602}}), written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by [[Louis Fabian Bachrach, Jr.|Louis Fabian Bachrach]]. The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry.

==Portal and Digital Library{{anchor|Portal}}{{anchor|Digital Library}}==
The '''ACM Portal''' is an online service of the ACM.&lt;ref name=portal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/|title=ACM Digital Library|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its core are two main sections: '''ACM Digital Library''' and the '''[[ACM Guide to Computing Literature]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libs.uga.edu/research/subject/computer-science The University of Georgia Guide to Online Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.&lt;ref name=portal/&gt;
The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.

ACM adopted a hybrid [[Open access|Open Access]] (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authors.acm.org/ | title=ACM Author Rights |publisher=Acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM was a "green" publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.

All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including [[abstracts]], linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.

There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement. Some authors see a centralized peer&amp;ndash;review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like [[arXiv]]. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)]], [[Journal of Machine Learning Research|Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)]] and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.

==Membership grades==
In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and "demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |title=ACM Senior Members–An Overview |publisher=Acm.org |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118200303/http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fellows===
{{main|ACM Fellow|List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery}}
The [[ACM Fellow]]s Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 "to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM." Since March 2015, there are about 958 Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/fellow/all.cfm |title=List of ACM Fellows |publisher=Awards.acm.org |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of about 75,000 professional members.

===Distinguished Members===
In 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and "have made a significant impact on the computing field". Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called "Distinguished Member" and was changed about two years later to "Distinguished Educator". Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.

===Senior Members===
Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. Senior Members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership.

===Distinguished Speakers===
While not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as 'Renowned International Thought Leaders'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/ |title = Homepage|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguished speaker program is overseen by a committee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://speakers.acm.org/committee| title = ACM Speakers Committee|website = ACM Distinguished Speakers|publisher = Association for Computing Machinery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman E. Gibbs served as the president of the ACM.

==Chapters==
ACM has three kinds of chapters: [[Special Interest Group]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/sigs | title=ACM Special Interest Groups | accessdate=August 7, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727190450/http://www.acm.org/sigs | archivedate=July 27, 2010 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional Chapters, and Student Chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/chapters/ | title=ACM Chapters | accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
{{category see also|Presidents of the Association for Computing Machinery}}

The President of ACM for 2018–2020 is [[Cherri M. Pancake]], Professor Emeritus at [[Oregon State University]] and Director of the Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and Engineering (NACSE). She is successor of Vicki L. Hanson (2016-2018), Distinguished Professor at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] and Visiting Professor at the [[University of Dundee]]; [[Alexander L. Wolf]] (2014–2016), Dean of the [[Jack Baskin School of Engineering]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Vint Cerf]] (2012–2014), an American computer scientist who is recognized as one of "the fathers of the Internet"; Alain Chesnais (2010–2012), a French citizen living in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, where he runs his company named Visual Transitions; and [[Wendy Hall|Dame Wendy Hall]] of the [[University of Southampton]], UK (2008–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/about/past-presidents |title=ACM Past Presidents |publisher=acm.org |accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM is led by a Council consisting of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Past President, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members&amp;ndash;At&amp;ndash;Large. This institution is often referred to simply as "Council" in ''Communications of the ACM''.

==Infrastructure==
ACM has five "Boards" that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows:
# Publications Board
# SIG Governing Board
# Education Board
# Membership Services Board
# Practitioners Board

==ACM Council on Women in Computing==
[[ACM-W]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ACM council on [[women in computing]], supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing. ACM–W's main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing, ACM-W chapters, and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences. In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM-W India and ACM-W Europe respectively.  ACM-W collaborates with organizations such as the [[Anita Borg Institute]], the [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology|National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT)]], and [[CRA-W: Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research|Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W)]].

===Athena Lectures===
The ACM-W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/athena|title=About ACM Athena Lecturer Award|website=awards.acm.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program began in 2006.

==Cooperation==
ACM's primary partner has been the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS), which is the largest subgroup of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical [[computer science]], but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Cooperation — Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101141809/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop|archive-date=January 1, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACM and its SIGs co-sponsor about 20 conferences each year with IEEE-CS and other parts of IEEE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Jointly Sponsored Conferences —Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/conferences|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101141814/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/conferences|archive-date=January 1, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eckert-Mauchly Award]] and [[Ken Kennedy Award]], both major awards in computer science, are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM / IEEE-CS Joint Awards — Association for Computing Machinery|url=http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/awards|website=www.acm.org|language=en|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143733/http://www.acm.org/acm-ieeecs-coop/awards|archive-date=April 6, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534860 |title=Computer Science Curricula 2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science|author1 = Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula|author2 = Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|author3 = IEEE Computer Society|authorlink3=IEEE Computer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIAM: ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA17)|url=https://www.siam.org/meetings/da17/|website=www.siam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BIM Collaboration Format''' ('''BCF''') is a structured file format which allows [[Issue_tracking_system|issue tracking]] with a [[Building information modeling|building information model]]. BCF is designed primarily for attaching information to collisions and errors connected with specific objects in a model, but can be used for general issue tracking in building construction projects. This allows developers of BIM-supporting software to design interfaces for collaboration between users who access the same model, especially with different software.

The format was developed by Tekla and Solibri and later adopted as a standard by [[buildingSMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases |title=BCF intro |website=www.buildingsmart-tech.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software with native support for BCF are Solibri, Tekla with plugins which provide usability for other software.

In a [[dynamical system]], '''bistability''' means the system has two [[stable equilibrium (disambiguation)|stable equilibrium states]].&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Something that is '''bistable''' can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to [[Energy storage|stored energy]].  An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a [[light switch]]. The switch lever is designed to rest in the "on" or "off" position, but not between the two.  Bistable behavior can occur in mechanical linkages, electronic circuits, nonlinear optical systems, chemical reactions, and physiological and biological systems.

In a [[conservative force]] field, bistability stems from the fact that the [[potential energy]] has two [[local minimum|local minima]], which are the stable equilibrium points.&lt;ref name="Nazarov"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By mathematical arguments, a [[local maximum]], an unstable equilibrium point, must lie between the two minima.  At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them.

A system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare [[activation energy]] and [[Arrhenius equation]] for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the other minimum state in a time called the [[relaxation time]].

Bistability is widely used in [[digital electronics]] devices to store [[binary number|binary]] data. It is the essential characteristic of the [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], a circuit widely used in latches and some types of [[semiconductor memory]].  A bistable device can store one [[binary digit|bit]] of binary data, with one state representing a "0" and the other state a "1".  It is also used in [[relaxation oscillator]]s, [[multivibrator]]s, and the [[Schmitt trigger]].
[[Optical bistability]] is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input.
Bistability can also arise in biochemical systems, where it creates digital, switch-like outputs from the constituent chemical concentrations and activities. It is often associated with [[Hysteresis#In biology|hysteresis]] in such systems.

==Mathematical modelling==

In the mathematical language of [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamic systems analysis]], one of the simplest bistable systems is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dy}{dt} = y (1-y^2).
&lt;/math&gt;

This system describes a ball rolling down a curve with shape &lt;math&gt;\frac{y^4}{4} - \frac{y^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and has three steady-states: &lt;math&gt; y = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y = -1&lt;/math&gt;. The middle steady-state &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable, while the other two states are stable. The direction of change of &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; over time depends on the initial condition &lt;math&gt;y(0)&lt;/math&gt;.  If the initial condition is positive (&lt;math&gt;y(0)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), then the solution &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; approaches 1 over time, but if the initial condition is negative (&lt;math&gt;y(0)&lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; approaches −1 over time. Thus, the dynamics are "bistable". The final state of the system can be either &lt;math&gt; y = 1 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; y = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, depending on the initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;For detailed techniques of mathematical modelling of bistability, see the tutorial by Chong et al. (2015) http://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/C2/chong.pdf{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} The tutorial provides a simple example illustration of bistability using a synthetic toggle switch proposed in {{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=James J. |last2=Gardner |first2=Timothy S. |last3=Cantor |first3=Charles R. |title=Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6767 |pages=339–42 |year=2000 |pmid=10659857 |doi=10.1038/35002131 }}. The tutorial also uses the dynamical system software XPPAUT http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}} to show practically how to see bistability captured by a saddle-node bifurcation diagram and the hysteresis behaviours when the bifurcation parameter is increased or decreased slowly over the tipping points and a protein gets turned 'On' or turned 'Off'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of a bistable region can be understood for the model system 
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dy}{dt} = y (r-y^2)
&lt;/math&gt;
which undergoes a supercritical [[pitchfork bifurcation]] with [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation parameter]] &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;.

==In biological and chemical systems==

Pro-osteoblast stimulus promotes P→O transition.&lt;ref name=CME&gt;{{cite journal | last1       = Kryven| first1     = I.| last2       = Röblitz| first2      = S.| last3       = Schütte| first3      =  Ch.| year       =2015| title      = Solution of the chemical master equation by radial basis functions approximation with interface tracking| journal  = BMC Systems Biology | issue = 9.1| url        = http://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-015-0210-y}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bistability is key for understanding basic phenomena of cellular functioning, such as decision-making processes in [[cell cycle]] progression, [[cellular differentiation]],&lt;ref name=Ghaffarizadeh&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghaffarizadeh A, Flann NS, Podgorski GJ |year = 2014 |title = Multistable switches and their role in cellular differentiation networks |journal = BMC Bioinformatics |volume = 15 |pages = S7+ |doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-15-s7-s7 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/S7/S7 |pmid = 25078021 |pmc = 4110729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[apoptosis]]. It is also involved in loss of cellular homeostasis associated with early events in [[cancer]] onset and in [[prion]] diseases as well as in the origin of new species ([[speciation]]).&lt;ref name=Wilhelm&gt;{{cite journal |author = Wilhelm, T |year = 2009 |title = The smallest chemical reaction system with bistability |journal = BMC Systems Biology |volume = 3 |pages = 90 |doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-3-90 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/90 |pmid = 19737387 |pmc = 2749052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bistability can be generated by a positive feedback loop with an ultrasensitive regulatory step.  Positive feedback loops, such as the simple X activates Y and Y activates X motif, essentially links output signals to their input signals and have been noted to be an important regulatory motif in cellular signal transduction because positive feedback loops can create switches with an all-or-nothing decision.&lt;ref name="O. Brandman, J. E 2005"&gt;O. Brandman, J. E. Ferrell Jr., R. Li, T. Meyer, Science 310, 496 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that numerous biological systems, such as ''Xenopus'' oocyte maturation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ferrell JE Jr. |author2=Machleder EM |title=The biochemical basis of an all-or-none cell fate switch in Xenopus oocytes.|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=895–8|pmid=9572732|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.895}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; mammalian calcium signal transduction, and polarity in budding yeast, incorporate temporal (slow and fast) positive feedback loops, or more than one feedback loop that occurs at different times.&lt;ref name="O. Brandman, J. E 2005"/&gt; Having two different temporal positive feedback loops or “dual-time switches” allows for (a) increased regulation: two switches that have independent changeable activation and deactivation times; and (b) linked feedback loops on multiple timescales can filter noise.&lt;ref name="O. Brandman, J. E 2005"/&gt;

Bistability can also arise in a biochemical system only for a particular range of parameter values, where the parameter can often be interpreted as the strength of the feedback. In several typical examples, the system has only one stable fixed point at low values of the parameter. A [[saddle-node bifurcation]] gives rise to a pair of new fixed points emerging, one stable and the other unstable, at a critical value of the parameter. The unstable solution can then form another saddle-node bifurcation with the initial stable solution at a higher value of the parameter, leaving only the higher fixed solution. Thus, at values of the parameter between the two critical values, the system has two stable solutions. An example of a dynamical system that demonstrates similar features is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = r + \frac{x^5}{1+x^5} - x
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the output, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter, acting as the input.&lt;ref name="Angeli 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Angeli, David| author2=Ferrell, JE| author3=Sontag, Eduardo D| title=Detection of multistability, bifurcations, and hysteresis in a large calss of biological positive-feedback systems| journal=PNAS| year=2003| volume=101| issue=7| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/7/1822| doi=10.1073/pnas.0308265100| pmid=14766974| pmc=357011| pages=1822–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bistability can be modified to be more robust and to tolerate significant changes in concentrations of reactants, while still maintaining its "switch-like" character.  Feedback on both the activator of a system and inhibitor make the system able to tolerate a wide range of concentrations.  An example of this in cell biology is that activated CDK1 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1) activates its activator Cdc25 while at the same time inactivating its inactivator, Wee1, thus allowing for progression of a cell into mitosis.  Without this double feedback, the system would still be bistable, but would not be able to tolerate such a wide range of concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ferrell JE Jr.|title=Feedback regulation of opposing enzymes generates robust, all-or-none bistable responses|journal=Current Biology|year=2008|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MiamiImageURL&amp;_cid=272099&amp;_user=10&amp;_pii=S0960982208001814&amp;_check=y&amp;_origin=&amp;_coverDate=25-Mar-2008&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLzVlV-zSkzk&amp;md5=68c1e4cd1871b9bbf09f2ade972e0d04/1-s2.0-S0960982208001814-main.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.035|pages=R244–R245|pmid=18364225|pmc=2832910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bistability has also been described in the embryonic development of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' (the fruit fly). Examples are anterior-posterior &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Francisco J. P.|author2=Vieira, Fernando M.

A prime example of bistability in biological systems is that of [[Sonic hedgehog]] (Shh), a secreted signaling molecule, which plays a critical role in development. Shh functions in diverse processes in development, including patterning limb bud tissue differentiation. The Shh signaling network behaves as a bistable switch, allowing the cell to abruptly switch states at precise Shh concentrations. ''gli1'' and ''gli2'' transcription is activated by Shh, and their gene products act as transcriptional activators for their own expression and for targets downstream of Shh signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Lai, K., M.J. Robertson, and D.V. Schaffer, The sonic hedgehog signaling system as a bistable genetic switch. Biophys J, 2004. 86(5): p. 2748-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the Shh signaling network is controlled by a negative feedback loop wherein the Gli transcription factors activate the enhanced transcription of a repressor (Ptc). This signaling network illustrates the simultaneous positive and negative feedback loops whose exquisite sensitivity helps create a bistable switch.

Bistability can only arise in biological and chemical systems if three necessary conditions are fulfilled: positive [[feedback]], a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent increase without bound.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt;

Bistable chemical systems have been studied extensively to analyze relaxation kinetics, [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], [[stochastic resonance]], as well as [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt; In bistable spatially extended systems the onset of local correlations and propagation of traveling waves have been analyzed.&lt;ref name=Elf&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Elf |first1 = J. | last2 = Ehrenberg| first2 = M. |year = 2004 |title = Spontaneous separation of bi-stable biochemical systems into spatial domains of opposite phases |journal = Systems Biology (Stevenage) |volume = 1 |number = 2| pages = 230–236 |pmid = 17051695 | doi=10.1049/sb:20045021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kochanzyck&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kochanczyk |first1 = M. |last2 = Jaruszewicz |first2 = J. |last3 = Lipniacki |first3 = T. |title = Stochastic transitions in a bistable reaction system on the membrane |journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume = 10 |number = 84 |pages = 20130151 |pmid = 23635492 |pmc = 3673150 |doi =  10.1098/rsif.2013.0151 |date=Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bistability is often accompanied by [[hysteresis]]. On a population level, if many realisations of a bistable system are considered (e.g. many bistable cells ([[speciation]])&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite journal |author = Nielsen |last2 = Dolganov |first2 = Nadia A. |last3 = Rasmussen |first3 = Thomas |last4 = Otto |first4 = Glen |last5 = Miller |first5 = Michael C. |last6 = Felt |first6 = Stephen A. |last7 = Torreilles |first7 = Stéphanie |last8 = Schoolnik |first8 = Gary K. |editor1-last = Isberg |year = 2010 |editor1-first = Ralph R. |title = A Bistable Switch and Anatomical Site Control Vibrio cholerae Virulence Gene Expression in the Intestine |journal = PLOS Pathogens |volume = 6 |issue = 9 |pages = 1 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001102

In an ensemble average over the population, the result may simply look like a smooth transition, thus showing the value of single-cell resolution.

== In mechanical systems ==
Bistability is the ability of a material to present in two stable phases that can both exist within a given range of temperatures but above and below that range only one or the other phase exists.

Bistability as applied in the design of mechanical systems is more commonly said to be "over centre"—that is, work is done on the system to move it just past the peak, at which point the mechanism goes "over centre" to its secondary stable position. The result is a toggle-type action- work applied to the system below a threshold sufficient to send it 'over center' results in no change to the mechanism's state.

[[spring (device)|Springs]] are a common method of achieving an "over centre" action. A spring attached to a simple two position ratchet-type mechanism can create a button or plunger that is clicked or toggled between two mechanical states. Many [[Ballpoint Pen|ballpoint]] and [[Rollerball Pen|rollerball]] retractable pens employ this type of bistable mechanism.

An even more common example of an over-center device is an ordinary electric wall switch.  These switches are often designed to snap firmly into the "on" or "off" position once the toggle handle has been moved a certain distance past the center-point.

A [[ratchet (device)|ratchet-and-pawl]] is an elaboration—a multi-stable "over center" system used to create irreversible motion.  The pawl goes over center as it is turned in the forward direction. In this case, "over center" refers to the ratchet being stable and "locked" in a given position until clicked forward again; it has nothing to do with the ratchet being unable to turn in the reverse direction.

The forms of '''Chinese furniture''' evolved along three distinct lineages which dates back to 1000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, G. "Chinese Domestic Furniture in Photographs and Measured Drawings" pp. XV-XXXIII, Dover Publications, Inc., 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  based on ''frame and panel'', ''yoke and rack'' (based on post and rail seen in architecture) and ''bamboo'' construction techniques.  Chinese home [[furniture]] evolved independently of Western furniture into many similar forms including chairs, tables, stools, cupboards, cabinets, beds and sofas.  Until about the 10th century CE the Chinese sat on mats or low platforms using low tables, in typical Asian style, but then gradually moved to using high tables with chairs.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese furniture is mostly in plain polished wood, but from at least the [[Song dynasty]] the most luxurious pieces often used [[lacquer]] to cover the whole or parts of the visible areas.  All the various sub-techniques of [[Lacquerware#Chinese_lacquerware|Chinese lacquerware]] can be found on furniture, and become increasingly affordable down the social scale, and so widely used, from about the [[Ming dynasty]] onwards.  [[carved lacquer]] furniture was at first only affordable by the imperial family or the extremely rich, but by the 19th century was merely very expensive, and mostly found in smaller pieces or as decorated areas on larger ones.  It was especially popular on screens, which were common in China. Lacquer inlaid with [[mother of pearl]] was especially a technique used on furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese furniture is usually light where possible, anticipating Europe by several centuries in this respect.  Practical fittings in metal such as hinges, lock plates, drawer handles and protective plates at edges or feet are used, and often given considerable emphasis, but compared to classic fine European furniture purely decorative metal mounts were rare.  From the [[Qing dynasty]] furniture made for export, mostly to Europe, became a distinct style, generally made in rather different shapes to suit the destination markets and highly decorated in lacquer and other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese furniture for sitting or lying on was very often used with cushions, but textiles and upholstery are not, until very late historical periods, incorporated into the piece itself in the Western manner.  [[Openwork]] in carved wood or other techniques is very typical for practical purposes such as chair-backs, and also for decoration.  The Ming period is regarded as the "golden age" of Chinese furniture, though very few examples of earlier pieces survive. Ming styles have largely set the style for furniture in traditional Chinese style in subsequent periods, though as in other areas of [[Chinese art]], the 18th and 19th centuries saw increasing prosperity used for sometimes excessively elaborated pieces, as wider groups in society were able to imitate court styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
What is now considered the Chinese aesthetic had its origins in [[China]] as far back as 1500–1000 BC. The furniture present in some of the artwork from that early period shows woven mats on elevated floors, sometimes accompanied by arm rests, providing seating accompanied by low tables. In this early period both unadorned and intricately engraved and painted pieces were already developing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinese-furniture.com/c_furniture/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  High chairs, usually single ones, had existed as status symbols, effectively [[throne]]s, since at least the [[Eastern Zhou]] period (771–256 BCE), but were not used with tables at the same level.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;    

[[Buddhism]], entering China around AD 200, brought with it the idea of (the Buddha) sitting upon a raised platform instead of simply mats. The platform was adopted as an honorific seat for special guests and dignitaries or officials. Longer versions were then used for reclining as well, which eventually evolved into the bed and daybed. Taller versions evolved into higher tables as well. The folding stool also proliferated similarly, after it was adapted from designs developed by nomadic tribes to the North and West, who used them for both their convenience and light weight in many applications such as mounting horses. Later, woven hourglass-shaped stools evolved; a design still in use today throughout China.

Some of the styles now widely regarded as Chinese began appearing more prominently in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD). It is here that evidence of early versions of the round and yoke back chairs are found, generally used by the elite. By the next two Dynasties (the Northern and Southern [[Song dynasty|Song]]) the use of varying types of furniture, including chairs, benches, and stools was common throughout Chinese society.  Two particular developments were recessed legs and waisted tables. Newer and more complex designs were generally limited to official and higher class use.

It was from this basis that more modern Chinese furniture developed its distinguishing characteristics. Use of thick lacquer finish and detailed engraving and painted decoration as well as pragmatic design elements would continue to flourish. Significant foreign design influence would not be felt until increased contact with the West began in the 19th century, due to efforts on the part of the ruling elite to limit trade.

During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties previous bans on imports were lifted, allowing for larger quantities and varieties of woods to flood in from other parts of Asia. The use of denser wood led to much finer work, including more elaborate joinery.  A Ming [[Chinese lacquerware table|Imperial table entirely covered in carved lacquer]], now in London, is one of the finest survivals of the period.

==Four categories==
Chinese furniture traditionally consisted of four distinct categories, all formed by the mid Qing dynasty, but each with its own unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110119040216/http://web.peopledaily.com.cn/shch/199907/20/newfiles/F108.html Traditional Categories of Chinese furnitures]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Beijing]] category (京式家具): characterized by its simple build, directly developed from Ming Dynasty furnitures.
*[[Guangzhou]] category (广式家具): incorporating western influence, fully formed in the 19th century but dating back to at least 17th century&lt;ref&gt;[https://read01.com/e4kB0.html 廣式家具與嶺南文化]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Characterized by the adoptation of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] artistic styles, use of native timbers in the Lingnan region, and the decorative mounting of marble and the shells of shellfish.
*[[Shanghai]] category (海式家具): characterized by its decrorative carving and carved lacquer.
*[[Suzhou]] category (苏式家具): opposite to the Beijing category, characterized by its elaborate decoration, developed from early Qing Dynasty furnitures.

==Material==
Classic Chinese furniture is typically made of a class of hardwoods, known collectively as "rosewood" (紅木, literally "red wood"). These woods are denser than water, fine grained, and high in oils and resins. These properties make them dimensionally stable, hardwearing, rot and insect resistant, and when new, highly fragrant. The density and toughness of the wood also allows furniture to be built without the use of glue and nail, but rather constructed from joinery and doweling alone. According to the Chinese industry standards the woods are grouped into eight classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=乡土 |date=2010-09-01 |title=红木宝贝 |publisher=CCTV1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA-l5MXU3fI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=国家标准红木分类 |date=2010-06-20 |publisher=北京秋翁堂古典家具有限公司 |url=http://www.qiuwengtang.com/index.php?_m=mod_article&amp;_a=article_content&amp;_r=_page&amp;article_id=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furniture and carving made from these woods are typically referred to, in the market, as "hongmu furniture" (紅木家具, literally "rosewood furniture"). Due to [[overlogging]] for the said furniture, most of the species are either [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]].

==Construction==
[[File:Yangminshan Zhongshan Furnishings.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chinese furniture in [[Taipei]]'s [[Zhongshan Building]]]]
Construction of traditional wooden Chinese furniture is based primarily of solid wood pieces connected solely using [[woodworking joints]], and rarely using glue or metallic nails. The reason was that the nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Michael Huntley demystifies the furniture making techniques of Chinese craftsmen prior to 1900 |first=Michael |last=Huntley |date=20 January 2009 |publisher=GMC Publications |journal=Wood Worker's Institute |url=http://s1074.photobucket.com/user/mrconstantinela/media/ttjvj-ujp7f_zpsceo6lbix.jpg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the oily and resinous woods used in Chinese furniture generally do not glue well, even when pre-cleaned with modern industrial solvents.

Platform construction is based on box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods.  While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, different parts of the construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction.  First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets.  Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two mitered vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached to the bottom of the feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way mitered corners.  Unlike European-derived styles, table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the mitered joints, especially the 3-way mitered joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.

The Yoke and Rack construction differs critically in the way that the legs of the piece are joined to the horizontal portion (be it tabletop, seat or cabinet carcass) using a type of wedged mortise-and-tenon joint where the end grain of the leg is visible as a circle in the frame of the tabletop. The cross-pieces (stretchers in the western equivalent) are joined through mortise-and-tenon joinery as well. The legs and stretchers are commonly round rather than square or curvilinear. The simplest pieces are simply four splayed legs attached to a solid top, but more complicated  pieces contain decorative brackets, drawers and metal latches. Cabinets in this style typically have an overhanging top similar to western-style cabinetry.

Bamboo construction style, although historically rooted in pieces made from bamboo, later saw many pieces made from hardwood with patterning to imitate the look of bamboo, or simply in the style of previous pieces made from bamboo. The construction is more similar to the Yoke and Rack style with some apparent crossover.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}
A '''concrete mixer''' (often colloquially called a '''cement mixer''') is a device that homogeneously combines [[cement]], [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] such as sand or gravel, and [[water]] to form [[concrete]]. A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works, portable concrete mixers are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified [[tarpaulin|tarps]] for this purpose.

The concrete mixer was invented by [[Columbus, Ohio]] [[industrialist]] Gebhardt Jaeger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Henry L. | last=Hunker | year=2000 | title=Columbus, Ohio: A Personal Geography | pages=196 | ISBN=978-0-8142-0857-1 | publisher=Ohio State University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial mixers==

Today's market increasingly requires consistent [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneity]] and short mixing times for the industrial production of [[ready-mix concrete]], and more so for precast/prestressed concrete. This has resulted in refinement of mixing technologies for concrete production. Different styles of stationary mixers have been developed, each with its own inherent strengths targeting different parts of the concrete production market. The most common mixers used today fall into three categories:

[[File:Twin shaft concrete mixer.JPG|330px|thumbnail|right|Twin shaft concrete mixer for [[concrete plant]]]]
*Twin-shaft mixers, known for their high intensity mixing, and short mixing times. These mixers are typically used for high strength concrete, RCC and SCC, typically in batches of {{convert|2|–|6|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}}.
*Vertical axis mixers, most commonly used for precast and prestressed concrete. This style of mixer cleans well between batches, and is favoured for coloured concrete, smaller batches (typically {{convert|0.75|–|3|m3|cuyd|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and multiple discharge points. Within this category, the pan mixers are losing popularity to the more efficient planetary (or counter-current) mixers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concrete-machinery.com/concrete-mixing-plants/concrete-mixing-machines|title=Photos planetary mixer|last=|first= |publisher=Rometa Editor|work (or website)=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the additional mixing action helps in production of more critical concrete mixes (colour consistency, SCC, etc.).
*Drum mixers ([[reversing drum mixer]] and tilting drum mixers), used where large volumes (batch sizes of {{convert|3|–|9|m3|cuyd|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are being produced. This type of mixer is capable of high production outputs.

All the mixer styles have their own inherent strengths and weaknesses, and all are used throughout the world to varying degrees of popularity.

==Trucks and trailers==

===Concrete mixing transport trucks===

[[File:Operation of a truck mixer.gif|thumb|250px|Operating diagram of a concrete mixer]]

Special concrete transport [[truck]]s (in-transit mixers) are made to mix concrete and transport it to the construction site. They can be charged with dry materials and water, with the mixing occurring during transport. They can also be loaded from a "central mix" plant; with this process the material has already been mixed prior to loading. The concrete mixing transport truck maintains the material's liquid state through agitation, or turning of the drum, until delivery. The interior of the drum on a concrete mixing truck is fitted with a [[spiral]] [[blade]]. In one rotational direction, the concrete is pushed deeper into the drum. This is the direction the drum is rotated while the concrete is being transported to the building site. This is known as "charging" the mixer. When the drum rotates in the other direction, the [[Archimedes' screw]]-type arrangement "discharges", or forces the concrete out of the drum. From there it may go onto chutes to guide the viscous concrete directly to the job site. If the truck cannot get close enough to the site to use the chutes, the concrete may be discharged into a [[concrete pump]], connected to a flexible hose, or onto a conveyor belt which can be extended some distance (typically ten or more metres). A pump provides the means to move the material to precise locations, multi-floor buildings, and other distance-prohibitive locations. Buckets suspended from cranes are also used to place the concrete.
The drum is traditionally made of steel but on some newer trucks, fibreglass has been used as a weight reduction measure.

[[File:Ready Mix Concrete Truck.jpg|thumb|Terex Advance front discharge truck with three lift axles including one tag axle]]
[[File:CementMixerM2439.jpg|thumb|This Kayaba Rocket concrete mixer delivers concrete in Japan.]]

"Rear discharge" trucks require both a driver and a "chuteman" to guide the truck and chute back and forth to place concrete in the manner suitable to the contractor. Newer "front discharge" trucks have controls inside the cab of the truck to allow the driver to move the chute in all directions. The first front discharge mixer was designed and built by Royal W. Sims of Holladay, Utah, United States.

Concrete mixers are equipped with two or more axles. Four-, five- and six-axle trucks are the most common,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} with the number being determined by the load and local legislation governing allowable loads on the road.

The axles are necessary to distribute the load evenly, allow operation on weight restricted roads, and reduce wear and tear on normal roads. A two- or three-axle truck during the winter when road weight limits are reduced has no usable payload in many jurisdictions. Other areas may require expensive permits to operate.

Additional axles other than those used for steering ("steers") or drivetrain ("drives") may be installed between the steers and drives, or behind the drives. Mixers commonly have multiple steering axles as well, which generally result in very large turning radii. To facilitate maneuvering, the additional axles may be "lift axles", which allows them to be raised off the ground so that they do not scrub (get dragged sideways across the ground) on tight turns, or increase the vehicle's turning radius. Axles installed behind the drives are known as "tag axles" or "booster axles", and are often equipped to turn opposite to the steering axle to reduce scrubbing and automatically lift when the truck is put into a reverse gear.

Tractor trailer combination mixers where the mixer is installed on a trailer instead of a truck chassis are used in some jurisdictions, such as the province of Quebec where even six-axle trucks would have trouble carrying a useful load.{{clarification needed|date=May 2018}}

Concrete mixers generally do not travel far from their plant, as the concrete begins to set as soon as it is in the truck. Many contractors require that the concrete be in place within 90 minutes after loading. If the truck breaks down or for some other reason the concrete hardens in the truck, workers may need to enter the barrel with jackhammers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/TOPICS/silica/pdfs/CT-247-19-readymix.pdf|title=Control Technology for Ready-mix Truck Drum Cleaning|last=|first= |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|date=31 May 2001 |work (or website)=|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Stepanian]] filed a patent application for the first truck mixer in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cement.org/basics/concreteproducts_readymix.asp Portland Cement Association: History of Ready Mixed Concrete] industry site&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trucks weigh {{convert|20000|to|30000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, and can carry roughly {{convert|40000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} of concrete although many varying sizes of Mixer Truck are currently in use. The most common truck capacity is {{convert|8|cuyd|m3|1}}.

Most concrete mixers in the UK are limited to a speed of {{convert|56|mph|km/h}}.

===Concrete mixer trailers===
[[File:CartAwayMixingTrailer.JPG|thumbnail|left|150px|1 cubic yard (0.76 m³) cart-away mixing trailer]]
A variant of standard concrete transportation is the concrete or cement mixing trailer. These small versions of transit-mix trucks are used to supply short loads of concrete. They have a concrete mixing drum with a capacity of between {{convert|1|and|1.75|cuyd|m3}}. Cart-aways are usually pulled behind a pick-up truck and batched from smaller batching systems. The mixing trailer system is popular with rental yards and building material locations, which use them to supply ready-mix to their regular customer base.

Metered concrete trucks or volumetric mobile mixers contain concrete ingredient materials and water to be mixed on the truck at the job site to make and deliver concrete according to the amount needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Jon M.|title=Parmer Metered Concrete offers precision and quality|url=http://hardhat.com/parmer-metered-concrete-offers-precision-and-quality/|website=Hard Hat News|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-site and portable concrete mixers==
[[File:Cement mixer2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|This portable concrete/mortar mixer has [[wheel]]s and a towing tongue so that it can be towed by a motor vehicle and moved around the worksite by hand, and its [[rotation]] is powered by [[mains electricity]]. The lever allows the concrete/mortar to be tipped into a [[wheelbarrow]].]]
[[File:ConcreteMixer4.JPG|right|thumb|150px|An outdated model of a small-scale concrete mixer. These older mixers are heavy and can not be moved as easily. They are still self-powered with electric motors.]]
For smaller jobs, such as residential repairs, renovations, or hobbyist-scale projects, many cubic yards of concrete are usually not required. Bagged cement is readily available in small-batch sizes, and aggregate and water are easily obtained in small quantities for the small work site. To service this small-batch concrete market, there many types of small portable concrete mixers are available.

A typical portable concrete mixer uses a small revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller jobs the concrete made at the construction site has no time lost in transport, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens.

Portable concrete mixers may be powered by gasoline engines, although it is more common that they are powered by electric motors using standard mains current.

These concrete mixers are further divided based on their loading mechanism. Cement, sand and other aggregates are loaded in a hydraulically operated hopper and then poured into the mixing drum for final mixing. They can be unloaded by tilting the drum. In hand-feed concrete mixers, cement, sand and other aggregates are directly added to the mixing drum manually. These both type of concrete mixers are popular in construction activities in Africa, some Middle Eastern countries and in the Indian subcontinent.

==Self-loading concrete mixers==

Self-loading concrete mixers are unique machines designed to batch, mix and transport concrete. They consist of a rotating drum mounted on an operator-driven cab-mounted chassis frame fitted with a loading bucket.

The operator of the self-loading concrete mixers batches and introduces the ingredients required for mixing concrete (cement, stone aggregates etc.) into the drum using the loading bucket. The drum is usually reversible type, tilt type or a combination of both. A predetermined volume of water is discharged to the drum via a water dispensing unit. The mixture is rotated at mixing speeds within the drum until the concrete discharges via a fitted chute.

Self-loading concrete mixers are suited for construction sites where concrete batching plants are unavailable, underfoot conditions are not suited for concrete transit mixer trucks or labor availability is scarce or constrained. Applications include urban and rural construction, concrete pavement maintenance, bridge and tunnel construction, township-level highways construction, foundation construction, national defense facilities, construction of high-speed railways, etc.

== Operating code ==
Operating concrete mixers correctly is one of the biggest safety issues in construction zones. Workers whose tasks are related to concrete processing currently{{when|date=May 2018}} number more than 250,000. Over 10 percent of those workers, 28,000, experienced a job-related injury or illness, and 42 died in just one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/horror-worker-mid-20s-killed-9812286|title=Horror as worker in mid 20s killed in 'concrete mixer accident' on building site|last=BAYNES|first=CHRIS|date=13 February 2017|work=Daily Mirror|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2017/03/man_killed_after_freak_cement_mixer_accident_cops.html|title=Man killed while cleaning cement mixer, cops say|last=Giovanny|first=Fausto|date=1 March 2017|work=New Jersey Local News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/concrete_manufacturing.html|title=Workers Safety Series:Concrete Manufacturing|last=Department of labor|first=|date=|website=osha.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction and culture==
*In ''[[Thomas and Friends]]'', Patrick is a concrete mixer who is dark red and cream.
*In ''[[Bob the Builder]]'', Dizzy is an orange on-site and portable concrete mixer and Tumbler is a yellow and green concrete transport truck (commonly called a cement truck). In the reboot of the series, Two-Tonne has a concrete mixer trailer.
*In the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise, [[Mixmaster (Transformers)|Mixmaster]] is a robot that can change into a cement truck.
*The ''Cement Truck'' is a gothic sculpture by [[Wim Delvoye]].

=== Television ===
* On an episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'', experiments were done to see if [[dynamite]] can be used to clean out hardened concrete from inside of a mixer truck, with limited practical results. For the finale, an excessive amount of explosive (800&amp;nbsp;lbs of commercial blasting agent) was used, and was detonated from a long distance away. The explosion left a very clear crater, and only the engine block was recovered.
* On an episode of ''[[Wrecked - Life In The Crash Lane]]'', O'Hare Towing responds to a call on a construction site to recover a mixer truck that had become stuck in mud, continuing to sink and threatening to roll over. After several unsuccessful attempts to hoist the mixer using a [[Tow truck|heavy rotator wrecker]], the foreman informs the wrecker driver that the mixing drum contains approximately 5 cubic yards of concrete, and asks whether emptying the drum would lighten the truck enough to enable the wrecker to recover it. After emptying the drum, the wrecker operator is able to winch the mixer truck out of the mud &amp; onto solid ground.
* In season 5, episode 1 of TV series ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', the series' main character uses an engine from a small portable gasoline powered concrete mixer, in order to build an aeroplane.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638733/|title=&amp;quot;MacGyver&amp;quot; Legend of the Holy Rose: Part 1 (TV Episode 1989) - IMDb|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Magicians [[Penn &amp; Teller]] perform a trick called "The Psychic Cement Mixer of Death" in which Teller is strapped blindfolded inside an empty, spinning concrete mixer and picks one half of a signed, broken brick (much like other tricks that tear a card or dollar bill in half) from dozens of other bricks spinning in the mixer. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY-Hr_Rpibo&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conveyor pulley''' is a mechanical device used to change the direction of the belt in a [[conveyor belt|conveyor system]], to drive the belt, and to tension the belt.  Modern pulleys are made of rolled shells with flexible end disks and locking assemblies.  Early pulley engineering was developed by Josef Sitzwohl &lt;ref name="Sitzwohl"&gt;Josef Sitzwohl, 1948 {{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Australia]] in 1948 and later by Helmuth Lange &lt;ref name="Lange"&gt;Helmut Lange, 1963 [[University of Hanover|Hannover University]] Ph.D. Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter Schmoltzi&lt;ref name="Schmoltzi"&gt;Schmoltzi, W, "Designing Drums with transverse Shafts for Belt Conveyors". Thesis for Doctorate in Engineering, Hannover, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Germany]].

==Components==

Pulleys are made up of several components including the shell, end disk, hub, shaft and locking assembly. The end disk and hub may be on piece. The locking assembly may also be replaced with a hub and bushing on lower tension pulleys. The shell is also referred to as the rim in some parts of the world.

The pulley shaft is typically sized following CEMA B105.1 in the Americas or AS 1403 in Australia.

'''Dichlorofluoromethane''' or '''Freon 21''' or '''R 21''' is a [[halomethane]] or [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon]]. It is a colorless and odorless gas.

Its critical point is at 178.5&amp;nbsp;°C (451.7 K) and 5.17 MPa (51.7 bar). At temperatures from 5 K to 105 K it has one phase in the [[space group]] Pbca.

==Uses==
Dichlorofluoromethane was used as a [[propellant]] and refrigerant, but due to its [[ozone depletion]] it has been set to be phased out. It has [[ozone depletion potential]] 0.04. Production and consumption has been since 2004 reduced to 15% of level from 1989 and it is to be phased out in 2015 according to [[Montreal Protocol]].

'''Digital Serial Interface''' ('''DSI''') is a [[communications protocol|protocol]] for the controlling of lighting in buildings (initially [[electrical ballast]]s).  It was created in 1991  by [[Austria]]n company [[Tridonic]] and is based on [[Manchester encoding|Manchester-coded]] 8-bit protocol, [[Baud rate|data rate]] of 1200 [[baud]], 1 start [[bit]], 8 data bits (dimming value), 4 stop bits, and is the basis of the more sophisticated protocol [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface]] (DALI).

The technology uses a single byte to communicate the lighting level (0-255 or 0x00-0xFF). DSI was the first use of digital communication in lighting control, and was the precursor to [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]].

==Advantages==
* Its simple nature makes it straightforward to understand, [[Implementation|implement]], and [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]], while its low voltage means it typically runs along relatively thin cables.
* Because each device has its own wire to the [[Controller (computing)|controller]] (rather than being part of a [[computer network|network]]) it has no need of an address to be set, so can be replaced simply by unplugging the faulty one and plugging in the new.
* It dims to off, so does not require mains switching equipment to turn them off.

==Disadvantages==
* It requires one wire per control channel so a sophisticated system could have hundreds of wires, thereby making diagnoses of problems difficult.
* It is a [[Property|proprietary]] standard initially exclusive to [[Zumtobel_Group#Tridonic|Tridonic]] and mainly brands of Tridonic's parent company [[Zumtobel]].

==Rival protocols==

===0-10V analog===
{{main|0-10 V lighting control}}

===ACN===
{{main|Architecture for Control Networks}}
ACN is an ANSI standard protocol adopted by the entertainment industry. It is based on Ethernet and is typically used as the backbone communication between controllers and control segments. To date few fixtures offer native ACN interface. Typically ACN is converted to DMX interface with strings of fixtures.

===DALI===
{{main|Digital Addressable Lighting Interface}}

DALI is an [[open standard]] for digital control of lighting. Several companies have adopted the DALI protocol in their product offerings. Even though DALI is an open standard, there are already versions of its implementation emerging in different lighting manufacturers products as they strive to provide a point of difference. DSI is essentially the same technology as DALI in terms of messaging, however, DSI eliminates the individual addressing aspect of each light fitting found in DALI.

===DMX===
{{main|DMX512}}
DMX is an ANSI standard protocol adopted by the entertainment industry worldwide which is also being offered on many architectural fixtures. DMX is built on ANSI standard RS-485 serial interface.

For [[open channel flow]] calculations where momentum can be assumed to be [[Momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#Conservation of Momentum|conserved]], such as in a hydraulic jump, we can equate the Momentum at an upstream location,''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, to that at a downstream location, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such that:  
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M_1=\frac{Q^2}{gA_1}+\overline y_1A_1=\frac{Q^2}{gA_2}+\overline y_2A_2=M_2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Momentum in a rectangular channel ===
In the unique circumstance where the flow is in a rectangular channel (such as a laboratory flume), we can describe this relationship as [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#The momentum equation for horizontal, rectangular channels|unit momentum]], by dividing both sides of the equation by the width of the channel.  This produces &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M in terms of ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is given by the equation: &lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_1}=\frac{q^2}{gy_1}+ \frac{y_1^2}{2} =\frac{q^2}{gy_2}+ \frac{y_2^2}{2}={_uM_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:{|
|where:	
* &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M is M/b [L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]
* q is Q/b [L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T]
* b is the base width of the rectangular channel [L]
|}

=== Why is momentum important? ===
Momentum is one of the most important basic definitions in [[Fluid mechanics|Fluid Mechanics]]. The conservation of momentum is one of the three fundamental physical principles in both Fluid Mechanics and [Open-channel flow | open channel flow] (the other two are mass conservation and energy conservation). This principle leads to the momentum equation set in three dimensions (x, y and z). With different assumptions, these momentum equations can be simplified to several widely applied forms:

With Newton’s second law, [[Newtonian fluids]] assumption and Stokes hypothesis, the original fluid momentum equations are derived as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. These equations are classic in Fluid Mechanics, but the nonlinearity in these partial differential equations make them difficult to solve mathematically. As a result, analytical solutions for the Navier–Stokes equations still remain a tough research topic.

For high Reynolds number flow, the effects of viscosity are negligible. In these cases, with the inviscid assumption, [[Navier–Stokes equations]] can be derived as [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. Though they are still nonlinear partial differential equations, the elimination of viscous terms simplifies the problem.

In some applications, when viscosity, [[Conservative vector field|rotationality]] and [[incompressible flow|compressibility]] of the fluid can be neglected, the Navier–Stokes equations can be further simplified to the Laplace equation form, which is referred as [[potential flow]].

In [[computational fluid dynamics]], solving the partial differential momentum equations mentioned above with discretized algebraic equations is the most important procedure to study flow characteristics in different applications.

Momentum also allows us to describe the characteristics of flow when energy is not conserved. [[HEC-RAS]], a widely used computer model developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers for calculating water surface profiles, considers that when flow passes through critical depth, the basic assumption of gradually varied flow required for the Energy Equation is not applicable. Locations where flow may make such a transition include: significant changes in slope, channel geometry (e.g. bridge sections), grade control structures, and the confluence of water bodies. In these instances, HEC-RAS will use a form of the momentum equation to solve for the water surface elevation at an unknown location.

In addition, momentum flux is one of the parameters to estimate fluid impact on offshore structures. Analysis of momentum flux in coastal regions can provide advisable infrastructure layout planning to minimize the potential hazards from extreme events such as storm surge, hurricane and tsunami (e.g. (Park et al. 2013), (Yeh 2006), (Guard et al. 2005) and (Chanson et al. 2002)).

=== What are the characteristics of momentum? ===
For discussion, we will consider an ideal, frictionless, [[Momentum-depth relationship in a rectangular channel|rectangular channel]].  For each value of q, a [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular rhannel#The M-y Diagram|unique curve]] can be produced where ''M'' is shown as a function of depth.  As is the case for specific energy, the minimum value of &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M, &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponds to [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#Critical flow|critical depth]].  For each value of &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M greater than &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;, there are two depths that can occur.  These are called conjugate depths, and represent supercritical and subcritical alternatives for flow of a given &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M.  Since [[Hydraulic Jumps in Rectangular Channels|hydraulic jumps]] conserve momentum, if the depth at the upstream or downstream end of a hydraulic jump is known, we can determine the unknown depth by drawing a vertical line through the known depth and reading its conjugate. The M-y diagram below shows three M-y curves with unit discharge 10, 15
and 20&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s. It can be observed that the M-y curves shift in positive M axis as the q value increases. From the M-y equation mentioned earlier, as y increases to infinity, the q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / gy&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; term would be negligible, and the M value will converge to 0.5y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (shown as the black dashed curve in M-y diagram). By taking the derivative dM / dy = 0, we can also obtain the equation of minimum M with different q values:&lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{dy} = y_c - \frac{q^2}{gy_c^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

By eliminating the term of q in the equation above with the relationship between q and y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = ( q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / g )&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; ), and put the resulting equation of y into the original M-y ccg3 c
equation, we can obtain the characteristic curve of critical M and y (shown as the red dashed curve in M-y diagram):
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y_c = \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{M_c} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Dimensionless M’-y’ diagram ==

=== Why do we need dimensionless momentum–depth relationship? ===
Conjugate depths can be determined from curves like the one above.  However, since this curve is unique for q = 20&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s, we would have to develop a new curve for each rectangular channel of a given base width (or discharge).  If we can establish a dimensionless relationship, we can apply the curve to any problem in which the cross-section is rectangular in shape.  To create a dimensionless momentum–depth relationship, we will divide both sides by a normalizing value that will allow us to use a dimensionless relationship between Momentum and Depth for all values of ''q''.

=== Derivation of the dimensionless momentum–depth relationship ===
Given that:  
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_1}=\frac{q^2}{gy_1}+ \frac{y_1^2}{2} =\frac{q^2}{gy_2}+ \frac{y_2^2}{2}={_uM_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and that:  
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{q^2}={gy_c^3}&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
according to the [[Buckingham pi theorem|Buckingham {{pi}} theorem]], with dimensional analysis, we can normalize the relationship between depth and Momentum by dividing both by the value of the critical depth squared and substituting for q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to yield:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{_uM}{y_c^2} = \frac{gy_c^3}{gyy_c^2} + \frac{y^2}{2y_c^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
:{|
|where:	
* y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical depth.
|}&lt;br /&gt;
If we let M’ = &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M/y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and y’ = y/y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, this equation becomes: 
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M'= \frac{1}{y'} + \frac{y'^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;  
|}

=== The dimensionless momentum–depth diagram ===
By applying the conversion to dimensionless units described above, the dimensionless momentum–depth diagram is produced below.
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| [[File:Dimensionless M-y.png|400px]]
|}

=== What is the relationship between the dimensionless momentum–depth diagram and the dimensionless energy–depth diagram? ===
By close inspection of the [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow|dimensionless dnergy–depth]] diagram, an interesting conclusion can be drawn, which is that M’ is the same function of y’ as E’ is of 1/y’, and vice versa.  This is demonstrated in the following chart that compares favorably to the chart of the [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow|Dimensionless Energy-Depth]] Diagram.  Note that the only difference between the chart above and the one below is the values of the y-axis are the reciprocal of one another and that the scale has been changed to be consistent with the scale found in the discussion of [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow|Dimensionless Energy-Depth]]. &lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| [[File:Dimensionless M v y-inverse.png|400px]]
|}
Because Energy and Momentum have this reciprocal relationship (found also in the non-dimensionless forms of these relationships), we can use a Dimensionless Energy-Depth Diagram to create a dimensionless momentum–depth diagram, and vice versa.

== Solution of simple version of hydraulic jump with dimensionless diagram ==
To demonstrate the use of a dimensionless momentum–depth diagram in the solution of a simple [[hydraulic jumps in rectangular hcannels|hydraulic jump]] problem (hydraulic jump is also very common in other situations. Let’s consider a rectangular channel with a base width of 10&amp;nbsp;ft, and a flow rate of 100&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, with a tailwater induced downstream depth of 6&amp;nbsp;ft.  What is the depth of flow at the upstream end of the hydraulic jump?

'''Step 1''' – Calculate q: 
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{Q}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{100 ft^3/s}{10 ft}=10ft^2/s&lt;/math&gt;
|}
'''Step 2''' – Calculate y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y_c=\sqrt[3]{q^2 \over g}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_c=\sqrt[3]{{(10 ft^2/s)}^2 \over 32.2 ft/s^2}=1.459 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| (note-calculations are displayed to 3 decimal places to reduce rounding errors in '''Step 6''')
|}

'''Step 3''' – Calculate y’ for the downstream depth:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{y_d}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{6 ft}{1.46 ft}=4.112&lt;/math&gt;
|}
'''Step 4''' – Determine Conjugate Dimensionless Depth from Chart:

Using the Dimensionless Chart presented above, plot y’ = 4.11 over to its intersection with the M’ curve.  Read down the chart to find the conjugate depth and determine the new y’ from the left axis.
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| [[File:Solution plot.png|400px|Solution plot]]
|}
'''Step 5''' – Calculate the upstream (conjugate) depth to  6&amp;nbsp;ft by converting y’ = 0.115 to its actual depth:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{y_u}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;{y_u}={y'}{y_c}=0.115(1.459ft)=0.168 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|}
'''Step 6''' – Validation:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_u}=\frac{q^2}{gy_1}+ \frac{y_1^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_u}=\frac{10^2}{(32.2)0.168}+ \frac{0.168^2}{2}=18.500ft^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_d}=\frac{q^2}{gy_2}+ \frac{y_2^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_d}=\frac{10^2}{(32.2)6}+ \frac{6^2}{2}=18.518ft^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
The difference between &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is shown as 0.18&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; due to rounding errors.  Therefore, &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are shown to represent the same unit momentum across the jump and momentum is conserved, validating the calculations using the Dimensionless Chart above.

This topic contribution was made in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Virginia Tech, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering course: CEE 5984 – Open Channel Flow during the Fall 2010 semester.

== Solution of hydraulic jump with sluice gate ==
The following example of a hydraulic jump at a [[Sluice|sluice gate]] outlet will give a clear idea about how conservation of energy and conservation of momentum apply in open channel flow.

As shown in the middle panel in schematic plot, in a rectangular channel, deep upstream flow (position 1) encounters a sluice gate in front of position 2. A sluice gate imposes adecrease in flow depth at position 2, and a hydraulic jump is formed between position 2 and far downstream where the flow depth increases again (position 3). The left panel in Figure 2 shows the M-y diagram of these 3 positions (momentum is also referred to as other definitions in different references, e.g. “Specific Force” in (Chaudhry 2008)), while the right panel in schematic plot shows the [[Energy–depth relationship in a rectangular channel|E-y]] diagram for these 3 positions. Energy loss can be neglected between position 1 and 2 (e.g. assuming conservation of energy), but the external thrust on the gate causes significant momentum loss. By contrast, between positions 2 and 3, turbulence in the hydraulic jump dissipates energy, while the momentum can be assumed to be conserved. If we know the unit discharge as q = 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s and the flow depth at position 1 as y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.0&amp;nbsp;ft, by applying energy conservation between position 1 &amp; 2 and momentum conservation between 2 &amp; 3, the flow depths at position 2 (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 3 (y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be computed.

Applying [[Energy–depth relationship in a rectangular channel|conservation of energy]] between position 1 &amp; 2:

{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_1 + \frac{q^2}{2gy_1} = y_2 + \frac{q^2}{2gy_2} = 8.02 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_2 = \frac{2y_1}{-1 + \sqrt{1+8\frac{gy_1^3}{q^2}}} =0.45 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Applying conservation of momentum between position 2 &amp; 3:

{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M_2 = M_3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_2}{2} + \frac{q^2}{gy_2} = \frac{y_3}{2} + \frac{q^2}{gy_3} = 32.4 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_3 = \frac{y_2}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{1+8\frac{q^2}{gy_2^3}}) = 3.46 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In addition, we can obtain the thrust on the sluice gate as well:

{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;\triangle{M} = M_1 - M_2 = 25.5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;Thrust = \gamma \triangle{M} = \rho g \triangle{M} = 1590 lbs/ff&lt;/math&gt;
|}

(The example above comes from Dr. Moglen’s “Open Channel Flow” course (CEE5384) in Virginia Tech, U.S.)

'''Dysprosium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Dy''' and [[atomic number]] 66. It is a [[rare earth element]] with a metallic silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as [[xenotime]]. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s, the most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of which is &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy.

Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of [[ion exchange]] techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in [[nuclear reactor]]s, for its high [[magnetic susceptibility]] in data storage applications, and as a component of [[Terfenol-D]] (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[Image:Dysprosium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|left|Dysprosium sample]]
Dysprosium is a [[rare earth element]] that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is quite soft, and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected by even small amounts of impurities.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{Cite book| editor = Lide, David R.| chapter = Dysprosium| year = 2007–2008| title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics| volume = 4| pages = 11| location = New York| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-0488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysprosium and [[holmium]] have the highest magnetic strengths of the elements,&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt; especially at low temperatures.&lt;ref name="krebs"/&gt; Dysprosium has a simple [[ferromagnetic]] ordering at temperatures below {{convert|85|K|C}}. Above {{convert|85|K|C}}, it turns into a helical [[antiferromagnetic]] state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular [[basal plane]] layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered ([[paramagnetic]]) state at {{convert|179|K|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = IRM Quarterly|year = 2000|volume = 10|issue = 3|page = 6|author = Jackson, Mike|url =http://www.irm.umn.edu/quarterly/irmq10-3.pdf|title=Wherefore Gadolinium? Magnetism of the Rare Earths|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Dysprosium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form [[dysprosium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Dy + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Dysprosium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water (and quite quickly with hot water) to form dysprosium hydroxide:
:2 Dy (s) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 Dy(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Dysprosium metal vigorously reacts with all the halogens at above 200&amp;nbsp;°C:
:2 Dy (s) + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [green]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [white]

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of dysprosium}}
Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;156&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;158&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;160&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;161&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;162&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;163&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, and &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy. These are all considered stable, although &lt;sup&gt;156&lt;/sup&gt;Dy decays by [[alpha decay]] with a half-life of over 1×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy is the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] at 28%, followed by &lt;sup&gt;162&lt;/sup&gt;Dy at 26%. The least abundant is &lt;sup&gt;156&lt;/sup&gt;Dy at 0.06%.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nubase2003 Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|issue=1|pages=3–128|year=2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|author=Audi, G.|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A. H.|url=http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184|citeseerx=10.1.1.692.8504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-nine [[radioisotopes]] have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, with a [[half-life]] of approximately 3{{e|6}}&amp;nbsp;years, followed by &lt;sup&gt;159&lt;/sup&gt;Dy with a half-life of 144.4&amp;nbsp;days. The least stable is &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, with a half-life of 200&amp;nbsp;ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by [[Beta decay#β− decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. However, &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Dy and &lt;sup&gt;159&lt;/sup&gt;Dy decay primarily by [[electron capture]].&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt; Dysprosium also has at least 11 [[metastable isomer]]s, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;165m&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, which has a half-life of 1.257&amp;nbsp;minutes. &lt;sup&gt;149&lt;/sup&gt;Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, &lt;sup&gt;149m2&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, has a half-life of 28&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

==History==
In 1878, [[erbium]] ores were found to contain the oxides of [[holmium]] and [[thulium]]. French chemist [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], while working with [[holmium oxide]], separated dysprosium oxide from it in [[Paris]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Comptes Rendus|volume = 143|pages = 1003–1006|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3058f/f1001.chemindefer|title = L'holmine (ou terre X de M Soret) contient au moins deux radicaux métallique (Holminia contains at least two metal)|language = French|year = 1886|author =  de Boisbaudran, Paul Émile Lecoq}}&lt;/ref&gt; His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid, then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide. He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure. On succeeding, he named the element ''dysprosium'' from the Greek ''dysprositos'' (δυσπρόσιτος), meaning "hard to get". The element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by [[Frank Spedding]] at [[Iowa State University]] in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=nbb&gt;{{cite book|last = Emsley| first = John| title = Nature's Building Blocks| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2001| location = Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA131|pages = 129–132| isbn = 978-0-19-850341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Xenotímio1.jpeg|thumb|Xenotime]]
While dysprosium is never encountered as a free element, it is found in many [[mineral]]s, including [[xenotime]], [[fergusonite]], [[gadolinite]], [[euxenite]], [[polycrase]], [[blomstrandine]], [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]], often with [[erbium]] and [[holmium]] or other rare earth elements. No dysprosium-dominant mineral (that is, with dysprosium prevailing over other rare earths in the composition) has yet been found.&lt;ref&gt;

In the high-[[yttrium]] version of these, dysprosium happens to be the most abundant of the heavy [[lanthanide]]s, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Russian Journal of Non-Ferrous Metals|year = 2008|volume = 49|issue = 1|pages = 14–22|title = Review of the World Market of Rare-Earth Metals|first = A.

==Production==
Dysprosium is obtained primarily from [[monazite]] sand, a mixture of various [[phosphate]]s. The metal is obtained as a by-product in the commercial extraction of yttrium. In isolating dysprosium, most of the unwanted metals can be removed magnetically or by a [[flotation process]]. Dysprosium can then be separated from other rare earth metals by an [[ion exchange]] displacement process. The resulting dysprosium ions can then react with either [[fluorine]] or [[chlorine]] to form dysprosium fluoride, DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or dysprosium chloride, DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These compounds can be reduced using either calcium or lithium metals in the following reactions:&lt;ref name=heiserman&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|author = Heiserman, David L.|pages = 236–238|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 978-0-8306-3018-9|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 Ca + 2 DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Dy + 3 CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:3 Li + DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Dy + 3 LiCl

The components are placed in a [[tantalum]] crucible and fired in a [[helium]] atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate due to differences in density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.&lt;ref name=heiserman/&gt;

About 100 tonnes of dysprosium are produced worldwide each year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysprosium (Dy) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects|url=http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Dy-en.htm|website=|publisher=Lenntech Water treatment &amp; air purification Holding B.V.|year=2008|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 99% of that total produced in China.&lt;ref name="Bradsher, Keith"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/business/global/30smuggle.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;emc=eta1 |title=In China, Illegal Rare Earth Mines Face Crackdown |author=Bradsher, Keith |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010.&lt;ref name="Bradsher, Keith"/&gt; The price increased to $1,400/kg in 2011 but fell to $240 in 2015, largely due to illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2016-raree.pdf Rare Earths] [https://web.archive.org/web/20160506184123/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2016-raree.pdf archive].

According to the [[United States Department of Energy]], the wide range of its current and projected uses, together with the lack of any immediately suitable replacement, makes dysprosium the single most critical element for emerging clean energy technologies - even their most conservative projections predict a shortfall of dysprosium before 2015.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist, 18 June 2011, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  As of late 2015, there is a nascent rare earth (including dysprosium) extraction industry in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, Clint (2015-09-22) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-22/rare-earth-miners-face-tough-market/6786970 Staring down a multitude of challenges, these Australian rare earth miners are confident they can break into the market]. abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysprosium is used, in conjunction with [[vanadium]] and other elements, in making [[laser]] materials and commercial lighting.

Dysprosium is used in [[dosimeter]]s for measuring [[ionizing radiation]]. Crystals of [[calcium sulfate]] or [[calcium fluoride]] are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become [[excited state|excited]] and [[luminescent]]. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;

Nanofibers of dysprosium compounds have high strength and a large surface area. Therefore, they can be used to reinforce other materials and act as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of DyBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NaF to 450&amp;nbsp;°C at 450 bars for 17 hours.

The trivalent dysprosium ion (Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) has been studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This idea is the basis for a new generation of UV-pumped white light emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carreira|first1=J. F.

==Precautions==
Like many powders, dysprosium powder may present an explosion hazard when mixed with air and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by [[static electricity]]. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable [[hydrogen]] gas.&lt;ref name="ESPI"&gt;{{cite web|title = Dysprosium|work = Material Safety Data Sheets|url = http://www.espi-metals.com/msds's/Dysprosium.htm|author = Dierks, Steve|date = January 2003|publisher = Electronic Space Products International|accessdate = 2008-10-20|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150922145520/http://www.espi-metals.com/msds's/Dysprosium.htm|archivedate = 2015-09-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dysprosium Chloride|work = Material Safety Data Sheets|url = http://www.espi-metals.com/msds%27s/Dysprosium%20Chloride.htm|author = Dierks, Steve|date = January 1995|publisher = Electronic Space Products International|accessdate = 2008-11-07|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150922145520/http://www.espi-metals.com/msds%27s/Dysprosium%20Chloride.htm|archivedate = 2015-09-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dysprosium Fluoride|work = Material Safety Data Sheets|url = http://www.espi-metals.com/msds%27s/Dysprosium%20Fluoride.htm|author = Dierks, Steve|date = December 1995|publisher = Electronic Space Products International|accessdate = 2008-11-07|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150922145520/http://www.espi-metals.com/msds%27s/Dysprosium%20Fluoride.htm|archivedate = 2015-09-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dysprosium Oxide|work = Material Safety Data Sheets|url = http://www.espi-metals.com/msds%27s/Dysprosium%20Oxide.htm|author = Dierks, Steve|date = November 1988|publisher = Electronic Space Products International|accessdate = 2008-11-07|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150922145520/http://www.espi-metals.com/msds%27s/Dysprosium%20Oxide.htm|archivedate = 2015-09-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a strong [[oxidizing agent]] and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.&lt;ref name="krebs"&gt;{{cite book|title = The History and Use of our Earth's Chemical Elements|author = Krebs, Robert E.|chapter = Dysprosium|pages = 234–235|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0-313-30123-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble dysprosium salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. Based on the toxicity of dysprosium chloride to [[mice]], it is estimated that the ingestion of 500&amp;nbsp;grams or more could be fatal to a human. The insoluble salts, however, are non-toxic.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6994">The '''electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide''' ('''ERC''') is the conversion of [[carbon dioxide]] to more [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced chemical species]] using electrical energy. The first examples of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide are from the 19th century, when carbon dioxide was reduced to [[carbon monoxide]] using a [[zinc]] [[cathode]]. Research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the [[oil embargo]]es of the 1970s.  Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide represents a possible means of producing chemicals or fuels, converting carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) to organic feedstocks such as [[Formic acid|formic acid (HCOOH)]], [[Methanol|methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)]], [[Ethylene|ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Methane|methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], and [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]].&lt;ref name=Centi&gt;Gabriele Centi, Siglinda Perathoner "Opportunities and prospects in the chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to fuels" Catalysis Today 148 (2009) 191–205.{{doi|10.1016/j.cattod.2009.07.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

Rev. 2013, vol. 113, 6621-6658.  {{DOI|10.1021/cr300463y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemicals from carbon dioxide ==
In [[carbon fixation]], plants convert carbon dioxide into sugars, from which many biosynthetic pathways originate.  The catalyst responsible for this conversion, [[RuBisCo]], is the most common protein on earth. Some anaerobic organisms employ enzymes to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[carbon monoxide]], from which fatty acids can be made.&lt;ref&gt;1. J. C. Fontecilla-Camps, P. Amara, C. Cavazza, Y. Nicolet and A. Volbeda, "Structure-function relationships of anaerobic gas-processing metalloenzymes", Nature 2009, volume 460, p. 814-822.{{doi|10.1038/nature08299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, a few products are made from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, including [[urea]], [[salicylic acid]], [[methanol]], and certain inorganic and organic carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Topham, "Carbon Dioxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the laboratory, carbon dioxide is sometimes used to prepare [[carboxylic acid]]s.  No electrochemical process involving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been commercialized.

==Electrocatalysis==
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to CO is usually described as:
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →   CO   + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The redox potential for this reaction is similar to that for hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus electrochemical reduction of CO2 is usually competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;ref name= Jitaru/&gt;

Electrochemical methods have gained significant attention: 1) at ambient pressure and room temperature; 2) in connection with renewable energy sources (see also [[solar fuel]]) 3) competitive controllability, modularity and scale-up is relatively simple.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., ChemSusChem 9 (2016) 333-344, Electrode Build-Up of Reducible Metal Composites toward Achievable Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide{{DOI|10.1002/cssc.201501112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can produce value-added chemicals such methane, ethylene, ethane, etc., and the products are mainly dependent on the selected catalysts and operating potentials (applying reduction voltage).&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., Sustainable production of formic acid by electrolytic reduction of gaseous carbon dioxide, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015,3, 3029-3034 {{DOI|10.1039/C4TA03893B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.T.

Although an electrochemical route to CO (or other chemicals) has not been commercialized, a variety of [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]] and [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hori | first1 = Y. | chapter = Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Metal Electrodes | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-49489-0_3 | title = Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry | series = Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry | volume = 42 | pages = 89–80 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-49488-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been evaluated.&lt;ref name='Jitaru'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Centi/&gt;  Many such processes are assumed to operate via the intermediacy of [[metal carbon dioxide complex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Eric E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5575">'''Ephemeralization''', a term coined by [[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], is the ability of technological advancement to do "more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing," that is, an accelerating increase in the efficiency of achieving the same or more output (products, services, information, etc.) while requiring less input (effort, time, resources, etc.).&lt;ref name=Fuller-Nine-Chains/&gt; Fuller's vision was that ephemeralization will result in ever-increasing standards of living for an ever-growing population despite finite resources. The concept has been embraced by those who argue against [[Malthusian]] philosophy.&lt;ref name=Fuller-Nine-Chains/&gt;

Fuller uses [[Henry Ford]]'s [[assembly line]] as an example of how ephemeralization can continuously lead to better products at lower cost with no upper bound on productivity. Fuller saw ephemeralization as an inevitable trend in human development. The progression was from "compression" to "tension" to "visual" to "abstract electrical" (i.e., nonsensorial radiation, such as radio waves, x rays, etc.).&lt;ref name=Fuller-Nine-Chains/&gt;

Length measurement technologies in human development, for example, started with a compressive measure, such as a ruler.  The compressive technique reached an upper limit with a rod.  For longer measures, a tensive measure such as a string or rope was used.  This reached an upper limit with sagging of the string.  Next was a surveyor’s telescope (visual).  This reached an upper limit with curvature of the earth.  Next was radio triangulation (abstract electrical). The technological progression is a continuing increase in length-measuring ability per pound of instrument, with no apparent upper limit according to Fuller.&lt;ref name=Fuller-Nine-Chains&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Random House|Anchor Books]], 1938, 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;252–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences to society ==
[[Francis Heylighen]]&lt;ref name=Heylighen-2002.04.12-A&gt;[[Francis Heylighen]],  ''[http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain]". In Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change (p. 284). Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Toffler]]&lt;ref name=Toffler1970-80-90&gt;[[Alvin Toffler]], ''[[Future Shock]]'' (1970), ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler)|The Third Wave]]'' (1980), and ''[[Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth and Violence at the Edge of the 21st Century|Powershift]]'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; have written that ephemeralization, though it may increase our power to solve physical problems, can make non-physical problems worse. According to Heylighen and Toffler, increasing system complexity and information overload make it difficult and stressful for the people who must control the ephemeralized systems. This can negate the advantages of ephemeralization.&lt;ref name=Heylighen-2002.04.12-A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Toffler1970-80-90/&gt;

The solution proposed by Heylighen&lt;ref name=Heylighen-2002.04.12-B&gt;[[Francis Heylighen]],  ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070103091059/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Info-overload.pdf Tackling Complexity and Information Overload: intelligence amplification, attention economy and the global brain]'', draft paper, to be submitted to [[The Information Society]], pages 20-44, 2002-04-12&lt;/ref&gt; is the integration of human intelligence, [[computer intelligence]], and coordination mechanisms that direct an issue to the cognitive resource (document, person, or computer program) most fit to address it. This requires a distributed, [[self-organizing system]], formed by all individuals, computers and the communication links that connect them. The self-organization can be achieved by algorithms. According to Heylighen, the effect is to superpose the contributions of many different human and computer agents into a collective map that may link the cognitive and physical resources relatively efficiently. The resulting information system could react relatively rapidly and [[Complex adaptive system|adaptively]] to requests for guidance or changes in the situation.&lt;ref name=Heylighen-2002.04.12-B/&gt;

In Heylighen's view, the system could frequently be fed with new information from its myriad human users and computer agents, which it would take into account to offer the human users a list of the best possible approaches to achieve tasks.&lt;ref name=Heylighen-2002.04.12-B/&gt; Heylighen believes near-optimization could be achieved both at the level of the individual who makes the request, and at the level of society which attempts to minimize the conflicts between the desires of its different members and to aim at long term, global progress while as much as possible protecting individual liberty and privacy.&lt;ref name=Heylighen-2002.04.12-B/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7754">'''Flynn's taxonomy''' is a classification of [[computer architecture]]s, proposed by [[Michael J. Flynn]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Michael J. |authorlink1=Michael J. Flynn|doi=10.1109/TC.1972.5009071|title=Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Computers]]|volume=C-21|issue=9|pages=948–960| date=September 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Duncan |first1=Ralph|title=A Survey of Parallel Computer Architectures|doi=10.1109/2.44900|journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer]]|volume=23|issue=2|pages=5–16| date=February 1990|url=http://www.eng.ucy.ac.cy/theocharides/Courses/ECE656/Duncan90.pdf |access-date=2018-07-18 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718181803/http://www.eng.ucy.ac.cy/theocharides/Courses/ECE656/Duncan90.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification system has stuck, and has been used as a tool in design of modern processors and their functionalities. Since the rise of [[multiprocessing]] [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), a [[multiprogramming]] context has evolved as an extension of the classification system.

==Classifications==
The four classifications defined by Flynn are based upon the number of concurrent instruction (or control) streams and data streams available in the architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse820/lectures/CAQA5e_ch4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Flynn's taxonomy}}

===Single instruction stream single data stream (SISD)===
{{main|SISD}}
A sequential computer which exploits no parallelism in either the instruction or data streams. Single control unit (CU) fetches single instruction stream (IS) from memory. The CU then generates appropriate control signals to direct single processing element (PE) to operate on single data stream (DS) i.e., one operation at a time.

Examples of SISD architecture are the traditional [[uniprocessor]] machines like older [[personal computer]]s (PCs; by 2010, many PCs had multiple cores) and [[mainframe computer]]s.

===Single instruction stream, multiple data streams (SIMD)===
{{main|SIMD}}
A single instruction operates on multiple different data streams.  Instructions can be executed sequentially, such as by pipelining, or in parallel by multiple functional units.

[[Single instruction, multiple threads]] (SIMT) is an execution model used in [[parallel computing]] where [[single instruction, multiple data]] (SIMD) is combined with [[Thread (computing)#Multithreading|multithreading]]. This is not a distinct classification in Flynn's taxonomy, where it would be a subset of SIMD.  However, Nvidia commonly uses the term in its marketing materials where it argues for the supposed novelty of Nvidia architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/fermi_white_papers/NVIDIA_Fermi_Compute_Architecture_Whitepaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple instruction streams, single data stream (MISD)===
{{main|MISD}}
Multiple instructions operate on one data stream. This is an uncommon architecture which is generally used for fault tolerance. Heterogeneous systems operate on the same data stream and must agree on the result. Examples include the [[Space Shuttle]] flight control computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spector|first=A. |last2=Gifford |first2=D. |date=September 1984 |title=The space shuttle primary computer system |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=27 |pages=872–900 |issue=9 |doi=10.1145/358234.358246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple instruction streams, multiple data streams (MIMD)===
{{main|MIMD}}
Multiple autonomous processors simultaneously executing different instructions on different data. MIMD architectures include [[multi-core]] [[superscalar]] processors, and [[distributed system]]s, using either one shared memory space or a distributed memory space.

==Diagram comparing classifications==
These four architectures are shown below visually. Each processing unit (PU) is shown for a uni-core or multi-core computer:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Single program, multiple data streams (SPMD)===
{{main|SPMD}}
Multiple autonomous processors simultaneously executing the same program (but at independent points, rather than in the [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] that SIMD imposes) on different data. Also termed ''single process, multiple data''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; - the use of this terminology for SPMD is technically incorrect, as SPMD is a parallel execution model and assumes multiple cooperating processors executing a program. SPMD is the most common style of parallel programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/singleprogrm.html |title=Single program multiple data |publisher=Nist.gov |date=2004-12-17 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPMD model and the term was proposed by Frederica Darema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Darema |first1=Frederica |author-link1=Frederica Darema|last2=George |first2=David A.|last3=Norton |first3=V.

Pfister was a manager of the RP3 project, and Darema was part of the RP3 team.

===Multiple programs, multiple data streams (MPMD)&lt;!--'' redirects here--&gt;===
&lt;!-- {{main|MPMD}} --&gt;
Multiple autonomous processors simultaneously operating at least 2 independent programs. Typically such systems pick one node to be the "host" ("the explicit host/node programming model") or "manager" (the "Manager/Worker" strategy), which runs one program that farms out data to all the other nodes which all run a second program. Those other nodes then return their results directly to the manager. An example of this would be the Sony PlayStation 3 game console, with its [[Cell (microprocessor)|SPU/PPU processor]].

'''Future Vision Technologies''' ('''FVT'''), operating from 1991 to 1995, was part of the second wave of companies working to commercialize [[virtual reality]] technology. The company was founded by a team out of the Advanced Digital Systems Laboratory in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The three original members, Matt Klapman, David Frerichs,&lt;ref name="Frerichs bio"&gt;[http://www.frerichs.net/bio.html Frerichs Bio]&lt;/ref&gt; and Kevin Lee, were later joined by John Belmonte. The company ceased to be an active entity when its PC card business was sold to [[Fujitsu Microelectronics]].&lt;ref name="FMI purchases FVT"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fujitsu+Microelectronics+Inc.+forms+new+graphics+products...-a016536569 Fujitsu Microelectronics Purchases FVT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products ==
The company produced a number of products which appear to be first of their kind in the market.

* '''Sapphire IME with Pixel Bus''' - an integrated 3D [[graphics card]] with graphics and audio output. A major innovation, demonstrated at AES 94 in Washington, DC and at [[Siggraph]] 94 in Orlando, FL, USA, was the ability to chain multiple cards together across multiple Pentium-class personal computers to create a single simulation environment known as a [[Cave automatic virtual environment|VR CAVE]]. The Siggraph 94 demonstration consisted of three Sapphire IME cards installed in three Pentium (90&amp;nbsp;MHz) computers driving three synchronized Barco projectors. Each screen was running frame-interlaced stereo, allowing users wearing LCD shutter glasses to be fully immersed in the scene. Until this demonstration, VR CAVE implementations had only been implemented using high-end graphics workstations from companies like [[Silicon Graphics]].&lt;ref name="UIC VR CAVE history"&gt;[http://www.evl.uic.edu/pape/CAVE/oldCAVE/CAVE.overview.html] UIC VR CAVE Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institut Lumière - CINEMATOGRAPHE Camera.jpg|thumb|Cinématographe Lumière at the [[Institut Lumière]] in [[Lyon]], [[France]] ]]
{{Years in film}}
Although the start of the '''history of film''' is not clearly defined, the commercial, public screening of ten of [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]]' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected [[cinematography|cinematographic]] motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a worldwide success.

Soon film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry.

The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long and without recorded sound.

During the 1890s films became several minutes long and started to consist of several shots. The first film studios were built in 1897. The first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built in 1898. Special effects were introduced and film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, began to be used.

In the 1900s, continuity of action across successive shots was achieved and the first close-up shot was introduced (some claim [[D. W. Griffith]] was the inventor). Most films of this period were what came to be called "chase films". The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was "The Nickelodeon" in Pittsburgh in 1905. The first feature length multi-reel film was a 1906 Australian production. By 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, opening the way for the creation of film stars. Regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news. From about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in Australia and in all European countries except France.

New film techniques were introduced in this period including the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes. As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel and be easier to be understood by the audience{{snd}} an audience that was new to this form of storytelling. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama but these categories were further subdivided. During the [[First World War]] there was a complex transition for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programs to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices. By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another.

[[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing among American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. The American film industry, or "[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]", as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries. By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,&lt;ref name="filmsite.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html|title=Film History of the 1920s|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997).  During late 1927, Warner's released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', with the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Sound saved the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995).

The desire for wartime propaganda created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas. The onset of American involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. During the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by [[television]] and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The 1950s was considered a "Golden Age" for non-English [[world cinema|cinema]].

''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'' is an 1888 [[short film|short]] [[silent film]] recorded by French inventor [[Louis Le Prince]]. It is believed to be the [[History of Film|oldest surviving film]] in existence, as noted by the [[Guinness World Records|''Guinness Book of Records'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness World Records|''Guinness Book of Records'']], all editions.&lt;/ref&gt;
The film ''[[Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon]]'' (1895) by French [[Louis Lumière]] is considered the "first true motion picture".&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573634/Lumi%C3%A8re.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080125065813/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573634/Lumi%C3%A8re.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-01-25 |title=Lumière |work=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
{{Main|Precursors of film}}
[[Film]] as an art form has drawn on several earlier traditions in the fields such as (oral) [[storytelling]], [[literature]], [[theatre]] and [[visual art]]s. Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include:
* [[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]], probably used since prehistoric times
* [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times
* [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]], possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China
* [[magic lantern]], developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s
* [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] "[[persistence of vision]]" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868)

Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits may have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or unknown projectors. By the 16th century [[necromancy|necromantic]] ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan "magicians" and "witches" seemed commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|last=Ruffles|first=Tom|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures. Around 1790 this was developed into multi-media ghost shows known as [[phantasmagoria]] that could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, [[superimposition]], [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. While the first magic lantern images seem to have been intended to scare audiences, soon all sorts of subjects appeared and the lantern was not only used for storytelling but also for education. In the 19th century several new and popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, etc.) or that showed for instance falling snow, or the planets and their moons revolving.

==Early period==
{{Main|Silent film|Sound film}}
[[File:Kinetoscope.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interior view of [[Kinetoscope]] with peephole viewer at top of cabinet.]]
In the 1890s, films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or [[slapstick]]. There was little to no cinematic technique, the film was usually black and white and it was without sound.

The novelty of realistic moving photographs was enough for a motion picture industry to blossom before the end of the century, in countries around the world. "The Cinema" was to offer a cheaper, simpler way of providing entertainment to the masses. Filmmakers could record actors' performances, which then could be shown to audiences around the world. Travelogues would bring the sights of far-flung places, with movement, directly to spectators' hometowns. Movies would become the most popular visual art form of the late Victorian age.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. (2003) ''Film History An Introduction''.

The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Berlin Wintergarten theater]] hosted an early movie presentation in front of an audience, shown by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in 1895. The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] started to screen movies in 1896. [[Movie theater]]s became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century, much like [[cabaret]]s and other theaters.

[[File:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) by [[Georges Méliès]].]]
Until 1927, motion pictures were produced without sound. This era is referred to as the [[Silent film|silent era of film]]. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film, thus dispensing with narrators, but in Japanese cinema human narration remained popular throughout the silent era. The technical problems were resolved by 1923.

[[Illustrated song]]s were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in [[vaudeville]] houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters.&lt;ref name="The House of Witmark"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The House of Witmark| last=Witmark| first=Isidore|author2=Goldberg, Isaac| year=1939| page=116| publisher=New York OOO| location=New York| id=ASIN B001DZ8MP6|isbn=0-306-70686-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass [[Magic lantern (projector)|slides]] projected through [[stereopticon]]s and similar devices. In this way, song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development. The main purpose of illustrated songs was to encourage [[sheet music]] sales, and they were highly successful with sales reaching into the millions for a single song. Later, with the birth of film, illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during [[Film reel|reel changes]].&lt;ref name="The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Abel| first=Richard| chapter=That Most American of Attractions, The Illustrated Song| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wADgG_d-PSAC&amp;pg=PA143| title=The Sounds of Early Cinema| editor1-last=Abel| editor1-first=Richard| editor2-first=Rick| editor2-last=Altman| year=2001| pages=143–153| publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=0-253-33988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' was a non-commercial attempt to combine the motion picture with a combination of slides and synchronize the resulting moving picture with audio. The film included hand-painted slides as well as other previously used techniques. Simultaneously playing the audio while the film was being played with a projector was required. Produced by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] (Jehovah's Witnesses), this eight–hour bible drama was being shown in 80 cities every day and almost eight million people in the United States and Canada saw the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics'' {{ISBN|978-1-438-13020-0}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth of movies ==
Within eleven years of motion pictures, the films moved from a novelty show to an established large-scale entertainment industry. Films moved from a single shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions.

By 1900, the first motion pictures that can be considered as "films"{{snd}} emerged, and film-makers began to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wichm.home.xs4all.nl/myth.html|title=The genesis of cinematography distinguishes two dates: in 1888 the technology became available and from 1900 onwards film language developed.|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invention and advancement of the camera ===
[[Image:Melstud2.gif|thumb|200px|[[Georges Méliès]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio.]]
Early movie cameras were fastened to the head of a tripod with only simple levelling devices provided. These cameras were effectively fixed during the course of a shot, and the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The [[Lumière brothers]] shot a scene from the back of a train in 1896.

The first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built by [[Robert W. Paul]] in 1897, on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]]. He used his camera to shoot the procession in one shot. His device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a "panning" head were also referred to as 'panoramas' in the film catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/robert-w-paul-cinematograph-camera-30th-birthday-countdown/|title=The cine camera which began the National Cinematography Collection|publisher=National Media Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Méliès]] built one of the first film studios in May 1897. It had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct rays of the sun on sunny days.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 747–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1896, Méliès would go on to produce, direct, and distribute over 500 short films. The majority of these films were short, one-shot films completed in one take. Méliès drew many comparisons between film and the stage, which was apparent in his work. He realized that film afforded him the ability (via his use of time lapse photography) to "produce visual spectacles not achievable in the theater.&lt;ref name="Gazetas, Aristides 2000"&gt;Gazetas, Aristides. ''An Introduction to World Cinema''. Jefferson: McFarland Company, Inc, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]'', produced by the Edison Company for viewing with the [[Kinetoscope]], showed [[Mary Queen of Scots]] being executed in full view of the camera. The effect was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|title=The execution of Mary Stuart 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georges Méliès also utilized this technique in the making of ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)''. The woman is seen to vanish through the use of [[stop motion]] techniques.

[[Image:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|200px|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a "dream vision" in ''Santa Claus'' (1899).]]
The other basic technique for trick cinematography was the [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera. This was pioneered by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in England. The set was draped in black, and after the main shot, the negative was re-exposed to the overlaid scene. His ''The Corsican Brothers'' was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]] in 1900: "By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow.”

G.A. Smith also initiated the special effects technique of [[reverse motion]]. He did this by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/725468/|title=Santa Claus (1898)|publisher=BFI Screenonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first films made using this device were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter''. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''[[The House That Jack Built (1900 film)|The House That Jack Built]]'', made before September 1900.

[[Cecil Hepworth]] took this technique further, by printing the [[negative (photography)|negative]] of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a "projection printer", and eventually an "[[optical printer]]".

The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of [[Robert W. Paul]] and Hepworth. Paul shot scenes from ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899) with the camera turning very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder|Seidlitz Powder]]'' (1901). The Chief's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second. This gives what we would call a "[[slow motion]]" effect.

=== Film editing and continuous narrative ===
The first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century, a notable example was the French film of the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], ''La vie du Christ (The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Guy|first=Alice|title=The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ|date=January 1907|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139714/|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alice Guy]]. These weren't represented as a continuous film, the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides, a lecture, and live choral numbers, to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes. Another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war]], made by [[Georges Méliès]] in 1897. Although each scene was sold separately, they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors. Even Méliès' ''Cendrillon (Cinderella)'' of 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one. To understand what was going on in the film the audience had to know their stories beforehand, or be told them by a presenter.

[[File:Paul3.gif|thumb|center|600px|The two scenes making up ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'']]
Real film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.&lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. This technique was first used in his 1901 film ''[[Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost]]''.

The further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899 at the [[Brighton]] School in [[England]]. In the latter part of that year, [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] made ''The Kiss in the Tunnel''. This started with a shot from a "phantom ride" at the point at which the train goes into a tunnel, and continued with the action on a set representing the interior of a railway carriage, where a man steals a kiss from a woman, and then cuts back to the phantom ride shot when the train comes out of the tunnel. A month later, the Bamforth company in Yorkshire made a restaged version of this film under the same title, and in this case they filmed shots of a train entering and leaving a tunnel from beside the tracks, which they joined before and after their version of the kiss inside the train compartment.

[[File:Telesc4.gif|thumb|center|600px|The first two shots of ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' (1900), with the telescope POV simulated by the circular mask.]]
In 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]], who also worked in [[Brighton]]. In that year Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'' (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the [[balcony]], who come and rescue them. The film also used the first "reverse angle" cut in film history.

G.A Smith pioneered the use of the close-up shot in his 1900 films ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' and ''[[Grandma's Reading Glass]]''. He further developed the ideas of breaking a scene shot in one place into a series of shots taken from different camera positions over the next couple of years, starting with ''The Little Doctors'' of 1901. In a series of films he produced at this time, he also introduced the use of subjective and objective point-of-view shots, the creation of dream-time and the use of reversing. He summed up his work in ''Mary Jane's Mishap'' of 1903, with repeated cuts in to a close shot of a housemaid fooling around, along with superimpositions and other devices, before abandoning film-making to invent the Kinemacolor system of colour cinematography. His films were the first to establish the basics of coherent narrative and what became known as film language, or "[[film grammar]]".&lt;ref name="BFIso001"&gt;{{cite web |title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444530/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BF01"&gt;{{cite web|title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=David |last=Fisher |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |accessdate=2011-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002732/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two film makers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most films of this period were what came to be called "chase films". These were inspired by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''[[Stop Thief!]]'' of 1901, which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butcher's boy in the first shot, then being chased through the second shot by the butcher's boy and assorted dogs, and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot. Several British films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction. These included ''An Elopement à la Mode'' and ''The Pickpocket: A Chase Through London'', made by Alf Collins for the British branch of the French [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont company]], ''Daring Daylight Burglary'', made by [[Frank Mottershaw]] at the Sheffield Photographic Company, and ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'', made by [[William Haggar]]. Haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots; the [[poaching|poachers]] are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along, creating a sense of urgency and speed.&lt;ref name="Affray"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444205/ | title=Desperate Poaching Affray (1903) | work=[[British Film Institute]] | author= | accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges, while film academic [[Noël Burch]] praised Haggar's effective use of off-screen space.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;Hayes, Christian.  [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1193042/ Phantom Rides], [[British Film Institute|BFI Screen Online]].  Accessed 30 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the first film makers to purposefully introduce violence for entertainment; in ''Desperate Poaching Affray'' the villains are seen firing guns at their pursuers.

[[Image:The Great Train Robbery 0018.jpg|thumb|left|Still from ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', produced by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]].]]
Other filmmakers took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter, a projectionist, was hired by Thomas Edison to develop his new projection model known as the [[Vitascope]]. Porter wanted to develop a style of filmmaking that would move away from the one-shot short films into a "story-telling [narrative]" style.&lt;ref name="Gazetas, Aristides 2000"/&gt; When he began making longer films in 1902, he put a dissolve between every shot, just as Georges Méliès was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] [[film editing|editing]] method to show simultaneous action in different places. The time continuity in ''The Great Train Robbery'' was actually more confusing than that in the films it was modeled on, but nevertheless it was a greater success than them due to its [[American Old West|Wild West]] violence. ''The Great Train Robbery'' served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity.&lt;ref name="Gazetas, Aristides 2000"/&gt;

The Pathé company in France also made imitations and variations of Smith and Williamson's films from 1902 onwards using cuts between the shots, which helped to standardize the basics of film construction. An influential French film of the period was Méliès's 14-minute-long ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Marvellous Méliès|year=1974|publisher=Gordon Fraser|location=London|isbn=0900406380|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was extremely popular at the time of its release, and is the best-known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès. It was one of the first known [[science fiction film]]s, and used innovative [[animation]] and [[special effects]], including the well-known image of the spaceship landing in the Moon's eye. The sheer volume of Pathé's production led to their filmmakers giving a further precision and polish to the details of film continuity.

=== Animation ===
The first use of animation in movies was in 1899, with the production of the short film Matches: An Appeal by British film pioneer [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]]- a thirty-second long stop-motion animated piece intended to encourage the audience to send matches to British troops fighting the [[Boer War]]. The film contains an appeal to send money to [[Bryant and May]] who would then send matches to the troops fighting in South Africa. It was shown in December 1899 at The Empire Theatre in London. This film is the earliest known example of stop-motion animation. Little puppets, constructed of matchsticks, are writing the appeal on a black wall. Their movements are filmed frame by frame, movement by movement.

[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A single frame from the ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' animation, showing the use of [[cutout animation|cut-out]] technique]]
The relative sophistication of this piece was not followed up for some time, with subsequent works in animation being limited to short, two or three frame effects, such as appeared in [[Edwin Stanton Porter]]'s 1902 short ''Fun in a Bakery Shop'', where a lump of dough was made to smile over the course of a three-frame sequence. Works rivaling the British short in length did not appear until 1905, when Edwin Porter made ''How Jones Lost His Roll'', and ''The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog''. Both of these films had intertitles which were formed by the letters moving into place from a random scattering to form the words of the titles. This was done by exposing the film one frame at a time, and moving the letters a little bit towards their final position between each exposure. This is what has come to be called "single frame [[animation]]" or "object animation", and it needs a slightly adapted camera that exposes only one frame for each turn of the crank handle, rather than the usual eight frames per turn.

[[File:Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Ernst Lubitsch]] known as the master of kostumfilme]]
In 1906, [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert Edward Smith]] and [[J. Stuart Blackton|James Stuart Blackton]] at [[Vitagraph Studios]] took the next step, and in their ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'',&lt;ref name="Beckerman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beckerman|first=Howard|title=Animation: the whole story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjW6cCE4v1QC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=16 August 2011|date=2003-09-01|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-58115-301-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; what appear to be cartoon drawings of people move from one pose to another. This is done for most of the length of this film by moving jointed cut-outs of the figures frame by frame between the exposures, just as Porter moved his letters. However, there is a very short section of the film where things are made to appear to move by altering the drawings themselves from frame to frame, which is how [[traditional animation|standard animated cartoons]] have since been made up to today.

[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[El Apóstol]]'', the world's first animated feature film, and ''[[Peludópolis]]'', the first animated feature film with sound, were produced in cutout animation by Italian-born cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]

The technique of single frame animation was further developed in 1907 by Edwin S. Porter in ''The Teddy Bears'' and by J. Stuart Blackton with ''Work Made Easy''. In the first of these the toy bears were made to move, apparently on their own, and in the latter film building tools were made to perform construction tasks without human intervention, by using frame-by-frame animation. The technique got to Europe almost immediately, and Segundo de Chomon and others at Pathé took it further, adding [[clay animation]], in which sculptures were deformed from one thing into another thing frame by frame in ''Sculpture moderne'' (1908), and then Pathé made the next step to the animation of silhouette shapes. Also in France, [[Émile Cohl]] fully developed drawn animation in a series of films starting with ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908), in which humans and objects drawn as outline figures went through a series of remarkable interactions and transformations. In the United States the response was from the famous strip [[Cartoonist|cartoon artist]] [[Winsor McCay]], who drew much more realistic animated figures going through smoother, more naturalistic motion in a series of films starting with the film ''Little Nemo'', made for Vitagraph in 1911. In the next few years various others took part in this development of [[animated cartoon]]s in the United States and elsewhere.

The world's first animated feature film was ''[[El Apóstol]]'' (1917), made by Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] utilizing cutout animation.{{sfn|Finkielman|2004}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=378}} Cristiani also directed the first animated feature film with sound, ''[[Peludópolis]]'', released with a vitaphone sound-on-disc synchronization system soundtrack. Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copies of the movies, and they are now considered as lost films.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=25}}{{sfn|Bendazzi|1996}}

In 1932, the first short animated film created entirely with [[technicolor]] (the trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue), whose use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions) was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'', directed by [[Burt Gillett]].&lt;ref name="esquire1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/cine/a10335017/primera-pelicula-color/|title=¿Cuál fue la primera película en color?|date=2017-08-02|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films at the time were no longer than one reel, although some multi-reel films had been made on the life of Christ in the first few years of cinema. The first feature length multi-reel film in the world was the 1906 Australian production called ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=37899&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Return of the Kelly Gang|journal= The [[UNESCO Courier]]|issn=1993-8616|issue=2007 #5|last=Chichester|first=Jo|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It traced the life of the legendary infamous [[outlaw]] and [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] (1855–1880) and ran for more than an hour with a reel length of approximately 4,000 feet (1,200 m).&lt;ref name=R&amp;P&gt;Ray Edmondson and Andrew Pike (1982) ''Australia's Lost Films.''

==Maturation==

===Film business===
[[File:Biograph poster2.jpg|left|thumb|Poster for a [[Biograph Studios]] release from 1913.]]
The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was "The Nickelodeon", which was opened in Pittsburgh in 1905. By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors in the United States quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s in operation. The American experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards.

By 1907 purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the United States, Britain and France. The films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist, though there could be more musicians. There were also a very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities. Initially, the majority of films in the programmes were [[Pathé]] films, but this changed fairly quickly as the American companies cranked up production. The programme was made up of just a few films, and the show lasted around 30 minutes. The reel of film, of maximum length {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, which usually contained one individual film, became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period. The programme was changed twice or more a week, but went up to five changes of programme a week after a couple of years. In general, cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities. In 1907, Pathé began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright.

By about 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened. Films were increasingly longer, and began to feature proper plots and development.

The litigation over patents between all the major American film-making companies led to the formation of a trust to control the American film business, with each company in the trust being allocated production quotas (two reels a week for the biggest ones, one reel a week for the smaller). However, although 6,000 exhibitors signed up to the trust, about 2,000 others did not and began to fund new film producing companies. By 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market and the government defeated the trust by initiating [[Antitrust|anti-trust]] action at the same time.

Accessed December 7, 2013. "Back in 1912, when Hollywood had more cattle than cameras, Fort Lee was the center of the cinematic universe. Icons from the silent era like Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish crossed the Hudson River via ferry to emote on Fort Lee back lots."&lt;/ref&gt; In need of a winter headquarters, moviemakers were attracted to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] due to its warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of "The Winter Film Capital of the World." New York-based [[Kalem Studios]] was the first to open a permanent studio in Jacksonville in 1908. Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including [[Metro Pictures]] (later [[MGM]]), [[Edison Studios]], Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, [[Vim Comedy Company]], [[Norman Studios]], [[Gaumont Studios]] and the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]]. Comedic actor and Georgia native [[Oliver Hardy|Oliver "Babe" Hardy]] began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to [[Jacksonville]] in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in [[Technicolor]] and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, [[The Gulf Between]], was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.

Jacksonville was especially important to the [[African-American art|African American film]] industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of [[Oscar Micheaux]] and the [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]]. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as [[The Birth of a Nation]], Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed "splendidly assuming different roles."

Jacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat [[John W. Martin]] was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern [[California]] was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like [[William Selig]] and [[D.W. Griffith]] to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.

Another factor for the industry's move west was that up until 1913, most American film production was still carried out around New York, but due to the monopoly of [[Thomas A. Edison, Inc.]]'s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it, many filmmakers moved to Southern California, starting with [[William Nicholas Selig|Selig]] in 1909. The sunshine and scenery was important for the production of Westerns, which came to form a major American film genre with the first cowboy stars, [[Broncho Billy Anderson|G.M. Anderson ("Broncho Billy")]] and [[Tom Mix]]. Selig pioneered the use of (fairly) wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures, with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals. [[Kalem Company]] sent film crews to places in America and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened. Kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912, with [[Ruth Roland]] playing starring roles in their Westerns.

In France, Pathé retained its dominant position, followed still by Gaumont, and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom. A film company with a different approach was Film d'Art. This was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature. Their declared programme was to make films using only the best dramatists, artists and actors. The first of these was ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise]]'' (''The Assassination of the Duc de Guise''), a historical subject set in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henri III]]. This film used leading actors from the [[Comédie-Française]], and had a special accompanying score written by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]. The other French majors followed suit, and this wave gave rise to the English-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as [[art film|"art films"]]. By 1910, the French film companies were starting to make films as long as two, or even three reels, though most were still one reel long. This trend was followed in Italy, Denmark, and Sweden.

In Britain, the [[Cinematograph Act 1909]] was the first [[primary legislation]] to specifically regulate the [[film industry]]. [[Cinematograph|Film exhibitions]] often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] for film, combined with [[limelight]] illumination, created a significant fire hazard. The Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = Juliet | title = The Thirties – an Intimate History | chapter = Prologue | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-00-724076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news{{snd}} the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13|British Antarctic Expedition]] to the [[South Pole]] was filmed for the newsreels as were the [[suffragette]] demonstrations that were happening at the same time.

=== New film producing countries ===
With the worldwide film boom, yet more countries now joined Britain, France, Germany and the United States in serious film production. In Italy, production was spread over several centres, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, [[Ambrosio Film|Ambrosio]] was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. Its most substantial rival was [[Cines]] in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian industry]] was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s two-reel ''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger glasses like ''[[Quo Vadis?]]'' (1912), which ran for 90 minutes, and Pastrone's ''[[Cabiria]]'' of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.

[[File:cadutaW1.gif|thumb|300px|''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' (1911).]]
Italian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy, with actors like [[André Deed]], known locally as "Cretinetti", and elsewhere as "Foolshead" and "Gribouille", achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags.

The most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk]] company was set up there in 1906 by [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]], a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like ''Den hvide Slavinde (The White Slave)'', ''Isbjørnenjagt (Polar Bear Hunt)'' and ''Løvejagten (The Lion Hunt)''. By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slave trade]], they contributed other new subjects. The most important of these finds was [[Asta Nielsen]] in ''[[The Abyss (1910 film)|Afgrunden]] (The Abyss)'', directed by [[Urban Gad]] for Kosmorama, This combined the circus, sex, jealousy and murder, all put over with great conviction, and pushed the other Danish filmmakers further in this direction. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly.

The [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film industry]] was smaller and slower to get started than the Danish industry. Here, the important man was [[Charles Magnusson]], a newsreel cameraman for the Svenskabiografteatern cinema chain. He started fiction film production for them in 1909, directing a number of the films himself. Production increased in 1912, when the company engaged [[Victor Sjöström]] and [[Mauritz Stiller]] as directors. They started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the Danish film industry, but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work, which sold very well.

Russia began its film industry in 1908 with Pathé shooting some fiction subjects there, and then the creation of real Russian film companies by [[Aleksandr Drankov]] and [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]. The Khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest Russian film company, and remained so until 1918.

In Germany, [[Oskar Messter]] had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant number of films per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when [[Paul Davidson (producer)|Paul Davidson]], the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, Projektions-AG "Union" ([[PAGU]]), for them, that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Another of the growing German film producers just before World War I was the German branch of the French [[Eclair (company)|Éclair]] company, Deutsche Éclair. This was expropriated by the German government, and turned into DECLA when the war started. But altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.

Overall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in all European countries except France, and even in France, the American films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of World War I. So even if the war had not happened, American films may have become dominant worldwide. Although the war made things much worse for European producers, the technical qualities of American films made them increasingly attractive to audiences everywhere.

===Film technique===
[[File:A.E. Smith filming The Bargain Fiend.gif|thumb|left|[[A.E. Smith]] filming ''The Bargain Fiend'' in the [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1907. Arc floodlights hang overhead.]]
New film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[Low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes.

Continuity of action from shot to shot was also refined, such as in Pathé's ''le Cheval emballé (The Runaway Horse)'' (1907) where [[cross cutting|cross-cutting between parallel actions]] is used. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] also began using cross-cutting in the film ''[[The Fatal Hour (1908 film)|The Fatal Hour]]'', made in July 1908. Another development was the use of the [[point of view shot|Point of View shot]], first used in 1910 in Vitagraph's ''Back to Nature''. Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film ''La mala planta (The Evil Plant)'', directed by [[Mario Caserini]] had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the "Evil Plant".

As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided.

[[Intertitles]] containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards, such as in Vitagraph's ''An Auto Heroine; or, The Race for the Vitagraph Cup and How It Was Won''. The dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912. The introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative. When dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking, and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking, then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film.

==During World War I==

===Industry===
[[Image:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The visual style of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' included deliberately distorted forms, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. It uses [[Mise-en-scène]]]]
The years of the [[First World War]] were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.

In the United States, these changes brought destruction to many film companies, the Vitagraph company being an exception. Film production began to shift to [[Los Angeles]] during World War I. The [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company. New entrants included the [[Jesse L. Lasky|Jesse Lasky]] Feature Play Company, and Famous Players, both formed in 1913, and later amalgamated into [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. The biggest success of these years was [[David Wark Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Griffith followed this up with the even bigger ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), but, due to the high quality of film produced in the US, the market for their films was high.

In France, film production shut down due to the general [[Mobilization|military mobilization]] of the country at the start of the war. Although film production began again in 1915, it was on a reduced scale, and the biggest companies gradually retired from production. Italian film production held up better, although so called "diva films", starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure. In Denmark, the Nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films, which led to a very sharp decline in Danish production, and the end of Denmark's importance on the world film scene.

The [[Cinema of Germany|German film industry]] was seriously weakened by the war. The most important of the new film producers at the time was [[Joe May]], who made a series of thrillers and [[adventure film]]s through the war years, but [[Ernst Lubitsch]] also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas.

===New techniques===
[[File:Die Austernprinzessin screenshot.gif|thumb|300px|Complex vignette shot in ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]] (The Oyster Princess)''.]]
At this time, studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight. This was replaced with floodlights and spotlights. The widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period. This is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask, which gradually gets larger until it expands beyond the frame. Other shaped slits were used, including vertical and diagonal apertures.

A new idea taken over from still photography was "[[soft focus]]". This began in 1915, with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect, as in [[Mary Pickford]] starrer ''[[Fanchon the Cricket]]''.

It was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established. These could now be done as Point of View ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots, as in Sidney Drew's ''The Story of the Glove'' (1915), where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the POV of a drunken man. The use of anamorphic (in the general sense of distorted shape) images first appears in these years with [[Abel Gance]] directed ''[[la Folie du Docteur Tube]] (The Madness of Dr. Tube)''. In this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a [[Curved mirror|distorting mirror]] of the fair-ground type.

Symbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years. In D. W. Griffith's ''[[The Avenging Conscience]]'' (1914), the title "The birth of the evil thought" precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider, and ants eating an insect. Symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in Italy and Russia. The supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art, and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well.

[[File:Screenshot from Old Wives for New.gif|thumb|600px|Insert shot in ''[[Old Wives for New]]'' ([[Cecil B. DeMille]], 1918)]]
The use of [[Insert (filmmaking)|insert shots]], i.e. close-ups of objects other than faces, had already been established by the Brighton school, but were infrequently used before 1914. It is really only with Griffith's ''The Avenging Conscience'' that a new phase in the use of the Insert Shot starts. As well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned, the film also made extensive use of large numbers of Big Close Up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension.

Atmospheric inserts were developed in Europe in the late 1910s. This kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story, nor is a Point of View shot seen by one of them. An early example is in [[Maurice Tourneur]] directed ''[[The Pride of the Clan]]'' (1917), in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk. [[Maurice Elvey]]'s ''[[Nelson (1918 film)|Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero]]'' (1919) has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to a peacock, and then to a battleship.

By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another. Cutting to ''different'' angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in American films. If the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees, it is called a reverse-angle cutting. The leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was [[Ralph Ince]] in his films, such as ''The Right Girl'' and ''His Phantom Sweetheart''

The use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flash-back]] structures continued to develop in this period, with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve. The Vitagraph company's ''The Man That Might Have Been'' ([[William J. Humphrey]], 1914), is even more complex, with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonist's real passage through life with what might have been, if his son had not died.

After 1914, [[cross cutting]] between parallel actions came to be used{{snd}} more so in American films than in European ones. Cross-cutting was often used to get new effects of contrast, such as the cross-cut sequence in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Whispering Chorus]]'' (1918), in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a Chinese prostitute in an opium den, while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church.

The general trend in the development of cinema, led from the United States, was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories, and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing amongst American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than Griffith. DeMille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary American life. [[Maurice Tourneur]] was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films, together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy, while at the same time he was capable of getting greater [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] from his actors at appropriate moments, as in ''[[A Girl's Folly]]'' (1917).

[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]] was the leader in developing "polite comedy", while slapstick was refined by [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]], who both started with [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone company. They reduced the usual frenetic pace of Sennett's films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement, and the cleverness of their gags. By 1917 Chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films, and mixing the comedy with sentiment.

In Russia, [[Yevgeni Bauer]] put a slow intensity of acting combined with Symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way.

In Sweden, [[Victor Sjöström]] made a series of films that combined the realities of people's lives with their surroundings in a striking manner, while Mauritz Stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level.

In Germany, [[Ernst Lubitsch]] got his inspiration from the stage work of [[Max Reinhardt (director)|Max Reinhardt]], both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle, and applied this to his films, culminating in his ''[[The Doll (1919 film)|die Puppe]]'' (''The Doll''), ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]]'' (''The Oyster Princess'') and ''[[Madame DuBarry (1919 film)|Madame DuBarry]]''.

===Hollywood triumphant===
[[File:Charlie_Chaplin_with_doll.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Charlie Chaplin]]]]
At the start of the [[First World War]], [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. The American industry, or "Hollywood", as it was becoming known after [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|its new geographical center in California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth.

By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,&lt;ref name="filmsite.org"/&gt; or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], the [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] adventures of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the romances of [[Clara Bow]], to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical [[continuity editing]] was developed and exported – although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong [[realism (arts)|realist]] traditions in art and drama, such as [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].

This development was contemporary with the growth of the [[studio system]] and its greatest publicity method, the [[star system (film)|star system]], which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios' efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system's commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous [[escapism]] discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the late teens and the 1920s.

==Sound era==
{{Main|Sound film}}
{{See also|1930s in film}}
[[File:DonJuanPoster2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]] is the first feature-length film to utilize the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it has no spoken dialogue.]]
During late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; but this process was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]''. This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with [[phonograph]] records of talks and music. The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as [[Vitaphone]] were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods like Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that "talking pictures", or "talkies", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].

The change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like [[Cinema of China|China]] and [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (China, 1934) and [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''[[I Was Born, But...]]'' (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the [[benshi]], the live narrator who was a major part of Japanese silent cinema, found his acting career was ending.

Sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called "The Golden Age of Hollywood", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer [[Shirley Temple]].

===Creative impact of sound===
[[File:Poster - Gone With the Wind 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]|alt=A screencap of the title card from the trailer of Gone with the Wind.]]

Creatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days. The late '20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended.

This awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: [[William Wellman]] with ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' and ''[[The Man I Love (1929 film)|The Man I Love]]'', [[Rouben Mamoulian]] with ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (Britain's first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound (Eyman, 1997). In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical advances in microphones and cameras, and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming).

Sound films emphasized black history and benefited different [[genres]] more so than silents did. Most obviously, the [[musical film]] was born; the first classic-style Hollywood musical was ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' (1929) and the form would find its first major creator in [[choreographer]]/director [[Busby Berkeley]] (''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', 1933, ''[[Dames]]'', 1934). In France, [[avant-garde]] director [[René Clair]] made [[surrealism|surreal]] use of song and dance in comedies like ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930) and ''[[Le Million]]'' (1931). [[Universal Pictures]] begin releasing [[gothic horror]] films like ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931)|Frankenstein]]'' (both 1931). In 1933, [[RKO Pictures]] released [[Merian C. Cooper]]'s classic "giant monster" film ''[[King Kong (1933)|King Kong]]''. The trend thrived best in [[Cinema of India|India]], where the influence of the country's traditional song-and-dance drama made the musical the basic form of most sound films (Cook, 1990); virtually unnoticed by the Western world for decades, this Indian popular cinema would nevertheless become the world's most prolific. (''See also [[Bollywood]].'')

At this time, American [[gangster film]]s like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and Wellman's ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931) became popular. Dialogue now took precedence over "slapstick" in Hollywood comedies: the fast-paced, witty banter of ''[[The Front Page]]'' (1931) or ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), the sexual double entrendres of [[Mae West]] (''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', 1933) or the often subversively anarchic nonsense talk of the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', 1933). [[Walt Disney]], who had previously been in the short cartoon business, stepped into feature films with the first English-speaking animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; released by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1937. 1939, a major year for American cinema, brought such films as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with The Wind]]''.

== Color in cinema ==
Previously, it was believed that color films were first projected in 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London (the main problem with the color being that the technique, created by George Smith, ([[Kinemacolor]]) only used two colors: green and red, which were mixed additively). But in fact, it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created. This untitled film was directed by photographer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] and his patron [[Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1871)|Frederick Marshall Lee]]. The way they did it was to use black and white film rolls, but have green, red, and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot. To complete the film, they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector. However, both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that, eventually, sank the idea.

Subsequently, in 1916, the [[technicolor]] technique arrived (trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue). Its use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions). The first audiovisual piece that was completely realized with this technique was the short of [[Walt Disney]] "[[Flowers and Trees]]", directed by [[Burt Gillett]] in 1932. Even so, the first film to be performed with this technique will be "The Vanities Fair" (1935) by Rouben Mamoulian. Later on, the technicolor was extended mainly in the musical field as "[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]" or "[[Singin' in the Rain|Singing in the rain]]", in films such as "[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]" or the animation film, "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]".&lt;ref name="esquire1"/&gt;

==World War II and its aftermath==
{{Main|1940s in film}}
The desire for wartime propaganda against the opposition created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas like ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942), ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944) and [[Noël Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s celebrated naval film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' in 1942, which won a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. These existed alongside more flamboyant films like [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944) and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), as well as [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[1944 in film|1944 film]] ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'', based on the [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespearean history]] ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. The success of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' allowed Disney to make more animated features like ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941) and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942).

The onset of US involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. American propaganda films included ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942), ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''  (1942), ''[[Forever and a Day (1943 film)|Forever and a Day]]'' (1943) and ''[[Objective, Burma!]]'' (1945). Notable American films from the war years include the anti-Nazi ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]'' (1943), scripted by [[Dashiell Hammett]]; ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's direction of a script by [[Thornton Wilder]]; the [[George M. Cohan]] [[biopic]], ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), starring [[James Cagney]], and the immensely popular ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart would star in 36 films between 1934 and 1942 including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), one of the first films now considered a classic [[film noir]]. In 1941, [[RKO Pictures]] released ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' made by [[Orson Welles]]. It is often considered the greatest film of all time. It would set the stage for the modern motion picture, as it revolutionized film story telling.

The strictures of wartime also brought an interest in more fantastical subjects. These included Britain's [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] melodramas (including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]''), and films like ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', ''I Married a Witch'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|Blithe Spirit]]''. [[Val Lewton]] also produced a series of atmospheric and influential small-budget [[horror film|horror]] films, some of the more famous examples being ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'', ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. The decade probably also saw the so-called "women's pictures", such as ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'' and ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' at the peak of their popularity.

1946 saw RKO Radio releasing ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' directed by [[Frank Capra]]. Soldiers returning from the war would provide the inspiration for films like ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', and many of those in the film industry had served in some capacity during the war. [[Samuel Fuller]]'s experiences in World War II would influence his largely autobiographical films of later decades such as ''[[The Big Red One]]''. [[The Actor's Studio]] was founded in October 1947 by [[Elia Kazan]], [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], and the same year [[Oskar Fischinger]] filmed ''[[Motion Painting No. 1]]''.

In 1943, ''Ossessione'' was screened in Italy, marking the beginning of [[Italian neorealism]]. Major films of this type during the 1940s included ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', and ''[[La Terra Trema]]''. In 1952 ''[[Umberto D]]'' was released, usually considered the last film of this type.

In the late 1940s, in Britain, [[Ealing Studios]] embarked on their series of celebrated comedies, including ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore!]]'', ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]'', and [[Carol Reed]] directed his influential thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', ''[[The Fallen Idol (film)|The Fallen Idol]]'' and ''[[The Third Man]]''. [[David Lean]] was also rapidly becoming a force in world cinema with ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and his [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', and [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] would experience the best of their creative partnership with films like ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''.

==1950s==
{{Main|1950s in film}}
[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&amp;W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|300px|A production scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].]]
The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. Protested by the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] before the committee, the hearings resulted in the [[blacklist]]ing of many actors, writers and directors, including Chayefsky, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Dalton Trumbo]], and many of these fled to Europe, especially the United Kingdom.

The [[Cold War|Cold War era]] [[zeitgeist]] translated into a type of near-[[paranoia]] manifested in [[theme (literature)|theme]]s such as [[alien invasion|invading armies of evil aliens]], (''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''); and [[communism|communist]] [[fifth column]]ists, (''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'').

During the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television, and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The demise of the "studio system" spurred the [[Criticism|self-commentary]] of films like ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).

In 1950, the [[Lettrists]] avante-gardists caused riots at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], when [[Isidore Isou]]'s ''Treatise on Slime and Eternity'' was screened. After their criticism of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and split with the movement, the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new [[hypergraphics|hypergraphical]] techniques.
The most notorious film is [[Guy Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' of 1952.

Distressed by the increasing number of closed theatres, studios and companies would find new and innovative ways to bring audiences back. These included attempts to widen their appeal with new screen formats. [[Cinemascope]], which would remain a [[20th Century Fox]] distinction until 1967, was announced with 1953's ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. [[VistaVision]], [[Cinerama]], and [[Todd-AO]] boasted a "bigger is better" approach to [[marketing]] films to a dwindling US audience. This resulted in the revival of epic films to take advantage of the new big screen formats. Some of the most successful examples of these [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[history|historical]] spectaculars include ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Also during this period a number of other significant films were produced in [[Todd-AO]], developed by [[Mike Todd]] shortly before his death, including [[Oklahoma!]] (1955), [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]] (1956), [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]] (1958) and [[Cleopatra]] (1963) plus many more.

[[Gimmick]]s also proliferated to lure in audiences. The fad for [[3-D film]] would last for only two years, 1952–1954, and helped sell ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. Producer [[William Castle]] would tout films featuring "Emergo" "Percepto", the first of a series of gimmicks that would remain popular marketing tools for Castle and others throughout the 1960s.

In the U.S., a post-WW2 tendency toward questioning the establishment and societal norms and the early [[activism]] of the [[civil rights movement]] was reflected in Hollywood films such as ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' (1955), ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' and [[Reginald Rose]]'s ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957). Disney continued making animated films, notably; ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). He began, however, getting more involved in live action films, producing classics like ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), and ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957). Television began competing seriously with films projected in theatres, but surprisingly it promoted more filmgoing rather than curtailing it.

''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' is probably a unique film in at least one interesting respect. Its two leads, [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Claire Bloom]], were in the industry in no less than three different centuries. In the 19th Century, Chaplin made his theatrical debut at the age of eight, in 1897, in a clog dancing troupe, The Eight Lancaster Lads. In the 21st Century, Bloom is still enjoying a full and productive career, having appeared in dozens of films and television series produced up to and including 2013.  She received particular acclaim for her role in ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010).

During [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]]'s 'Golden Age' of the 1950s, successful films included ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) by [[Akira Kurosawa]], as well as [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953) and [[Ishirō Honda]]'s ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5D71238F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa's ''Seven Samurai'' has been remade several times as [[Western (genre)|Western films]], such as ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' (1960) and ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), and has also inspired several [[Bollywood]] films, such as ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) and ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]'' (1998). ''Rashomon'' was also remade as ''[[The Outrage]]'' (1964), and inspired films with "[[Rashomon effect]]" storytelling methods, such as ''[[Andha Naal]]'' (1954), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002). ''The Hidden Fortress'' was also the inspiration behind [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Mikio Naruse]], [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] and [[Nagisa Oshima]].&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the [[New Hollywood]] movement of the 1960s to 1980s.

During [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]]'s 'Golden Age' of the 1950s, it was producing 200 films annually, while [[Parallel Cinema|Indian independent films]] gained greater recognition through international [[film festival]]s.

The [[cinema of South Korea]] also experienced a 'Golden Age' in the 1950s, beginning with director Lee Kyu-hwan's tremendously successful remake of ''Chunhyang-jon'' (1955).&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Korean Film|first=Jon|last=Marshall|url=http://www.pusanweb.com/Exit/Oct97/briefhist.htm|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year also saw the release of ''[[Yangsan Province (film)|Yangsan Province]]'' by the renowned director, [[Kim Ki-young]], marking the beginning of his productive career. Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy ''Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)'', had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 films were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Darcy|last=Paquet|title=1945–1959|publisher=Korean Film Page|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm45-59.html|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s was also a 'Golden Age' for [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]], with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included [[Gerardo de Leon]], [[Gregorio Fernández (director)|Gregorio Fernández]], [[Eddie Romero]], [[Lamberto Avellana]], and [[Cirio Santiago]].&lt;ref name="curtain"&gt;[http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?].

==1960s==
{{Main|1960s in film}}
During the 1960s, the studio system in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] declined, because many films were now being made on location in other countries, or using studio facilities abroad, such as [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] in the UK and [[Cinecittà]] in Rome. "Hollywood" films were still largely aimed at family audiences, and it was often the more old-fashioned films that produced the studios' biggest successes. Productions like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) were among the biggest money-makers of the decade. The growth in independent producers and production companies, and the increase in the power of individual actors also contributed to the decline of traditional Hollywood studio production.

There was also an increasing awareness of foreign language cinema in America during this period. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the [[French New Wave]] directors such as [[François Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] produced films such as ''[[The 400 Blows|Les quatre cents coups]]'', ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' and ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' which broke the rules of Hollywood cinema's [[narrative structure]]. As well, audiences were becoming aware of Italian films like [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' and the stark dramas of Sweden's [[Ingmar Bergman]].

In Britain, the "Free Cinema" of [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Tony Richardson]] and others lead to a group of realistic and innovative dramas including ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' and ''[[This Sporting Life]]''. Other British films such as ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (all in 1965–1966) helped to reduce prohibitions sex and nudity on screen, while the casual sex and violence of the [[James Bond]] films, beginning with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 would render the series popular worldwide.

During the 1960s, [[Ousmane Sembène]] produced several French- and [[Wolof language|Wolof-language]] films and became the "father" of [[African Cinema]]. In Latin America, the dominance of the "Hollywood" model was challenged by many film makers. [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]] called for a politically engaged [[Third Cinema]] in contrast to Hollywood and the European [[auteur]] cinema.

Further, the nuclear paranoia of the age, and the threat of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange (like the 1962 close-call with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]]) prompted a reaction within the film community as well. Films like [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] were produced in a Hollywood that was once known for its overt patriotism and wartime propaganda.

In [[documentary film]] the sixties saw the blossoming of [[Direct Cinema]], an observational style of film making as well as the advent of more overtly partisan films like ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]'' about the [[Vietnam War]] by [[Emile de Antonio]]. By the late 1960s however, Hollywood filmmakers were beginning to create more innovative and groundbreaking films that reflected the social revolution taken over much of the western world such as ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' is often considered the beginning of the so-called [[New Hollywood]].

In Japanese cinema, Academy Award-winning director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), which like his previous films also had a profound influence around the world. The influence of this film is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the "[[Man with No Name]]" trend.

==1970s==
{{Main|1970s in film}}
The [[New Hollywood]] was the period following the decline of the [[studio system]] during the 1950s and 1960s and the end of the [[production code]], (which was replaced in 1968 by the [[MPAA film rating system]]). During the 1970s, filmmakers increasingly depicted explicit sexual content and showed gunfight and battle scenes that included graphic images of bloody deaths{{snd}} a good example of this is [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).

Post-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling of the New Hollywood producers. The new methods of [[drama]] and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired during the classical/Golden Age period: story chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature unsettling "[[twist ending]]s", main characters may behave in a morally ambiguous fashion, and the lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The beginnings of post-classical storytelling may be seen in 1940s and 1950s [[film noir]] films, in films such as ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. 1971 marked the release of controversial films like ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. This sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema.

During the 1970s, a new group of American filmmakers emerged, such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Terrence Malick]], and [[Robert Altman]]. This coincided with the increasing popularity of the [[auteur theory]] in film literature and the media, which posited that a film director's films express their personal vision and creative insights. The development of the auteur style of filmmaking helped to give these directors far greater control over their projects than would have been possible in earlier eras. This led to some great critical and commercial successes, like Scorsese's ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' films, [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', Altman's ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', Allen's ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', Malick's ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' and ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and Polish immigrant [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. It also, however, resulted in some failures, including [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' and [[Michael Cimino]]'s hugely expensive Western epic ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which helped to bring about the demise of its backer, [[United Artists]].

The financial disaster of ''Heaven's Gate'' marked the end of the visionary "auteur" directors of the "New Hollywood", who had unrestrained creative and financial freedom to develop films. The phenomenal success in the 1970s of [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' originated the concept of the modern "[[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]". However, the enormous success of George Lucas' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' led to much more than just the popularization of blockbuster film-making. The film's revolutionary use of special effects, sound editing and music had led it to become widely regarded as one of the single most important films in the medium's history, as well as the most influential film of the 1970s. Hollywood studios increasingly focused on producing a smaller number of very large budget films with massive marketing and promotional campaigns. This trend had already been foreshadowed by the commercial success of [[disaster film]]s such as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]''.

During the mid-1970s, more pornographic theatres, euphemistically called "adult cinemas", were established, and the legal production of [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films began. Porn films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and its star [[Linda Lovelace]] became something of a popular culture phenomenon and resulted in a spate of similar sex films. The porn cinemas finally died out during the 1980s, when the popularization of the home [[VCR]] and pornography videotapes allowed audiences to watch sex films at home. In the early 1970s, English-language audiences became more aware of the new [[West German]] cinema, with [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and [[Wim Wenders]] among its leading exponents.

In [[world cinema]], the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of [[martial arts film]]s, largely due to its reinvention by [[Bruce Lee]], who departed from the artistic style of traditional [[Chinese martial arts]] films and added a much greater sense of realism to them with his [[Jeet Kune Do]] style. This began with ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which was a major success across [[Asian cinema|Asia]]. However, he didn't gain fame in the [[Western world]] until shortly after his death in 1973, when ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' was released. The film went on to become the most successful martial arts film in cinematic history, popularized the martial arts film genre across the world, and cemented Bruce Lee's status as a cultural icon. [[Hong Kong action cinema]], however, was in decline due to a wave of "[[Bruceploitation]]" films. This trend eventually came to an end in 1978 with the martial arts [[comedy film]]s, ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and starring [[Jackie Chan]], laying the foundations for the rise of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s.

While the [[musical film]] genre had declined in Hollywood by this time, musical films were quickly gaining popularity in the [[cinema of India]], where the term "[[Bollywood]]" was coined for the growing [[Hindi]] film industry in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that ended up dominating [[South Asian cinema]], overtaking the more critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] in popularity. Hindi filmmakers combined the Hollywood musical formula with the conventions of ancient [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] to create a new film genre called "[[Masala (film genre)|Masala]]", which dominated Indian cinema throughout the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K. Moti Gokulsing|first=K. Gokulsing, Wimal Dissanayake|publisher=Trentham Books|year=2004|isbn=1-85856-329-1|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "Masala" films portrayed [[Action film|action]], comedy, [[Drama film|drama]], [[Romance film|romance]] and [[melodrama]] all at once, with "[[filmi]]" song and dance routines thrown in. This trend began with films directed by [[Manmohan Desai]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who remains one of the most popular [[film star]]s in South Asia. The most popular Indian film of all time was ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), a "Masala" film inspired by a real-life [[Dacoity|dacoit]] as well as Kurosawa's ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and the [[Spaghetti Western]]s.

The end of the decade saw the first major international marketing of [[Australia]]n cinema, as [[Peter Weir]]'s films ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[The Last Wave]]'' and [[Fred Schepisi]]'s ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' gained critical acclaim. In 1979, Australian filmmaker [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] also garnered international attention for his violent, low-budget action film ''[[Mad Max]]''.

==1980s==
{{Main|1980s in film}}
[[File:The_Expendables_2_Cast_Roster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ensemble cast of action stars of the 80s, including (left to right) [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Terry Crews]]]]
During the 1980s, audiences began increasingly watching films on their home [[VCR]]s. In the early part of that decade, the [[film studio]]s tried legal action to ban home ownership of VCRs as a violation of [[copyright]], which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, the sale and rental of films on [[home video]] became a significant "second venue" for exhibition of films, and an additional source of revenue for the film industries.

The [[George Lucas|Lucas]]–[[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] combine would dominate "Hollywood" cinema for much of the 1980s, and lead to much imitation. Two follow-ups to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', three to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and three ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films helped to make sequels of successful films more of an expectation than ever before. Lucas also launched [[THX|THX Ltd]], a division of [[Lucasfilm]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |title=THX Milestones |accessdate=2006-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109131348/http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |archivedate=2006-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spielberg enjoyed one of the decade's greatest successes in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' the same year. 1982 also saw the release of Disney's ''[[Tron]]'' which was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively. American independent cinema struggled more during the decade, although [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983) helped to establish him as one of the most critically acclaimed American film makers of the era. Also during 1983 ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' was released, which was very profitable and resulted in even greater fame for its leading actor [[Al Pacino]]. Probably{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} the most successful film commercially was [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 version of [[Bob Kane]]'s creation, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which broke box-office records. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of the demented [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] earned him a total of $60,000,000 after figuring in his percentage of the gross.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

British cinema was given a boost during the early 1980s by the arrival of [[David Puttnam]]'s company [[Goldcrest Films]]. The films ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' and ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'' appealed to a "middlebrow" audience which was increasingly being ignored by the major Hollywood studios. While the films of the 1970s had helped to define modern [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion pictures, the way "Hollywood" released its films would now change. Films, for the most part, would premiere in a wider number of theatres, although, to this day, some films still premiere using the route of the [[Roadshow theatrical release|limited/roadshow release system]]. Against some expectations, the rise of the multiplex cinema did not allow less mainstream films to be shown, but simply allowed the major blockbusters to be given an even greater number of screenings. However, films that had been overlooked in cinemas were increasingly being given a second chance on home video.

During the 1980s, [[Japanese cinema]] experienced a revival, largely due to the success of [[anime]] films. At the beginning of the 1980s, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1973) and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' (1979), both of which were unsuccessful as television series, were remade as films and became hugely successful in Japan. In particular, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' sparked the [[Gundam]] franchise of [[Real Robot]] [[mecha]] anime. The success of ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' also sparked a [[Macross]] franchise of mecha anime. This was also the decade when [[Studio Ghibli]] was founded. The studio produced [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s first [[fantasy film]]s, ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984) and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986), as well as [[Isao Takahata]]'s ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' (1988), all of which were very successful in Japan and received worldwide critical acclaim. [[Original video animation]] (OVA) films also began during this decade; the most influential of these early OVA films was [[Noboru Ishiguro]]'s [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' (1985). The most famous anime film of this decade was [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s cyberpunk film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988), which although initially unsuccessful at Japanese theaters, went on to become an international success.

[[Hong Kong action cinema]], which was in a state of decline due to endless [[Bruceploitation]] films after the death of [[Bruce Lee]], also experienced a revival in the 1980s, largely due to the reinvention of the [[action film]] genre by [[Jackie Chan]]. He had previously combined the [[comedy film]] and [[martial arts film]] genres successfully in the 1978 films ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]''. The next step he took was in combining this comedy martial arts genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and highly dangerous [[stunt]]s, reminiscent of the [[silent film]] era. The first film in this new style of action cinema was ''[[Project A]]'' (1983), which saw the formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] as well as the "Three Brothers" (Chan, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]). The film added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and [[slapstick]] humor, and became a huge success throughout the [[Far East]]. As a result, Chan continued this trend with martial arts action films containing even more elaborate and dangerous stunts, including ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985), ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'' (1986), ''[[Project A Part II]]'' (1987), ''[[Police Story 2]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'' (1988). Other new trends which began in the 1980s were the "[[girls with guns]]" subgenre, for which [[Michelle Yeoh]] gained fame; and especially the "[[heroic bloodshed]]" genre, revolving around [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]], largely pioneered by [[John Woo]] and for which [[Chow Yun-fat]] became famous. These Hong Kong action trends were later adopted by many Hollywood action films in the 1990s and 2000s.

==1990s==
{{Main|1990s in film}}
The early 1990s saw the development of a commercially successful independent cinema in the United States. Although cinema was increasingly dominated by special-effects films such as ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), the latter of which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time up until ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), also directed by James Cameron, independent films like [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989) and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) had significant commercial success both at the cinema and on home video. Filmmakers associated with the Danish film movement [[Dogme 95]] introduced a manifesto aimed to purify filmmaking. Its first few films gained worldwide critical acclaim, after which the movement slowly faded out.

[[File:1995cinema admissions.png|thumb|250px|right|Cinema admissions in 1995]]
Major American studios began to create their own [[independent film|"independent" production companies]] to finance and produce non-mainstream fare. One of the most successful independents of the 1990s, [[Miramax Films]], was bought by Disney the year before the release of Tarantino's runaway hit ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' in 1994. The same year marked the beginning of film and video distribution online. Animated films aimed at family audiences also regained their popularity, with Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). During 1995, the first feature length [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] feature, ''[[Toy Story]]'', was produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by Disney. After the success of Toy Story, computer animation would grow to become the dominant technique for feature length animation, which would allow competing film companies such as [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[20th Century Fox]] to effectively compete with Disney with successful films of their own. During the late 1990s, another cinematic transition began, from physical film stock to [[digital cinema]] technology. Meanwhile, [[DVD]]s became the new standard for consumer video, replacing VHS tapes.

==Recent years==
{{Main|2000s in film|2010s in film}}
The [[documentary film]] also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time, with the success of films such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. A new genre was created with [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq, transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers. The success of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' led to a revival of interest in [[epic film|epic cinema]], and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' renewed interest in [[musical film|musical cinema]]. [[home cinema|Home theatre]] systems became increasingly sophisticated, as did some of the special edition [[DVD]]s designed to be shown on them. ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]'' was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences.

In 2001, the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] began, and by its end in 2011, it had become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time until the Marvel Cinematic Universe passed it in 2015.

More films were also being released simultaneously to [[IMAX]] cinema, the first was in 2002's Disney animation ''[[Treasure Planet]]''; and the first live action was in 2003's ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and a re-release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Later in the decade, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was the first major feature film to have been at least partially shot in IMAX technology.

There has been an increasing globalization of cinema during this decade, with foreign-language films gaining popularity in English-speaking markets. Examples of such films include ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (Mandarin), ''[[Amélie]]'' (French), ''[[Lagaan]]'' (Hindi), ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japanese), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (Brazilian Portuguese), ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (Aramaic), ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (Mayan) and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (multiple European languages). Italy is the most awarded country at the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|nominations]].

In 2003 there was a revival in 3D film popularity the first being James Cameron's ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' which was released as the first full-length 3-D IMAX feature filmed with the [[Reality Camera System]]. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Emmy nominated Director of Photography Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film ''[[Spy Kids 3D: Game Over]]'' (2003), ''[[Aliens of the Deep]]'' IMAX (2005), and ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]'' (2005).

After James Cameron's 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the highest-grossing film of all time, 3D films gained brief popularity with many other films being released in 3D, with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation such as [[Universal Pictures]]/[[Illumination Entertainment]]'s ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[How To Train Your Dragon (film)|How To Train Your Dragon]]'', ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and ''[[Megamind]]''.

A '''hybrid operating room''' is a surgical theatre that is equipped with advanced medical imaging devices such as fixed [[C-Arm]]s, [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] scanners or [[MRI]] scanners.&lt;ref name=nollert&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nollert |first1=Georg|author2=Wich, Sabine; Figel, Anne|title=The Cardiovascular Hybrid OR-Clinical &amp; Technical Considerations|journal=CTSnet|date=12 March 2010 |url=http://www.ctsnet.org/article/cardiovascular-hybrid-or-clinical-technical-considerations|accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These imaging devices enable minimally-invasive surgery. Minimally-invasive surgery is intended to be less traumatic for the patient and minimize [[Surgical incision|incisions]] on the patient and perform surgery procedure through one or several small cuts.

Though imaging has been a standard part of the OR for a long time in the form of mobile [[C-Arm]]s, [[ultrasound]] and [[endoscopy]], these new minimally-invasive procedures require imaging techniques that can visualize smaller body parts such as thin vessels in the heart muscle and can be facilitated through [[rotational angiography|intraoperative 3D imaging]].&lt;ref name="nollert" /&gt;

== Clinical applications ==
Hybrid operating rooms are currently used mainly in cardiac, vascular and neurosurgery, but could be suitable for a number of other surgical disciplines.

=== Cardiovascular surgery ===
The repair of diseased heart valves and the surgical treatment of rhythm disturbances and aortic aneurysms can benefit from the imaging capabilities of a hybrid OR. [[Hybrid cardiac surgical procedure|Hybrid Cardiac Surgery]] is a widespread treatment for these diseases.

Also, the shift towards endovascular treatment of [[Endovascular aneurysm repair|abdominal aortic aneurysms]] pushed the spread of angiographic systems in vascular OR environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biasi|first1=L.|author2=Ali, T.; Ratnam, L.A.; Morgan, R.; Loftus, I.; Thompson, M.|title=Intra-operative DynaCT imptoves technical success of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.|journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery|date=February 2009|volume=49|issue=2|pages=288–295|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2008.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly for complex endografts, a hybrid operating theater should be a basic requirement. Also, it is well-suited for emergency treatment.&lt;ref name=steinbauer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinbauer|first1=M.|author2=I. Töpel, E. Verhoeven|title=Angiohybrid-OP – Neue Möglichkeiten, Planung, Realisierung und Effekte|journal=Gefässchirurgie – Zeitschrift für vaskuläre und endovaskuläre Medizin|year=2012|issue=17|pages=346–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some surgeons do not only verify the placement of complex endografts intraoperatively, they also use their angiography system and the applications it offers for planning the procedure. As anatomy changes between a preoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy because of patient positioning and the insertion of stiff material, a much more precise planning is possible if the surgeon performs an intraoperative rotational angiography, takes an automatic segmentation of the aorta, places markers for the renal arteries and other landmarks in 3D and then overlays the contours on 2D fluoroscopy. This guidance is updated with any change in C-Arm angulation/position or table position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maene|first1=Lieven, MD|author2=Roel Beelen, MD; Patrick Peeters, MD; Jürgen Verbist, MD; Koen Keirse, MD; Koen Deloose, MD; Joren Callaert, MD; and Marc Bosiers, MD|title=3D Navigation in Complex TEVAR|journal=Endovascular Today|date=September 2012|pages=69–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurosurgery ===
{{Main|Intraoperative MRI}}
In Neurosurgery, applications for hybrid ORs are for example spinal fusion&lt;ref name=raftovideo&gt;{{cite web |last=Raftopoulos |first=Christian |title=Robotic 3D Imaging for Spinal Fusion – Live Case |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2eZdaCK5rY |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AuTwE0Ob?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2eZdaCK5rY |archivedate=24 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and intracranial aneurysm coiling. In both cases, they have been rated promising to improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heran|first1=N.S.|author2=J.K. Song, K. Namba, W. Smith, Y. Niimi and A. Berenstein|title=The Utility of DynaCT in Neuroendovascular Procedures|journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology|year=2006|volume=27|pages=330–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koreaki |first1=Irie |author2=Murayama, Yuichi; Saguchi, Takayuki; Ishibashi, Toshihiro; Ebara, Masaki; Takao, Hiroyuki; Abe, Toshiaki|title=Dynact Soft-Tissue Visualization Using An Angiographic C-Arm System: Initial Clinical Experience in the Operating Room|journal=Neurosurgery|date=March 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=266–272|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000317403.23713.92 |pmid=18424996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For spinal fusion procedures, an integration with a navigation system can further improve the workflow. Intraoperative acquisition of a cone beam computed tomgraphy image can also be used to reconstruct three dimensional CT-like images.  This may be useful for the applications above and also for confirmation of targeting for placement of ventricular catheters, biopsies, or deep brain stimulation electrodes. Intra-operative MRI is used to guide brain tumor surgery as well as placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes and interstitial laser thermal therapy.

=== Thoracic surgery and endobronchial procedures ===

Procedures to diagnose and treat small pulmonary nodules have also recently been performed in hybrid operating rooms. Interventional image guidance thereby offers the advantage of precisely knowing the position of the nodules, particularly in small or ground-glass opaque tumors, metastases, and/or patients with reduced pulmonary function. This allows for a precise navigation in biopsies, and resection in [[Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery|VATS]]. Most importantly, using interventional imaging in VATS can substitute for the loss of tactile sensing. This new approach also delivers the potential to spare healthy lung tissue by knowing the exact position of the nodule which increases the quality of life for the patient after the operation.

The process for diagnosis and treatment usually comprises 3 steps:
# Detection of nodules on CT or chest X-ray
# Biopsy of nodule to evaluate malignancy
# If necessary, treatment of nodule through surgery/ radiotherapy/ chemotherapy (curative approach) or through chemoembolization / ablation (palliative approach)

A hybrid operating room supports steps 2 and 3 (if surgery is performed) of this workflow:

==== Biopsy ====
Small lung nodules identified on a thorax CT need to be examined for malignancy, thus a small portion of sample tissue is taken out in a needle procedure. The needle is advanced through the bronchial tree, or trans-thoracically, towards the position of the nodule. To make sure tissue is captured from the nodule as opposed to accidentally taking healthy lung tissue, imaging modalities such as mobile C-Arms, ultrasound, or bronchoscopes are used. The yield rate of biopsies in small nodules is reported to be between 33–50% in tumors smaller than 3&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Shure&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shure|first1=D.|journal=Chest |year=1989 |volume=95 |pages=1130–1138|doi=10.1378/chest.95.5.1130 |display-authors=etal |title=Transbronchial biopsy and needle aspiration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=G.|journal=Chest|year=2003|volume=123|pages=115S-128S|doi=10.1378/chest.123.1_suppl.115s |display-authors=etal|title=Performance Characteristics of Different Modalities for Diagnosis of Suspected Lung Cancer *}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APC&gt;{{cite journal|title=APC Guidelines Chest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with angiographic C-arms has proven to be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that the patient and the diaphragm are in exactly the same position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the accuracy is usually much higher than using pre-operative data.
Rotational angiography visualizes the bronchial tree in 3D during the procedure. The air thereby serves as a ‘natural’ contrast agent, thus the nodules are well visible. On this 3D image, using dedicated software, the nodules can be marked, along with a planned needle path for the biopsy (endobronchially or trans-thoracically). These images can then be overlaid on live fluoroscopy. This gives the pulmonologist improved guidance towards the nodules. Yield rates of 90% in nodules of 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm, and 100% in nodules &gt; 2&amp;nbsp;cm have been reported with this new approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohenforst-Schmidt|first1=W-|author2=J. Brachmann|title=Dynact-Navigation For Bronchoscopy Shows Promising Results In A First Feasibility Study|journal=Medical Hospital Coburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Surgery ====

VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive technique to resect lung nodules that saves the patient the trauma of a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing makes it difficult for the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules &lt; 1&amp;nbsp;cm can be below 40% as studies show.&lt;ref name=Suzuki&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suzuki|first1=K.|author2=Nagai K, Yoshida J, Ohmatsu H, Takahashi K, Nishimura M, Nishiwaki Y|journal=Chest|year=1999|volume=115|issue=2|pages=563–568|doi=10.1378/chest.115.2.563|title=Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery for Small Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules *}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In order to be able to use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol&lt;ref name=Ikeda&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ikeda|first1=K.|author2=Ikeda K, Nomori H, Mori T, Kobayashi H, Iwatani K, Yoshimoto K, Kawanaka K|journal=Chest|year=2007|volume=131|pages=502–506|doi=10.1378/chest.06-1882|title=Impalpable Pulmonary Nodules With Ground-Glass Opacity *|pmid=17296654}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes,&lt;ref name=Kazuhiro&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kazuhiro|first1=U.|author2=Kazuyoshi S, Yoshikazu K, Tao-Sheng L, Katsuhiko U, Kimikazu, H|journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery|year=2004|volume=77|pages=1033–1038}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then can be resected within the same procedure.

=== Orthopedic trauma surgery ===

Complex fractures like pelvis fractures, calcaneus or tibia head fractures, etc. need an exact placement of screws and other surgical implants to allow quickest possible treatment of the patients. Minimally invasive surgical approaches result in less trauma for the patient and quicker recovery. However, the risk of malpositionins, revisions and nerval damage cannot be underestimated (Malposition and revision rates of different imaging modalities for percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation following pelvic fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;ref name=Schmal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmal |first1=Zwingmann |author2=Hauschild O, Bode G, Südkamp NP|journal=Arch Orthop Trauma Surg |year=2013 |volume=133 |issue=9 |pages=1257–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The possibility of the use of an angio system with a spatial resolution of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm, the large field of view to image the entire pelvis in one image and the high kW rate allows the surgeon high precision images while not impairing hygiene (floor mounted systems) or access to the patient (CT).

=== Laparoscopic surgery ===

As in other minimally invasive surgery the first laparoscopic surgeons were smiled at and the surgical community did not believe in this new technology. Today it is the gold standard for most surgeries. Starting with a simple appendectomy, partial kidney resections and partial liver resections, etc. The laparoscopic approach is expanding. The image quality, the possibility of imaging the patient in the surgical position and the guidance of the instruments facilitate this approach.(Efficacy of DynaCT for surgical navigation during complex laparoscopic surgery: an initial experience.&lt;ref name=Nozaki&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuse|first=Nozaki|journal=Surg Endosc|year=2013|volume=27|pages=903–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial resection of the kidney, leaving as much healthy tissue, meaning kidney function to the patient has been described some time ago (Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors: indications, techniques and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Novick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novick|first=Uzzo|journal=Urology|year=2001|volume=166|pages=6–18|doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(05)66066-1|title=NEPHRON SPARING SURGERY FOR RENAL TUMORS: INDICATIONS, TECHNIQUES AND OUTCOMES}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The challenges the surgeons face is the loss of natural 3D vision and tactile sensing. Through small ports he/she has to rely on the images provided by the endoscope and is unable to feel the tissue. In a hybrid operating room the anatomy can be updated and imaged in real time. 3D images can be fused and/or overlaid on live fluoroscopy or the endoscope. (Real-time image guidance in laparoscopic liver surgery: first clinical experience with a guidance system based on intraoperative CT imaging.&lt;ref name=Kenngott&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller-Stich|first1=Kenngott|last2=Wagner|first2=Martin|last3=Gondan|first3=Matthias|last4=Nickel|first4=Felix|last5=Nolden|first5=Marco|last6=Fetzer|first6=Andreas | last7=Weitz| first7=Jürgen|last8=Fischer|first8=Lars|last9=Speidal|first9=Stefanie|last10=Meinzer | first10=Hans-Peter|last11=Böckler|first11=Dittmar | last12=Büchler | first12=Markus W. | last13=Müller-Stich | first13=Beat P. | journal=Surgical Endoscopy | publisher=Springer US|year=2013|doi=10.1007/s00464-013-3249-0|issn=0930-2794 | title=Real-time image guidance in laparoscopic liver surgery: first clinical experience with a guidance system based on intraoperative CT imaging | volume=28 | issue=3 | pages=933–940}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Crucial anatomy like vessels or a tumor can be avoided and complications reduced. Further investigations are under trial at the moment. (Surgical navigation in urology. European perspective&lt;ref name=Rassweiler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ESUT expert group|first1=Rassweiler|author2=Rassweiler MC, Müller M, Kenngott H, Meinzer HP, Teber D|journal=Curr Opin Urol|year=2014|volume=24|pages=81–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Emergency care ===

For the treatment of trauma patients every minute counts. Patients with severe bleeding after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and endovascular treatment of the patient can be performed. For example, the tension in the brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an operating table as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if unstable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the patient can save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.

== Imaging techniques ==

=== Imaging techniques with a fixed C-Arm ===

==== Fluoroscopy and data acquisition ====

[[Fluoroscopy]] is performed with continuous X-ray to guide the progression of a catheter or other devices within the body in live images. To depict even fine anatomic structures and devices, brilliant image quality is required. In particular, in cardiac interventions, imaging the moving heart requires a high frame rate (30f/s, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz) and high power output (at least 80&amp;nbsp;kW). Image quality needed for cardiac applications can only be achieved by high powered fixed angiography systems, not with mobile C-Arms.&lt;ref name=hartkens /&gt;

Angiographic systems provide a so-called acquisition mode, which stores the acquired images automatically on the system to be uploaded into an image archive later. While standard fluoroscopy is predominantly used to guide devices and to re-position the field of view,
data acquisition is applied for reporting or diagnostic purposes. In particular, when contrast media is injected, a data acquisition is mandatory, because the stored sequences can be replayed as often as required without re-injection of contrast media. To achieve a sufficient image quality for diagnoses and reporting, the angiographic system uses up to 10 times higher x-ray doses than standard fluoroscopy. Thus, data acquisition should be applied only when truly necessary. Data acquisition serves as a base for advanced imaging techniques such as DSA and rotational angiography.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

==== Rotational Angiography ====

[[Rotational angiography]] is a technique to acquire CT-like 3D images intraoperatively with a fixed C-Arm. To do that, the C-Arm is rotated around the patient, acquiring a series of projections that will be reconstructed to a 3D data set.

==== Digital subtraction angiography ====

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a two-dimensional imaging technique for the visualization of blood vessels in the human body (Katzen, 1995).&lt;ref name=katzen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katzen|first=B. T.|title=Current Status of Digital Angiography in Vascular Imaging|journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America|date=January 1995|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For DSA, the same sequence of a projection is acquired without and then with [[contrast media|contrast agent injection]] through the vessels under investigation. The first image is subtracted from the second to remove background structures such as bones as completely as possible and show the contrast-filled vessels more clearly. As there is a time lag between the acquisition of the first and the second image, motion correction algorithms are necessary to remove movement artifacts.&lt;ref name=hartkens&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartkens |first1=Thomas |author2=Riehl, Lisa; Altenbeck, Franziska; Nollert, Georg|title=Zukünftige Technologien im Hybrid OP|journal=Tagungsband zum Symposium "Medizintechnik Aktuell", 25.-26.10.2011 in Ulm, Germany|year=2011|series=Fachverband Biomedizinische Technik|pages=25–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An advanced application of DSA is road mapping. From the acquired DSA sequence, the image frame with maximum vessel opification is identified and assigned to be the so-called road-map mask. This mask is continuously subtracted from live [[fluoroscopy]] images to produce real-time subtracted fluoroscopic images overlaid on a static image of the vasculature. The clinical benefit is better visualization of small and complex vascular structures without distracting underlying tissue to support the placement of catheters and wires.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

==== 2D/3D registration ====

===== Fusion imaging and 2D/3D overlay =====
Modern angiographic systems are not just used for imaging, but support the surgeon also during the procedure by guiding the intervention based on [[rotational angiography|3D information]] acquired either pre-operatively or intra-operatively. Such guidance requires that the 3D information is registered to the patient. This is done using special proprietary software algorithms.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

===== Information flow between workstation and angiographic system =====
[[rotational angiography|3D images]] are calculated from a set of projections acquired during a rotation of the [[C-Arm]] around the patient. The volume reconstruction is performed on a separate workstation. The C-Arm and the workstation are connected a communicate continuously. For example, when the user virtually rotates the volume on the workstation to view the anatomy from a certain perspective, the parameter of this view can be transmitted to the angio system, which then drives the [[C-arm]] to exactly the same perspective for [[fluoroscopy]]. In the same way, if the C-arm angulation is changed, this angulation can be transmitted to the workstation which updates the volume to the same perspective as the fluoroscopic view. The software algorithm that stands behind this process is called registration and can also be done with other [[DICOM]] images, such as [[rotational angiography#CT versus Rotational Angiography|CT]] or [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRT]] data acquired preoperatively.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

===== Overlay of 3D information on top of 2D fluoroscopy =====
The 3D image itself can be overlaid colour-coded on top of the fluoroscopic image. Any change of the angulations of the C-arm will cause the workstation to re-calculate in real-time the view on the 3D image to match exactly the view of the live 2D fluoroscopy image. Without additional [[contrast media|contrast agent injection]] the surgeon can observe device movements simultaneously with the 3D overlay of the vessel contours in the fluoroscopy image.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;
An alternative way to add information from the workstation to the fluoroscopic image is to overlay, after either manual or automatic segmentation of the anatomical structures of interest in the 3D image, the outline as a contour onto the fluoroscopic image. This provides
additional information which is not visible in the fluoroscopic image. Some software available provides landmarks automatically, more can be added manually be the surgeon or a qualified technician. One example is the placement of a [[fenestrated stentgraft]] to treat an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]. The ostia of the [[renal artery|renal arteries]] can be circled on the 3D image and then overlaid on the live fluorscopy. As the marking has been done in 3D, it will update with any change of the fluoroscopy angulation to match the current view.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

===== Guidance during Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) =====
Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation requires exact positioning of the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root is considered to be optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.

==== Functional imaging in the OR ====

Improvements of the C-Arm technology nowadays also enable perfusion imaging and can visualize [[parenchyma]]l blood volume in the OR. To do that, [[rotational angiography]] (3D-DSA) is combined with a modified injection protocol and a special reconstruction algorithm. The blood flow can then be visualized in the course of time. This can be useful in the treatments of patients suffering from [[ischemic stroke]].&lt;ref name=hartkens /&gt;

=== Imaging techniques with a CT ===

A CT system mounted on rails can be moved into and out of an OR to support complex surgical procedures, such as brain, spine and trauma surgery with additional information through imaging. The Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Maryland describes that their intra-operative CT usage has a positive impact on patient outcomes by improving safety, decreasing infections and lowering the risks of complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsbayview.org/neurosurgery/ict|title=Intraoperative CT (iCT)|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imaging techniques with a MRT ===

Magnetic resonance imaging is used in Neurosurgery:

# Before surgery to enable precise planning
# During surgery to support decision making and accounting for brain shift
# After surgery to evaluate the outcome

An MRT system usually requires a lot of space both in the room and around the patient. It is not possible to perform surgery in a regular MRT room. Thus for step 2, there are two solutions of how to use an MR interoperatively, one is a moveable MRT scanner that can be brought in only when imaging is needed, the other is to transport the patient to an MR scanner in an adjacent room during surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=SUTHERLAND |first1=GARNETTE R. |author2=TARO KAIBARA, DEON LOUW, DAVID I. HOULT, BOGUSLAW TOMANEK AND JOHN SAUNDERS|title=A mobile high-field magnetic resonance system for Neurosurgery|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|date=November 1999|volume=91|pages=804–813 |doi=10.3171/jns.1999.91.5.0804}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinmeier |first1=Ralf |author2=Fahlbusch, Rudolf; Ganslandt, Oliver; Nimsky, Christopher; Buchfelder, Michael; Kaus, Michael; Heigl, Thomas; Lenz, Gerald; Kuth, Rainer; Huk, Walter|title=Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging with the Magnetom Open Scanner: Concepts, Neurosurgical Indications, and Procedures: A Preliminary Report|journal=Neurosurgery|date=October 1998|volume=43|issue=4|pages=739–747 |doi=10.1097/00006123-199810000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning considerations ==

=== Location/ Organization ===

Not only the usage of a hybrid operating room is "hybrid", but also its role within the hospital system. As it holds an imaging modality, the radiology department could take the lead responsibility for the room for expertise in handling, technical, maintenance, and connectivity reasons. From a patient workflow perspective, the room could be run by their surgical department and should rather be situated next to other surgical facilities, to ensure proper patient care and fast transportation.&lt;ref name=nollert /&gt;

=== Room size and preparation ===

Installing a hybrid OR is a challenge to standard hospital room sizes, as not only the imaging system requires some additional space, but there are also more people in the room as in a normal OR. A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. can work in such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=nollert /&gt;

=== Workflow ===

Planning a hybrid OR requires to involve a considerable number of stakeholders. To ensure a smooth workflow in the room, all parties working there need to state their requirements, which will impact the room design and determining various resources like space, medical, and imaging equipment.&lt;ref name=toma08 /&gt;&lt;ref name=benjamin08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=M.E.|title=Building a Modern Endovascular Suite|journal=Endovascular Today|date=March 2008|volume=3|pages=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This may require professional project management and several iterations in the planning process with the vendor of the imaging system, as technical interdependencies are complex. The result is always an individual solution tailored to the needs and preferences of the interdisciplinary team and the hospital.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

=== Lights, monitors and booms&lt;ref name=intech /&gt; ===

In general, two different light sources are needed in an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during [[fluoroscopy]] or [[endoscopy]]. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the [[C-Arm|angiography system]] determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process.&lt;ref name=toma08 /&gt; Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. [[vein stripping]] of the legs.
In summary, the key topics for planning the surgical light system include:
* Central location above the OR table (impossible with ceiling mounted systems).
* Usually three light heads for optimal illumination of multiple surgical fields
* Suspension accommodating unrestricted, independent movement and stable positioning of light heads
* Modular system with options for extension, e.g. video monitor and/or camera.

=== Imaging systems ===

The most common imaging modality to be used in hybrid ORs is a [[C-Arm]]. Expert consensus rates the performance of mobile C-arms in hybrid ORs as insufficient, because the limited power of the tube impacts image quality, the field of view is smaller for image-intensifier systems than for flat-panel detector systems and the cooling system of mobile C-Arms can lead to overheating after just a few hours, which can be too short for lengthy surgical procedures or for multiple procedures in a row, that would be needed to recover the investment in such a room.&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;Nollert, G.; Hartkens, T.; Figel, A.; Bulitta, C.; Altenbeck, F.; Gerhard, V. (2012). ''The Hybrid Operating Room'' in ''Cardiac Surgery / Book 2''. Intechweb. {{ISBN|978-953-51-0148-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed C-Arms do not have these limitations, but require more space in the room. These systems can be mounted either on the floor, the ceiling, or both if a biplane system is chosen. The latter is the system of choice if pediatric [[cardiology|cardiologists]], [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiologists]] or [[Neuroradiology|neurointerventionalists]] are major users of the room. It is not recommended to implement a biplane system if not clearly required by these clinical disciplines, as ceiling-mounted components may raise hygienic issues:&lt;ref name=bonatti07&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonatti|first1=J.|author2=Vassiliades, T.; Nifong, W.; Jakob, H.; Erbel, R.; Fosse, E.; Werkkala, K.; Sutlic, Z.; Bartel, T.; Friedrich, G. and Kiaii, B.|title=How to build a cath-lab operating room|journal=Heart Surgery Forum|year=2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=344–348|pmid=17650462|doi=10.1532/HSF98.20070709}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some hospitals do not allow operating parts directly above the surgical field, because dust may fall in the wound and cause infection. Since any ceiling-mounted system includes moving parts above the surgical field and impairs the [[laminar airflow]], such systems are not the right option for hospitals enforcing highest hygienic standards.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt; (see also&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bastian Modrow und Lina Timm |title=Uni-Klinik: Hygienemängel legen neuen Herz-OP lahm |url=http://www.ln-online.de/lokales/luebeck/3288582/uni-klinik-hygienemaengel-legen-neuen-herz-op-lahm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908083820/http://www.ln-online.de/lokales/luebeck/3288582/uni-klinik-hygienemaengel-legen-neuen-herz-op-lahm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 September 2012 |work=ln-online |publisher=Lübecker Nachrichten |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and,&lt;ref name=inno&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=BarbE|title=Saarländische SHG-Kliniken setzen im Hybrid-OP auf höchsten Hygienestandard|url=http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/medizin_gesundheit/saarlaendische_shg_kliniken_setzen_hybrid_op_201121.html|publisher=Innovations Report |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; both German only)

There are more factors to consider when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and [[catheter]]s that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does not interfere with the anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the head end without colliding with [[anesthesia]] equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for [[neurosurgery]], where anesthesia is not at the head end. Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;&lt;ref name=toma08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomaszewski|first=R.|title=Planning a Better Operating Room Suite: Design and Implementation Strategies for Success.|journal=Perioperative Nursing Clinics|date=March 2008|volume=3|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1016/j.cpen.2007.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bonatti07 /&gt;

=== OR table ===

The selection of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements.&lt;ref name=nollert /&gt;&lt;ref name=bonatti07 /&gt; Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic]], general and [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeons]] usually expect a table with a segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a [[radiolucent]] tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used.

Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during [[angiography]]. Cardiac and [[vascular surgery|vascular surgeons]], in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended.&lt;ref name="tencate04"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ten Cate|first1=G.|author2=Fosse, E.; Hol, P.K.; Samset, E.; Bock, R.W.; McKinsey, J.F.; Pearce, B.J. &amp; Lothert, M.|title=Integrating surgery and radiology in one suite: a multicenter study|journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery|date=September 2004|volume=40|issue=3|pages=494–499|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2004.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table.

The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports [[rotational angiography|3D imaging]], or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging.

In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.&lt;ref name="intech" /&gt;

== Radiation dose ==

X-ray radiation is [[ionizing radiation]], thus exposure is potentially harmful. Compared to a mobile C-Arm, which is classically used in surgery, CT scanners and fixed C-Arms work on a much higher energy level, which induces higher dose. Therefore, it is very important to monitor radiation dose applied in a hybrid OR both for the patient and the medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A knowledge resource for patients and caregivers|url=http://www.medicalradiation.com/|work=Understanding Medical Radiation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few simple measures to protect people in the OR from [[scatter radiation]], thus lower their dose. '''Awareness''' is one critical issue, otherwise the available protection tools might be neglected. Among these tools is '''protective clothing''' in the form of a protective apron for the trunk, a protective thyroid shield around the neck and protective glasses. The later may be replaced by a ceiling-suspended lead glass panel. Additional '''lead curtains''' can be installed at the table side to protect the lower body region. Even more restrictive rules apply to pregnant staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faulkner|first=K|title=Radiation protection in interventional radiology|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|date=April 1997|volume=70|pages=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very effective measure of both protection to both the staff and the patient of course is applying less radiation. There is always a trade-off between radiation dose and image quality. A higher x-ray dose leads to a clearer picture. Modern software technology can improve image quality during post-processing, such that the same image quality is reached with a lower dose. Image quality thereby is described by contrast, noise, resolution and artifacts. In general, the [[ALARA]] principle (as low as reasonably achievable) should be followed. Dose should be as low as possible, but image quality can only be reduced to the level that the diagnostic benefit of the examination is still higher than the potential harm to the patient.

There are both technical measures taking by x-ray equipment manufacturers to reduce dose constantly and handling options for the staff to reduce dose depending on the clinical application. Among the former is beam hardening. Among the latter are frame rate settings, pulsed fluoroscopy and collimation.

'''Beam Hardening''': X-ray radiation consists of hard and soft particles, i.e. particles with a lot of energy and particles with little energy. Unnecessary exposure is mostly caused by soft particles, as they are to weak to pass through the body and interact with it. Hard particles, by contrast, pass through the patient. A filter in front of the x-ray tube can catch the soft particles, thus hardening the beam. This decreases dose without impacting image quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X-ray dose concept and reduction measure|url=http://www.e-radiography.net/radtech/d/Dose_ge/dose.htm|work=Radiographic Technology Index|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frame rate''': High frame rates (i.e. images acquired per second) are needed to visualize fast motion without stroboscopic effects. However, the higher the frame rate, the higher the radiation dose. Therefore, the frame rate should be chosen according to the clinical need and be as low as reasonably possible. For example, in pediatric cardiology, frame rates of 60 pulses per second are required compared to 0.5 p/s for slowly moving objects. A reduction to half pulse rate reduces dose by about half. The reduction from 30 p/s to 7.5 p/s results in a dose saving of 75%.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

When using '''pulsed fluoroscopy''', radiation dose is only applied in prespecified intervals of time, thus less dose is used to produce the same image sequence. For the time in between, the last image stored is displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/informationfor/healthprofessionals/1_radiology/fluoroscopy.htm|title=Fluoroscopy|work=IAEA Radiation Protection of Patients|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218192836/http://rpop.iaea.org/rpop/rpop/content/informationfor/healthprofessionals/1_radiology/fluoroscopy.htm|archivedate=18 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tool for decreasing dose is '''[[collimator|collimation]]'''. It may be that from the field of view provided by the detector, only a small part is interesting for the intervention. The x-ray tube can be shielded at the parts that are not necessary to be visible by a collimator, thus only sending dose to the detector for the body parts in question. Modern C-Arms enable to navigate on acquired images without constant fluoroscopy.&lt;ref name=intech /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="805">In economics and finance, '''in kind''' refers to goods, services, and transactions not involving [[money]] or not measured in monetary terms. For example: 
*[[Payment in kind (disambiguation)|Payment in kind]], or [[barter]]:  exchange of goods or services for other goods or services with no [[medium of exchange]]
*[[Income in kind]]: in particular
**[[Benefit in kind]]: employee benefits such as a [[company car]] or gym membership
*[[Tax in kind]]: such as a [[tithe]] from farmer's crops
*[[Calculation in kind]]: a type of accounting based on physical magnitudes and physical quantities rather than a common [[unit of account]]
*[[Gifts in kind]]: charitable donation of goods or services, as opposed to donation of money to buy goods and services

'''Inductrack''' is a [[Passive component|passive]], [[fail-safe]] [[electrodynamic suspension|electrodynamic magnetic levitation]] system, using only unpowered loops of wire in the track and permanent magnets (arranged into [[Halbach array]]s) on the vehicle to achieve [[magnetic levitation]]. The track can be in one of two configurations, a "ladder track" and a "laminated track". The ladder track is made of unpowered [[Litz wire]] cables, and the laminated track is made out of stacked copper or aluminium sheets.

There are three designs: Inductrack I, which is optimized for high speed operation, Inductrack II, which is more efficient at lower speeds, and Inductrack III, which is intended for heavy loads at low speed.

Inductrack (or Inductrak) was invented by a team of scientists at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[California]], headed by physicist [[Richard F. Post]], for use in [[maglev train]]s, based on technology used to levitate flywheels.&lt;ref name=anew&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.llnl.gov/str/Post.html |title = ''A New Approach for Magnetically Levitating Trains — and Rockets'' |publisher = llnl.gov |accessdate = 2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skytran.net/press/sciam01.htm |author=Richard F. Post |title=MagLev: A New Approach |publisher=''Scientific American'' |date=January 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309114627/http://www.skytran.net/press/sciam01.htm |archivedate=9 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.askmar.com/Inductrack/2000-4%20Magnetic%20Levitation.pdf |author = Richard F. Post |title = ''The Inductrack Approach to Magnetic Levitation'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; At constant velocity, power is required only to push the train forward against air and electromagnetic [[drag (physics)|drag]]. Above a minimum speed, as the velocity of the train increases, the levitation gap, lift force and power used are largely constant. The system can lift 50 times the magnet weight.

== Description ==
The name ''inductrack'' comes from the word ''[[inductance]]'' or ''[[inductor]]''; an electrical device made from loops of wire.   As a [[Halbach array|Halbach magnet array]] passes over the loops of wire, the [[sinusoidal]] variations in the field induce a voltage in the track coils. At low speeds the loops are a largely resistive impedance, and hence the induced currents are highest where the field is changing most quickly, which is around the ''least'' intense parts of the field, thus little lift produced.

However, at speed, the impedance of the coils increases, proportionate to speed, and dominates the composite impedance of the coil assemblies. This delays the phase of the current peak so that induced current in the track tends more closely to coincide with the field peaks of the magnet array.  The track thus creates its own magnetic field which lines up with and repels the permanent magnets, creating the levitation effect.&lt;ref name=anew/&gt; The track is well modeled as an array of series [[RL circuit|RL circuits]].

When [[NdFeB|neodymium–iron–boron permanent magnets]] are used, levitation is achieved at low speeds. The test model levitated at speeds above {{convert|22|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but Richard Post believes that, on real tracks, levitation could be achieved at "''as little as {{convert|1|to|2|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}''". {{citation needed|reason=A direct quote deserves a reference|date=September 2015}} Below the transition speed the magnetic drag increases with vehicle speed; above the transition speed, the magnetic drag ''de''creases with speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berdutmagnetech.com/documents/maglev_trains.pdf ''Track To The Future: Maglev Trains On Permanent Magnets''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327054256/http://www.berdutmagnetech.com/documents/maglev_trains.pdf |date=27 March 2014 }} — Scott R. Gourley — [[Popular Mechanics]]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, at {{convert|500|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} the [[lift to drag ratio]] is 200:1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skytran.net/press/sciam03.htm In "MagLev: A New Approach", above, section on "The Issue of Efficiency"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821042134/http://www.skytran.net/press/sciam03.htm |date=21 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; far higher than any aircraft but much lower than classic steel on steel rail which reaches 1000:1 ([[rolling resistance]]). This occurs because the inductive [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] increases proportionately with speed which compensates for the faster rate of change of the field seen by the coils, thus giving a constant current flow and power consumption for the levitation.

The Inductrack II variation uses two Halbach arrays, one above and one below the track, to double the magnetic field without substantially increasing the weight or area of the arrays, while also reducing drag at low speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/ChEHeXOTnf3dHH5qjYRXMA/09_Post_10_11_trans.pdf ''Toward More Efficient Transport: The Inductrack Maglev System''] — Presented by Richard F. Post, 10 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Several maglev railroad proposals are based upon Inductrack technology. The U.S. [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) is also considering Inductrack technology for launching space planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-4/iss-4/p12.pdf| title=AIP:Halbach Arrays Enter the Maglev Race|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706153012/http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-4/iss-4/p12.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-06 |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lead styphnate''' (lead 2,4,6-[[resorcinol|trinitroresorcinate]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Pb ), whose name is derived from [[styphnic acid]], is an [[explosive]] used as a component in [[primer (firearm)|primer]] and [[detonator]] mixtures for less sensitive [[secondary explosive]]s.  Lead styphnate is only slightly soluble in [[water]] and [[methanol]]&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;Jacques Boileau, Claude Fauquignon, Bernard Hueber and Hans H. Meyer "Explosives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2009, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_143.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of lead styphnate vary in color from yellow to gold, orange, reddish-brown, to brown. Lead styphnate is known in various polymorphs, hydrates, and basic salts. Normal lead styphnate monohydrate, monobasic lead styphnate, tribasic lead styphnate dihydrate, and pentabasic lead styphnate dehydrate as well as α, β polymorphs of lead styphnate exist.

Two forms of lead styphnate are six-sided [[monohydrate]] crystals and small rectangular crystals.  Lead styphnate is particularly sensitive to fire and the discharge of [[static electricity]]. When dry, it can readily detonate by static discharges from the human body. The longer and narrower the crystals, the more susceptible lead styphnate is to static electricity. Lead styphnate does not react with metals and is less sensitive to shock and friction than [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] or [[Lead(II) azide|lead azide]].  It is stable in storage, even at elevated temperatures. As with other [[lead]]-containing compounds, lead styphnate is toxic owing to [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] poisoning.

==Preparation==
Although never substantiated, lead styphnate may have been discovered by [[Peter Griess]] (of [[Griess test]] fame) in 1874. In 1919, Edmund Herz first established a preparation of anhydrous normal lead styphnate by the reaction of magnesium styphnate with lead acetate in the presence of nitric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.R.

==Structure==
Normal lead styphnate exists as α and β polymorphs, both being monoclinic crystals. The lead centres are seven-coordinate and are bridged via oxygen bridges. The water molecule is coordinated to the metal and is also hydrogen-bonded to the anion. Many of the Pb-O distances are short, indicating some degree of covalency. The styphnate ions lie in approximately parallel
planes linked by Pb atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierce-Butler, M.A.|title=The structure of the lead salt of 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3-benzenediol monohydrate (alpha-polymorph)|journal=Acta Crystallogr.|year=1984|url=http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0108270184003036|doi=10.1107/S0108270184003036|volume=40|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierce-Butler, M.A.|title=Structures of the barium salt of 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3-benzenediol monohydrate and the isomorphous lead salt (beta-polymorph)|journal=Acta Crystallogr.|year=1982|url=http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0567740882010966|doi=10.1107/S0567740882010966|volume=38|pages=3100–3104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Lead styphnate's heat of formation is -835 kJ mol-1. The loss of water leads to the formation of a sensitive anhydrous material with a density of 2.9 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The variation of colors remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Robert Matyáš |author2=Ji í Pachman |title=Primary Explosives|journal=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-28436-6|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28436-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead styphnate has a detonation velocity of 5.2&amp;nbsp;km/s and an explosion temperature of 265-280&amp;nbsp;°C after five seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hyman Henkin |author2=Russell McGill |title=Rates of Explosive Decomposition of Explosives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27124">Pipeline '''leak detection''' is used to determine if and in some cases where a leak has occurred in systems which contain liquids and gases. Methods of detection include [[hydrostatic test]]ing, infrared, and [[Laser|laser technology]] after pipeline erection and leak detection during service.

Pipeline networks are the most economic and safest mode of transportation for oil, gases and other fluid products. As a means of long-distance transport, pipelines have to fulfill high demands of safety, reliability and efficiency. If properly maintained, pipelines can last indefinitely without leaks.  Most significant leaks that do occur are caused by damage from nearby excavation. If a pipeline is not properly maintained, it can corrode, particularly at construction joints, low points where moisture collects, or locations with imperfections in the pipe.  However, these defects can be identified by inspection tools and corrected before they progress to a leak.  Other reasons for leaks include accidents, earth movement, or sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingaa.org/File.aspx?id=12282&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of leak detection systems (LDS) is to help pipeline controllers to detect and localize leaks. LDS provide alarms and display other related data to the pipeline controllers to assist decision-making. Pipeline leak detection systems can also enhance productivity and system reliability thanks to reduced downtime and inspection time.

According to the [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] document "RP 1130", LDS are divided into internally based LDS and externally based LDS. Internally based systems use field instrumentation (for example flow, pressure or fluid temperature sensors) to monitor internal pipeline parameters. Externally based systems use a different set of field instrumentation (for example infrared radiometers or [[thermal camera]]s, vapor sensors, acoustic microphones or fiber-optic cables) to monitor external pipeline parameters.

== Rules and regulations ==
Some countries formally regulate pipeline operation.

=== API RP 1130 "Computational Pipeline Monitoring for Liquids" (US) ===
This recommended practice (RP)&lt;ref name="LitAPI1130"&gt;API RP 1130 (2007): Computational Pipeline Monitoring for Liquids. 1st Edition (September 2007). [[American Petroleum Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the design, implementation, testing and operation of LDS that use an algorithmic approach. The purpose of this recommended practice is to assist the Pipeline Operator in identifying issues relevant to the selection, implementation, testing, and operation of an LDS. 

=== TRFL (Germany) ===
TRFL is the abbreviation for "Technische Regel für Fernleitungsanlagen" (Technical Rule for Pipeline Systems).&lt;ref name="LitTRFL"&gt;TRFL (2003): Technische Regel für Fernleitungen (Technical Rule For Pipelines).&lt;/ref&gt; The TRFL summarizes requirements for pipelines being subject of official regulations. It covers pipelines transporting flammable liquids, pipelines transporting liquids that are dangerous for water, and most of the pipelines transporting gas. Five different kinds of LDS or LDS functions are required:
* Two independent LDS for continuous leak detection during steady-state operation. One of these systems or an additional one must also be able to detect leaks during transient operation, e.g. during start-up of the pipeline
* One LDS for leak detection during shut-in operation
* One LDS for creeping leaks
* One LDS for fast leak location

== Requirements ==
API 1155&lt;ref name="LitAPI1155"&gt;API 1155 (1995): Evaluation Methodology for Software Based Leak Detection Systems. 1st  Edition (February 1995). [[American Petroleum Institute]]. Replaced by API RP 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;(replaced by API RP 1130&lt;ref name="LitAPI1130"/&gt;) defines the following important requirements for an LDS:
* Sensitivity: An LDS must ensure that the loss of [[fluid]] as a result of a leak is as small as possible.  This places two requirements on the system: it must detect small leaks, and it must detect them quickly.
* Reliability: The user must be able to trust the LDS.  This means that it must correctly report any real alarms, but it is equally important that it does not generate false alarms.
* Accuracy: Some LDS are able to calculate leak flow and leak location. This must be done accurately.
* Robustness: The LDS should continue to operate in non-ideal circumstances.  For example, in case of a transducer failure, the system should detect the failure and continue to operate (possibly with necessary compromises such as reduced sensitivity).

=== Steady-state and transient conditions ===
During steady-state conditions, the flow, pressures, etc. in the pipeline are (more or less) constant over time. During transient conditions, these variables may change rapidly.  The changes propagate like waves through the pipeline with the speed of sound of the fluid. Transient conditions occur in a pipeline for example at start-up, 
if the pressure at inlet or outlet changes (even if the change is small), and when a batch changes, or when multiple products are in the pipeline. Gas pipelines are almost always in transient conditions, because gases are very compressible. Even in liquid pipelines, transient effects cannot be disregarded most of the time. LDS should allow for detection of leaks for both conditions to provide leak detection during the entire operating time of the pipeline.

== Internally based LDS ==
[[File:Overview Internally LDS.jpg|thumb|left|Overview about internally based LDS.]]
Internally based systems use field instrumentation (e.g. for flow, pressure and fluid temperature) to monitor internal pipeline parameters which are used to detect possible leaks.&lt;ref name="LitAPI1130"/&gt; System cost and complexity of internally based LDS are moderate because they use existing field instrumentation. This kind of LDS is used for standard safety requirements.&lt;ref name="LitSurvey"&gt;Geiger, G., Werner, T., Matko, D. (2003): Leak Detection and Locating – A Survey. 35th Annual PSIG Meeting, 15–17 October 2003, Bern, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pressure/flow monitoring ===
A leak changes the hydraulics of the pipeline, and therefore changes the pressure or flow readings after some time. Local monitoring of pressure or flow at only one point can therefore provide simple leak detection. As it is done locally it requires in principle no [[telemetry]]. It is only useful in steady-state conditions, however, and its ability to deal with gas pipelines is limited.&lt;ref name="LitPrinciples"&gt;Geiger, G. (2008): Principles of Leak Detection. 1st Edition (September 2008). Krohne Oil &amp; Gas, Breda (The Netherlands).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic pressure waves ===
The acoustic pressure wave method analyses the rarefaction waves produced when a leak occurs. When a pipeline wall breakdown occurs, fluid or gas escapes in the form of a high velocity jet. This produces negative pressure waves which propagate in both directions within the pipeline and can be detected and analyzed. The operating principles of the method are based on the very important characteristic of pressure waves to travel over long distances at the speed of sound guided by the pipeline walls. The amplitude of a pressure wave increases with the leak size. A complex mathematical algorithm analyzes data from pressure sensors and is able in a matter of seconds to point to the location of the leakage with accuracy less than 50&amp;nbsp;m (164&amp;nbsp;ft). Experimental data has shown the method's ability to detect leaks less than 3mm (0.1 inch) in diameter and operate with the lowest false alarm rate in the industry – less than 1 false alarm per year.&lt;ref&gt;Avateq Corp. Press Release. New Leak Detection and Monitoring Technology Ensures Safety of Pipelines.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the method is unable to detect an ongoing leak after the initial event: after the pipeline wall breakdown (or rupture), the initial pressure waves subside and no subsequent pressure waves are generated. Therefore, if the system fails to detect the leak (for instance, because the pressure waves were masked by transient pressure waves caused by an operational event such as a change in pumping pressure or valve switching), the system will not detect the ongoing leak.

=== Balancing methods ===
These methods base on the principle of [[conservation of mass]]. In the steady state, the [[mass flow]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_I&lt;/math&gt; entering a leak-free pipeline will balance the mass flow &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_O&lt;/math&gt; leaving it; any drop in mass leaving the pipeline (mass imbalance &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_I - \dot{M}_O&lt;/math&gt;) indicates a leak. Balancing methods measure &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_O&lt;/math&gt; using [[flowmeters]] and finally compute the imbalance which is an estimate of the unknown, true leak flow. Comparing this imbalance (typically monitored over a number of periods) against a leak alarm threshold &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; generates an alarm if this monitored imbalance.&lt;ref name="LitPrinciples"/&gt; Enhanced balancing methods additionally take into account the change rate of the mass inventory of the pipeline. Names that are used for enhanced line balancing techniques are volume balance, modified volume balance, and compensated mass balance.&lt;ref name="LitAPI1130"/&gt;

=== State-observer-based methods ===
These methods are based on [[state observer]]s which are designed from fluid mathematical models expressed in [[state-space representation]].
These methods can be classified into two types: infinite-dimensional observers and finite-dimensional observers. The first type is based on a couple of quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations: a momentum and a continuity equations that represent the fluid dynamics in a pipeline. The finite-dimensional observers are constructed from a lumped version of the momentum and a continuity equations.
Several types of observers have been used for leak detection, for instance [[Kalman filter]]s&lt;ref&gt;Benkherouf, A., &amp; Allidina, A. Y. (1986). Leak Detection Methods for Gas Pipelines. IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 19(6), 205-210.&lt;/ref&gt;, high gain observers&lt;ref&gt;Torres, L., Verde, C., Besancon, G., &amp; González, O. (2014). High‐gain observers for leak location in subterranean pipelines of liquefied petroleum gas. International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, 24(6), 1127-1141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torres, L., Besançon, G., Navarro, A., Begovich, O., &amp; Georges, D. (2011, March).

Model based pipeline monitoring with leak detection. IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 40(12), 318-323.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Statistical methods ===
Statistical LDS use statistical methods (e.g. from the field of [[decision theory]]) to analyse pressure/flow at only one point or the imbalance in order to detect a leak.&lt;ref name="LitPrinciples"/&gt; This leads to the opportunity to optimise the leak decision if some statistical assumptions hold. A common approach is the use of the [[hypothesis test]] procedure

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Hypothesis }H_0:\text{ No leak}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Hypothesis }H_1:\text{ Leak}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a classical detection problem, and there are various solutions known from statistics.&lt;ref name="LitBerger"&gt;Berger, J.O. (1985): Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis. Springer Series in Statistics. 2nd Edition (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RTTM methods ===
RTTM means "Real-Time Transient Model".&lt;ref name="LitPrinciples"/&gt; RTTM LDS use mathematical models of the flow within a pipeline using basic physical laws such as [[conservation of mass]], [[conservation of momentum]], and [[conservation of energy]]. RTTM methods can be seen as an enhancement of balancing methods as they additionally use the conservation principle of momentum and energy. An RTTM makes it possible to calculate [[mass flow]], [[pressure]], [[density]] and [[temperature]] at every point along the pipeline in [[real-time data|real-time]] with the help of mathematical algorithms.  RTTM LDS can easily model steady-state and transient flow in a pipeline.  Using RTTM technology, leaks can be detected during steady-state and transient conditions. With proper functioning instrumentation, leak rates may be functionally estimated using available formulas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cincinnati-test.com/cin_leak_calculator.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-RTTM methods ===
[[File:E-RTTM Method PC (Standard) SVG.svg|thumb|left|Signal flow Extended Real-Time Transient Model (E-RTTM).]]
E-RTTM&lt;ref name="LitSurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LitPrinciples"/&gt; stands for "Extended Real-Time Transient Model", using RTTM technology with statistical methods. So, leak detection is possible during steady-state and transient condition with high sensitivity, and false alarms will be avoided using statistical methods.

For the residual method, an RTTM module calculates estimates &lt;math&gt;\hat{\dot{M}}_I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\dot{M}}_O&lt;/math&gt; for MASS FLOW at inlet and outlet, respectively. This can be done using measurements for [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] at inlet (&lt;math&gt;p_I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_I&lt;/math&gt;) and outlet (&lt;math&gt;p_O&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_O&lt;/math&gt;). These estimated [[mass flow]]s are compared with the measured mass flows &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}_O&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the residuals &lt;math&gt;x=\dot{M}_I - \hat{\dot{M}}_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=\dot{M}_O - \hat{\dot{M}}_O&lt;/math&gt;. These residuals are close to zero if there is no leak; otherwise the residuals show a characteristic signature. In a next step, the residuals are subject of a leak signature analysis. This module analyses their temporal behaviour by extracting and comparing the leak signature with leak signatures in a database ("fingerprint"). Leak alarm is declared if the extracted leak signature matches the fingerprint.

== Externally based LDS ==

=== Analytic thermal leak detector for above ground pipelines ===
Video analytics driven thermal imaging using uncooled microbolometer infrared sensors is emerging as a new and effective method of visualizing, detecting and generating alerts of unplanned surface emissions of liquids and hydrocarbon gas liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aboutpipelines.com/blog/the-inside-story-on-pipeline-leak-detection/|title=The Inside Story on Pipeline Leak Detection|last=CEPA|first=|date=November 20, 2015|website=Canadian Energy Pipeline Association|access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Detection to alarm generation takes less than 30 seconds. This technology is suitable for above-ground piping facilities, such as pump stations, refineries, storage sites, mines, chemical plants, water crossings, and water treatment plants. The need for new solutions in this area is driven by the fact that more than half of pipeline leaks occur at facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.api.org/~/media/files/oil-and-natural-gas/ppts/advisories/2009_5ppts_operator_advisory_facilities_otc_final.pdf|title=PPTS Operator Advisory: New Findings on Releases from Facilities Piping|last=API|first=|date=October 2009|website=American Petroleum Institute|access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High quality thermographic technology accurately measures and visualizes emissivity or infrared radiation (thermal heat) of objects into gray scale imagery without the need for ambient lighting. The monitored petroleum product (e.g. oil) is distinguished from background objects by this heat difference. The addition of an analytic software component, typically optimizable to better address a specific application or environment, enables automated onsite leak analysis, validation and reporting, thereby reducing reliance on man power. A leak appearing within an analytic region (a rule added to the camera) is immediately analyzed for its attributes, including thermal temperature, size, and behaviour (e.g. spraying, pooling, spilling). When a leak is determined to be valid based on set parameters, an alarm notification with leak video is generated and sent to a monitoring station. 

Optimal detection distance varies and is influenced by camera lens size, resolution, field of view, thermal detection range and sensitivity, leak size, and other factors. The system's layers of filters and immunity to environmental elements, such as snow, ice, rain, fog and glare, contribute to false alarms reduction. The video monitoring architecture can be integrated onto existing leak detection and repair (LDAR) systems, including SCADA networks, as well as other surveillance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/oil-patch-companies-use-internet-connected-sensors-and-thermal-cameras-to-drive-down-costs/article26093519/|title=New technology allows workers to control oil wells with their smartphones|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital oil leak detection cable ===
Digital sense cables consist of a braid of semi-permeable internal conductors protected by a permeable insulating moulded braid. An electrical signal is passed through the internal conductors and is monitored by an inbuilt microprocessor inside the cable connector. Escaping fluids pass through the external permeable braid and make contact with the internal semi-permeable conductors. This causes a change in the electrical properties of the cable that is detected by the microprocessor. The microprocessor can locate the fluid to within a 1-metre resolution along its length and provide an appropriate signal to monitoring systems or operators. The sense cables can be wrapped around pipelines, buried sub-surface with pipelines or installed as a pipe-in-pipe configuration.&lt;ref&gt;TTK S.A.S. Liquid Hydrocarbon and Non-Conductive Solvent Sense Cable http://www.ttkuk.com/oil-leak-detection/products/sense-cable/hydrocarbon-sense-cables/fg-od/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infrared radiometric pipeline testing ===
[[File:Leak Detection.jpg|frame|right|Aerial thermogram of buried cross country oil pipeline revealing subsurface contamination caused by a leak.]]
Infrared thermographic pipeline testing has shown itself to be both accurate and efficient in detecting and locating subsurface pipeline leaks, voids caused by erosion, deteriorated pipeline insulation, and poor backfill. When a pipeline leak has allowed a [[fluid]], such as water, to form a plume near a pipeline, the fluid has a thermal conductance different from the dry soil or backfill. This will be reflected in different surface temperature patterns above the leak location. A high-resolution infrared radiometer allows entire areas to be scanned and the resulting data to be displayed as pictures with areas of differing temperatures designated by differing grey tones on a black &amp; white image or by various colours on a colour image. This system measures surface energy patterns only, but the patterns that are measured on the surface of the ground above a buried pipeline can help show where pipeline leaks and resulting erosion voids are forming; it detects problems as deep as 30 meters below the ground surface.&lt;ref name="LitJackson"&gt;Jackson, C.N.; Sherlock, C.N. (1998): Non-destructive Testing Handbook: Leak Testing, page 519, Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic emission detectors ===
Escaping liquids create an acoustic signal as they pass through a hole in the pipe. Acoustic sensors affixed to the outside of the pipeline create a baseline acoustic "fingerprint" of the line from the internal noise of the pipeline in its undamaged state. When a leak occurs, a resulting low frequency acoustic signal is detected and analysed. Deviations from the baseline "fingerprint" signal an alarm.&lt;ref name="LitSurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LitFuchs"&gt;Fuchs, H. V. (1991): Ten Year of Experience with Leak Detection by Acoustic Signal Analysis. Applied Acoustics 33 (1991), p. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
Now sensors are having better arrangement with frequency band selection, time delay range selection etc. This makes the graphs more distinct and easy to analyse.There are other ways to detect leakage. Ground geo-phones with filter arrangement are very useful to pinpoint the leakage location. It saves the excavation cost. The water jet in the soil hits the inner wall of soil or concrete. This will create a feeble noise. This noise will decay while coming up on the surface. But the maximum sound can be picked up only over the leakage position. Amplifiers and filter helps to get clear noise. Some types of gases entered into the pipe line will create a range of sounds when leaving the pipe.

=== Vapour-sensing tubes ===
The vapour-sensing tube leak detection method involves the installation of a tube along the entire length of the pipeline. This tube - in cable form - is highly [[Permeation|permeable]] to the substances to be detected in the particular application. If a leak occurs, the substances to be measured come into contact with the tube in the form of vapour, gas or dissolved in water. In the event of a leak, some of the leaking substance diffuses into the tube. After a certain period of time, the inside of the tube produces an accurate image of the substances surrounding the tube. In order to analyse the concentration distribution present in the sensor tube, a pump pushes the column of air in the tube past a detection unit at a constant speed. The detector unit at the end of the sensor tube is equipped with gas sensors. Every increase in gas concentration results in a pronounced "leak peak".&lt;ref name="LitSurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.areva.com/EN/customer-530/leos.html Leakage detection and localization system - LEOS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dec.alaska.gov/spar/ppr/docs/Final%20PLD%20Technology%202011%20Conference%20Report%20March%202012%20-%20Revised%20041912.pdf Technical Review of Leak Detection Technologies - Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fibre-optic leak detection ===
At least two [[fibre-optic]] leak detection methods are being commercialized: Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). The DTS method involves the installation of a fibre-optic cable along the length of pipeline being monitored. The substances to be measured come into contact with the cable when a leak occurs, changing the [[temperature]] of the cable and changing the reflection of the laser beam pulse, signalling a leak. The location is known by measuring the time delay between when the laser pulse was emitted and when the reflection is detected. This only works if the substance is at a temperature different from the ambient environment. In addition, the distributed fibre-optical temperature-sensing technique offers the possibility to measure temperature along the pipeline. Scanning the entire length of the fibre, the temperature profile along the fibre is determined, leading to leak detection.&lt;ref name="LitSurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LitGroßwig"&gt;Großwig, S. et al. (2001): Distributed Fiber Optical Temperature Sensing Technique – A Variable Tool for Monitoring Tasks. Proceedings of the 8th  International Symposium on Temperature and Thermal Measurements in Industry and Science, June 19 – 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAS method involves a similar installation of fiber-optic cable along the length of pipeline being monitored. Vibrations caused by a substance leaving the pipeline via a leak changes the reflection of the laser beam pulse, signaling a leak. The location is known by measuring the time delay between when the laser pulse was emitted and when the reflection is detected. This technique can also be combined with the Distributed Temperature Sensing method to provide a temperature profile of the pipeline.

=== Pipeline flyovers ===
[[Aerial survey|Flyovers]] of the pipeline are frequently carried out to either confirm the location or to detect and locate small releases that cannot be identified by other methods. Typically the flyover of the right of way is recorded by video, which may have some image filtering, such as thermal imaging. Larger spills will typically be identified by a "sheen" in wetland or an area of dead vegetation around the release location.

Flyovers are typically scheduled and not recommended as a primary leak-detection method. They may be used to rapidly confirm the presence and location of a leak.

===Biological leak detection ===
Biological methods of leak detection includes the use of dogs, which are more likely to be used once a release has been identified but not located due to its small size; or by landscapers who keep the pipeline right of way clear. 

There are several companies who can provide dogs trained to identify the scent of release. Typically a technician injects a fluid into the pipeline that the scent dogs are trained to track. The dogs will then direct handlers towards a pipeline leak. They are trained to indicated at the strongest concentration therefore their pinpointing abilities can be typically within a meter. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours to mobilise a team, and may take several days to actually locate a release depending on the remoteness of the area.

Pipeline rights of way are kept clear by landscapers who are also trained to look for signs of pipeline releases. This is typically a scheduled process and should not be considered a primary form of leak detection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3159">A '''manual override (MO)''' or '''manual analog override (MAO)''' is a mechanism wherein control is taken from an [[automated system]] and given to the user. For example, a manual override in [[photography]] refers to the ability for the human photographer to turn off the automatic [[aperture]] sizing, [[automatic focus]]ing, or any other automated system on the camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambitions4.com/Glossary-Pub-View-Topic-Details.asp?GlossaryID=339&amp;strChar=M Manual override] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060513202632/http://www.ambitions4.com/Glossary-Pub-View-Topic-Details.asp?GlossaryID=339&amp;strChar=M |date=2006-05-13 }}, Ambitions Photography Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manual overrides can be used to veto an automated system's judgment when the system is in error. An example of this is a [[Printer (computing)|printer's]] ink level detection: in one case, a researcher found that when he overrode the system, up to 38% more pages could be printed at good quality by the printer than the automated system would have allowed.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3035500.stm 'Raw deal' on printer ink], ''[[BBC]]'', 3 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated systems are becoming increasingly common and integrated into everyday objects such as [[automobile]]s and [[domestic appliance]]s.  This development of [[ubiquitous computing]] raises general issues of policy and law about the need for manual overrides for matters of great importance such as life-threatening situations and major economic decisions.  The loyalty of such autonomous devices then becomes an issue.  If they follow rules installed by the manufacturer or required by law and refuse to cede control in some situations then the owners of the devices may feel disempowered, alienated and lacking true ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jjbohn.com/papers/langhein_aswemaylive_2002.pdf |title=As we may live – Real-world implications of ubiquitous computing |author1=Marc Langheinrich |author2=Vlad Coroama |author3=Jurgen Bohn |author4=Michael Rohs  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Institute of Information Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major incidents==
[[China Airlines Flight 140]] crashed, causing many deaths, due to a misunderstanding about the manual overrides for the [[autopilot]].  The Take-Off/Go Around system had been activated to abort a landing.  It was programmed to ignore manual controls in this situation but the human pilots tried to continue the landing.  The conflicting control signals from the pilots and autopilot then resulted in the aircraft stalling and crashing.  The autopilot for this aircraft type was then reprogrammed so that it would never ignore a manual override.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SG07muS_S2EC |page=151 |year=2004 |title=Taming HAL: designing interfaces beyond 2001 |isbn=978-0-312-29574-5 |author=Asaf Degani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Navtex Ostsee.png|thumb|right|Navtex message for the Baltic Sea]]

'''Navtex''' ('''Nav'''igational '''Te'''le'''x''') is an international automated [[medium frequency]] direct-printing service for delivery of navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent [[maritime safety information (MSI)]] to ships.

Navtex was developed to provide a low-cost, simple, and automated means of receiving this information aboard ships at sea within approximately 370&amp;nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) off shore.

There are no user fees associated with receiving navtex broadcasts, as the transmissions are typically transmitted from the National Weather Authority (Italy) or Navy or Coast Guard (as in the US) or national navigation authority (Canada).

Where the messages contain weather forecasts, an abbreviated format very similar to the [[shipping forecast]] is used.

Navtex is a component of the [[International Maritime Organization]]/[[International Hydrographic Organization]] [[Worldwide Navigation Warning Service]] (WWNWS). Navtex is also a major element of the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]] (GMDSS). [[SOLAS Convention]] mandated certain classes of vessels must carry navtex, beginning August 1, 1993.

==Technical information==

Navtex transmissions are also called [[narrow-band direct printing]] (NBDP). The transmissions are layered on top of [[SITOR|SITOR collective B-mode]]. SITOR-B is a [[forward error correction|forward error correcting]] (FEC) broadcast that uses the [[CCIR 476]] character set.

SITOR-B is also used in [[amateur radio]], where it is known as [[AMTOR|AMTOR-B]] or AMTOR-FEC. 
* Navtex / SITOR / AMTOR broadcasts use 100 baud FSK modulation with a frequency shift of 170&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Navtex broadcasts are primarily made on the [[Medium frequency|medium frequencies]] of 518&amp;nbsp;kHz and 490&amp;nbsp;kHz. The international navtex frequency is 518&amp;nbsp;kHz,&lt;ref&gt;The mark frequency is 517.915&amp;nbsp;kHz, and the space frequency is 518.085&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;/ref&gt; and these broadcasts should always be in English. National transmission of navtex uses 490&amp;nbsp;kHz specifically for broadcasts in local languages. It is not used in the U.S.

Navtex Marine Safety Information (MSI) national transmissions also take place on [[High frequency|HF]] at 4209.5&amp;nbsp;kHz using FEC mode.

Other transmission modes (like [[MT63]], or [[Olivia MFSK|Olivia]]) with better error correction properties have emerged since navtex was made the standard for maritime information transmissions. Overall, with slightly higher transmitter power most Navtex error correction issues tend to be absent.

==Navtex message format==

Navtex messages are transmitted using binary [[frequency-shift keying]] (BFSK) at 100 bit/s and a 170&amp;nbsp;Hz frequency shift. The characters are encoded using the 7-bit CCIR 476 character set and basic error detection is enabled by employing [[forward error correction]] (FEC). This is the same format as the SITOR-B ([[AMTOR]]) format.

A navtex message is built on [[SITOR]] collective B-mode and consists of:&lt;ref&gt;ITU R M 540-2, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* a phasing signal of at least ten seconds
* the four characters "ZCZC" that identify the end of phasing
* a single space
* four characters ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' (see below)
* a carriage return and a line feed
* the information
* the four characters "NNNN" to identify the end of information
* a carriage return and two line feeds
* either
:* 5 or more seconds of phasing signal and another message starting with "ZCZC" ''or''
:* an end of emission idle signal α for at least 2 seconds.

B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an alpha character identifying the station, and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an alpha character used to identify the subject of the message. Receivers use these characters to reject messages from certain stations or if the message contains subjects of no interest to the user.

B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are two-digit numerics identifying individual messages, used by receivers to keep already received messages from being repeated.

For example, a message containing ''B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' characters of 'FE01' from a U.S. navtex station indicates a weather forecast message from Boston, MA.

Navtex message example:
&lt;pre&gt;(phasing signals &gt;= 10 seconds)
ZCZC FE01
(message text ...)
NNNN

(end of message phasing signals for &gt;= 2 seconds before next message)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Start of message===
ZCZC begins the message.

===Transmitter identity (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)===
This character defines the transmitter identity and its associated coverage area.

===Subject indicator character (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)===
The subject indicator character is used by the receiver to identify different classes of messages below. The indicator is also used to reject messages concerning certain optional subjects which are not required by the ship (e.g. [[LORAN]] C messages might be rejected in a ship which is not fitted with a LORAN C receiver).

Navtex broadcasts use following subject indicator characters:

::{| class="wikitable"
| A
| Navigational warnings &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| B
| Meteorological warnings &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Note:''' Receivers use the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; character to identify messages which, because of their importance, can '''not''' be rejected (designated by a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
The subject indicator characters B, F and G are normally not used in the United States since the [[National Weather Service]] normally includes meteorological warnings in forecast messages. Meteorological warnings are broadcast using the subject indicator character E.
U.S. Coast Guard District Broadcast Notices to Mariners affecting ships outside the line of demarcation, and inside the line of demarcation in areas where deep draft vessels operate, use the subject indicator character A.

===Serial number of message (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)===
These two characters define the serial number of each B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; message type (class). Generally serial numbers start with the numbers '01', however in special circumstances, the numbers begin with '00'. This forces the receiver to print the message.

===Time of origin===
Time of origin is in the format of "DDHHmm UTC MMM" where DD is the date, HH hour, mm minute and MMM three-character abbreviation of month. The time of the transmission of the message is in UTC.

===Message text===
The full text of the message follows.

===End of message===
The end of the message is asserted when the characters "NNNN" are received.

==Navtex transmission schedule==

Each station identifier has a fixed 10-minute time slot, starting with A at 0000UTC. The time slots are repeated at 4 hour intervals. Within each time slot, a mix of navigation warnings, weather forecasts, ice information and other content may be sent, and this is normally according to a structured plan for that specific station. For example, in the first and third time slot they may decide to transmit navigation warnings, and weather forecasts in the others. Normally each [[NAVAREA]] or sub-NAVAREA has only one station at each slot.

Details of all transmitting stations and their schedules may be found at [http://www.pcnavtex.com/AboutNAVTEX/NAVTEXStations/tabid/63/Default.aspx www.pcnavtex.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

==Navtex receivers==

Navtex receivers which are approved for GMDSS contain an internal printer and/or a scrollable display, and cost between $800–$1500. A new generation of navtex receivers intended for non-GMDSS applications such as the recreational community is entering the marketplace. These receivers include features such as [[LCD]] screens and [[RS-232]] output and have a purchase price in the $300–$500 range. In the UK they can be purchased for £115. There are also a number of navtex engines available that do not have any user interface, and just output decoded data in [[RS-232]] format, either as a simple [[ASCII]] data stream, or using the [[NMEA 0183|NMEA]] navtex sentences, or their own proprietary protocol.

There are also a number of software packages available, such as SeaTTY, Mscan, JNX, Fldigi or JVComm32, allowing messages to be decoded by a PC with a suitable receiver connected to the computer's soundcard. Any general communications receiver capable of audio reception at 518&amp;nbsp;kHz or 490&amp;nbsp;kHz [[single sideband]] can be used.

[[File:Niagara-Tunnel-Project.gif|thumb|right|The Niagara Tunnel Project's intake point (near Upper Rapids Boulevard) under construction in 2010.]]

The '''Niagara Tunnel Project''' was part of a series of major additions to the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Stations|Sir Adam Beck]] [[hydroelectric]] generation complex in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

Water delivered by the major new underground tunnel complements other upgrades to the [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations]], resulting in more efficient use of the [[Niagara River]]'s hydro power.

The project's new {{convert|12.7|m}} diameter, {{convert|10.2|km}} long tunnel was officially placed into service on 21 March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's [[nameplate capacity]] by 150 [[megawatts]],&lt;ref name="NiagaraFrontier-TechFacts" /&gt; with the extra power produced enough for approximately 160,000 homes.

== Background ==

First constructed in 1922, the initial Sir Adam Beck power generating station, now abbreviated as SAB 1, derived its water supply from a hydro canal connected to the [[Welland River]].  However, due to increased power demand in later years, a second generating station, known as SAB 2, was constructed in 1954.  It derives its water supply from two diversion tunnels, each about {{convert|9|km}} in length.  In 1958, a reservoir and the SAB Pump Station were constructed in order to make better use of available water by storing it during periods of low demand and using it in periods of greater demand in order to maximize the efficiency of the stations in regards to electricity supply and demand.

Between 1996 and 2005, [[Ontario Power Generation]] (OPG), which owns and operates the SAB complex, completed a series of major upgrades at the SAB 2 plant, increasing its potential generating [[nameplate capacity]] by 194 [[megawatts]]. Water delivered through the new Niagara Tunnel Project complements the SAB 2 upgrade, and results in an overall increase to the efficient use of the Niagara River's [[hydro power]].

The new {{convert|10.2|km}} long tunnel is {{convert|12.7|m}} in diameter, or about four stories in height, and allows an additional diversion of a distant part of the Niagara River to reach the SAB plant complex at a rate of about 500 cubic meters (17,657 cubic feet) of water per second, a flow rate that can fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in seconds.&lt;ref name="OPG-Website" /&gt; The Ontario Government considers the Niagara Tunnel Project and the Sir Adam Beck complex as integral to its efforts to close all of the province's coal-fired generating plants as part of its [[Green Energy Act 2009|clean and green energy program]].

Upon the project's formal opening the Honourable [[Bob Chiarelli]], M.P.P., Ontario’s [[Ministry of Energy (Ontario)|Minister of Energy]], stated that "This project is a source of pride as an engineering feat and as a practical solution for meeting Ontario's energy needs through clean sources".&lt;ref name="OPG-Website" /&gt;

== Construction ==
The Niagara Tunnel was constructed using a [[Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM), affectionately named "Big Becky" in honour of [[Sir Adam Beck]].  The TBM machine bored a tunnel about {{convert|10.2|km}} long and about 14.4 metres (47 ft) in diameter under the [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|City of Niagara Falls, Ontario]], from the [[Niagara River]] to the SAB complex. The bored tunnel was subsequently lined with an impervious membrane and a concrete lining, pre-stressed by high pressure grouting.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Power Generation - [http://www.opg.com/power/hydro/new_projects/ntp/index.asp Niagara Tunnel Now In-Service, 21 March 2013]. Retrieved September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive undertaking created about 1.6 million cubic meters of rock and debris, and was designed for a minimum 90-year life span.&lt;ref name="NiagaraFrontier-TechFacts" /&gt;

The HP 471-316 TBM was driven by 15 electric motors totaling about 4.7 megawatts of power (6,375 horsepower), built by the Robbins Company of [[Solon, Ohio]] (a suburb of Cleveland), and was the world’s largest hard-rock tunnel boring machine as of 2006. The TBM operated as deep as {{convert|140|m}} below ground level to avoid the machine's vibrations being felt at surface level.&lt;ref name="NiagaraFrontier-TechFacts"&gt;[http://www.niagarafrontier.com/tunneltechnical.html Niagara Tunnel Project Technical Facts], NiagaraFrontier.com website, updated November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The design-build contractor for the project was the [[Austria]]n construction company [[Strabag|Strabag AG]], a large construction group with extensive experience in large tunnel construction.&lt;ref name="OPG-Website" /&gt;

Boring by the Hatch Mott MacDonald Engineering Company started on 15 September 2006 at the north end, located at {{coord|43|08|25.2|N|79|03|44.2|W|scale:10000_region:CA-ON_type:river|name=Niagara Tunnel north end}} and ended on 31 March 2011 at the south end, located at {{coord|43|04|10.72|N|79|03|33.77|W|region:CA-ON_type:river|name=Niagara Tunnel south end}}.[http://www.niagarafrontier.com/tunnel.html]

Due to slower than projected boring progress caused by constant tunnel roof over-breaks, the project completion date was extended to at least December 2013, with a revised total projected cost of $1.6B.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafrontier.com/tunnel.html Niagara Tunnel Project (2005-2013)], NiagaraFrontier.com website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OPG-News-2013.03.21" /&gt;

== Completion and commissioning ==

On 21 March 2013 the [[Ontario Power Generation|Ontario Power Generation Corporation]] (OPG) and the Ontario Government officially placed the new Niagara tunnel into service with a formal opening ceremony and tour.&lt;ref name="OPG-Website"&gt;[http://www.opg.com/power/hydro/new_projects/ntp/index.asp 21 March 2013: Niagara Tunnel Now In-Service], Ontario Power Generation website, March 2013.

OPG's president and CEO Tom Mitchell stated: "This was a large, complex project that will serve Ontario for more than 100 years".&lt;ref name="RenEnergy-Harris-2013.04.13"&gt;Harris, Michael.

The tunnel project was completed at a total cost $100 million lower than its revised $1.6 billion budget, and with an in-service date of 9 March 2013. The operational start-of-service date was nine months sooner than the project's revised schedule that was drawn up in 2009 due to unexpected and difficult geological conditions encountered in the soft [[Queenston Formation|Queenston Shale Formation]] during the tunnel boring process.&lt;ref name="OPG-News-2013.03.21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Niagara Falls Review-2008.11.26"&gt;Larocque, Corey.

The new tunnel will provide enough additional water to the Sir Adam Beck generating complex to produce power for approximately 160,000 homes.&lt;ref name="Niagara Falls Review-2008.11.26" /&gt;

The Niagara Tunnel Project was selected by International Water Power &amp; Dam Construction as the North American Project of the Year for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;International Water Power &amp; Dam Construction - [http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/features/featurenorth-american-project-of-the-year-niagara-tunnel-project/ North American Project of the Year – Niagara tunnel project].

The '''North Arm Powder Magazine''' near [[Port Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] was from 1858 to 1906 a secure storage facility for [[dynamite]] and [[gelignite]] to be used in the construction, mining and quarrying industries.&lt;ref name="North Arm"&gt;''Explosives storage in Magazine Creek, Port Adelaide district, 1857-1906.'' Journal of the Historical Society of South Australia, Nr. 35, 2007 (english).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

It was in [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]] near Port Adelaide at the North Arm of the Port River only 9 m{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} away from the North Arm Bridge and North Arm Road. The explosives were stored in the wooden and slated magazine building and in two dynamite hulks moored in Magazine Creek. One of them was a retired iron dredger, built around 1852, and the other was a former lighter. They were seen as a risk, if they should ever explode, because they were close to the new bridge and coastal settlements and inland towns.&lt;ref name="North Arm"/&gt;

== Buildings ==

The North Arm Powder Magazine was built in 1858 by the government. The magazine was built as a lightweight structure on wooden poles due to its location at the tidal creek. Only later this became best practice to mitigate the secondary damage from an explosion by descending débris.&lt;ref name="North Arm"/&gt;

As it was close to urbanisation, it was  suggested to abandon the site already a decade after it had been commissioned. It was taken out of service only in 1906, after its contents had been moved to the new [[Dry Creek explosives depot]]. The building was demolished in 1916 and no visible evidence remains.&lt;ref name="North Arm"/&gt;

'''OPS-SAT''' is a [[CubeSat]] currently being built by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and it is intended to demonstrate the improvements in mission control capabilities that will arise when satellites can fly more powerful on-board computers. It consists of a satellite which contains an experimental computer that is ten times more powerful than any current ESA spacecraft.&lt;ref name="OPSActivities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/OPS-SAT |title=OPS-SAT |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=27 April 2017 |accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OPS-SAT mission has the very clear objective to break the cycle of “has never flown, will never fly” in the area of satellite control. It is going to be the first CubeSat operated directly by ESA.

OPS-SAT shall provide an in-orbit test-bed environment for the deployment of different experiments to test new protocols, new algorithms and new techniques. The satellite is being designed to be robust and no [[Single point of failure]] should exist, therefore it shall be always possible to recover the spacecraft if something goes wrong with one of the software experiments. The robustness of the basic satellite itself will allow ESA flight control teams to upload and try out new, innovative control software submitted by experimenters.

As of April 2017, OPS-SAT is completing its first System Validation Tests, in which the engineering model and ground segments of the spacecraft are brought together.

Launch date is currently being targeted for 2019.&lt;ref name="ESAW2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa-esaw2017.eu/sites/default/files/OPS-SAT_Experimenter_Dave_Evans_Final%20.pdf |title=ESAW 2017 |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=20 June 2017 |accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Java (programming language)|Java]]
*[[CCSDS File Delivery Protocol]] (CFDP)
*[[NanoSat MO Framework]]

ESA‘s aim is to remove as many barriers to experimentation as possible. For example, there will be no paper work, ESOC's infrastructure will be ready to do automated tests on the experiments, and aims at reducing the overheads close to zero.

The NanoSat MO Framework (NMF) is a software framework for nanosatellites based on CCSDS Mission Operations services. An experiment can be developed as an NMF App that can then be installed, started, and stopped. It also includes monitoring and control capabilities for NMF Apps. The software is open-source. &lt;ref name="NanoSat MO Framework"&gt;{{cite web|title=NanoSat MO Framework|url=https://nanosat-mo-framework.github.io|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Ground, EUD4MO will provide a web-based solution for the monitoring and control of NMF Apps. OPS-SAT experimenters will be able to take control using their web browser.

'''PICMG 2.10''' is a specification by [[PICMG]] that defines the use of the keying mechanisms defined in IEC 1076-4-101 for the J4/P4 connector and in IEEE 1101.10 for handle and cardguide hardware.   Backplanes can be designed for 3.3V VIO or 5V VIO operation. These are differentiated by having 'Cadmium Yellow' colored keys for 3.3V or 'Brilliant Blue' color for 5V operation. If the cPCI card operates on a particular VIO voltage the card shall have the respective colored coding key. If the card is compatible with both voltages then it may not have any coding key.  Other coding keys exists for use of backplanes and cards that support PICMG 2.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Picket fencing''' is slang for the chopping effect sometimes heard by cell phone users at the edge of a cell's coverage area, or (more likely) by the landline user to whom the cellphone is connected. "Picket fencing" refers to the way portions of speech are stripped from the conversation, as if the listener was walking by a [[picket fence]], and hearing a conversation on the other side that changes audibily depending on the position of the pickets relative to the listener.

Originally from [[amateur radio]], the phrase was used to describe the way an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] transmitter will cut in and out as it nears the [[capture effect|capture threshold]] of a moving receiver or transmitter as it passes through [[fresnel zone]]s, thus chopping the speech of the transmitting operator. It is not clear if the phrase was intended to describe the loss of the speech, or if it actually referred to the chopping sound itself, which imitates the noise produced by dragging a stiff object across a picket fence.

'''Plumbing''' is any system that conveys [[fluid]]s for a wide range of applications.

In the developed world, plumbing infrastructure is critical to [[public health]] and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Health Aspects of Plumbing |url=http://www.who.int/topics/water/en/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Plumbing: the Arteries of Civilization'', Modern Marvels video series, The History Channel, AAE-42223, A&amp;E Television, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boilermaker|Boilermakers]] and [[pipefitter]]s are not [[plumber]]s, although they work with [[piping]] as part of their trade, but their work can include some plumbing.

{{See also|History of plumbing|Sanitation in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Lead pipe - Bath Roman Baths.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman lead pipe with a folded seam, at the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England]]

Plumbing originated during ancient civilizations such as the Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese cities as they developed [[public baths]] and needed to provide [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[sewerage|wastewater removal]], for larger numbers of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archaeologists Urge Pentagon To Keep Soldiers From Destroying|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=20030319&amp;id=0jsfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MNAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6854,2226879|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=Mar 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized earthen plumbing pipes with broad [[flange]]s making use of [[asphalt]] for preventing leakages appeared in the urban settlements of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] by 2700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Teresi et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans used [[lead pipe inscription]]s to prevent water theft.
The word  "plumber" dates from the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulsifer, William H. [https://archive.org/details/notesforhistoryo00pulsrich Notes For a History of Lead], New York University Press, 1888. pp. 132, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] for [[lead]] is ''{{lang|la|plumbum}}''.  Roman roofs used lead in conduits and drain pipes&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA821 Middleton, The Remains of Ancient Rome, Vol. 2, A &amp; C Black, 1892]&lt;/ref&gt; and some were also covered with lead. Lead was also used for [[piping]] and for making baths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121025509/http://www.ila-lead.org/factbook/annex.pdf Historical production and uses of lead]. ila-lead.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumbing reached its early apex in [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|ancient Rome]], which saw the introduction of expansive systems of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[tile]] [[wastewater]] removal, and widespread use of [[lead pipe]]s. With the [[Fall of Rome]] both water supply and sanitation stagnated—or regressed—for well over 1,000 years.  Improvement was very slow, with little effective progress made until the growth of modern densely populated cities in the 1800s. During this period, [[public health]] authorities began pressing for better waste disposal systems to be installed, to prevent or control [[epidemic]]s of disease. Earlier, the waste disposal system had merely consisted of collecting waste and dumping it on the ground or into a river. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems eliminated open sewage ditches and [[cesspit|cesspools]].

Most large cities today pipe solid wastes to [[sewage treatment]] plants in order to separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, [[galvanized iron]] piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with flared fittings, then with rigid copper tubing utilizing soldered fittings.

The use of lead for potable water declined sharply after [[World War II]] because of increased awareness of the dangers of [[lead poisoning]]. At this time, copper piping was introduced as a better and safer alternative to lead pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Notice .Lead Contamination Informative City Ok Moscow Water System|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&amp;dat=19880812&amp;id=EZUrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AdEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3819,1428737|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Waterpipes.jpeg|thumb|200px|A system of [[copper]] water [[Tubing (material)|tubes]] used in a [[radiator]] heating system.]]

A ''water pipe'' is a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] or [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]], frequently made of plastic or metal,{{efn|Materials used to make water pipes are [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], [[ductile iron]], [[cast iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and formerly [[lead]].}} that carries [[Pressure|pressurized]] and [[Water purification|treated]] [[fresh water]] to a building (as part of a [[municipal water system]]), as well as inside the building.

===History===
{{Main article|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:Canalisation machine de Marly.jpg|thumb|Old water pipe, remnant of the [[Machine de Marly]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], France]]

For many centuries, [[lead]] was the favoured material for water pipes, because its [[ductility|malleability]] made it practical to [[metalsmith|work]] into the desired shape. (Such use was so common that the word "plumbing" derives from ''plumbum'', the [[Latin]] word for lead.) This was a source of lead-related health problems in the years before the [[lead poisoning|health hazards of ingesting lead]] were fully understood; among these were [[stillbirth]]s and high rates of [[infant mortality]]. Lead water pipes were still widely used in the early 20th century, and remain in many households. In addition, lead-tin [[alloy]] [[solder]] was commonly used to join [[copper pipe]]s, but modern practice uses tin-antimony alloy solder instead, in order to eliminate lead hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead in Drinking Water|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/lead/|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Romans' common use of lead pipes, [[Roman aqueduct|their aqueducts]] rarely poisoned people. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much [[calcium]] in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What often causes confusion is the large amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had easy access to piped water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Roger|title=WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS IN IMPERIAL ROME|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/rome/|publisher=Waterhistory.org|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and drink, for example as a [[preservative]] in wine.&lt;ref name="Lead Poisoning"&gt;Grout, James. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html "Lead Poisoning and Rome"]. Encyclopaedia Romana. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman lead pipe inscription]]s provided information on the owner to prevent water theft.

[[Piping#Wooden piping history|Wooden pipes]] were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs, which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wooden water pipe|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lg-zKE0ETBSw4I8O_RHz5A|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat.  They were often used in Montreal and Boston in the 1800s, and built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes, used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes, were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.

[[Cast iron pipe|Cast iron]] and [[ductile iron pipe]] was long a lower-cost alternative to copper, before the advent of durable plastic materials but special non-conductive fittings must be used where transitions are to be made to other metallic pipes, except for terminal fittings, in order to avoid corrosion owing to electrochemical reactions between dissimilar metals (see [[galvanic cell]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Pipe Material|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/material.html|publisher=Virginia's Community Colleges|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronze]] fittings and short pipe segments are commonly used in combination with various materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/232263/market-for-water-equipment/ Worldwide Market for Industrial and Domestic Water Equipment as of 2010]. PwC. March 2012. Retrieved January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between pipes and tubes==
[[Image:Watermain.jpg|thumb|Typical PVC municipal water main being installed in Ontario, Canada]]
[[Image:FlexibleRainPipe.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A plastic water pipe being installed. Note that the inner tube is actually transporting the water, while the outer tube only serves as a protective casing]]

The difference between pipes and tubes is simply in the way it is sized. [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipe for plumbing applications and galvanized steel pipe for instance, are measured in IPS ([[iron pipe size]]). Copper tube, [[CPVC]], [[PEX|PeX]] and other tubing is measured nominally, which is basically an average diameter. These sizing schemes allow for universal adaptation of transitional fittings. For instance, 1/2" PeX tubing is the same size as 1/2" copper tubing. 1/2" PVC on the other hand is not the same size as 1/2" tubing, and therefore requires either a threaded male or female adapter to connect them.  When used in agricultural irrigation, the singular form "pipe" is often used as a plural.&lt;ref name="etb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between Pipes and Tubes|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pipes-tubes-d_347.html|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipe is available in rigid "joints", which come in various lengths depending on the material. Tubing, in particular copper, comes in rigid hard tempered "joints" or soft tempered (annealed) rolls. PeX and CPVC tubing also comes in rigid "joints" or flexible rolls. The temper of the copper, that is whether it is a rigid "joint" or flexible roll, does not affect the sizing.&lt;ref name="etb" /&gt;

The thicknesses of the water pipe and tube walls can vary.  Pipe wall thickness is denoted by various schedules or for large bore polyethylene pipe in the UK by the [[Standard Dimension Ratio]] (SDR), defined as the ratio of the pipe diameter to its wall thickness. Pipe wall thickness increases with schedule, and is available in schedules 20, 40, 80, and higher in special cases. The schedule is largely determined by the operating pressure of the system, with higher pressures commanding greater thickness. Copper tubing is available in four wall thicknesses: type DWV (thinnest wall; only allowed as drain pipe per UPC), type 'M' (thin; typically only allowed as drain pipe by IPC code), type 'L' (thicker, standard duty for water lines and water service), and type 'K' (thickest, typically used underground between the main and the meter). Because piping and tubing are commodities, having a greater wall thickness implies higher initial cost. Thicker walled pipe generally implies greater durability and higher pressure tolerances.

Wall thickness does not affect pipe or tubing size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall thickness does not affect pipe o|url=http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903072809/http://www.jmeagle.com/pdfs/Technical%20Bulletins/TB10SunlightEffectsonPVC.pdf|archivedate=September 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1/2" L copper has the same outer diameter as 1/2" K or M copper. The same applies to pipe schedules. As a result, a slight increase in pressure losses is realized due to a decrease in flowpath as wall thickness is increased. In other words, 1 foot of 1/2" L copper has slightly less volume than 1 foot of 1/2 M copper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Materials ===
Water systems of ancient times relied on gravity for the supply of water, using pipes or channels usually made of [[clay]], [[lead]], bamboo, wood, or stone. Hollowed wooden logs wrapped in steel banding were used for plumbing pipes, particularly water mains. Logs were used for water distribution in England close to 500 years ago. US cities began using hollowed logs in the late 1700s through the 1800s.  Today, most plumbing supply pipe is made out of steel, copper, and plastic; most waste (also known as "soil")&lt;ref name=cispi&gt;http://www.cispi.org/products/types.aspx{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute&lt;/ref&gt; out of steel, copper, plastic, and cast iron.&lt;ref name=cispi /&gt;

The straight sections of plumbing systems are called "pipes" or "tubes". A pipe is typically formed via [[casting]] or [[welding]], whereas a tube is made through [[extrusion]]. Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as [[brazing]], [[compression fitting]], [[crimp (joining)|crimping]], or for plastics, [[solvent welding]].  These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the [[piping and plumbing fittings]] article.

==== Steel ====
{{Main article|Galvanized pipe}}
[[Galvanized steel]] potable water supply and distribution [[pipe (material)|pipes]] are commonly found with [[nominal pipe size]]s from {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} to {{convert|2|in|mm}}. It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has [[National Pipe Thread]] (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, [[valve]]s, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a [[pipe threader]].   It remains in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy [[building code]] non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely durable and resistant to mechanical abuse.  Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for [[fire sprinkler]]s and natural gas.

Most typical single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than {{convert|3/4|in|mm}} due to expense as well as steel piping's tendency to become obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In potable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.

==== Copper ====
{{Main article|Copper tubing}}

Copper pipe and tubing was widely used for domestic water systems in the latter half of the twentieth century. Demand for copper products has fallen due to the dramatic increase in the price of copper, resulting in increased demand for alternative products including [[PEX]] and [[stainless steel]].

==== Plastic ====
{{Main article|Plastic pipework}}
[[File:SinkPlumbing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Plastic hot and cold supply piping for a sink]]
Plastic pipe is in wide use for domestic water supply and [[Drain-waste-vent system|drain-waste-vent]] (DWV) pipe. Principal types include:
[[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when [[Waldo Semon]] of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) pipe. The method for producing [[cross-linked polyethylene]] (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a variety of materials and fittings employed.
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]/[[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride|CPVC]] – rigid plastic pipes similar to PVC drain pipes but with thicker walls to deal with municipal water pressure, introduced around 1970. PVC stands for polyvinyl chloride, and it has become a common replacement for metal piping. PVC should be used only for cold water, or for venting. CPVC can be used for hot and cold potable water supply. Connections are made with primers and solvent cements as required by code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What’s the difference between PVC and CPVC pipe?|url=http://www.commercial-industrial-supply.com/resource-center/whats-the-difference-between-pvc-and-cpvc-pipe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polypropylene|PP]] – The material is used primarily in housewares, food packaging, and clinical equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/polypropylene-properties-and-uses.html|title=Polypropylene Properties and Uses|author=Bidisha Mukherjee|work=Buzzle}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since the early 1970s has seen increasing use worldwide for both domestic hot and cold water. PP pipes are [[heat fusion|heat fused]], being unsuitable for the use of glues, solvents, or mechanical fittings. PP pipe is often used in [[green building]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmengineer.com/Articles/Green/2010/06/01/Walking-The-Talk|title=Walking The Talk|work=pmengineer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polybutylene terephthalate|PBT]] – flexible (usually gray or black) plastic pipe which is attached to barbed fittings and secured in place with a copper crimp ring. The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for "exposed locations" such as risers.
* [[PEX]] – cross-linked polyethylene system with mechanically joined fittings employing barbs, and crimped steel or copper rings.
* Polytanks – plastic polyethylene cisterns, underground water tanks, above ground water tanks, are usually made of linear polyethylene suitable as a potable water storage tank, provided in white, black or green.
* Aqua – known as PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, consisting of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass compression fittings. In 2005, a large number of these fittings were recalled.{{Elucidate|date=March 2012}}

Present-day water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes in buildings are now made of copper,&lt;ref&gt;''Copper Tube Handbook'', the Copper Development Association, New York, USA, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; brass, plastic (particularly [[cross-linked polyethylene]] called PEX, which is estimated to be used in 60% of single-family homes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.builderonline.com/legislation/californias-pex-battle-continues.aspx California’s PEX Battle Continues]. Builderonline.com&lt;/ref&gt;), or other nontoxic material. Due to its [[lead poisoning|toxicity]], most cities moved away from lead water-supply piping by the 1920s in the United States,&lt;ref name=Maceketal2006 /&gt; although lead pipes were approved by national plumbing codes into the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabin|first=Richard|date=2017-03-06|title=The Lead Industry and Lead Water Pipes “A MODEST CAMPAIGN”|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=98|issue=9|pages=1584–1592|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113555|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2509614|pmid=18633098}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead was used in plumbing solder for drinking water until it was banned in 1986.&lt;ref name=Maceketal2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Macek | first1 = MD. | last2 = Matte | first2 = TD. | last3 = Sinks | first3 = T. | last4 = Malvitz | first4 = DM. | title = Blood lead concentrations in children and method of water fluoridation in the United States, 1988–1994. | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 130–4 |date=Jan 2006 | doi =  10.1289/ehp.8319 |pmc=1332668 |pmid=16393670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast-iron, or lead.&lt;ref&gt;''Uniform Plumbing Code'', IAPMO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Plumbing Code'', ICC&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lengths of pipe or tubing, pipe fittings are used in plumbing systems, such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miscellaneous Valves|url=http://www.ridgewaymechanical.com/atlanta_plumbing_miscellaneous_valves.htm|accessdate=December 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426212049/http://ridgewaymechanical.com/atlanta_plumbing_miscellaneous_valves.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipe and fittings are held in place with [[pipe hanger]]s and [[strapping]].

[[Plumbing fixture]]s are exchangeable devices using water that can be connected to a building's plumbing system.  They are considered to be "fixtures", in that they are semi-permanent parts of buildings, not usually owned or maintained separately.  Plumbing fixtures are seen by and designed for the end-users.  Some examples of fixtures include water closets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Basic Plumbing Principles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19261110&amp;id=Y_NPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1VQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1477,3295499|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=November 10, 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[toilet]]s), [[Urinal (restroom)|urinals]], [[bidet]]s, [[shower]]s, [[bathtub]]s, utility and kitchen [[sink]]s, [[drinking fountain]]s, [[ice maker]]s, humidifiers, [[air washer]]s, [[fountain]]s, and eye wash stations.

=== Sealants ===
Threaded pipe joints are sealed with [[thread seal tape]] or [[pipe dope]]. Many plumbing fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with [[plumber's putty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Key To Pop-up Drain Is Fresh Plumber's Putty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=20030112&amp;id=lg0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KUgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826,1218984|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=Daily News|date=January 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment and tools ==
[[File:Plumber uses two wrenches to tighten a fitting.jpg|thumb|A plumber tightening the fitting on a gas supply line.]]
Plumbing equipment includes devices often hidden behind walls or in utility spaces which are not seen by the general public. It includes [[water meter]]s, [[pump]]s, expansion tanks,   [[back flow preventers]], [[water filter]]s, [[UV sterilization]] lights, [[water softener]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[heat exchangers]], gauges, and control systems.

There are many tools a plumber needs to do a good plumbing job. While many simple plumbing tasks can be completed with a few common hand held tools, other more complex jobs require specialised tools, designed specifically to make the job easier.

Specialized plumbing tools include [[pipe wrench]]es, [[flaring pliers]], pipe vise, pipe bending machine, pipe cutter, [[Tap and die|dies]], and joining tools such as soldering torches and crimp tools.  New tools have been developed to help plumbers fix problems more efficiently. For example, plumbers use video cameras for inspections of hidden leaks or problems, they use hydro jets, and high pressure hydraulic pumps connected to steel cables for trench-less sewer line replacement.

Flooding from excessive rain or clogged sewers may require specialized equipment, such as a heavy duty pumper truck designed to vacuum raw sewage.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Problems ==
Bacteria have been shown to live in "premises plumbing systems". The latter refers to the "pipes and fixtures within a building that transport water to taps after it is delivered by the utility".&lt;ref name=ehp&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carol Potera|title=Plumbing Pathogens: A Fixture in Hospitals and Homes|journal=Environ Health Perspectives;|date=August 2015|volume=123|issue=8|doi=10.1289/ehp.123-A217|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/123-A217/|pmc=4528999|pmid=26230512|page=A217|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907005050/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/123-a217/|archive-date=September 7, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community water systems have been known for centuries to spread [[waterborne diseases]] like  typhoid and cholera, however "opportunistic premises plumbing pathogens" have been recognized only more recently; [[Legionella pneumophila]] discovered in 1976, [[Mycobacterium avium]], and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] are the most commonly tracked bacteria, which people with depressed immunity can inhale or ingest and may become infected with.&lt;ref name=ehp2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Joseph O. Falkinham III|author2=Elizabeth D. Hilborn|author3=Matthew J. Arduino|author4=Amy Pruden|author5=Marc A.

These opportunistic pathogens can grow for example in faucets, shower heads, water heaters and along pipe walls. Reasons that favor their growth are "high surface-to-volume ratio, intermittent stagnation, low disinfectant residual, and warming cycles". A high surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. a relatively large surface area allows the bacteria to form a [[biofilm]], which protects them from disinfection.&lt;ref name=ehp2 /&gt;


== Regulation ==
[[File:pipewrench.jpg|thumb|100px|A [[pipe wrench]] for holding and turning pipe]]
Much of the plumbing work in populated areas is regulated by government or quasi-government agencies due to the direct impact on the public's health, safety, and welfare. Plumbing installation and repair work on residences and other buildings generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the inhabitants of the buildings and to ensure safe, quality construction to future buyers. If permits are required for work, plumbing contractors typically secure them from the authorities on behalf of home or building owners.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===== Australia =====
In Australia, the national governing body for plumbing regulation is the Australian Building Codes Board. They are responsible for the creation of the National Construction Code (NCC), Volume 3 of which, the Plumbing Regulations 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/pr2008216/s11.html|title=PLUMBING REGULATIONS 2008 - REG 11 Plumbing work that may be carried out by unlicensed or unregistered persons|website=classic.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Plumbing Code of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ablis.business.gov.au/service/ag/the-plumbing-code-of-australia-pca-/31066|title=The Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) - Australian Government|last=|first=|date=14 Nov 2018|website=ablis.gov.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertains to plumbing. 

Each Government at the state level has their own Authority and regulations in place for licensing plumbers. They are also responsible for the interpretation, administration and enforcement of the regulations outlined in the NCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abcb.gov.au/ncc-online/Regulatory-Framework|title=Regulatory Framework {{!}} Australian Building Codes Board|website=www.abcb.gov.au|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Authorities are usually established for the sole purpose of regulating plumbing activities in their respective states/territories. However, several state level regulation acts are quite outdated, with some still operating on local policies introduced more than a decade ago. This has led to an increase in plumbing regulatory issues not covered under current policy, and as such, many policies are currently being updated to cover these more modern issues. The updates include changed to the minimum experience and training requirements for licensing, additional work standards for new and more specific kinds of plumbing, as well as adopting the Plumbing Code of Australia into state regulations in an effort to standardise plumbing regulations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://24hourmelbourneplumbers.com.au/plumbing-regulations-in-australia/|title=Plumbing Regulations in Australia|last=|first=|date=14 Nov 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the professional body is the [[Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering]] (educational charity status) and it is true that the trade still remains virtually ungoverned;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciphe.org.uk |title=The Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE) |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no systems in place to monitor or control the activities of unqualified plumbers or those home owners who choose to undertake installation and maintenance works themselves, despite the health and safety issues which arise from such works when they are undertaken incorrectly; see ''Health Aspects of Plumbing (HAP)'' published jointly by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[World Plumbing Council|World Plumbing Council (WPC)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldplumbing.org|title=World Plumbing Council|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/plumbinghealthasp/en|title=WHO Health aspects of plumbing|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; WPC has subsequently appointed a representative to the World Health Organization to take forward various projects related to Health Aspects of Plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldplumbing.org/sep07.html|title=World Plumbing Council|accessdate=October 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117061821/http://www.worldplumbing.org/sep07.html|archivedate=January 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The United States =====
In the United States, plumbing codes and licensing are generally controlled by state and local governments. At the national level, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has set guidelines about what constitutes [[lead]]-free plumbing fittings and pipes, in order to comply with the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/section-1417-safe-drinking-water-act-prohibition-use-lead-pipes-solder-and|title=Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act: Prohibition on Use of Lead Pipes, Solder, and Flux|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Ildefonso - Real Fabrica de Cristales de la Granja 015.JPG|thumb|right|Crystalware manufactured in Real Fábrica de Cristales de La Granja de San Ildefonso]]
'''Real Fábrica de Cristales de La Granja''' ("Royal Factory of Glass and Crystal of La Granja") was a [[Spain|Spanish]] royal manufacturing factory built in  [[San Ildefonso]] (in [[Segovia]], {{Convert|7|mi|km}} south east on the N 601&lt;ref name="Dunlop,2012"/&gt;), in the eighteenth century.

==History==
It was established in 1727 by [[Philip V of Spain]]. In that year, funded by the crown, the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artisan [[Buenaventura Sit]] installed a small oven which manufactured [[float glass]] for the windows and mirrors of the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]], which was under construction in the 1720s. Sit had previously worked at [[Nuevo Baztan]] where a glass factory failed because of inadequate fuel supplies.  At La Granja there was an abundant supply of wood for the factory in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]].

[[Bartolome Sureda y Miserol]], previously director of the [[Real Fábrica del Buen Retiro|Real Fabrica de Porcelana del Buen Retiro]], the [[Real Fabrica de Pano]] in [[Guadalajara]], and the [[Royal Factory of La Moncloa|Real Fabrica de Loza de la Moncloa]], became director of the Real Fábrica de Cristales de La Granja in 1822.&lt;ref name="BrownMann1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan|last2=Mann|first2=Richard G.|title=Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth through Nineteenth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=29 March 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40107-4|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass blowing and glassware production could be viewed at the factory.&lt;ref name="Dunlop,2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Dunlop|first1= Fiona|last2= Soriano|first2= Tino|title= National Geographic Traveler: Spain, Fourth Edition|url= https://books.google.com/?id=HCHR34LqBR8C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=Real+F%C3%A1brica+de+Cristales+de+La+Granja#v=onepage&amp;q=Real%20F%C3%A1brica%20de%20Cristales%20de%20La%20Granja&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher= National Geographic Books|isbn=9781426209550|page =226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wares of the royal factory were exported to the [[Americas]], which caused financial losses to the other countries who exported as well.&lt;ref name=" Fioratti, 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last= Fioratti |first= Helen Costantino |title= Illuminating their world: three hundred years of light, 1500|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvFJAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Real+F%C3%A1brica+de+Cristales+de+La+Granja&amp;q=Real+F%C3%A1brica+de+Cristales+de+La+Granja#search_anchor|year=2007|publisher= L'antiquaire &amp; the Connoisseur, inc|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1836, with the royal factory experiencing financial hardship, the Royal Treasury formally took over the facility which, unlike other royal factories, failed to financially support itself.

To revive the traditions of the Royal Glass Factory, the National Glass Centre Foundation was established in 1982 in the eighteenth-century building. The Ministerial Order of 1989 was formalized by law in 1994, its basic objective being “the promotion, development, education, research and dissemination of craftsmanship and history of glass manufacture artistic and other cultural and scientific activities related to art and art glass.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.realfabricadecristales.es/Sobre-nosotros&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dreal%2Bf%25C3%25A1brica%2Bde%2Bcristales%2Bde%2Bla%2Bgranja%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1440%26bih%3D710%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DIdTUNHhFsj9igLdyYGIDg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ7gEwAg|title=Royal Glass Factory of La Granj, a Sobre Nosotros - Real Fábrica de Cristales de La Granja|accessdate=14 September 2012|publisher= realfabricadecristales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PC-Netzteil (redundant).jpg|thumb|Redundant power supply]]
[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|thumb|Redundant subsystem "B"]]

In [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[wikt:component|component]]s or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the form of a backup or [[fail-safe]], or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of [[GNSS]] receivers, or [[multi-threaded]] computer processing.

In many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research&lt;/ref&gt; which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; often outweighed by other risk factors, such as [[human error]]. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "majority voting systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303033411/http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |title=Analog Voting Circuit Is More Flexible Than Its Digital Version |author=R.

[[File:Bridge-suspension.svg|thumb|A [[suspension bridge|suspension bridge's]] numerous cables are a form of redundancy.]]

Redundancy sometimes produces less, instead of greater reliability{{snd}} it creates a more complex system which is prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglect of duty, and may lead to higher production demands which by overstressing the system may make it less safe.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D. Sagan |date=March 2004 |work=Organization &amp; Environment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040714202943/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of redundancy ==
In computer science, there are four major forms of redundancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koren|first1=Israel|last2=Krishna|first2=C. Mani|title=Fault-Tolerant Systems|date=2007|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-12-088525-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are:
* Hardware redundancy, such as [[dual modular redundancy]] and [[triple modular redundancy]]
* Information redundancy, such as [[error detection and correction]] methods
* Time redundancy, performing the same operation multiple times such as multiple executions of a program or multiple copies of data transmitted
* Software redundancy such as [[N-version programming]]

A modified form of software redundancy, applied to hardware may be:

* Distinct functional redundancy, such as both mechanical and hydraulic braking in a car.  Applied in the case of software, code written independently and distinctly different but producing the same results for the same inputs.
[[Structures]] are usually designed with redundant parts as well, ensuring that if one part fails, the entire structure will not collapse. A structure without redundancy is called [[Fracture critical|fracture-critical]], meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure. Bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the [[Silver Bridge]] and the [[Skagit River Bridge|Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River]].

[[File:Series-Parallel-Systems-Examples.jpg|thumb|Series (A) and parallel (B) systems and their combination (C).&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Parallel and combined systems demonstrate different level of redundancy. The models are subject of studies in reliability and safety engineering.

== Function of redundancy ==
The two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and [[active redundancy]]. Both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity.

Passive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges. This extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse. The extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety.

Eyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy. Vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but depth perception is impaired. Hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is impaired. Performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur.

Active redundancy eliminates performance declines by monitoring the performance of individual devices, and this monitoring is used in voting logic. The voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures the components. Error detection and correction and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are two examples of active redundancy.

Electrical power distribution provides an example of active redundancy. Several power lines connect each generation facility with customers. Each power line includes monitors that detect overload. Each power line also includes circuit breakers. The combination of power lines provides excess capacity. Circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload. Power is redistributed across the remaining lines.

==Disadvantages==
[[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004/&gt;

== Voting logic ==
Voting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system. Voting logic often involves computers, but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic. Circuit breakers are an example of a form of non-computer voting logic.

Electrical power systems use [[power scheduling]] to reconfigure active redundancy. Computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost. This prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake.

The simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components: primary and alternate. They both run similar software, but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation. The primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is OK. All outputs from the primary stop, including the activity message, when the primary detects a fault. The alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases. Errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time, or cause outputs to flutter on and off.

A more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more. All perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic. The voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement, and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device(s) that disagree. A single fault will not interrupt normal operation. This technique is used with [[avionics]] systems, such as those responsible for operation of the [[Space Shuttle]].

== Calculating the probability of system failure ==
Each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:-

:&lt;math&gt;{p}=  \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; – number of components
* &lt;math&gt; p_{i} &lt;/math&gt; – probability of component i failing
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; – the probability of all components failing (system failure)

This formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket in such a way that if one power supply failed, the other would too.

It also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10602">'''ReserVec''' was a [[computerized reservation system]] developed by [[Ferranti Canada]] for [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA, today's [[Air Canada]]) in the late 1950s. It appears to be the first such system ever developed, predating the more famous [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]] system in the US by about two years. Although Ferranti had high hopes that the system would be used by other airlines, no further sales were forthcoming and development of the system ended. Major portions of the [[Transistor computer|transistor-based circuit design]] were put to good use in the [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] computer, which would later go on to see major sales in Europe as the [[ICT 1900 series|ICT 1904]].

==Background==

In the early 1950s the airline industry was undergoing explosive growth. A serious limiting factor was the time taken to make a single booking, which could take upwards of 90 minutes in total. TCA found their bookings typically involved between three and seven calls to the centralized booking centre in [[Toronto]], where telephone operators would scan flight status displayed on a huge board showing all scheduled flights one month into the future. Bookings past that time could not be made, nor could an agent reliably know anything other than if the flight was full or not &amp;ndash; to book two seats was much more complex, requiring the operator to find the "flight card" for that flight in a filing cabinet.

In 1946 [[American Airlines]] decided to tackle this problem through [[automation]], introducing the [[Reservisor]], a simple [[electromechanical]] computer based on telephone switching systems. Newer versions of the Reservisor included [[magnetic drum]] systems for storing flight information further into the future. The ultimate version of the system, the Magnetronic Reservisor, was installed in 1956 and could store data for 2,000 flights a day up to one month into the future. Reservisors were later sold to a number of airlines, as well as Sheraton for hotel bookings, and Goodyear for inventory control.

==TCA experiments==

TCA was aware of the Reservisor, but was unimpressed by its limited capabilities in terms of information it could store, and even more by the failure rate which was essentially "constant". Nor did the Reservisor really change the way the reservations system worked; ticket agents still had to call central booking and talk (typically through an intermediary) to a Reservisor operator to answer queries.

TCA asked one of their communications engineers, Lyman Richardson, to study the booking problem, and he quickly came to the opinion that a computerized solution was the only one worth studying. TCA then entered into an agreement to build a prototype system on the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[UTEC#FERUT|FERUT]] computer, a surplus [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer they had received in 1952 when the UK's nuclear weapons laboratories had to abandon it after budget cuts.

The FERUT-based system was demonstrated in 1953 and was a qualified success; while the programmed logic and data storage/retrieval worked well, input/output was a serious bottleneck that seemed to make the system no better than the mechanical Reservisor. Furthermore the Ferut was [[vacuum tube]] based, and thus no more reliable than the Reservisor, TCA's major concern prior to the experiment.

Richardson was convinced that the basic concept was sound, and formed a team of himself and several engineers from the university's Computation Center, operating under the aegis of Adalia Ltd., a consulting firm set up by [[Robert Watson-Watt]] of [[radar]] fame when he moved to [[Montreal]] at the end of [[World War II]]. They became involved with the newly-forming electronics group at Ferranti Canada, who felt they had a solution to the input/output and reliability problems.

Ferranti proposed a new "transactor" (terminal) that used a new [[punched card]] system. Booking agents at the ticketing offices marked the cards with pencil, for various checkboxes, then inserted it into the transactor which read the marks and punched those codes onto the edge of the card. Cards would then be collected from any number of operators and fed into a normal card reader, which would read them over telephone lines at "high speed" directly into the central booking computer. The computer itself would be built using transistor-based logic, thereby eliminating downtime due to tube burnout. Such a system had first been proposed in order to improve the reliability of the [[DATAR]] system Ferranti had built for the Canadian Navy, and they were convinced of its practicality.

TCA was interested, and provided $75,000 for the construction of six prototype transactors. In 1957 these were attached to FERUT over telephone lines and the experimental booking program run again. The demonstration was a complete success; users could quickly feed in requests and Ferut was able to book, change, query and cancel flights at speeds that made the Reservisor look terribly slow.

==Deployment==

There was some further development and planning, but in 1959 TCA placed a $2 million ($12 million in year-2000 dollars) contract for a deployment system consisting of 350 transactors and all the communications equipment to support them in the field. Ferranti also won the contract for the computer system itself, although [[IBM]] had also been considered. The new machine was based on a 25-bit word, using one bit for [[parity bit|parity]] checking and 24 bits for data, and was equipped with 4,096 words of [[core memory]], later expanded to 8,192 words. Storage consisted of five magnetic drums (one was a spare) with 32,768 25-bit words each, and six tape units. Simple load balancing software routed requests across two CPUs, known as Castor and Pollux, the computer as a whole thus becoming '''Gemini'''. An internal TCA contest in late 1960 to name the system as a whole resulted in ReserVec for ''Reservations Electronically Controlled''.

Installation of the transactors started in April 1961, followed by the computer in the Toronto booking office in August. The system was brought up for testing on October 18th, 1961, connecting additional ticketting offices as the transactors were installed over the next year. By August 1962 the system was complete, and the switch-over from the manual systems to ReserVec was completed on January 24, 1963. Use of ReserVec reduced the head count at the booking office from 230 to 90, and allowed for the sale of thousands of telephone lines formerly needed to reach the human operators. Total turnaround from request to response could be as short as a second, although under load it might drop to two seconds at the worst. The system as a whole could process 10 transactions a second.

It is interesting to compare the system with [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]], being deployed at about the same time by American Airlines. SABRE was first started as an experimental effort in 1953, and a formal development contract signed in 1957. The system was first turned on in 1960, and took over booking functions in December 1964. So while the two projects started at the same time, ReserVec was completed almost two years earlier. While the ReserVec cost $4 million, SABRE was ten times that. Equally interesting is that while the SABRE CPU was about ten times faster, ReserVec handled 80-100,000 transactions a day with a maximum two second delay, while SABRE handled only 26,000 with delays of up to three seconds.

Unlike SABRE, however, ReserVec did not store passenger information, which had to be processed manually. In order to address this need, TCA added a second system known as '''Pioneer''', which could link ReserVec's three letter passenger codes with the full passenger records held on a Burroughs D-82 computer (originally designed for US military use). Pioneers were installed only in the Toronto and Montreal offices, smaller offices continued using paper records for user info.

ReserVec ran all of TCA's reservations for nine years, with an average downtime of only 120 seconds a year. Originally designed for only 60,000 transactions a day, it was already processing 80 to 100,000 when it was first turned on, and over 600,000 by 1970. Retroactively named '''ReserVec I''', the system was finally replaced at the end of 1970 by a new [[Univac]]-based system known as '''ReserVec II''', which featured small [[computer terminal]]s replacing the punched card systems.

==Disappointing sales==

Ferranti, now as Ferranti-Packard, tried to sell the machine as-is to other airlines. The US market seemed to be entirely wrapped up by IBM and Univac, but there was no comparable system in Europe, where a number of airlines were looking at the US developments with interest. Gemini could be sold directly into Europe by Ferranti's existing UK-based sales force. Instead, the UK headquarters decided to build their own solution from scratch. In the end, the UK system would never be delivered; it was still being developed when Ferranti decided to sell off their entire computer division after years of losses.

Nevertheless, the work did not go to waste. The engineering team convinced Canadian management to support the development of a business computer aimed at the low-end of the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] market. They expanded the ReserVec system with additional hardware to directly support [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] and various changes to make the system highly modular, making it more attractive to a wider variety of users. Sales of the new [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] were just starting when the UK headquarters used the design to sweeten the deal when selling off their UK computer divisions, handing the design to the [[International Computers and Tabulators|ICT]] who took over production. This was much to the chagrin of the Canadian staff, most of whom quit. The FP-6000 became the ICT 1904, one of a line of similar machines which sold over 3,000 during the 1960s and 70s.

A '''safety harness''' is a form of [[Personal protective equipment|protective equipment]] designed to protect a person, animal, or object from [[injury]] or damage. The harness is an attachment between a stationary and non-stationary object and is usually fabricated from [[rope]], [[Wire rope|cable]] or [[webbing]] and locking hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-safetyharness.html Encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some safety harnesses are used in combination with a [[shock absorber]], which is used to regulate [[deceleration]] when the end of the rope is reached.  One example would be [[bungee jumping]].

In North America, Safety Harness for protection against falls from heights in industrial and construction activities are covered by design performance standards issued by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) in the United States and by CSA (Canadian Standards Association) in Canada. Specifically, the standards issued are ANSI Z359.1 and CSA Z259.10. These standards are updated approximately every four to five years so it is important to ensure the latest version is referenced.

==Classifications==
Fall Protection Systems

Listed below are different types of fall safety equipment and their recommended usage.  

Class 1 	Body belts (single or double D-ring) are designed to restrain a person in a hazardous work position to prevent fall or to arrest a fall completely within 3 foot of movement (OSHA).  Amends must be made to keep the line rigid at all times.  A harness should also be used.

Class 2 	Chest harnesses are used when there are only limited fall hazards (no vertical free fall hazard), or for retrieving persons such as removal of persons from a tank or a bin.  

Class 3 	Full body harnesses are designed to arrest the most severe free falls.  

Class 4 	Suspension belts are independent work supports used to suspend a worker, such as boatswain's chairs or raising or lowering harnesses .

'''Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy''' , formerly '''Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica''' ({{IPA-es|ɡaˈmesa koɾpoɾaˈθjon teɣnoˈloxika}}) and '''Grupo Auxiliar Metalúrgico''', is a Spanish manufacturing company principally involved in the fabrication of [[wind turbine]]s and the construction of [[wind farm]]s.

It was formerly headquartered in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], 40&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Bilbao]], in northern [[Spain]]. 2010 it moved to [[Zamudio]], [[Biscay]], a suburb of Bilbao. Gamesa develops, manages and sells [[wind farms]], for which it also supplies wind turbines. It is the market leader in Spain and the fourth largest wind turbine manufacturer in the world (2011).&lt;ref name="ihs2012"&gt;IHS Emerging Energy Research. [http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/article1295534.ece Gamesa back in wind top-five as GE drops out - analysts] ''Global Wind Turbine Supply Market Share Evolution'', 6 March 2012. Retrieved: 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It manufactures the SG7 turbine one of the [[List of most powerful wind turbines|most powerful turbines]] in the World.

In 2016 [[Siemens Wind Power]] and Gamesa reached agreement on a 59:41 merger of their wind turbine businesses.

== History ==
Gamesa began operations in 1976 focused at that time on developing new technologies and applying them to emerging activities. These included [[robotics]], [[microelectronics]], [[aeronautics]] and the development of [[composite material]]s. In 1994, Gamesa Eólica was created as a subsidiary specializing in the manufacture of wind turbines. The company became involved in the development, construction and operations of wind farms in 1995 and completed its first wind farm the following year. Gamesa had a 7-year partnership with [[Vestas]] that ended in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/950913/two-wind-giants-go-head-head---vestas-gamesa-split |title=Two wind giants go head to head -- Vestas and Gamesa split |publisher=[[Windpower Monthly]] |date=2002 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160214230618/http://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/950913/two-wind-giants-go-head-head---vestas-gamesa-split |archivedate=14 February 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corporation was officially listed on the stock exchange on 31 October 2000 and joined the selective [[IBEX 35]] on 24 April 2001.

Since 2006, the company has focused on technologies associated with [[sustainable energy]], principally [[wind power]]. It has divested of its interests in aeronautics, which were sold off to form a new company known as ''Aernnova'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aernnova.com/user/index.php Aernnova homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and in services, which were sold off to form a new company known as ''Global Energy Services.''

As part of the [[United Kingdom]]'s move to expand its production of offshore wind energy production, Gamesa has committed to the expenditure of £133.7 million on a production factory and other facilities in the UK, and will also move its offshore wind division headquarters to London.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, James.

In January 2014, Gamesa and French nuclear manufacturer [[Areva]] announced a preliminary deal to create a joint venture (Adwen) in the offshore wind power business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-25818347| title=Wind turbine firms Gamesa and Areva in joint venture | publisher=BBC| accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2016 [[Siemens AG]] and Gamesa announced they were to merge their wind businesses, with the two operations forming 59% ([[Siemens Wind]]) and 41% (Gamesa) of the resulting company's shareholding, with Siemens offering €3.75 per Gamesa share. The resultant company was to be headquartered in Spain, with an offshore operations headquartered in Hamburg, Germany and Vejle, Denmark. Siemens was reported to have paid €1 billion cash for Gamesa shares. Cost savings between duplicated functions in the two businesses was expected by Gamesa to save c. €230 million in the first year of operation. The combined business would be the largest wind turbine manufacturer worldwide by installed capacity (c. 69GW), exceeding [[Vestas]] and [[GE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-17/gamesa-gets-siemens-merger-approval-to-expand-wind-turbine-units| title = Siemens, Gamesa Merge Units to Form World’s Biggest Wind-Turbine Maker | first = Anna| last = Hirtenstein | work = www.bloomberg.com| date =  17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamesa-m-a-siemens-idUSKCN0Z22JC | title = Siemens, Gamesa to form world's largest wind farm business| first =Jose Elias|last = Rodriguez| date = 17 June 2016| work = www.reuters.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gam2016"&gt;{{citation| url  =https://www.siemens.com/press/PR2016060295COEN| title = Siemens and Gamesa to merge wind businesses to create a leading wind power player| date = 17 July 2016| type = press release| publisher = Siemens }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stirrup jar''' is a style of pottery vessel which originated during the Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haskell|first=Halford W.|date=1985|title=The Origin of the Aegean Stirrup Jar and Its Earliest Evolution and Distribution (MB III-LBI)|jstor=504326|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=221–229|doi=10.2307/504326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such vessels were sometimes decorated with painted designs or ornamentation. Early examples of the stirrup jar have been recovered from [[Rhodes]] dating to c. 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Octopus Style' stirrup jar|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/o/octopus_style_stirrup_jar.aspx|work=The British Museum|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of inscribed [[Kydonia]]n stirrup jars have been recovered from several archaeological sites on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cydonia|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes|work=The Modern Antiquarian|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirrup jars were originally intended for use as containers for oil and wine. The early stirrup jars were sparsely decorated and featured a three handled arrangement, disc hole, spout horns, and the shape of a false neck and spout. Traditionally stirrup jars were divided into two versions: a small, fine ware version suggesting a specialized use and a large, coarse ware version.&lt;ref name=haskell&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=504326 | title=The Origin of the Aegean Stirrup Jar and Its Earliest Evolution and Distribution | last=Haskell | first=Halford W. | journal=American Journal of Archaeology | series=2 |date=April 1985 | volume=89 | pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The features found suggest that the stirrup jar could have been economically valuable. The arrangement of the stirrup jar suggests a stopper was used to secure the contents. The disc holes and third handle may have been used to secure a tag to the vessel suggesting a commercial importance and resale value. The locations where stirrup jars have been found in reflect the fact that the popularity of this vessel type spread quickly throughout the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the use of the stirrup jar to identify a specific commodity became important.&lt;ref name="haskell" /&gt;

'''SubRip''' is a free software program for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] which "[[Ripping|rips]]" (extracts) [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] and their timings from video. It is [[free software]], released under the [[GNU]] [[GPL]].  ''SubRip'' is also the name of the widely used and broadly compatible subtitle text file format created by this software.

==SubRip software==
Using [[optical character recognition]], SubRip can extract from live video, video files and DVDs, then record the extracted subtitles and timings as a ''Subrip format'' [[text file]].&lt;ref name="Thaureaux1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thaureaux|2007| pp=131–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can optionally save the recognized subtitles as bitmaps for later subtraction (erasure) from the source video.&lt;ref&gt;Zuggy, News, entry dated May 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thaureaux|2007| p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, SubRip is configured with the correct [[codec]] for the video source, then trained by the user on the specific text area, fonts, styles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thaureaux|2007| p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  colors and video processing requirements&lt;ref name="Zguide"&gt;Zuggy, Guide.&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize subtitles. &lt;!-- this is demystifying the process, not step-by-stepping it --&gt; After trial and fine tuning, SubRip can automatically extract subtitles for the whole video source file during its playback.  SubRip records the beginning and end times and text for each subtitle in the output text &lt;code&gt;.srt&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Thaureaux|2007|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SubRip uses [[AviSynth]] to extract video frames from source video, and can rip subtitles from all video files supported by that program.

The SubRip file format, as reported on the [[Matroska]] multimedia [[container format (digital)|container format]] website, is "perhaps the most basic of all subtitle formats."&lt;ref name="Matroska"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html |title=SRT Subtitles |publisher=CoreCodec Inc. |work=matroska.org |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SubRip (SubRip Text) files are named with the [[Filename extension|extension]] &lt;code&gt;.srt&lt;/code&gt;, and contain formatted lines of plain text in groups separated by a blank line.  Subtitles are numbered sequentially, starting at 1. The [[timecode]] format used is '''hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds''' with time units fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits (00:00:00,000).  The [[Decimal separator#History|fractional separator]] used is the [[comma]], since the program was written in [[Decimal separator#History|France]].

# A numeric counter identifying each sequential subtitle
# The time that the subtitle should appear on the screen, followed by &lt;code&gt;--&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the time it should disappear
# Subtitle text itself on one or more lines
# A blank line containing no text, indicating the end of this subtitle&lt;ref name="Matroska"/&gt;
Example:
 168
 00:20:41,150 --&gt; 00:20:45,109
 - How did he do that?
 - Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.&lt;br&gt;

=== Formatting ===
Unofficially the format has very basic text formatting, which can be either interpreted or passed through for rendering depending on the processing application.  Formatting is derived from HTML tags for bold, italic, underline and color:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ale5000.altervista.org/subtitles.htm SubRip (.SRT) subtitles support in players] – ale5000.altervista.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bold – &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt; or {b} ... {/b}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Italic – &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt; ... &lt;/i&gt; or {i} ... {/i}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Underline – &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;u&gt; ... &lt;/u&gt; or {u} ... {/u}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Font color – &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;font color="color name or #code"&gt; ... &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (as in [[HTML]])
Nested tags are allowed; some implementations prefer whole-line formatting only.

===Compatibility===
The SubRip &lt;code&gt;.srt&lt;/code&gt; file format is supported by most software video players listed in ''[[Comparison of video player software#Subtitle ability|Comparison of video player software]]''. For [[Windows]] software video players that do not support subtitle playback directly, the [[VSFilter]] [[DirectX]] filter displays SubRip and other subtitle formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=实用工具软件玩家攻略 |author= 陈波, 杨涛 |publisher=清华大学出版社 |year=2006

== WebVTT ==
{{Main article|WebVTT}}
A format originally called WebSRT (Web Subtitle Resource Tracks) was as of October 2010 being specified by the [[WHATWG|Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] for the proposed [[HTML5]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;track&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. It shared the &lt;code&gt;.srt&lt;/code&gt; file extension and was "broadly &lt;!-- see Talk #2--&gt; based on" (parts of) &lt;!-- see Talk #3 --&gt; the SubRip format, but was not fully compatible with SubRip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delphiki.com/websrt/ Understanding WebSRT format]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/websrt.html WebSRT], from the WHATWG HTML draft specification, retrieved 2010-10-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- sources for whole paragraph --&gt;
The prospective format was later renamed WebVTT (Web Video Text Track).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Google's Chrome and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 10 browsers were the first to support {{tag|track|o}} tags with WebVTT files for HTML5 videos. Mozilla Firefox implemented WebVTT in its nightly builds (Firefox 24), and as of Firefox 31 (July 24, 2014), Mozilla enabled WebVTT on Firefox by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firefox 31 Release Notes|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/31.0/releasenotes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature had to be enabled in Firefox by going to the "about:config" page and setting the value of "media.webvtt.enabled" to true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implement the track element|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629350}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube began supporting WebVTT in April, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caption File - YouTube Help|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=2734698&amp;topic=3014331&amp;ctx=topic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text encoding ==
SubRip's default output encoding is configured as [[Windows-1252]]. However, output options are also given for many [[Windows code page|Windows code pages]] as well [[Unicode]] encodings, such as [[UTF-8]] and [[UTF-16]], with or without [[Byte order mark|Byte Order Mark (BOM)]]. Therefore, there's no de facto character encoding standard for &lt;code&gt;.srt&lt;/code&gt; files, which means that any SubRip file parser must attempt to use [[Charset detection]]. Unicode [[Byte order mark|Byte Order Mark (BOM)]] are typically used to aid detection.   

A number of embedded hardware-based players only have support for ASCII or Western European fonts due to the licensing costs associated with the commercial fonts used {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

'''Techreturns Nederland BV''' is a Dutch company founded with the aim to reduce [[electronic waste]] (e-waste). It does this by buying used electronics, especially mobile phones, from consumers and companies to repair them and give them a second life. Some choose to donate mobile phone through organisations such as Masterpeace and [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]] Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doneer je oude telefoon aan de olifanten|url=http://www.artis.nl/kaartjes-steunen/olifanten/doneer-je-oude-telefoon-aan-de-olifanten/|work=Artis Zoo|publisher=Artis Zoo|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The company's revenues comes from selling the second hand devices mainly in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] where there is a market for affordable, quality electronics.&lt;ref name="Mobile phones Africa"&gt;{{cite news|last=Persson|first=Michael|title=Afrika biedt tweede leven aan de mobieltjes die wij afdanken|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/3375320/2013/01/11/Afrika-biedt-tweede-leven-aan-de-mobieltjes-die-wij-afdanken.dhtml|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=De Volkskrant|date=11.01.2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales also take place in [[Europe]], especially in the Netherlands through its sister company BeatsNew.

__NOTOC__
A '''tension-leg platform''' (TLP) or '''extended tension leg platform''' (ETLP) is a vertically [[geotechnical engineering#Floating-moored structures|moored floating structure]] normally used for the offshore production of [[crude oil|oil]] or [[natural gas|gas]], and is particularly suited for water depths greater than 300 metres (about 1000&amp;nbsp;ft) and less than 1500 metres (about 4900&amp;nbsp;ft). Use of tension-leg platforms has also been proposed for wind turbines.

The platform is permanently moored by means of tethers or tendons grouped at each of the structure's corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg. A feature of the design of the tethers is that they have relatively high [[Axis of rotation|axial]] [[stiffness]] (low [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), such that virtually all vertical motion of the platform is eliminated. This allows the platform to have the production [[wellhead]]s on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the [[seafloor]]. This allows a simpler [[well completion]] and gives better control over the production from the [[Petroleum|oil]] or [[gas]] [[oil reservoir|reservoir]], and easier access for downhole intervention operations.

TLPs have been in use since the early 1980s. The first tension leg platform&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT&gt;[http://everything.but.architecture.pagesperso-orange.fr/Oilrig/oilrig.htm Reconversion d’une plate-forme offshore]&lt;/ref&gt; was built for Conoco's [[Hutton oilfield|Hutton field]] in the North Sea in the early 1980s. The hull was built in the dry-dock at Highland Fabricator's Nigg yard in the north of Scotland, with the deck section built nearby at McDermott's yard at Ardersier. The two parts were mated in the Moray Firth in 1984.

The Hutton TLP was originally designed for a service life of 25 years in Nord Sea depth of 100 to 1000 metres. It had 16 tension legs. Its weight varied between 46,500 and 55,000 tons when moored to the seabed, but up to 61,580 tons when floating freely.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt; The total area of its living quarters was about 3,500 square metres and accommodated over a 100 cabins though only 40 people were necessary to maintain the structure in place.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt;

The hull of the Hutton TLP has been separated from the topsides. Topsides have been redeployed to the [[Prirazlomnoye field]] in the Barents Sea, while the hull was reportedly sold to a project in the Gulf of Mexico (although the hull has been moored in Cromarty Firth since 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilrig-photos.com/picture/number1709.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger TLPs will normally have a full drilling rig on the platform with which to drill and intervene on the wells. The smaller TLPs may have a workover rig, or in a few cases no production wellheads located on the platform at all.

The deepest (E)TLPs measured from the sea floor to the surface are:&lt;ref&gt;https://portal.mustangeng.com/pls/portal30/docs/FOLDER/MUSTANGENG/INDUSTRY_POSTERS_CONTENT/2007_07_DSRPOSTER.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use for wind turbines==
Although the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] explored the concept of TLPs for [[Floating wind turbine|offshore wind turbines]] in September 2006, architects had studied the idea as early as 2003.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt; Earlier offshore wind turbines cost more to produce, stood on towers dug deep into the ocean floor, were only possible in depths of at most {{convert|50|ft|m}}, and generated 1.5 megawatts for onshore units and 3.5 megawatts for conventional offshore setups. In contrast, TLP installation was calculated to cost a third as much. TLPs float, and researchers estimate they can operate in depths between 100 and {{convert|650|ft|m}} and farther away from land, and they can generate 5.0 megawatts.&lt;ref name=FLOW&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/060918_floating_windmills.html Floating Ocean Windmills Designed to Generate More Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer simulation]]s project that in a [[hurricane]] TLPs would shift 0.9 m to 1.8 m and the turbine blades would cycle above wave peaks. MIT and NREL researchers say dampers could be used to reduce motion in the event of a [[natural disaster]].&lt;ref name=FLOW/&gt;

MIT and NREL researchers plan to install a half-scale prototype south of [[Cape Cod]]. Sclavounos said, "We'd have a little unit sitting out there to show that this thing can float and behave the way we're saying it will."&lt;ref name=FLOW/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1569">A roofing '''toe board''' is one of the most basic pieces of [[safety equipment]] a [[roofer]] can use.  A toe board is a long piece of 2 inch x 4 inch (a 2x4) wood nailed horizontally along a [[roof]] in various places. 

Most roofers work in a variety of [[weather]] conditions, sometimes severe [[heat]], and resist wearing an apparatus such as a safety harness.  As a result of needing both an uncumbered work environment and the need to stay as cool as possible, roofers prefer the toe board due to its [[freedom of movement|freeness of movement]].  If an [[accident]] happens and a roofer loses his/her footing, the 2x4 would stop the roofer from sliding down and/or off the roof.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.okstate.edu/manuals/roof-man.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

More deaths occur in falls than for any other reason in the [[construction]] profession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/heightsafeleaflet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a toe board is a small vertical barrier attached to a raised floor or raised platform. A toe board is like a tiny wall - usually between 4 and 12 inches - whose purpose is to prevent objects or people from falling over, or rolling over, the side of a raised platform, such as preventing a screwdriver dropped on the floor of elevated construction scaffolding from rolling off the side onto people or objects below.
