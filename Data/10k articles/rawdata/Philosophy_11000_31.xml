'''Anupalabdhi'''  ([[Sanskrit]]: अनुपलब्धि) means 'non-recognition', 'non-perception'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=anupalabdhi&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word refers to the [[Pramāṇa|Pramana]] of Non-perception which consists in the presentative knowledge of negative facts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion |author=|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uec1E8DpiH8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anupalabdhi'' or ''abhāvapramāṇa'' is the Pramana of Non-perception admitted by [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumārila]] for the perception of non-existence of a thing. He holds that the non-existence of a thing cannot be perceived by the senses for there is nothing with which the senses could come into contact in order to perceive the non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=397|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bhāṭṭa school of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā and [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita-Vedānta]] system of philosophy, Anupalabdhi is a way to apprehend an absence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Philosophy|author=Jitendranath Mohanty|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asxruhA1DRgC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is regarded as the source of knowledge, the other five being – ''[[pratyaksha|pratyakṣa]]'' ('perception'), ''[[anumana|anumāna]]'' ('inference'), ''[[shabda|śabda]]'' ('testimony'), ''upamāna'' ('comparison') and ''arthāpatti'' ('presumption'). The perception of negation or non-existence in its various forms is also due to the relation of attributiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Padartha Vijnana|author=Y.C.Mishra|publisher=Chaukhambha Publications|page=392,465|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uuywLu-DxPIC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All things exist in places either in a positive (''sadrupa'') or in a negative (''asadrūpa'') relation, and it is only in the former case that they come into contact with the senses, while in the latter case the perception of the negative existence can only be had by a separate mode of movement of the mind, a separate ''pramāṇa'' – ''anupalabdhi''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Systems of Indian Philosophy|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oEpPOKtrbkC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indirect knowledge of non-existence can be attained by other means but direct knowledge of non-existence of perceptible objects and their attributes is available only through this kind of ''pramāṇa'' which is not inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accomplishing the Accomplished|author=Anantanand Rambachan|publisher=University of Hawaii|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FlsBa8FWlIC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BkYuU5WtFsfirAfA24HYDA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four  verities of ''Anupalabdhi'' which have been identified, they are  – a) ''kāraṇa-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of the causal condition', b) ''vyāpaka-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of the pervader', c) ''svabhāva-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of presence of itself', and d) ''viruddha-anupalabdhi'' or 'non-perception of the opposed'. The lack of perceptible (''yogya'') adjuncts (''upādhi'') is known through non-perception of what is perceptible (''yogya-anupalabdhi'') and the lack of imperceptible adjuncts is known by showing that which is thought to be an adjunct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Philosophy of Induction|author=Kisor Kumar Chakraborti|publisher=Lexington Books|page=278,146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2xhSHlppPQC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of [[Prabhākara]] and the [[Viśiṣṭādvaita|Vishishtadvaita]] do not accept ''anupalabdhi'' as a separate ''parmāṇa'' because the same sense organs which apprehend an entity can also cognize its ''abhāva'' or the non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattvamuktakalapa|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RUIuU4Y1h9StB8D9gOAB&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dharmakīrti|Dharmakirti]], ''anupalabdhi'' is the affirmative assertion of a negative prediction, and is same as ''anumāna'' of an ''abhāva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contrary Thinking|author=Daya Krishna|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=121,125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a44AHKGef64C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=anupalabdhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BkYuU5WtFsfirAfA24HYDA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anupalabdhi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arturo Reghini''' (12 November 1878 – 1 July 1946) was an Italian mathematician, philosopher and esotericist.

== Biography ==
Reghini edited the journals ''Atanór'' (1924) and ''Ignis'' (1925) devoted to initiate studies, covering topics such as [[Pythagoreanism]], [[yoga]], Hebrew [[Cabalism]] and the [[Freemasonry]] of [[Alessandro Cagliostro]]. A circle of esotericists formed around these journals and adopted the name ''Gruppo di Ur''. The group's members included [[Julius Evola]] and the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophists]] [[Giovanni Colazza]] and [[Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesarò]]. From 1927 to 1928 the group published the monthly journal ''UR''.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke"&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. 2003. Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity. pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Reghini fell out with Evola and the ''Ur'' group in 1928; a major reason was Reghini's support for Freemasonry, which was not in line with the direction the journal had taken. Reghini left the editorial board and ''UR'' was discontinued. It was briefly replaced in 1929 by a journal named ''Krur'', without Reghini's involvement.&lt;ref name="furlong"&gt;Paul Furlong. 2011. Social and Political Thought of Julius Evola. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Reghini was opposed to Christianity, which he associated with [[modernity]] and [[egalitarianism]], and sought to establish a form of [[modern Paganism]] he called "''magia colta''", "cultured magic", which he drew from [[Hermeticism]] and [[Platonism]].&lt;ref name="furlong" /&gt; A critic of democracy and an advocate for the [[Social class in ancient Rome|ancient Roman aristocracy]], Reghini welcomed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]], which he associated with the ancient world. He wrote in ''Atanór'' in 1924 that he had anticipated the emergence of such a regime in Italy 15 years prior.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Reghini was an important influence on Evola during the years 1924 to 1930. He introduced Evola to the major texts on [[alchemy]], which became the basis for Evola's book ''The Hermetic Tradition'' (1931).&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke" /&gt; It was also through Reghini that Evola met [[René Guénon]], whose [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]] would have a profound impact on his thinking.&lt;ref name="furlong" /&gt; Reghini's journals and the works of the ''Ur'' group has influenced the development of Italic-Roman neopaganism and [[Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Davide Marré. 2008. "Tradizione Romana". ''L'Essenza del Neopaganesimo''. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bedeutung''''' is a quarterly magazine of [[philosophy]], [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]], [[art]] and [[literature]] published in the UK. The name 'bedeutung' comes from the German word which means 'meaning'.

==Publication==
''Bedeutung''  was started in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedeutung magazine|url=http://profileengine.com/groups/profile/432387998/bedeutung-magazine|work=Profile Engine|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is published four times a year. It features a number of essays by prominent philosophers, sociologists, authors, public intellectuals, thinkers, artists and curators on a range of topics that are overarched by a general theme that runs through the whole issue. Issue 1 was on the distinction between ''Nature &amp; Culture''. It has been suggested that the magazine should be read in the sequence that it is printed, as its structure gradually moves from abstract philosophical ('Philosophy' section) to more concrete and "journalistic" type of articles ('Current Affairs' section) leading, eventually, to the 'Art' section and closing with the 'Literature' section. 

The magazine has (already prior to the publication of the first issue) received a lot of attention from various academic and artistic sections, thanks to its combination of analytical thinking, provocative and controversial positions and its beautiful, elegant design. For example, on the first issue, and as it was announced on the magazine's website already months before the issue was out, the Editorship embraced a skeptical approach to environmentalism, illustrated by, amongst others, the interview with [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]], producer of [[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]. Despite that, however, the approach seems to have been sober enough, not to alienate readers but, instead, to engage them in an open debate.

The issue of the magazine themed "Human &amp; Divine" featured articles by the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Rowan Williams]], LSE political philosopher, [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], renowned atheist philosopher, [[A. C. Grayling]], LSE social scientist Nicos Mouzelis, an interview with anti-religion crusader [[Michel Onfray]] and features the Austrian actionist artist [[Hermann Nitsch]], British artist Becky Beasley, [[Miuccia Prada]] protégé Martino Gamper and [[Warren Neidich]]. It also includes a piece by author Sarah Wood. The back cover features an extract by Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. According to the editorial, the second issue of the magazine sets out to defend the view that our idea of secularism bears significant conceptual resemblances with religious belief, in that it is based in faith, rather than objective knowledge.

The third issue of ''Bedeutung'', themed "Life &amp; Death", was announced on the magazine's website.

A '''centralized government'''  (also '''centralised government''' ([[Oxford spelling]])) is one in which [[Political power|power]] or [[Rational-legal authority|legal authority]] is exerted or coordinated by a ''[[de facto]]'' political executive to which [[Federated state|'''federal states''']], [[Local government|local authorities]], and smaller units are considered subject. In a national context, centralization occurs in the transfer of power to a typically [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] [[nation state]]. [[Menes]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|early dynastic period]], is credited by classical tradition with having united [[Upper and Lower Egypt]], and as the founder of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]] (Dynasty I), became the first ruler to institute a centralized government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = C | last = Williams | title = The Destruction of Black Civilization | publisher = Third World Press | place = Chicago | year = 1987 | page = 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Electoral district|constituted]] governments are, to some degree, necessarily centralized, in the sense that a theoretically federal state exerts an authority or prerogative beyond that of its constituent parts. To the extent that a base unit of society — usually conceived as an individual [[Citizenship|citizen]] — vests authority in a larger unit, such as the [[State (polity)|state]] or the local [[community]], authority is centralized. The extent to which this ought to occur, and the ways in which centralized government evolves, forms part of [[Social contract|social contract theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1996">A '''collapsing sequence''' occurs in human [[speech]] when utterance pairs between speakers have some unspoken thought occurring between them that may make the latter phrase, out of context, seem to have no logical connection to the former; there is, however, an implication that logical thought has occurred between the two phrases, so that the latter phrase will make sense based upon an assumption of its relation to the former.

==Examples==
Customer: ''What's chocolate filbert?''
:Clerk: ''We don't have any.''

The clerk's reply is in response to what he knows will come next in the [[discourse]]. If the clerk had proceeded to explain what chocolate filbert is, then it is possible that the customer would have asked for some. By explaining what the product is, the clerk would have tacitly implied that he had some to sell. Describing a product in a selling situation is often an implication that it is available. A waiter, for example, would not launch into a detailed description of a particular dish that a customer is inquiring about, only to end the discourse by then informing the customer that the dish is not available.

Another common collapsing sequence is illustrated below:

A. ''Do you smoke?''
B. ''I left them in my other jacket.''

This type of collapsing sequence speeds up social interaction by averting unnecessary explanations.

Collapsing sequences can be used in other situations as well, such as when someone joins a discussion already in progress:

''Hi, John. We were just talking about nursery schools.''

In the phrasing of this response, the speaker is either warning John not join the group, or is giving him orientation so that he can understand the context of the discussion and participate.

'''Commons-based peer production''' ('''CBPP''') is a term coined by [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Yochai Benkler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] |title=The Internet? We Built That |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/the-internet-we-built-that.html?src=dayp |quote=The Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler has called this phenomenon 'commons-based peer production'. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a new model of [[socioeconomic]] production in which large numbers of people work [[cooperative]]ly (usually over the [[Internet]]). [[Commons]]-based projects generally have less rigid [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical structures]] than those under more traditional business models. Often—but not always—commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors. For example, sharing of [[STL (file format)]] design files for objects freely on the internet enables anyone with a [[3-D printer]] to digitally replicate ([[distributed manufacture]]) the object&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/3d-printing-home-savings/ Using a 3D printer to print your household items could save you $12,000] - Digital Trends, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://insights.globalspec.com/article/4213/license-to-print-money-at-home License to Print Money at Home?]- Engineering360 IEEE GlobalSpec, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; saving the [[prosumer]] significant money.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Petersen  and J. Pearce. [http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/5/1/7 Emergence of Home Manufacturing in the Developed World: Return on Investment for Open-Source 3-D Printers]. ''Technologies'' 2017, 5(1), 7; doi:10.3390/technologies5010007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://all3dp.com/household-items-save-money/ All 3DP- -Could you save money with 3D printing?&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used interchangeably with the term '''social production'''.

==Overview==
[[File:The history of commons-based peer production communities (CBPP).svg|thumb|The history of commons-based [[peer production]] communities (by the P2Pvalue project)]]
Benkler contrasts [[commons]]-based [[peer production]] with [[business entity|firm production]], in which tasks are delegated based on a central [[decision-making]] process, and [[Market economy|market-based production]], in which allocating different prices to different tasks serves as an incentive to anyone interested in performing a task.

Benkler first introduced the term in his 2002 paper "Coase's Penguin, or Linux and the Nature of the Firm",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Coase's Penguin or [[Linux distribution|Linux]] and [[The nature of the firm]]'' 112 YALE L.J. 369 (2002), [http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/article/coase's-penguin,-or,-linux-and-the-nature-of-the-firm/ PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; whose title refers to the [[Linux mascot]] and to [[Ronald Coase]], who originated the transaction costs theory of the firm that provides the methodological template for the paper's analysis of peer production. The paper cites [[Eben Moglen]] as the originator of the concept.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In his book [[The Wealth of Networks]] (2006), Benkler significantly expands on his definition of commons-based peer production. According to Benkler, what distinguishes commons-based production is that it doesn't rely upon or propagate proprietary knowledge: "The inputs and outputs of the process are shared, freely or conditionally, in an institutional form that leaves them equally available for all to use as they choose at their individual discretion." To ensure that the knowledge generated is available for free use, commons-based projects are often shared under an [[open content|open license]].

Not all commons-based production necessarily qualifies as commons-based peer production. According to Benkler, peer production is defined not only by the openness of its outputs, but also by a decentralized, participant-driven working method of working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benkler |first=Yochai |date=2006 |title=The Wealth of Networks |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/wealth_of_networks/Main_Page |pages=73–74 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-11056-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer production enterprises have two primary advantages over traditional hierarchical approaches to production:

# [[Information gain]]: Peer production allows individuals to self-assign tasks that suit their own skills, expertise, and interests. Contributors can generate [[dynamic content]] that reflects the individual skills and the "variability of human creativity."
# Great variability of human and [[information resource (disambiguation)|information resources]]: leads to substantial increasing returns to scale to the number of people, and resources and projects that may be accomplished without need for a contract or other factor permitting the proper use of the resource for a project.&lt;ref&gt;Benkler, Yochai; [[Nissenbaum, Helen]] (2006). "Commons-based Peer Production and Virtue". The Journal of Political Philosophy. 4 (14): 394-419. Retrieved 22 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything|Wikinomics]]'', [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]] suggest an [[incentive]] mechanism behind common-based peer production. "People participate in peer production communities," they write, "for a wide range of intrinsic and self-interested reasons....basically, people who participate in peer production communities love it. They feel passionate about their particular area of expertise and revel in creating something new or better."&lt;ref&gt;Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything (2006), by Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, Portfolio Books, p 70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron Krowne]] offers another definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;commons-based peer production refers to any coordinated, (chiefly) internet-based effort whereby volunteers contribute project components, and there exists some process to combine them to produce a unified intellectual work. CBPP covers many different types of intellectual output, from software to libraries of quantitative data to [[human-readable]] documents (manuals, books, encyclopedias, reviews, blogs, periodicals, and more).&lt;ref&gt;Krowne, Aaron (March 1, 2005). "[http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/free_issues/issue_02/fud_based_encyclopedia/ The FUD based encyclopedia: Dismantling the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt aimed at Wikipedia and other free knowledge sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209143550/http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/free_issues/issue_02/fud_based_encyclopedia/ |date=2006-02-09 }}. ''[[Free Software Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Principles ==
First, the potential goals of peer production must be [[modular]]. In other words, objectives must be divisible into components, or modules, each of which can be independently produced. That allows participants to work asynchronously, without having to wait for each other's contributions or coordinate with each other in person.&lt;ref name=Yochai&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benkler |first=Yochai |author2=Nissenbaum, Helen |title=Commons-based Peer Production and Virtue |journal=The Journal of Political Philosophy |year=2006 |volume=(14) |series=4 |pages=394–419 |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/jopp_235.pdf |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the [[granularity]] of the modules is essential. Granularity refers to the degree to which objects are broken down into smaller pieces (module size).&lt;ref name="Yochai" /&gt;  Different levels of granularity will allow people with different levels of motivation to work together by contributing small or large grained modules, consistent with their level of interest in the project and their motivation.&lt;ref name="Yochai" /&gt;

Third, a successful peer-production enterprise must have low-cost [[Enterprise integration|integration]]—the mechanism by which the modules are integrated into a whole end product. Thus, integration must include both quality controls over the modules and a mechanism for integrating the contributions into the finished product at relatively low cost.&lt;ref name="Yochai" /&gt;

== Outgrowths ==
Several outgrowths have been:

* Customization/Specialization: With [[free and open-source software]] small groups have the capability to customize a large project according to specific needs. With the rise of low-cost [[3-D printing]], and other digital manufacturing techniques this is now also becoming true of [[open source hardware]].
* Longevity: Once code is released under a [[copyleft]] [[free software license]] it is almost impossible to remove it from the public domain.
* Cross-fertilization: Experts in a field can work on more than one project with no legal hassles.
* Technology Revisions: A core technology gives rise to new implementations of existing projects.
* Technology Clustering: Groups of products tend to cluster around a core set of technology and integrate with one another.

Interrelated concepts to Commons-based peer production are the processes of peer governance and peer property. To begin with, peer governance is a new mode of governance and [[bottom-up (finance)|bottom-up]] mode of [[participative decision-making]] that is being experimented in peer projects, such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[FLOSS]]; thus peer governance is the way that peer production, the process in which common value is produced, is managed.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilis Kostakis (2010): ''[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2613/2479 Peer governance and Wikipedia]''. In: First Monday 3-1(15)&lt;/ref&gt; Peer Property indicates the innovative nature of legal forms such as the General Public License, the Creative Commons, etc. Whereas traditional forms of property are exclusionary ("if it is mine, it is not yours"), peer property forms are inclusionary. It is from all of us, i.e. also for you, provided you respect the basic rules laid out in the license, such as the openness of the source code for example.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Bauwens (2005): ''[http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499 The Political Economy of Peer Production]''. In: Ctheory&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease of entering and leaving an organization is a feature of [[adhocracy|adhocracies]].

The principle of commons-based peer production is similar to [[collective invention]], a model of [[Open Innovation|open innovation]] in economics coined by Robert Allen.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Allen (1983): ''[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeborg/v4y1983i1p1-24.html Collective invention]''. In: Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization 4(1), p. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Magrassi|Magrassi, P.]] (2010). ''[http://www.academic-conferences.org/pdfs/ICICKM10-Booklet.pdf Free and Open-Source Software is not an Emerging Property but Rather the Result of Studied Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112100704/http://academic-conferences.org/pdfs/ICICKM10-Booklet.pdf |date=2010-11-12 }}" Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management &amp; Organisational Learning, Hong Kong Polytechnic, Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the commons-based peer production (CBPP) vision, while powerful and groundbreaking, needs to be strengthened at its root because of some allegedly wrong assumptions concerning [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS).

The CBPP literature regularly and explicitly quotes FOSS products as examples of artifacts "emerging" by virtue of mere cooperation, with no need for supervising leadership (without "market signals or managerial commands", in Benkler’s words).

It can be argued, however, that in the development of any less than trivial piece of software, irrespective of whether it be FOSS or proprietary, a subset of the (many) participants always play—explicitly and deliberately—the role of leading system and subsystem designers, determining architecture and functionality, while most of the people work “underneath” them in a logical, functional sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Magrassi|Magrassi, P.]] (2010).

{{Wikiquote}}'''Consent''' occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/39517?rskey=7YN1Zi&amp;result=1#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a term of common speech, but may have more specific definitions in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships.  

Types of consent include [[implied consent]], expressed consent, [[informed consent]] and [[unanimous consent]].  Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its  everyday meaning. For example, a person with a [[mental disorder]], a low [[mental age]], or under the legal [[age of sexual consent]] may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law. UN agencies and initiatives in sex education programs believe that teaching the topic of consent as part of a [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*[[Implied consent]] is a form of consent which is not expressly granted by a person, but rather inferred from a person's actions and the facts and circumstances of a particular situation (or in some cases, by a person's silence or inaction). Some examples include implied consent to follow rules and/or regulations at an education institution and the implied consent to physical contact by participants in a hockey game.
*Expressed consent is clearly and unmistakably stated, rather than implied. It may be given in [[writing]], by [[spoken words|speech]] (orally), or [[nonverbal communication|non-verbally]], e.g. by a clear gesture such as a nod. Non-written express consent not evidenced by witnesses or an audio or video recording may be disputed if a [[Party (law)|party]] denies that it was given.
*[[Informed consent]] in medicine is consent given by a person who has a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and future consequences of an action. The term is also used in other contexts, such as in social scientific research, when participants are asked to affirm that they understand the research procedure and consent to it.
*[[Unanimous consent]], or general consent, by a group of several parties (e.g., an [[Voluntary association|association]]) is consent given by all parties.
*Substituted consent, or the substituted judgment doctrine, allows a decision maker to attempt to establish the decision an incompetent person would have made if he or she were competent.&lt;ref name="sub"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan |date=2011 |title=Black's Law Dictionary |url= |location= |publisher=West Publishing Co. |page=726 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tort==
{{Main|Tort}}
Consent can be either expressed or implied. For example, participation in a [[contact sport]] usually implies consent to a degree of contact with other participants, implicitly agreed and often defined by the rules of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4200680.stm  Example of permitted and regulated contact in sport - BBC Sport: Rugby Union: "... you can tackle an opponent in order to get the ball, as long as you stay within the rules."]&lt;/ref&gt; Another specific example is where a boxer cannot complain of being punched on the nose by an opponent; implied consent will be valid where the violence is '''ordinarily and reasonably to be contemplated as incidental to the sport in question'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1976|litigants=Pallante v Stadiums Pty Ltd (No 1) |parallelcite=[1976] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 331 at 339 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Express consent exists when there is oral or written agreement, particularly in a contract. For example, businesses may require that persons [[Digital signature|sign]] a [[waiver]] (called a [[liability waiver]]) acknowledging and accepting the hazards of an activity. This proves express consent, and prevents the person from filing a [[tort]] lawsuit for unauthorised actions.

In [[English law]], the principle of ''[[volenti non fit injuria]]'' applies not only to participants in sport, but also to spectators and to any others who willingly engage in activities where there is a risk of injury. Consent has also been used as a defense in cases involving [[Death during consensual sex|accidental deaths during sex]], which occur during [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' (May 23, 1988) referred to this latter example, as the "''rough-sex defense''". It is not effective in English law in cases of serious injury or death.

As a term of jurisprudence prior provision of consent signifies a possible defence (an [[excuse]] or justification) against civil or criminal liability. [[Defendant]]s who use this [[defense (legal)|defense]] are arguing that they should not be held [[legal liability|liable]] for a tort or a [[crime]], since the [[action (philosophy)|actions]] in question took place with the plaintiff or "victim's" prior consent and permission.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Medicine==
{{see also| Informed consent}}

The question of consent is important in medical law. For example, a medical practitioner may be liable for harm to a patient by a procedure which was not consented to. There are [[Doe ex. rel. Tarlow v. District of Columbia|exemptions]], such as when the patient is unable to give consent.&lt;ref name="sub"/&gt;

Also, a medical practitioner must explain the significant risks of a procedure (those that might change the patient's mind about whether or not to have it) before the patient can give binding consent. This was explored in Australia in ''Rogers v Whitaker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|58|1992|litigants=Rogers v Whitaker |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a practitioner does not explain a material risk that subsequently eventuates, then that is considered negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Chester v Afshar]] |year=2004 |court=UKHL |num=41 |parallelcite= [2005] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 134 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These material risks include the loss of chance of a better result if a more experienced surgeon had performed the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1998|litigants=Chappel v Hart |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 232 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[UK]], a [[Supreme Court]] judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board |courtname=auto|juris=Scotland |court=UKSC |year=2015 |num=11 |parallelcite=[2015] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; modernised the law on consent and introduced a patient-focused test to UK law: allowing the patient rather than the medical professionals to decide upon the level of risk they wish to take in terms of a particular course of action, given all the information available.  This change reflects the Guidance of the General Medical Council on the requirement to consent patients, and removes the rule of medical paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court decision changes doctor-patient relationship forever - Balfour+Manson|url=https://www.balfour-manson.co.uk/news-plus-events/news/2015/03/mothers-landmark-court-win-changes-doctor-patient-relationship-forever/|website=www.balfour-manson.co.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social science research ==
[[Social science|Social scientists]] are generally required to obtain informed consent from [[Research participant|research participants]] before asking interview questions or conducting an experiment. Federal law governs social science research that involves [[Human subject research|human subjects]], and tasks [[Institutional review board|institutional review boards]] (IRBs) at universities, federal or state agencies, and tribal organizations to oversee social science research that involves human subjects and to make decisions about whether or not informed consent is necessary for a social scientific study to go forward. Informed consent in this context generally means explaining the study's purpose to research participants and obtaining a signed or verbal affirmation that the study participants understand the procedures to be used and to consent to participate in the study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51-55}} 

Some types of social scientific research, such as psychological experiments, may use deception as part of the study; in these cases, researchers may not fully describe the procedures to participants, and thus participants are not fully informed. However, researchers are required to debrief participants immediately after the experiment is concluded. Certain populations are considered to be vulnerable, and in addition to informed consent, special protections must be made available to them. These include persons who are incarcerated, pregnant women, persons with disabilities, and persons who have a mental disability. Children are considered unable to provide informed consent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/890179806|title=Making sense of the social world: methods of investigation|last=Chambliss|first=Daniel F.|last2=Schutt|first2=Russell K.|publisher=Sage|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781483380612|edition=Fifth|location=Los Angeles|pages=|oclc=890179806}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51-55}}

==Planning law==
Some countries, such as [[New Zealand]] with its [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] and its [[Building Act]], use the term "consent" for the legal process that provide planning permission for developments like subdivisions, bridges or buildings. Achieving permission results in getting "Resource consent" or "Building consent".

==Sexual activity==

{{see also| Sexual consent|Rape#Consent|Consent (criminal law)}}

In Canada "consent means…the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity" without abuse or exploitation of "trust, power or authority", coercion or threats.&lt;ref name=canadiancriminalcode&gt;{{cite journal|last=Criminal Code|first=Canadian|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-137.html#docCont|title=‘Canadian Criminal Code’|date=2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Consent can also be revoked at any moment.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=David S.|title=‘Consent for Sexual Behavior in a College Student Population’|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|date=10 August 1998|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual consent plays an important role in defining what sexual assault is, since [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] without consent by all parties is considered [[rape]].&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beres. A|first=Melanie|title='Spontaneous' Sexual Consent: An Analysis of Sexual Consent Literature|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|date=18 January 2007|volume=17|issue=93|page=93|doi=10.1177/0959353507072914}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that we must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than "no means no" or "yes means yes".&lt;ref name=PINEAU&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pineau|first=Lois|title=‘Date Rape: A Feminist Analysis’|journal=Law and Philosophy|year=1989|volume=8|issue=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. "Consent is good, joyous, sexy": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of "yes means yes" and affirmative models, such as Hall's definition: "the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment."&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be "free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness' to engage in sexual activity."&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, S.E. and Muehlenhard, C.L. (1999) '"By the Semi-mystical Appearance of a Condom": How Young Women and Men Communicate Sexual Consent in Heterosexual Situations', The Journal of Sex Research 36: 258–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the "yes means yes", or in the "no means no", model.&lt;ref name=Roffee&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137476159_5|title=Roffee James A., ‘When Yes Actually Means Yes: Confusing Messages and Criminalising Consent’ in Rape Justice: Beyond the Criminal Law eds. Powell A., Henry N., and Flynn A., Palgrave, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals are unable to give consent. Children or [[Minor (law)|minors]] below a certain age, the [[Age of consent|age of sexual consent]] in that [[jurisdiction]], are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. Likewise, persons with [[Alzheimer's disease]] or similar disabilities may be unable to give [[Consent (criminal law)|legal consent]] to sexual relations even with their spouse.&lt;ref name=NYT42215&gt;{{cite news|author1=Pam Belluck|title=Iowa Man Found Not Guilty of Sexually Abusing Wife With Alzheimer’s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/health/iowa-man-found-not-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-wife-with-alzheimers.html|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within literature, definitions surrounding consent and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus.&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres/&gt; Roffee argued that legal definition needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrated how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023|title= No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights| volume=14 | journal=Human Rights Law Review|pages=541–572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964663913502068?legid=spsls%3B23%2F1%2F113&amp;patientinform-links=yes|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour’s Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some children under the legal age of consent may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However the law does not view this as legitimate. Whilst there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

Initiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula.  In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on "consensual sexual relationships," "the meaning and importance of consent" as well as "[[rape myth]]s".&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title='Plans for sexual consent lessons in schools 'do not go far enough''|date=9 March 2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school’s policies.&lt;ref name=consentpolicy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication.&lt;ref name=CAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rushowy|first=Kristin|url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2015/02/25/in-ontario-sex-ed-consent-the-hot-issue.html|title=‘In Ontario sex ed, consent the hot issue’|date=25 February 2015}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. "Consent is good, joyous, sexy": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affirmative consent===
Affirmative consent (enthusiastic yes) is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures.&lt;ref name=Grinberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;"...affirmative consent standards have been adopted at colleges across the nation, including every ivy league university except Harvard. "Affirmative consent: A primer"  Christine Emba ''Washington Post'' Oct 12 2015 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/12/affirmative-consent-a-primer/&lt;/ref&gt; which describe consent as an "affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity." According to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., "Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing." Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity ("Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity," a university policy reads).&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.

There are 3 pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or "the way we let others know what we're up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex."

They are:

# Knowing exactly what and how much I'm agreeing to
# Expressing my intent to participate
# Deciding freely and voluntarily to participate&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

To obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say "no", one gives and seeks an explicit "yes". This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. "There's varying language, but the language gets to the core of people having to communicate their affirmation to participate in sexual behavior," said Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; "It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about sexual assault. It's requiring us to say women and men should be mutually agreeing and actively participating in sexual behavior."&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4382">{{UStaxation}}
The '''Doctrine of Cash Equivalence''' states that the [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax law]] treats certain non-cash payment transactions like cash payment transactions for federal income tax purposes.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite
|first=Samuel A.|last=Donaldson
|title=Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials
|edition=2nd
|date=2007
|page=364
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is used most often for deciding when cash method (as opposed to [[accrual method]]) taxpayers are to include certain non-cash income items.  Another doctrine often used when trying to determine the timing of the inclusion of income is the [[constructive receipt]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Most individuals begin as [[cash method]] taxpayers because their first form of bookkeeping is a checkbook.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some businesses start as accrual method taxpayers because businesses use different rules for recording income and expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 446(a) states, however, that  "[t]axable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages to the cash method of accounting is the ability to defer taxation because the recognition of income applicable to amounts in accounts receivable can be deferred to a later year.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Doctrine of Cash Equivalence''' is important because many people are cash method taxpayers and would be subject to this rule.

==Elements==
Cash method taxpayers include income items (cash and cash equivalents) in the year the items are received.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; See also Treasury Regulations &lt;ref&gt;§ 1.446-1(c)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain payment transactions involve cash equivalents, such as receipts of checks and credit card payments. The cash equivalence doctrine arose out of a need to determine whether certain items that were either actually or constructively received must be accrued as income. A dispute over timing of income recognition for tax purposes may arise when the thing received is really not much more than a promise of payment, such as a promissory note or a bond. If mere promises to pay were considered cash equivalents, then there would be little difference between the cash and accrual methods for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] established the standard for applying the cash equivalence doctrine to promises of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Cowden v. Commissioner |vol=289 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=20 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |date=1961 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/253663/frank-cowden-sr-and-wife-gladys-cowden-petitioner-respondent-v/ |accessdate=2017-10-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court first noted that the principle that "[a] [[promissory note]], negotiable in form, is not necessarily the equivalent of cash" remains true.&lt;ref name="cc24"&gt;''Cowden v Commissioner'', 289 F.2d at 24.&lt;/ref&gt; But that principle also has a true inverse—that a non-[[negotiable instrument]] can be a cash equivalent if the following factors are met.&lt;ref name="cc24"/&gt; A promise to pay will be considered a cash equivalent for cash method taxpayers if:

# the promise to pay is unconditional;
# the promise is made by a solvent person;
# the promise is assignable;
# the promise is not subject to set-offs; and
# the promise is marketable.&lt;ref name="cc24"/&gt;

Since taxpayers generally prefer to defer recognition of income to subsequent tax years (due to the [[time value of money]]), a finding of cash equivalence will typically be to the disadvantage of the individual taxpayer.

==Mechanics==
To use the doctrine of cash equivalence, a taxpayer must have either actually received an item, or constructively received an item. If either of these situations exist, a taxpayer must determine whether the item received is cash equivalence, using the six factors described in Cowden v. Commissioner. If the item is deemed cash equivalent, then the taxpayer has income. If it is not cash equivalent, the taxpayer does not have income.

{{Ashoka Edicts articles}}
The '''Edicts of Ashoka''' are a collection of more than thirty inscriptions on the [[Pillars of Ashoka|pillars]] as well as boulders and cave walls, made by Emperor [[Ashoka]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]] during his reign, from 268 BCE to 232 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Phuoc 2009, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka used the expression ''Dhaṃma [[Lipi]]'' ([[Prakrit]] in the [[Brahmi script]]: [[wikt:𑀥𑀁𑀫𑀮𑀺𑀧𑀺|𑀥𑀁𑀫𑀮𑀺𑀧𑀺]], "Inscriptions of the [[Dharma]]") to describe his own Edicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131711200 |page=351 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA351 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], and provide the first tangible evidence of [[Buddhism]]. The edicts describe in detail Ashoka's view about [[Ashoka's policy of Dhamma|dhamma]], an earnest attempt to solve some of the problems that a complex society faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-ashokan-rock-edicts-are-a-marvel-of-history/20170808.htm?sc_cid=twshare|title='The Ashokan rock edicts are a marvel of history'}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the edicts, the extent of Buddhist proselytism during this period reached as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and many Buddhist monuments were created.

These inscriptions proclaim Ashoka's adherence to the Buddhist philosophy which, as in [[Hinduism]], is called [[dharma]], "Law". The inscriptions show his efforts to develop the Buddhist dharma throughout his kingdom. Although Buddhism as well as [[Gautama Buddha]] are mentioned, the edicts focus on social and moral precepts rather than specific religious practices or the philosophical dimension of Buddhism. These were located in public places and were meant for people to read.

In these inscriptions, Ashoka refers to himself as "Beloved of the Gods" (''[[Devanampiya]]''). The identification of Devanampiya with Ashoka was confirmed by an inscription discovered in 1915 by C. Beadon, a British gold-mining engineer, at [[Maski]], a village in [[Raichur district]] of [[Karnataka]]. Another minor rock edict, found at the village [[Commons:Category:Ashoka Minor Rock Edict, Gujarra|Gujarra]] in [[Datia district]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]], also used the name of Ashoka together with his titles: "''Devanampiya [[Priyadasi|Piyadasi]] Asokaraja''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malalasekera |first1=Gunapala Piyasena |title=Encyclopaedia of Buddhism |date=1990 |publisher=Government of Ceylon |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdwKAAAAYAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions found in the central and eastern part of India were written in [[Magadhi Prakrit]] using the [[Brahmi script]], while [[Prakrit]] using the [[Kharoshthi]] script, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]] were used in the northwest. These edicts were deciphered by British [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and historian [[James Prinsep]].&lt;ref name=RS208/&gt;

The inscriptions revolve around a few recurring themes: Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, the description of his efforts to spread Buddhism, his moral and religious precepts, and his social and [[animal welfare]] program.The edicts were based on Ashoka's ideas on administration and behaviour of people towards one  another  and religion.

Besides a few inscriptions in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (which were only discovered in the 20th century), the Edicts were mostly written in the [[Brahmi script]] and sometimes in the [[Kharoshthi script]] in the northwest, two Indian scripts which had both become extinct around the 5th century CE, and were yet undeciphered at the time the Edicts were discovered and investigated in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |pages=204-206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA204 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RHP/&gt;
 
The first successful attempts at deciphering the ancient [[Brahmi script]] were made in 1836 by Norwegian scholar [[Christian Lassen]], who used the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]] to correctly and securely identify several Brahmi letters.&lt;ref name=RHP&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ray |first1=Himanshu Prabha |title=Buddhism and Gandhara: An Archaeology of Museum Collections |date=2017 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9781351252744 |page=181 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiBBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task was then completed by [[James Prinsep]], an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the [[East India Company]], who was able to identify the rest of the Brahmi characters, with the help of [[Major Cunningham]].&lt;ref name=RHP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_sanchi_detail.asp More details about Buddhist monuments at Sanchi], Archaeological Survey of India, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of results that he published in March 1838 Prinsep was able to translate the inscriptions on a large number of rock edicts found around India, and to provide, according to [[Richard G. Salomon (academic)|Richard Salomon]], a "virtually perfect" rendering of the full Brahmi alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. |date=1838 |publisher=Calcutta : Printed at the Baptist Mission Press [etc.] |pages=219-285 |url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic775asia#page/n51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RS208&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |page=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA206 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edicts in [[Brahmi script]] mentioned a King [[Devanampriya]] Piyadasi which Prinsep initially assumed was a Sri Lankan king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic62asia#page/566/mode/1up|title=Interpretation of the most ancient of inscriptions on the pillar called lat of Feroz Shah, near Delhi, and of the Allahabad, Radhia and Mattiah pillar, or lat inscriptions which agree therewith|author=Prinsep, J|pages=566–609|year=1837|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then able to associate this title with Asoka on the basis of [[Pali script]] from Sri Lanka communicated to him by [[George Turnour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic62asia#page/790/mode/1up/|title=Further elucidation of the lat or Silasthambha inscriptions from various sources|author=Prinsep, J.|pages=790–797|journal=Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of London|year=1837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Note on the Facsimiles of the various Inscriptions on the ancient column at Allahabad, retaken by Captain Edward Smith, Engineers.|author=Prinsep, J|pages=963–980|year=1837|journal=Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal|volume =6|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic62asia#page/963/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edicts are divided into four categories, according to their size (Minor or Major) and according to their medium (Rock or Pillar). Chronologically, the minor inscriptions tend to precede the larger ones, while rock inscriptions generally seem to have been started earlier than the pillar inscriptions:
* [[Minor Rock Edicts]]: Edicts inscribed at the beginning of Ashoka's reign; in [[Prakrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]].
* [[Minor Pillar Edicts]]: Schism Edict, Queen's Edict, [[Rummindei]] Edict, [[Nigali Sagar]] Edict; in [[Prakrit]].
* [[Major Rock Edicts]]: 14 Edicts (termed 1st to 14th) and 2 separate ones found in [[Odisha]]; in [[Prakrit]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].
* [[Major Pillar Edicts]]: 7 Edicts, inscribed at the end of Ashoka's reign; in [[Prakrit]].

;General content
The [[Minor Rock Edicts]] (in which Ashoka is sometimes named in person, as in [[Maski]] and [[:Commons:Category:Ashoka Minor Rock Edict, Gujarra|Gujarra]]) as well as the [[Minor Pillar Edicts]] are very religious in their content: they mention extensively the [[Buddha]] (and even previous Buddhas as in the [[Nigali Sagar]] inscription), the [[Samgha]], Buddhism and Buddhist scriptures (as in the [[Bairat Temple|Bairat]] Edict).&lt;ref name=SDK/&gt; 

On the contrary, the [[Major Rock Edicts]] and [[Major Pillar Edicts]] are essentially moral and political in nature: they never mention the Buddha or explicit Buddhist teachings, but are preoccupied with order, proper behaviour and non violence under the general concept of "[[Dharma]]", and they also focus on the administration of the state and positive relations with foreign countries as far as the [[Hellenistic]] [[Mediterranean]] of the mid-3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name=SDK&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kulkarni |first1=S.

===Minor Rock Edicts===
{{main|Minor Rock Edicts}}
The [[Minor Rock Edicts]] of Ashoka (r.269-233 BCE) are rock inscriptions which form the earliest part of the Edicts of Ashoka. They predate [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edicts]]. 

Chronologically, the first known edict, usually classified as a Minor Rock Edict, is the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]], in Greek and in Aramaic, written in the 10th year of his reign (260 BCE) at the border of his empire with the [[Hellenistic world]], in the city of [[Old Kandahar]] in modern [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name = "DC"&gt; India: An Archaeological History: Palaeolithic Beginnings to Early ... by Dilip K. Chakrabarty [https://books.google.com/books?id=wPQtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT395 {{p.|395}}] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Inscriptions Of Asoka, E.Hultzsch, 1925 [https://archive.org/stream/InscriptionsOfAsoka.NewEditionByE.Hultzsch/HultzschCorpusAsoka]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valeri P.

[[File:Rock_edict-_closer_look.JPG|thumb|left|Minor Rock Edict from [[Maski]]. It specifically mentions the name "Asoka" ([[File:Ashoka_in_Brahmi_script.jpg|30px]], center of the top line) in conjonction with the title "Devanampriya" (Beloved-of-the-gods).]]
Ashoka then made the first edicts in the Indian language, written in the [[Brahmi]] script, from the 11th year of his reign (according to his own inscription, "two and a half years after becoming a secular Buddhist", ie two and a half years at least after returning from the [[Kalinga war|Kalinga conquest]] of the eighth year of his reign, which is the starting point for his remorse towards the horrors of the war, and his gradual conversion to Buddhism). The texts of the inscriptions are rather short, the technical quality of the engraving of the inscriptions is generally very poor, and generally very inferior to the pillar edicts dated to the years 26 and 27 of Ashoka's reign.&lt;ref&gt; [[John Irwin (curator)|John Irwin]], [https://www.scribd.com/document/136703111/Chronology-of-Asokan-Pillars "The True Chronology of Aśokan Pillars"], in:''[[Artibus Asiae]]'', Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), {{p.|247-265}} &lt;/ref&gt;

There are several slight variations in the content of these edicts, depending on location, but a common designation is usually used, with Minor Rock Edict N°1 (MRE1)&lt;ref&gt;Minor Rock Edict 1 &lt;/ref&gt; and a Minor Rock Edict N°2 (MRE2, which does not appear alone but always in combination with Edict N°1), the different versions being generally aggregated in most translations. The [[Maski]] version of Minor Rock Edict No.1 is historically particularly important in that it confirmed the association of the title "[[Devanampriya]]" with the name "Asoka", thereby clarifying the historical author of all these inscriptions.&lt;ref name=CSH&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Shorter History of India |publisher=CUP Archive |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_48AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=Subhadra Sen |title=Ashoka |date=2009 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=9788184758078 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5ru08et_ZAC&amp;pg=PT13 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[:Commons:Category:Ashoka Minor Rock Edict, Gujarra|Gujarra]] version of Minor Rock Edict No.1 also, the name of Ashoka is used together with his full title: ''[[Devanampriya|Devanampiya]] [[Priyadasi|Piyadasi]] Asoka[[raja]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malalasekera |first1=Gunapala Piyasena |title=Encyclopaedia of Buddhism |date=1990 |publisher=Government of Ceylon |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdwKAAAAYAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a unique Minor Rock Edict No.3, discovered next to [[Bairat Temple]], for the Buddhist clergy, which gives a list of Buddhist scriptures (most of them unknown today) which the clergy should study regularly.&lt;ref&gt; Inscriptions of Asoka by DC Sircar [https://books.google.com/books?id=1_omDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32 p.32-22] &lt;/ref&gt; 

A few other inscriptions of Ashoka in [[Aramaic]], which are not strictly edicts, but tend to share a similar content, are sometimes also categorized as "Minor Rock Edicts". The dedicatory inscriptions of the [[Barabar caves]] are also sometimes classified among the Minor Rock Edicts of Ashoka.

The Minor Rock Edicts can be found throughout the territory of Ashoka, including in the frontier area near the [[Hindu Kush]], and are especially numerous in the southern, newly conquered, frontier areas of [[Karnataka]] and southern [[Andhra Pradesh]].

===Minor Pillar Edicts===
{{main|Minor Pillar Edicts}}
{{double image|right|Brahmi script on Ashoka Pillar, Sarnath.jpg|269|Sarnath capital.jpg|100|Minor Pillar Edict on the [[Sarnath]] [[pillar of Ashoka]], and the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] which crowned it.}}
The [[Minor Pillar Edicts]] of Ashoka refer to 5 separate minor Edicts inscribed on columns, the [[Pillars of Ashoka]].&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/indianart/pdf/asoka_thapar.pdf|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi|title= Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas|author=Romila Thapar|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These edicts are preceded chronologically by the Minor Rock Edicts and may have been made in parallel with the Major Rock Edicts. 

The inscription technique is generally very poor compared for example to the later [[Major Pillar Edicts]], however the Minor Pillar Edicts are often associated with some of the artistically most sophisticated pillar capitals of Ashoka, such as the renowned [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] which crowned the [[Sarnath]] Minor Pillar Edict, or the very similar, but less well preserved [[Sanchi]] lion [[capital (architecture)|capital]] which crowned the very clumsily inscribed Schism Edict of Sanchi.&lt;ref name=JI/&gt; According to Irwin, the Brahmi inscriptions on the Sarnath and Sanchi pillars were made by inexperienced Indian engravers at a time when stone engraving was still new in India, whereas the very refined Sarnath capital itself was made under the tutelage of crafstmen from the former [[Achaemenid Empire]], trained in Perso-Hellenistic statuary and employed by Ashoka.&lt;ref name=JI264&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irwin |first1=John |title=The True Chronology of Aśokan Pillars |date=1983 |pages=250&amp;264 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3249612}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the most sophisticated capitals were actually the earliest in the sequence of [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashokan pillars]] and that style degraded over a short period of time.&lt;ref name=JI&gt;The True Chronology of Aśokan Pillars, John Irwin, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), pp. 264 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3249612?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt;

These edicts were probably made at the beginning of the reign of Ashoka (reigned 268-232&amp;nbsp;BCE), from the year 12 of his reign, that is, from 256&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yailenko |first1=Valeri P. |title=Les maximes delphiques d'Aï Khanoum et la formation de la doctrine du dhamma d'Asoka |date=1990 |pages=239–256 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/dha_0755-7256_1990_num_16_1_1467 |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minor Pillar Edicts are the Schism Edict, warning of punishment for dissent in the [[Samgha]], the Queen's Edict, and the [[Rummindei]] Edict as well as the [[Nigali Sagar]] Edict which record Ashoka's visits and Buddhist dedications in the area corresponding to today's [[Nepal]]. The Rummindei and Nigali Sagar edicts, inscribed on pillars erected by Ashoka later in his reign (19th and 20th year) display a high level of inscriptional technique with a good regularity in the lettering.&lt;ref name=JI264/&gt;

The [[Major Rock Edicts]] of [[Ashoka]] refer to 14 separate major Edicts, which are significantly detailed and extensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/this-excerpt-from-a-new-book-demolishes-emperor-ashoka-reputation-as-a-pacifist/story-puxXlUpPsDy4TqELZ3UonN.html|title=This excerpt from a new book demolishes Emperor Ashoka’s reputation as a pacifist}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Edicts were concerned with practical instructions in running the kingdom such as the design of irrigation systems and descriptions of Ashoka's beliefs in peaceful moral behavior.

Three languages were used, [[Prakrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The edicts are composed in [[Grammar|non-standardized]] and archaic forms of [[Prakrit]]. Prakrit inscriptions were written in [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmi]] and [[Kharosthi]] scripts, which even a commoner could read and understand. The inscriptions found in the area of Pakistan are in the [[Kharoshthi]] script. Other Edicts are written in Greek or Aramaic. The [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka]] (including portions of Edict No.13 and No.14) is in Greek only, and originally probably contained all the Major Rock Edicts 1-14.&lt;ref name="persee.fr"&gt;Une nouvelle inscription grecque d'Açoka, Schlumberger, Daniel, Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Année 1964  Volume 108  Numéro 1  pp. 126-140 [http://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_1964_num_108_1_11695]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Major Rock Edicts of Ashoka are inscribed on large rocks, except for the Kandahar version in Greek ([[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka]]), written on a stone plaque belonging to a building. The Major Edicts are not located in the heartland of Mauryan territory, traditionally centered on [[Bihar]], but on the frontiers of the territory controlled by Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;"Fourteen Major Rock Edicts have been discovered at seven places along the borders of the territory that Asoka controlled" {{cite book |last1=Hirakawa |first1=Akira |title=A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna |date=1993 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120809550 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjjwjC7rcOYC&amp;pg=PA96 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These edicts are preceded chronologically by the Minor Rock Edicts and the Major Rock Edicts, and constitute the most technically elegant of the inscriptions made by Ashoka. They were made at the end of his reign, from the years 26 and 27 of his reign, that is, from 237-236 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yailenko |first1=Valeri P. |title=Les maximes delphiques d'Aï Khanoum et la formation de la doctrine du dhamma d'Asoka |date=1990 |pages=239–256 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/dha_0755-7256_1990_num_16_1_1467 |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically they follow the fall of [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] power in [[Central Asia]] and the related rise of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the independent [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] circa 250 BCE. Hellenistic rulers are not mentioned anymore in these last edicts, as they only appear in [[Major Rock Edict]] No.13 (and to a lesser extent Major Rock Edict No.2), which can be dated to about the 14th year of the reign of Ashoka circa 256-255.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thapar |first1=Romila |title=Aśoka and the Decline of the Mauryas |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199088683 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoAyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT90 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Major Pillar Edicts (Edict No.7) is testamental in nature, making a summary of the accomplishments of Ashoka during his life.

The Major Pillar Edicts of Ashoka were exclusively inscribed on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] or fragments thereof, at [[Kausambi]] (now [[Allahabad pillar]]), [[Topra Kalan]], [[Ashokan Edicts in Delhi|Meerut]], [[Lauriya Araraj|Lauriya-Araraj]], [[Lauria Nandangarh]], [[Rampurva]] ([[Champaran]]), and fragments of these in Aramaic ([[Kandahar Aramaic inscription|Kandahar, Edict No.7]] and [[Pul-i-Darunteh Aramaic inscription|Pul-i-Darunteh, Edict No.5 or No.7]] in [[Afghanistan]])&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptions of Asoka de D.C.

Behrendt [https://books.google.com/books?id=C9_vbgkzUSkC&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]&lt;/ref&gt; However several pillars, such as the bull pillar of [[Rampurva]], or the pillar of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] do not have inscriptions, which, together with their lack of proper foundation stones and their particular style, led some authors to suggest that they were in fact pre-Ashokan.&lt;ref name=JI1983&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irwin |first1=John |title=The True Chronology of Aśokan Pillars |date=1983 |pages=247–265 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3249612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Irwin |first1=John |title='Aśokan' Pillars: A Re-Assessment of the Evidence - III: Capitals |date=1975 |page=631 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/878154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Major Pillar Edicts (excluding the two fragments of translations found in modern [[Afghanistan]]) are all located in central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hirakawa |first1=Akira |title=A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna |date=1993 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120809550 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjjwjC7rcOYC&amp;pg=PA96 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pillars of Ashoka are stylistically very close to an important Buddhist monument, also built by Ashoka in [[Bodh Gaya]], at the location where the [[Buddha]] had reached enlightenment some 200 years earlier: the [[Vajrasana, Bodh Gaya|Diamond Throne]].&lt;ref name="Ching"&gt;A Global History of Architecture, Francis D.

This led some authors to suggest that the artistic level under Ashoka tended to fall towards the end of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;The True Chronology of Aśokan Pillars, John Irwin, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1983), pp. 247-265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3249612?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages of the Edicts==
Three languages were used: [[Prakrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the language of the neighbouring [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom and the Greek communities in Ashoka's realm) and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (the official language of the former [[Achaemenid Empire]]). The Prakrit displayed local variations, from early [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]] in the northwest, to [[Ardhamagadhi Prakrit|Old Ardhamagadhi]] in the east, where it was the "Chancelly language" of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |pages=73-76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language level of the Prakrit inscriptions tends to be rather informal or colloquial.&lt;ref name=RS72/&gt; 
[[File:The four scripts of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|left|The four scripts used by Ashoka in his Edicts: [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] (top left), [[Kharoshthi]] (top right), [[Greek language|Greek]] (bottom left) and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (bottom right).]]
Four scripts were used. Prakrit inscriptions were written in the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmi]] and [[Kharosthi]] scripts, the latter for the area of modern Pakistan. The Greek and Aramaic inscriptions used their respective scripts, in the northwestern areas of Ashoka's territory, in modern [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].

While most Edicts were in Prakrit, a few were written in Greek or Aramaic. The [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription|Kandahar Rock Inscription]] is bilingual Greek-Aramaic. The [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka]] is in Greek only, and originally probably contained all the Major Rock Edicts 1-14. The Greek language used in the inscription is of a very high level and displays philosophical refinement. It also displays an in-depth understanding of the political language of the Hellenic world in the 3rd century BCE. This suggests the presence of a highly cultured Greek presence in Kandahar at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Une nouvelle inscription grecque d'Açoka, Schlumberger, Daniel, Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Année 1964  Volume 108  Numéro 1  pp. 136-140 [http://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_1964_num_108_1_11695]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in the rock edicts engraved in southern India in the newly conquered territories of [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], Ashoka only used the [[Prakrit]] of the North as the language of communication, with the [[Brahmi]] script, and not the local [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] idiom, which can be interpreted as a kind of authoritarianism in respect to the southern territories.&lt;ref name="SB"&gt; A Sourcebook of Indian Civilization published by Niharranjan Ray, Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zcyho16xzWEC&amp;pg=PA592 p.592] &lt;/ref&gt;

Ashoka's edicts were the first written inscriptions in India after the ancient city of [[Harrapa]] fell to ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content of the Edicts==
The Dharma preached by Ashoka is explained mainly in term of moral precepts, based on the doing of good deeds, respect for others, generosity and purity. The expressions used by Ashoka to express the Dharma, were the [[Prakrit]] word ''[[Dhamma|Dhaṃma]]'', the Greek word ''[[Eusebeia]]'' (in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] and the [[Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka]]), and the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Qsyt'' ("Truth") (in the [[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hiltebeitel |first1=Alf |title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195394238 |pages=36-37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC&amp;pg=PA36 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral precepts===
;Right behaviour

{{quote|Dharma is good. And what is Dharma? It is having few faults and many goods deeds, mercy, charity, truthfulness and purity. (Major Pillar Edict No.2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learn.columbia.edu/indianart/pdf/asoka_thapar.pdf|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi|title= Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas|author=Romila Thapar|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Thus the glory of Dhamma will increase throughout the world, and it will be endorsed in the form of mercy, charity, truthfulness, purity, gentleness, and virtue. (Major Pillar Edict No.7)&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;}}

;Benevolence
Ashoka's Dharma meant that he used his power to try to make life better for his people and he also tried to change the way people thought and lived. He also thought that dharma meant doing the right thing.

;Kindness to prisoners
Ashoka showed great concern for fairness in the exercise of [[justice]], caution and tolerance in the application of sentences, and regularly pardoned prisoners.

{{quote|But it is desirable that there should be uniformity in judicial procedure and punishment. This is my instruction from now on. Men who are imprisoned or sentenced to death are to be given three days respite. Thus their relations may plead for their lives, or, if there is no one to plead for them, they may make donations or undertake a fast for a better rebirth in the next life. For it is my wish that they should gain the next world. (Major Pillar Edict No.4)&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;}}

{{quote|In the period [from my consecration] to [the anniversary on which] I had been consecrated twenty-six years, twenty-five releases of prisoners have been made. (Major Pillar Edict No.5)&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;}}

;Respect for animal life

The Mauryan empire was the first Indian empire to unify the country and it had a clear-cut policy of exploiting as well as protecting natural resources with specific officials tasked with protection duty. When [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was perhaps the first ruler in history to advocate conservation measures for wildlife. Reference to these can be seen inscribed on the stone edicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofasiat1190507asia#page/n521/mode/2up|title = Animals in the inscriptions of Piyadasi| author=Chakravarti, Monmohan| pages=361–374|year=1906| journal=Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal| volume=1| issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IWH5"&gt;Rangarajan, M.

{{quote|This rescript on morality has been caused to be written by Devanampriya Priyadarsin. Here no living being must be killed and sacrificed. And also no festival meeting must be held. For king Devanampriya Priyadarsin sees much evil in festival meetings. 
And there are also some festival meetings which are considered meritorious by king Devanampriya Priyadarsin. Formerly in the kitchen of king Devanampriya Priyadarsin many hundred thousands of animals were killed daily for the sake of curry. But now, when this rescript on morality is caused to be written, then only three animals are being killed (daily), (viz.) two peacocks (and) one deer, but even this deer not regularly. But even these three animals shall not be killed (in future). (Major Rock Edict No.1)&lt;ref&gt;Translation by [[E. Hultzsch]] (1857-1927). Published in India in 1925.

{{quote|King Devanampriya Priyadansin speaks thus. (When I had been) anointed twenty-six years, the following animals were declared by me inviolable, viz. parrots, mainas, the aruna, ruddy geese, wild geese, the nandimukha, the gelata, bats, queen-ants, terrapins, boneless fish, the vedaveyaka, the Ganga-puputaka, skate-fish, tortoises and porcupines, squirrels (?), the srimara, bulls set at liberty, iguanas (?), the rhinoceros, white doves, domestic doves, (and) all the quadrupeds which are neither useful nor edible. Those [she-goats], ewes, and sows (which are) either with young or in milk, are inviolable, and also those (of their) young ones (which are) less than six months old. Cocks must not be caponed. Husks containing living animals must not be burnt. Forests must not be burnt either uselessly or in order to destroy (living beings). Living animals must not be fed with (other) living animals.

Ashoka advocated restraint in the number that had to be killed for consumption, protected some of them, and in general condemned violent acts against animals, such as [[castration]].

However, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100  'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices then freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.&lt;ref name="IWH5"/&gt;

;Buddhism
Explicit mentions of Buddhism or the Buddha only appear in the [[Minor Rock Edicts]] and the [[Minor Pillar Edicts]].&lt;ref name=SDK/&gt; Beyond affirming himself as a Buddhist and spreading the moral virtues of Buddhism, Ashoka also insisted that the word of the Buddha be read and followed, in particular in monastic circles (the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sanghas]]),  in a unique edict ([[Minor Rock Edict|Minor Rock Edict No.3]]), found in front of the [[Bairat Temple]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbandharma.org/pdf/king_asoka.pdf King Asoka and Buddhism, Edited by Anuradha Seneviratna, p.44]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Minor Rock Edict No.3)&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;}}

Ashoka also expressed his devotion for the [[List of the named Buddhas|Buddhas of the past]], such as the [[Koṇāgamana Buddha]], for whom he enlarged a [[stupa]] in the 14th year of his reign, and made a dedication and set up a pillar during a visit in person in the 20th year of his reign, as described in his [[Minor Pillar Edict]] of [[Nigali Sagar]], in modern [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inscriptions of Asoka.

Far from being [[sectarian]], Ashoka, based on a belief that all religions shared a common, positive essence, encouraged tolerance and understanding of other religions.

{{quote|The Beloved of the Gods, the king Piyadassi, wishes that all sect may dwell in all places, for all seek self-control and purity of mind. (Major Rock Edict No.7&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;}}

{{quote|For whosoever praises his own sect or blames other sects, — all (this) out of pure devotion to his own sect, (i.e.) with the view of glorifying his own sect, — if he is acting thus, he rather injures his own sect very severely. But concord is meritorious, (i.e.) that they should both hear and obey each other's morals. For this is the desire of Devanampriya, (viz.) that all sects should be both full of learning and pure in doctrine. And those who are attached to their respective (sects), ought to be spoken to (as follows). Devanampriya does not value either gifts or honours so (highly) as (this), (viz.) that a promotion of the essentials of all sects should take place.

===Social and animal welfare===
According to the edicts, Ashoka took great care of the [[quality of life|welfare]] of his subjects (human and animal), and those beyond his borders, spreading the use of medicinal treatments, improving roadside facilities for more comfortable travel, and establishing "officers of the faith" throughout his territories to survey the welfare of the population and the propagation of the [[Dharma]]. The Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] ("the [[Yona]] king named Antiyoga" in the text of the Edicts) is also named as a recipient of Ashoka's generosity, together with the other kings neighbouring him.&lt;ref name=PK&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kosmin |first1=Paul J. |title=The Land of the Elephant Kings |date=2014 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674728820 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9UWdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | Now, it is the conquest by the Dharma that the Beloved of the Gods considers as the best conquest. And this one (the conquest by the Dharma) was won here, on the borders, and even 600 [[yojana]]s (leagues) from here, where the king [[Antiochos II|Antiochos]] reigns, and beyond where reign the four kings [[Ptolemy II| Ptolemy]], [[Antigonos II Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]], likewise in the south, where live the [[Cholas]], the [[Pandyas]], and as far as [[Kingdom of Tambapanni|Tamraparni]].

It is not clear in Hellenic records whether these emissaries were actually received, or had any influence on the Hellenic world.

=== Proselytism within Ashoka's territories ===
Inside India proper, in the realm of Ashoka, many different populations were the object of the King’s proselytism. Greek communities also lived in the northwest of the Mauryan empire, currently in Pakistan, notably ancient [[Gandhara]], and in the region of [[Gedrosia]], nowadays in Southern Afghanistan, following the conquest and the colonization efforts of Alexander the Great around 323 BCE. These communities therefore seem to have been still significant during the reign of Ashoka. The [[Kambojas]] are a people of [[Central Asia]]n origin who had settled first in [[Arachosia]] and [[Drangiana]] (today’s southern [[Afghanistan]]), and in some of the other areas in the northwestern Indian subcontinent in [[Sindhu]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Sauvira]]. The Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the [[Satavahanas|Andhras]] and the [[Paradas|Palidas]] were other people under Ashoka’s rule:

===Hellenistic inscriptions===
It has also been suggested that inscriptions bearing the [[Delphic maxims]] from the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], inscribed by philosopher [[Clearchus of Soli]] in the neighbouring city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] circa 300 BCE, may have influenced the writings of Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erskine |first1=Andrew |title=A Companion to the Hellenistic World |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405154413 |page=421 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krJF3rnhQdsC&amp;pg=PA421 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VY"&gt;Valeri P.

===Ancestor of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system===
[[File:Edicts of Ashoka numerals.jpg|thumb|left|The numerals used by Ashoka in his Edicts.]]
[[File:Ashoka Brahmi numerals 256.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|The number "256" in Ashoka's [[Minor Rock Edict]] No.1 in [[Sasaram]].]]
The first examples of what were later called the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] appeared in the [[Brahmi numerals]] used in the Edicts of Ashoka, in which a few numerals are found, although the system is not yet positional (the [[zero]], together with a mature positional system, was invented much later around the 6th century CE) and involves different symbols for units, dozens or hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hollingdale |first1=Stuart |title=Makers of Mathematics |date=2014 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=9780486174501 |pages=95-96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZET_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is later further documented with more numerals in the [[Nanaghat Inscriptions|Nanaghat inscriptions]] (1st century BCE), and later in the [[Nasik caves]] inscriptions (2nd century CE), to acquire designs which are largely similar to the Hindu-Arabic numerals used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Publishing |first1=Britannica Educational |title=The Britannica Guide to Theories and Ideas That Changed the Modern World |date=2009 |publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing |isbn=9781615300631 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcOcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Victor J. |last2=Parshall |first2=Karen Hunger |title=Taming the Unknown: A History of Algebra from Antiquity to the Early Twentieth Century |date=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400850525 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQLHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pillis |first1=John de |title=777 Mathematical Conversation Starters |date=2002 |publisher=MAA |isbn=9780883855409 |page=286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YB4wS-N9qb0C&amp;pg=PA286 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number "[[6]]" in particular appears in [[Minor Rock Edict]] No.1 when Ashoka explains he has "been on tour for 256 days". The evolution to the modern glyph for 6 appears rather straightforward. It was written in one stroke, somewhat like a cursive lowercase "e". Gradually, the upper part of the stroke (above the central squiggle) became more curved, while the lower part of the stroke (below the central squiggle) became straighter. The Arabs dropped the part of the stroke below the squiggle. From there, the European evolution to the modern 6 was very straightforward, aside from a flirtation with a glyph that looked more like an uppercase G.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl. David Bellos et al. London: The Harvill Press (1998): 395, Fig. 24.66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Indian epigraphy===
{{main|Early Indian epigraphy}}
[[File:Delhi-Topra pillar Brahmi and Nagari.jpg|thumb|The Edicts of Ashoka started a tradition of epigraphical inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Singor/&gt; 1800 years separate these two inscriptions: Brahmi script of the 3rd century BCE (Major Pillar Edict of Ashoka), and its derivative, 16th century CE [[Devanagari]] script (1524 CE), on the [[Ashokan Edicts in Delhi|Delhi-Topra pillar]].]]
Ashokan inscriptions in [[Prakrit]] precede by several centuries inscriptions in [[Sanskrit]], probably owing to the great prestige which Ashokan inscriptions gave to the Prakrit language.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}} Louis Renou called it "the great linguistical [[paradox]] of India" that the Sanskrit inscriptions appear later than [[Prakrit]] inscriptions, although Prakrit is considered as a descendant of the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}} 

Ashoka was probably the first Indian ruler to create stone inscriptions, and in doing so, he began an important Indian tradition of royal epigraphical inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Singor&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singor |first1=Henk |title=King Ashoka's Philanthropia |date=2014 |page=4 |url=http://www.singor.org/publ/singor201201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known stone inscriptions in Sanskrit are in the Brahmi script from the first century BCE.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}} These early Sanskrit inscriptions include the [[Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana|Ayodhyā]] (Uttar Pradesh) and [[Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions|Hāthībādā-Ghosuṇḍī]] (near [[Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan) inscriptions.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theo Damsteegt|title=Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA209|year=1978|publisher=Brill Academic|pages=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important inscriptions dated to the 1st century BCE, in relatively accurate classical Sanskrit and Brahmi script are the [[Yavanarajya inscription]] on a red sandstone slab and the long [[Naneghat#Nanaghat_inscriptions|Naneghat inscription]] on the wall of a cave rest stop in the Western Ghats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonya Rhie Quintanilla|title=History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC |year=2007|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-15537-6|page=254-255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these few examples from the 1st century BCE, the bulk of early Sanskrit inscriptions were made from the 1st and 2nd-century CE by the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Northern Satraps]] in [[Mathura]] ([[Uttar Pradesh]]), and the [[Western Satraps]] in [[Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]].{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=87 with footnotes}} According to Salomon, the Scythian rulers of northern and western India while not the originators, were promoters of the use of Sanskrit language for inscriptions, and "their motivation in promoting Sanskrit was presumably a desire to establish themselves as legitimate Indian or at least Indianized rulers and to curry the favor of the educated Brahmanical elite".{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=93}}

The [[Brahmi script]] used in the Edicts of Ashoka, as well as the [[Prakrit]] language of these inscriptions was in popular use down through the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]], and remained readable down to the 4th century CE during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]. After that time the script underwent significant evolutions which rendered the Ashokan inscriptions unreadable. This still means that Ashoka's Edicts were for everyone to see and understand for a period of nearly 700 hundred years in India, suggesting that they remained significantly influential for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Christopher I. Beckwith|Beckwith]] |first1=[[Christopher I. Beckwith|Christopher I.]] |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400866328 |page=242 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlCUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative theories on authorship==
A few significant authors have been suggesting that the author of the "Buddhist" Minor Edicts might not be the same as the advocate of the Dharma in the Major Edicts, especially pointing to the fact that Buddhism is not mentioned directly in the Major Edicts, and that, on the contrary, the Buddhist notions described in the Minor Edicts (such as the Buddhist [[wikt:canonical|canonical]] writings in Minor Edict No.3 at [[Bairat Temple|Bairat]], the mention of a Buddha of the past [[Kanakamuni Buddha]] in the [[Nigali Sagar]] Minor Pillar Edict) are more characteristic of the "Normative Buddhism" of the [[Indo-Scythian|Saka]]-[[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] period around the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=CB238&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Christopher I. Beckwith|Beckwith]] |first1=[[Christopher I.

Beckwith]], the Major Edicts were made by a ruler named "Devanampiya Priyadarsi", probably the son of [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]], called [[Amitrochates]] by the Greeks and [[Bindusara]] by the Indians,&lt;ref name=CB231&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Christopher I.

'''Edmund Burke''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|ɜr|k}}; 12 January &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[New Style|NS]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1729&lt;ref&gt;The exact year of his birth is the subject of a great deal of controversy; 1728, 1729, and 1730 have been proposed. The month and day of his birth also are subject to question, a problem compounded by the [[Julian calendar|Julian]]–[[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] changeover in 1752, during his lifetime. For a fuller treatment of the question, see F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume I: 1730–1784'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 16–17. [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] (2008; p. 14) questions Burke's birthplace as having been in Dublin, arguing in favour of Shanballymore, Co. Cork (in the house of his uncle, James Nagle).&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}9 July 1797) was an [[Irish people| Irish]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2001, p. 25: "Edmund Burke was an Irishman, born in Dublin but in an age before 'Celtic nationalism' had been constructed to make Irishness and Englishness incompatible: he was therefore free also to describe himself, without misrepresentation, as 'a loyalist being loyal to England' to denote his membership of the wider polity. He never attempted to disguise his Irishness (as some ambitious Scots in eighteenth-century England tried to anglicise their accents), did what he could in the Commons to promote the interests of his native country and was bitterly opposed to the Penal Laws against Irish Catholics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |title=Reactionary Prophet |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2004/04/hitchens.htm |newspaper=The Atlantic |location=Washington |date=April 2004 |quote=Edmund Burke was neither an Englishman nor a Tory. He was an Irishman, probably a Catholic Irishman at that (even if perhaps a secret sympathiser), and for the greater part of his life he upheld the more liberal principles of the Whig faction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC - History - Edmund Burke|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politician|statesman]] born in [[Dublin]], as well as an author, orator, [[political theorist]] and philosopher, who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] with the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]].

Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bourke, ''Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} These views were expressed in his ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. Burke criticized British treatment of the [[British America|American colonies]], including through its taxation policies. He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. Burke is remembered for his support for [[Catholic emancipation]], the impeachment of [[Warren Hastings]] from the [[East India Company]] and for his staunch opposition to the [[French Revolution]]. In his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society and traditional institutions of state and society, and condemned the persecution of the [[Catholic Church]] that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], which he dubbed the "Old Whigs", as opposed to the pro-French Revolution "New Whigs", led by [[Charles James Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke lived before the terms "conservative" and "liberal" were used to describe political ideologies, cf. J. C. D. Clark, ''English Society, 1660–1832'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2000), pp. 5, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennis O'Keeffe |author2=John Meadowcroft |title=Edmund Burke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVO9QuYUGwwC&amp;pg=PA93 |year=2009 |publisher=Continuum |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Heywood, ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction. Third Edition'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Edmund Burke. Volume II: 1784–1797'' (Clarendon Press, 2006), p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Burke was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland. His mother Mary ''née'' Nagle (c. 1702–1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a [[wikt:declasse|declasse]] [[County Cork]] family (and a cousin of [[Nano Nagle]]), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the [[Church of Ireland]]; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Langford, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4019 Burke, Edmund (1729/30–1797)], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Burke|Burke dynasty]] descends from an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[knight]] surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as ''de Burgo'') who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following [[Henry II of England]]'s 1171 [[Norman invasion of Ireland|invasion of Ireland]] and is among the chief "Gall" (or "[[Normans in Ireland#Old English|Old English]]") families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Prior (surgeon)|James Prior]], ''Life of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Fifth Edition'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Connor Cruise|page=10|title=The Great Melody|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his political enemies repeatedly accused him of having been educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[College of St. Omer]], near [[Calais]], France, and of harbouring secret Catholic sympathies at a time when membership of the Catholic Church would disqualify him from public office (''see'' [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws in Ireland]]). As Burke told [[Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe|Frances Crewe]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Burke's Enemies often endeavoured to convince the World that he had been bred up in the Catholic Faith, &amp; that his Family were of it, &amp; that he himself had been educated at St. Omer—but this was false, as his father was a regular practitioner of the Law at Dublin, which he could not be unless of the Established Church: &amp; it so happened that though Mr. B—was twice at Paris, he never happened to go through the Town of [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Extracts from Mr. Burke's Table-talk, at Crewe Hall. Written down by Mrs. Crewe, pp. 62.", ''Miscellanies of the Philobiblon Society. Volume VII'' (London: Whittingham and Wilkins, 1862–63), pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After being elected to the House of Commons, Burke was required to take the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of Allegiance]] and [[Abjuration#Great Britain and Ireland|abjuration]], the [[oath of supremacy]], and declare against [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although never denying his Irishness, Burke often described himself as "an Englishman". According to the historian [[J. C. D. Clark]], this was in an age "before 'Celtic nationalism' sought to make Irishness and Englishness incompatible".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child he sometimes spent time away from the unhealthy air of Dublin with his mother's family in the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]] Valley in County Cork. He received his early education at a [[Quakers|Quaker]] school in [[Ballitore]], County Kildare, some {{convert|67|km|mi}} from Dublin; and possibly, like his cousin [[Nano Nagle]] at a [[Hedge school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.distancesfrom.com/ie/distance-from-Dublin-to-Baltimore-Ireland/DistanceHistory/1830632.aspx?IsHistory=1&amp;GMapHistoryID=1830632 |title=DistanceFrom.com Dublin, Ireland to Ballitore, Co. Kildare, Ireland|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=DistanceFrom.com |publisher=softusvista. |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in correspondence with his schoolmate from there, [[Mary Leadbeater]], the daughter of the school's owner, throughout his life.

In 1744, Burke started at [[Trinity College Dublin]], a Protestant [[university|establishment]], which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take [[academic degree|degrees]].&lt;ref name="millbanksystems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1834/may/08/catholics-and-trinity-college-dublin|title=Catholics and Trinity College Dublin. (Hansard, 8 May 1834)|publisher=hansard.millbanksystems.com|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1747, he set up a debating society, "Edmund Burke's Club", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the [[College Historical Society]]; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the [[Middle Temple]], before soon giving up legal study to travel in [[Continental Europe]]. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edmund Burke|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_burke.html|publisher=The Basics of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early writing==
The late [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]]'s ''Letters on the Study and Use of History'' was published in 1752 and his collected works appeared in 1754. This provoked Burke into writing his first published work, ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society|A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind]]'', appearing in Spring 1756. Burke imitated Bolingbroke's style and ideas in a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of his arguments for [[atheistic]] [[rationalism]], in order to demonstrate their [[absurdity]].&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 45"&gt;Prior, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim McCue, ''Edmund Burke and Our Present Discontents'' (The Claridge Press, 1997), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edmund Burke2 c.jpg|left|thumb|"The writers against religion, whilst they oppose every system, are wisely careful never to set up any of their own." ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]'']]

Burke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against [[Revelation|revealed religion]] could apply to all social and civil institutions as well.&lt;ref name="Critical Dict"&gt;{{cite book |title=A critical dictionary of English literature and British and American authors, living and deceased, from the earliest accounts to the latter half of the nineteenth century.

B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]] |volume=1 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] and [[William Warburton|Bishop Warburton]] (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a [[satire]].&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the [[ironic]] nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 85"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Hurd (clergyman)|Richard Hurd]] believed that Burke's imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose: an [[ironist]] "should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ''ridicule'' shine through the Imitation. Whereas this ''Vindication'' is everywhere enforc'd, not only in the language, and on the principles of L. Bol., but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 85" /&gt; A minority of scholars have taken the position that, in fact, Burke did write the ''Vindication'' in earnest, later disowning it only for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html |title=Edmund Burke, Anarchist |accessdate=14 October 2007 |author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Sobran|Sobran, Joseph]], [http://www.sobran.com/columns/2002/020124.shtml Anarchism, Reason, and History]: "Oddly enough, the great conservative Edmund Burke began his career with an anarchist tract, arguing that the state was naturally and historically destructive of human society, life, and liberty. Later he explained that he'd intended his argument ironically, but many have doubted this. His argument for anarchy was too powerful, passionate, and cogent to be a joke. Later, as a professional politician, Burke seems to have come to terms with the state, believing that no matter how bloody its origins, it could be tamed and civilized, as in Europe, by "the spirit of a gentleman, and the spirit of religion". But even as he wrote, the old order he loved was already breaking down. "&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, Burke published a treatise on [[aesthetics]], ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', which attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. It was his only purely philosophical work, and when asked by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] and [[French Laurence]] to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation (Burke had written it before he was nineteen years of age).&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 1757, Burke signed a contract with [[Robert Dodsley]] to write a "history of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne", its length being eighty quarto sheets (640 pages), nearly 400,000 words. It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped; it was not published until after Burke's death, being included in an 1812 collection of his works, entitled ''An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History''. [[G. M. Young]] did not value Burke's history and claimed that it was "demonstrably a translation from the French".&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Young, 'Burke', ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', XXIX (London, 1943), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Acton]], on commenting on the story that Burke stopped his history because [[David Hume]] published his, said "it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Butterfield, ''Man on His Past'' (Cambridge, 1955), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year following that contract, with Dodsley, Burke founded the influential ''[[Annual Register]]'', a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Burke contributed to the ''Annual Register'' is unclear:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wellsted Copeland, 'Edmund Burke and the Book Reviews in Dodsley's Annual Register', ''Publications of the [[Modern Language Association]]'', Vol. 57, No. 2. (Jun. 1942), pp. 446–68.&lt;/ref&gt; in his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the ''Register'' as evidence of Burke's opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference.&lt;ref name="Copeland, p. 446"&gt;Copeland, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke remained the [[chief editor]] of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766.&lt;ref name="Copeland, p. 446" /&gt;

On 12 March 1757, Burke married Jane Mary Nugent (1734–1812), daughter of Dr [[Christopher Nugent (physician)|Christopher Nugent]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/41200 www.ucl.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; a Catholic physician who had provided him with medical treatment at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Their son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]] was born on 9 February 1758; an elder son, Christopher, died in infancy. Burke also helped raise a [[Ward (law)|ward]], Edmund Nagle (''later'' [[Admiral]] [[Sir Edmund Nagle]]), the son of a maternal cousin orphaned in 1763.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19720 Nagle, Sir Edmund], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[John Knox Laughton|J. K. Laughton]], (subscription required), Retrieved 22 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

At about this same time, Burke was introduced to [[William Gerard Hamilton]] (known as "Single-speech Hamilton"). When Hamilton was appointed [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], Burke accompanied him to Dublin as his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|private secretary]], a position he held for three years. In 1765 Burke became [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|private secretary]] to the liberal Whig statesman, [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Charles, Marquess of Rockingham]], then [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]], who remained Burke's close friend and associate until his untimely death in 1782. Rockingham also introduced Burke as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;Denslow, William R., 10,000 Famous Freemasons, 4 vol., Missouri Lodge of Research, Trenton, Missouri, 1957–61. vol. 1, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/burke_e/burke_e.html |title=Edmund Burke |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
{{The Club|size=250px|align=right}}&lt;!--the grammar in the caption is incorrect, ''who is '''who''''' should read, ''to identify each member''--&gt;

In December 1765, Burke entered the House of Commons of the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] as Member for [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]], a [[pocket borough]] in the gift of Lord Fermanagh, later [[Earl Verney|2nd Earl Verney]] and a close political ally of Rockingham. After Burke delivered his [[maiden speech]], [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] said he had "spoken in such a manner as to stop the mouths of all Europe" and that the Commons should congratulate itself on acquiring such a Member.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first great subject Burke addressed was the controversy with the American colonies, which soon developed into [[American Revolutionary War|war]] and ultimate [[United States Declaration of Independence|separation]]; in reply to the 1769 [[George Grenville|Grenvillite]] [[pamphlet]], ''The Present State of the Nation'', he published his own pamphlet on, ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation''. Surveying the finances of France, Burke predicts "some extraordinary convulsion in that whole system".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, with mostly borrowed money, Burke purchased ''Gregories'', a {{convert|600|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} estate near [[Beaconsfield]]. Although the [[Estate (land)|estate]] included saleable assets such as [[art work]]s by [[Titian]], ''Gregories'' proved a heavy financial burden in the following decades and Burke was never able to repay its purchase price in full. His speeches and writings, having made him famous, led to the suggestion that he was the author of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''.

At about this time, Burke joined the circle of leading intellectuals and artists in London of whom [[Samuel Johnson]] was the central luminary. This [[Social circle|circle]] also included [[David Garrick]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and [[Joshua Reynolds]]. [[Edward Gibbon]] described Burke as 'the most eloquent and rational madman that I ever knew'.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Letters of Edward Gibbon, II (1896)'' Prothero, P. (ed.). p. 251 cited in ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781–1998'' (2007) Brendon, Piers. Jonathan Cape, London. p. 10 {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson admired Burke's brilliance, he found him a dishonest politician.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Life of Samuel Johnson'', edited by Hill-Powell; v. II, p. 349; 7 April 1775&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, Journals, ''Boswell: The Ominous Years'', p. 134, edited by Ryskamp &amp; Pottle; McGraw Hill, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke took a leading role in the debate regarding the constitutional limits to the executive authority of the [[George III of the United Kingdom|king]]. He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses, either by the monarch, or by specific factions within the government. His most important publication in this regard was his ''Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents'' of 23 April 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Burke: Select Works of Edmund Burke, Vol. 1, Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke identified the "discontents" as stemming from the "secret influence" of a neo-Tory group he labelled as, the "king's friends", whose system "comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, ''Double Cabinet''".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain needed a party with "an unshaken adherence to principle, and attachment to connexion, against every allurement of interest". Party divisions "whether operating for good or evil, are things inseparable from free government".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gregories Estate near Beaconsfield Buckinghamshire 1792.jpg|thumb|The ''Gregories'' estate, purchased by Burke for £20,000 in 1768]]
During 1771, Burke wrote a Bill that, if passed, would have given [[jury|juries]] the right to determine what was [[libel]]. Burke spoke in favour of the Bill but it was opposed by some, including [[Charles James Fox]] thus not becoming law. Fox, when introducing [[Libel Act 1792|his own Bill]] in 1791 in Opposition, repeated almost verbatim the text of Burke's Bill without acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 127 + pp. 340–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also was prominent in securing the right to publish debates held in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in a parliamentary debate on the prohibition on the export of grain on 16 November 1770, Burke argued in favour of a [[free market]] in corn: "There are no such things as a high, &amp; a low price that is encouraging, &amp; discouraging; there is nothing but a natural price, which grain brings at an universal market."&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 321–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772 Burke was instrumental in the passing of the [[Repeal of Certain Laws Act 1772]], which repealed various old laws against dealers and forestallers in corn.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Annual Register'' for 1772 (published in July 1773), Burke condemned the [[First Partition of Poland|Partition of Poland]]. He saw it as "the first very great breach in the modern political system of Europe" and as upsetting the balance of power in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan Simms]], ''Three Victories and a Defeat. The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714–1783'' (Allen Lane, 2007), pp. 569–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1774, Burke was elected Member for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]], at the time "England's second city" and a large constituency with a genuine electoral contest. The platform on which he was elected included the ''Speech to the Electors of Bristol'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html uchicago.edu: "Edmund Burke, Speech to the Electors of Bristol"] 3 Nov. 1774, Works 1:446--48&lt;/ref&gt; a remarkable disclaimer of the constituent-imperative form of democracy, for which he substituted his statement of the "representative mandate" form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

In May 1778, Burke supported a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] revising restrictions on Irish trade. His constituents, citizens of the great trading city of Bristol, however urged Burke to oppose [[free trade]] with Ireland. Burke resisted their protestations and said: "If, from this conduct, I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election, it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England, that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke published, ''Two Letters to Gentlemen of Bristol on the Bills relative to the Trade of Ireland'', in which he espoused "some of the chief principles of commerce; such as the advantage of free intercourse between all parts of the same kingdom...the evils attending restriction and monopoly...and that the gain of others is not necessarily our loss, but on the contrary an advantage by causing a greater demand for such wares as we have for sale".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 175–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke also supported the attempts of [[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet|Sir George Savile]] to repeal some of the [[penal laws]] against Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also called capital punishment "the Butchery which we call justice" in 1776 and in 1780 he condemned the use of the [[pillory]] for two men convicted for attempting to practice [[sodomy]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

This support for unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and [[Catholic Emancipation]], led to Burke losing his [[Legislative seat|seat]] in 1780. For the remainder of his parliamentary career, Burke represented [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]], another pocket borough under the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]]'s patronage.

==American War of Independence==
Burke expressed his support for the grievances of the [[American Colonies]] under the government of [[King George III]] and his appointed representatives. On 19 April 1774 Burke made a speech, "[[On American Taxation]]" (published in January 1775), on a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to repeal the [[Tea Act|tea duty]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again and again, revert to your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, if she has taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor attempting to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 March 1775, in the House of Commons, Burke delivered a speech (published during May 1775) on reconciliation with America. Burke appealed for peace as preferable to civil war and reminded the House of America's growing population, its industry, and its wealth. He warned against the notion that the Americans would back down in the face of force, since most Americans were of British descent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke prized peace with America above all else, pleading with the House of Commons to remember that the interest by way of money received from the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] was far more attractive than any sense of putting the [[colonist]]s in their place:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war, not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal discord... it is simple peace, sought in its natural course and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm |title=Speech on Moving Resolutions for Conciliation with America, 22 March 1775 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke was not merely presenting a [[Peace treaty|peace agreement]] to Parliament; rather, he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in [[British America|Colonial America]] would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. "An armament", Burke said, "is not a victory".&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=Speech to Parliament on Reconciliation with the American Colonies|url=http://americainclass.org/sources/makingrevolution/war/text1/burkereconspeech.pdf|website=America in Class|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt; Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic—the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.

It was not temporary force, uncertainty, impairment, or even experience that Burke cited as the number one reason for avoiding war with the American colonies, however; it was the character of the American people themselves: "In this character of Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole... this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any other people of the earth... [the] men [are] acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defense, full of resources..."&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt; Burke concludes with another plea for peace, and a prayer that Britain might avoid actions which, in Burke's words, "may bring on the destruction of this Empire".&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;

Burke proposed six resolutions to settle the American conflict peacefully:
# Allow the American colonists to elect their own representatives, thus settling the dispute about taxation without representation;
# Acknowledge this wrongdoing and apologise for grievances caused;
# Procure an efficient manner of choosing and sending these delegates;
# Set up a General Assembly in America itself, with powers to regulate taxes;
# Stop gathering taxes by imposition (or law), and start gathering them only when they are needed; and
# Grant needed aid to the colonies.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;

The effect of these resolutions, had they been passed, can never be known. Unfortunately, Burke delivered this speech just less than a month before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexington and Concord|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/11c.asp|website=USHistory.org|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.

Among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]] (1684–1775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: "Young man, There is America—which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 384"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Johnson]] was so irritated at hearing it continually praised, that he made a parody of it, where the devil appears to a young Whig and predicts that in short time, [[Whiggism]] will poison even the paradise of America!&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. I, p. 384" /&gt;

The administration of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] (1770–1782) tried to defeat the colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and, in 1776, came the [[American Declaration of Independence]]. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of the defeat of the Americans at New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Burke wrote: "As to the good people of England, they seem to partake every day more and more of the Character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Burke's view, the British Government was fighting "the American English" ("our English Brethren in the Colonies"), with a [[House of Hanover|Germanic king]] employing "the hireling sword of German boors and vassals" to destroy the English liberties of the colonists.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; On [[American independence]], Burke wrote: "I do not know how to wish success to those whose Victory is to separate from us a large and noble part of our Empire. Still less do I wish success to injustice, oppression and absurdity".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gordon Riots]] in 1780, Burke became a target of hostility and his home was placed under armed guard by the military.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert pp. 48–73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paymaster of the Forces==
[[File:Cincinnatus in retirement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In ''Cincinnatus in Retirement'' (1782), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Burke's support of rights for Catholics.]]

The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed [[Paymaster of the Forces]] and a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham's unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister, put an end to his administration after only a few months, however, Burke did manage to introduce two Acts.

The [[Paymaster General Act 1782]] ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', p. 511 + n. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] was a watered down version of Burke's original intentions as outlined in his famous ''Speech on Economical Reform'' of 11 February 1780. He managed, however, to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The third [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] and the [[Board of Trade]] were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save £72,368 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. I'', pp. 511–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne's government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of [[William Pitt the Younger]], which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life.

==Democracy==
In 1774, Burke's ''Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll'' was noted for its defence of the principles of [[Representation (politics)|representative]] government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume I'' (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), pp. 446–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political scientist [[Hanna Pitkin]] points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, "Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve."&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, ''The concept of representation'' (1972) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over [[Tyranny of the majority|unpopular minorities]], who needed the protection of the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Hamburger, "Burke, Edmund" in Seymour Martin Lipset, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Democracy'' (Congressional Quarterly, 1995) 1:147–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==India and the impeachment of Warren Hastings==
{{main|Impeachment of Warren Hastings}}

For years Burke pursued impeachment efforts against [[Warren Hastings]], formerly Governor-General of Bengal, that resulted in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Siraj Ahmed, "The Theater of the Civilized Self: Edmund Burke and the East India Trials". ''[[Representations]]'' 78 (2002): 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the [[East India Company]] when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged "to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirk, ''Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered'' (1988), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the [[Maharaja|Indian princes]] that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the East India Company should recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that "began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire.'"&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth D. Samet, "A Prosecutor and a Gentleman: Edmund Burke's Idiom of Impeachment", ''[[ELH]]'' 68, no. 2 (2001): 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1785, Burke delivered a now-famous speech, ''The [[Nabob of Arcot]]'s Debts'', wherein he condemned the damage to [[India]] by the East India Company. In the province of the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] the Indians had constructed a system of reservoirs to make the soil fertile in a naturally dry region, and centred their society on the husbandry of water:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke held that the advent of British dominion, and in particular the conduct of the East India Company, had destroyed much that was good in these traditions and that, as a consequence of this, and the lack of new customs to replace them, the Indians were suffering. He set about establishing a set of British expectations, whose moral foundation would, in his opinion, warrant the empire.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the ''Article of Charge of [[High Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' against Hastings. The [[impeachment]] in Westminster Hall, which did not begin until 14 February 1788, would be the "first major public discursive event of its kind in England",&lt;ref&gt;Mithi Mukherjee, "Justice, War, and the Imperium: India and Britain in Edmund Burke's Prosecutorial Speeches", ''Law and History Review'' 23, no. 3 (2005): 589.&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, ''Justice, War, and the Imperium'', 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781–1998'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2007), p. 35. {{ISBN|978-0-224-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Commons eventually [[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached Hastings]], but subsequently, the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.

==French Revolution: 1688 versus 1789==
[[File:Smelling out a rat.jpg|thumb|''Smelling out a Rat;—or—The Atheistical-Revolutionist disturbed in his Midnight "Calculations"'' (1790) by Gillray, depicting a caricature of Burke holding a crown and a cross; the seated man, Dr. Richard Price, is writing "On the Benefits of Anarchy Regicide Atheism" beneath a picture of the execution of [[Charles I of England]].]]
[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|''Reflections on the Revolution in France, And on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to Have Been Sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke.'']]

Initially, Burke did not condemn the [[French Revolution]]. In a letter of 9 August 1789, he wrote: "England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The events of 5–6 October 1789, when [[Women's March on Versailles|a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles]] to compel [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken "as no more than the expression of doubt" but he added: "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month he described France as "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in France. The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world. In that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their monarchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures... [there was a danger of] an imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody and tyrannical democracy... [in religion] the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Atheism; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1790, Burke read Dr. [[Richard Price]]'s sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled, ''[[A Discourse on the Love of Our Country]]'', to the [[Revolution Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/price/price_8.htm |title=A Discourse on the Love of our Country |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That society had been founded to commemorate the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. In this sermon Price espoused the philosophy of universal [[human rights|"Rights of Men"]]. Price argued that love of our country "does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Price asserted that Englishmen should see themselves "more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community".

A debate between Price and Burke ensued that was "the classic moment at which two fundamentally different conceptions of national identity were presented to the English public".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''English Society'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Price claimed that the principles of the Glorious Revolution included "the right to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to frame a government for ourselves".

Immediately after reading Price's sermon, Burke wrote a draft of what eventually became ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/241734 |title=The Genesis of Burke's Reflections |year=1978 |author=Dreyer, Frederick |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |volume=50|issue=3 |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly, Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, however he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November he finally published the ''Reflections'' and it was an immediate best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Gaëton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Lock, ''Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1985), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

What the Glorious Revolution had meant was as important to Burke and his contemporaries as it had been for the last one hundred years in British politics.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Reflections'', Burke argued against Price's interpretation of the Glorious Revolution and instead, gave a classic Whig defence of it.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 24–25, 34, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke argued against the idea of abstract, metaphysical rights of humans and instead advocated national tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Revolution was made to preserve our ''antient'' indisputable laws and liberties, and that ''antient'' constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty... The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as ''an inheritance from our forefathers''. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [scion] alien to the nature of the original plant... Our oldest reformation is that of [[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]]. You will see that Sir [[Edward Coke]], that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter... were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom... In the famous law... called the ''[[Petition of Right]]'', the parliament says to the king, "Your subjects have ''inherited'' this freedom", claiming their franchises not on abstract principles "as the rights of men", but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke said  "We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is ''natural'' to be so affected".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is "the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages" and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. "Prejudice", Burke claimed, "is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised [[social contract]] theory by claiming that society is indeed, a contract, but "a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous passage in Burke's ''Reflections'' was his description of the events of 5–6 October 1789 and the part of [[Marie-Antoinette]] in them. Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt; His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. [[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]] wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was "pure foppery".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], however, reacted differently: "I adore his chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the [[Armand Louis de Gontaut|Duchesse de Biron]], that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cobban and Robert A. Smith (eds.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Price had rejoiced that the French king had been "led in triumph" during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XVI translated the ''Reflections'' "from end to end" into French.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 313–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Whig MPs [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] and [[Charles James Fox]], disagreed with Burke and split with him. Fox thought the ''Reflections'' to be "in very bad taste" and "favouring Tory principles".&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Mitchell, ''Charles James Fox'' (Penguin, 1997), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Whigs such as the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] and [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam]] privately agreed with Burke, but did not wish for a public breach with their Whig colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote on 29 November 1790: "I have received from the Duke of Portland, [[Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], the [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], [[Lord John Cavendish]], Montagu ([[Frederick Montagu]] MP), and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution".&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke of Portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the ''Reflections'' to him, he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true Whig creed.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 161, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of [[Paul Langford]],&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Burke [[crossing the Rubicon|crossed something of a Rubicon]] when he attended a levee on 3 February 1791 to meet the king, later described by Jane Burke:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On his coming to Town for the Winter, as he generally does, he went to the Levee with the Duke of ''Portland'', who went with [[Lord William Bentinck|Lord William]] to [[Kissing hands|kiss hands]] on his going into the [[Coldstream Guards|Guards]]—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [Burke] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for [Burke]'s coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of how long have you been in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [Burke] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see—[Burke] made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of ''use to us all'', it is a general opinion, is it not so [[John Dalrymple, 6th Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]]? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said [Burke]—I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke's ''Reflections'' sparked a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was one of the first into print, publishing ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' a few weeks after Burke. [[Thomas Paine]] followed with the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' in 1791. [[James Mackintosh]], who wrote ''Vindiciae Gallicae'', was the first to see the ''Reflections'' as "the manifesto of a Counter Revolution". Mackintosh later agreed with Burke's views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him, that Burke was "minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackintosh later said: "Burke was one of the first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time. He is without parallel in any age, excepting perhaps Lord Bacon and Cicero; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles James Fox00.jpg|thumb|[[Charles James Fox]]]]

In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the [[National Assembly of France]], wrote to Burke, praising ''Reflections'' and requesting more "very refreshing mental food" that he could publish.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 162–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This Burke did in April 1791 when he published ''A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly''. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed "a considerable insight into human nature" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–67 Burke was a friend of [[David Hume]], with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau "entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but ''vanity''"—which he "was possessed to a degree little short of madness". He also cited Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' as evidence that Rousseau had a life of "obscure and vulgar vices" that was not "chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: "a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 356–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was "overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and "the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man".&lt;ref name="McCue, p. 23"&gt;McCue, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (Macmillan, 1967), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] and seconded by Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.

Burke's response was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It certainly was indiscreet at any period, but especially at his time of life, to parade enemies, or give his friends occasion to desert him; yet if his firm and steady adherence to the British constitution placed him in such a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public experience taught him, with his last words exclaim, "Fly from the French Constitution".&lt;ref name="McCue, p. 23" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this point, Fox whispered that there was "no loss of friendship". "I regret to say there is", Burke replied, "I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend. There is something in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches".&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 329"&gt;Prior, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered "unusually bitter sarcasms".&lt;ref name="Prior, p. 329" /&gt; This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.&lt;ref name="O'Gorman, p. 75"&gt;O'Gorman, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke was dismayed that some Whigs, instead of reaffirming the principles of the Whig Party he laid out in the ''Reflections'', had rejected them in favour of "French principles" and that they criticised Burke for abandoning Whig principles. Burke wanted to demonstrate his fidelity to Whig principles and feared that acquiescence to Fox and his followers would allow the Whig Party to become a vehicle for Jacobinism.

Burke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution. Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig party "as tolerating, and by a toleration, countenancing those proceedings" so that he could "stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be...their sentiments".&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, on 3 August 1791 Burke published his ''Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs'', in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them, as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig party.

Burke owned two copies of what has been called "that practical compendium of Whig political theory", ''The Tryal of Dr. [[Henry Sacheverell]]'' (1710).&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40"&gt;Clark, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote of the trial: "It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the [Glorious] Revolution".&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40" /&gt; Writing in the third person, Burke asserted in his ''Appeal'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;... that the foundations laid down by the Commons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for justifying the revolution of 1688, are the very same laid down in Mr. Burke's Reflections; that is to say,—a breach of the ''original contract'', implied and expressed in the constitution of this country, as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in King, Lords and Commons.—That the fundamental subversion of this antient constitution, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accomplished, justified the Revolution. That it was justified ''only'' upon the ''necessity'' of the case; as the ''only'' means left for the recovery of that ''antient'' constitution, formed by the ''original contract'' of the British state; as well as for the future preservation of the ''same'' government. These are the points to be proved.&lt;ref name="Clark, p. 40" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke then provided quotations from Paine's ''Rights of Man'' to demonstrate what the New Whigs believed. Burke's belief that Foxite principles corresponded to Paine's was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Burke denied that a majority of "the people" had, or ought to have, the final say in politics and alter society at their pleasure. People had rights, but also duties, and these duties were not voluntary. Also, the people could not overthrow morality derived from God.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Whig [[grandee]]s such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke's ''Appeal'', they wished he had used more moderate language. Fitzwilliam saw the ''Appeal'' as containing "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Francis Basset]], a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: "...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox &amp; from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386" /&gt; Burke sent a copy of the ''Appeal'' to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it "with great Satisfaction".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 386" /&gt; Burke wrote of its reception: "Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice".&lt;ref name="O'Gorman, p. 75" /&gt; [[Charles Burney]] viewed it as "a most admirable book—the best &amp; most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', pp. 385–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, most of the Whigs sided with Burke and gave their support to Pitt's "conservative" government, which, in response to France's declaration of war against Britain, declared war on France's Revolutionary Government in 1793.

In December 1791, Burke sent Government ministers his ''Thoughts on French Affairs'' where he put forward three main points: no counter-revolution in France would come about by purely domestic causes; the longer the Revolutionary Government exists the stronger it becomes; and the Revolutionary Government's interest and aim is to disturb all of the other governments of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke, as a Whig, did not wish to see an [[absolute monarchy]] again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism. Writing to an ''émigré'' in 1791, Burke expressed his views against a restoration of the ''ancien régime'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When such a complete convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, or in the Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness as well as other inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.&lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VI'', pp. 479–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke delivered a speech on the debate of the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Bill]] on 28 December 1792. He supported the Bill as it would exclude "murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; The peroration included a reference to a French order for 3,000 daggers. Burke revealed a dagger he had concealed in his coat and threw it to the floor: "This is what you are to gain by an alliance with France". Burke picked up the dagger and continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When they smile, I see blood trickling down their faces; I see their insidious purposes; I see that the object of all their cajoling is—blood! I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example—'Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto' ['Such a man is evil; beware of him, Roman'. Horace, ''Satires'' I. 4. 85.].&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 439" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke supported the war against revolutionary France, seeing Britain as fighting on the side of the [[royalist]]s and ''émigres'' in a civil war, rather than fighting against the whole nation of France.&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453"&gt;Lock, ''Burke. Vol. II'', p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also supported the [[War in the Vendée|royalist uprising]] in [[Vendée|La Vendée]], describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to [[William Windham]], as "the sole affair I have much heart in".&lt;ref name="Lock, Burke. Vol. II, p. 453" /&gt; Burke wrote to [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] on 7 October urging him to send reinforcements there, as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on Paris. Dundas did not follow Burke's advice, however.

Burke believed the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the [[Charles X of France|Prince Charles of France]] (''S.A.R. le comte d'Artois''), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government. Burke was forced to reply on 6 November: "I am not in His Majesty's Service; or at all consulted in his Affairs".&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke published his ''Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France'', begun in October, where he said: "I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners. La Vendée is a proof of this".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. Volume VII'' (F. C. and J. Rivington, 1815), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son [[Richard Burke Jr.|Richard]]. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for [[Catholic emancipation]]). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him [[Earl of Beaconsfield]], but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and the [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale|Earl of Lauderdale]], to whom Burke replied in his ''Letter to a Noble Lord'' (1796):&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 425–26.&lt;/ref&gt; "It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, ''To innovate is not to reform''".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''A Letter from The Right Honourable Edmund Burke to a Noble Lord, on the Attacks made upon him and his pension, in the House of Lords, by The Duke of Bedford and The Earl of Lauderdale, Early in the present Sessions of Parliament.'' (F. and C. Rivington, 1796), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: "Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But as to ''our'' country and ''our'' race, as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion—as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land—so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke's last publications were the ''[[Letters on a Regicide Peace]]'' (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as [[appeasement]], injurious to national dignity and honour.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 439–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Second Letter'', Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: "Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Blakemore, 'Burke and the Revolution: Bicentennial Reflections', in Blakemore (ed.), ''Burke and the French Revolution. Bicentennial Essays'' (The [[University of Georgia Press]], 1992), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke regarded the war with France as ideological, against an "armed doctrine". He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe, and that the war was not against France, but against the revolutionaries governing her.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp. 443–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke said: "It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Later life==
In November 1795, there was a debate in Parliament on the high price of corn and Burke wrote a memorandum to Pitt on the subject. In December [[Samuel Whitbread (1764–1815)|Samuel Whitbread]] MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would vote for it. This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the [[Board of Agriculture (1793–1822)|Board of Agriculture]], [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, ''[[Thoughts and Details on Scarcity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eccleshall, ''English Conservatism since the Restoration'' (London: Unwin Hyman, 1990), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Burke expounded "some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade".&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages, and set out what the limits of government should be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is ''truly and properly'' public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The economist [[Adam Smith]] remarked that Burke was "the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do, without any previous communications having passed between us".&lt;ref&gt;E. G. West, ''Adam Smith'' (New York: Arlington House, 1969), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing to a friend in May 1795, Burke surveyed the causes of discontent: "I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland; or of Indianism [i.e. corporate tyranny, as practiced by the British East Indies Company], as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia; or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe, and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil".&lt;ref&gt;R. B. McDowell (ed.), ''The Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1796, however Burke had changed his mind: "Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all ''formal'' Government".&lt;ref&gt;McDowell (ed.), ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke. Volume VIII'', p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a year prior to his death, Burke knew that his 'stomach' was "irrecoverably ruind".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; After hearing that Burke was nearing death, Fox wrote to Mrs. Burke enquiring after him. Fox received the reply the next day:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. Burke presents her compliments to Mr. Fox, and thanks him for his obliging inquiries. Mrs. Burke communicated his letter to Mr. Burke, and by his desire has to inform Mr. Fox that it has cost Mr. Burke the most heart-felt pain to obey the stern voice of his duty in rending asunder a long friendship, but that he deemed this sacrifice necessary; that his principles continue the same; and that in whatever of life may yet remain to him, he conceives that he must live for others and not for himself. Mr. Burke is convinced that the principles which he has endeavoured to maintain are necessary to the welfare and dignity of his country, and that these principles can be enforced only by the general persuasion of his sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Prior, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burke died in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, on 9 July 1797,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |date=1997-07-07 |title=Edmund Burke, Political Writer and Philosopher Dies  |url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/edmund-burke-political-writer-and-philosopher-dies |magazine=History Today |volume=47 |issue=7 |access-date=2018-07-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried there alongside his son and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|12496191|Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife survived him by nearly fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Burke.

Burke believed that property was essential to human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As [[Christopher Hitchens]] summarises, "If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Reactionary Prophet|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/04/reactionary-prophet/302914/?single_page=true|website=www.theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's support for Irish Catholics and Indians often led him to be criticised by [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Sack, ''From Jacobite to Conservative. Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c. 1760–1832'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to British imperialism in Ireland and India and his opposition to French imperialism and radicalism in Europe, made it difficult for Whig or Tory to accept Burke wholly as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives. Burke's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke "was a man who truly &amp; prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles" but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys, 'The ''Reflections'' refracted: the critical reception of Burke's ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' during the early 1790s', in John Whale (ed.), ''Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. New interdisciplinary essays'' ([[Manchester University Press]], 2000), p. 55, n. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had, when he had separated from Fox, and an observer said Windham spoke "like the ghost of Burke" when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Harvey, ''Britain in the early nineteenth century'' (B T Batsford Ltd, 1978), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hazlitt]], a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau), and made it "a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in 'A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff' (1793), but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his ''Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland'' Wordsworth called Burke "the most sagacious Politician of his age" whose predictions "time has verified".&lt;ref name="Lock, p. 173"&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised his poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' to include praise of Burke ("Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders") and portrayed him as an old oak.&lt;ref name="Lock, p. 173" /&gt; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] came to have a similar conversion: he had criticised Burke in ''[[The Watchman (periodical)|The Watchman]]'', but in his ''Friend'' (1809–10) Coleridge defended Burke from charges of inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', pp. 173–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'' (1817) Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring "habitually to ''principles''. He was a ''scientific'' statesman; and therefore a ''seer''".&lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke's Reflections'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] wrote of Burke: "... all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity".&lt;ref name="Claeys, p. 50"&gt;Claeys, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Canning]] believed that Burke's ''Reflections'' "has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled".&lt;ref name="Claeys, p. 50" /&gt; In 1823 Canning wrote that he took Burke's "last works and words [as] the manual of my politics".&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Stapleton (ed.), ''Some Official Correspondence of George Canning. Volume I'' (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1887), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] "was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings".&lt;ref&gt;William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, ''The Life of Benjamin Disraeli. Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume I. 1804–1859'' (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] considered Burke "a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America" and in his diary recorded: "Made many extracts from Burke—''sometimes almost divine''".&lt;ref&gt;John Morley, ''The Life of William Ewart Gladstone. Volume III (1880–1898)'' (London: Macmillan, 1903), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The Radical MP and anti-[[Corn Law]] activist [[Richard Cobden]] often praised Burke's ''Thoughts and Details on Scarcity''.&lt;ref&gt;John Morley, ''The Life of Richard Cobden'' (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Paul (ed.), ''Letters of Lord Acton to Mary Gladstone'' (Macmillan, 1914), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: "I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since [[John Milton|Milton]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sir George Trevelyan, ''The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay. Volume II'' (London: Longmans, 1876), p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gladstonian Liberal MP [[John Morley]] published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Hamer, ''John Morley. Liberal Intellectual in Politics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cobdenite Radical [[Francis Wrigley Hirst|Francis Hirst]] thought Burke deserved "a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site".&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Hirst, ''Liberty and Tyranny'' (London: Duckworth, 1935), pp. 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a [[manifesto]] for Conservative thinking.

Two contrasting assessments of Burke also were offered long after his death by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sycophant—who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic ''laudator temporis acti'' against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy—was an out-and-out vulgar [[bourgeois]]. "The laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God." (E. Burke, l.c., pp. 31, 32) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winston Churchill, in ''Consistency in Politics'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority. But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing. History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations. His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect. No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The historian [[Piers Brendon]] asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the [[British Empire]], epitomised in the trial of [[Warren Hastings]], that was ultimately to be its undoing: when Burke stated that "The British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom, for it will be governed by no other",&lt;ref&gt;K. Brittlebank, ''Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy'' (Delhi, 1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; this was "...an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal. This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust. It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright—freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Brendon, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this opinion, Burke objected to the opium trade, which he called a "smuggling adventure" and condemned "the great Disgrace of the British character in India".&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Whelan, ''Edmund Burke and India'' (Pittsburgh, 1996), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Burke at [[Gerrard Street, London|37 Gerrard Street]] now in [[Chinatown, London|London's Chinatown]].&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/burke-edmund-1729-1797|title=BURKE, EDMUND (1729–1797)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Edmund Burke==
One of Burke's largest and most developed critics was [[Leo Strauss]], who was thoroughly analyzed by Steven Lenzner. Strauss in his book ''Natural Right and History'' makes a series of points in which he somewhat harshly evaluates Burke's writings.

One of the topics that he first addresses is the fact that Burke creates a definitive separation between happiness and virtue, and explains that "Burke, therefore, seeks the foundation of government 'in a conformity to our duties' and not in 'imaginary rights of man"&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Leo|title=Natural Right and History|publisher=University of Chicago Publication|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo3643753.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenzner|first1=Steven|title=Strauss's Three Burkes: The Problem of Edmund Burke in Natural Right and History|jstor=191417|publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Strauss views Burke as believing that government should focus solely on the duties that a man should have in society as opposed to trying to address any additional needs or desires. Government is simply a practicality to Burke, and not necessarily meant to function as a tool to help individuals live their best lives. Strauss also argues that in a sense, Burke's theory could be seen as opposing the very idea of forming such philosophies. Burke expresses the view that theory cannot adequately predict future occurrences, and thus, men need to have instincts that can't be practiced or derived from ideology.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt;

This leads to an overarching criticism that Strauss holds regarding Burke, which is his rejection of the use of logic. Burke dismisses a widely held view amongst theorists that reason should be the primary tool in the forming of a constitution or contract.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; Burke instead believes that constitutions should be made based on 'natural processes' as opposed to rational planning for the future. Strauss points out, however, that criticising rationality actually works against Burke's original stance of returning to traditional ways because some amount human reason is inherent, and therefore is in part grounded in tradition.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; In regards to this formation of legitimate social order, Strauss does not necessarily support Burke's opinion— that order cannot be established by individual wise people, but exclusively by a culmination of individuals with historical knowledge of past functions to use as a foundation.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; Strauss notes that Burke would oppose more newly formed republics due to this thought,&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; although Lenzner adds the fact that he did seem to believe that America's constitution could be justified given the specific circumstances.&lt;ref name="Lenzner" /&gt; France's constitution, on the other hand, was much too radical as it relied too heavily on enlightened reasoning as opposed to traditional methods and values.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt;

==Religious thought of Edmund Burke==
{{main|Religious thought of Edmund Burke}}
Burke's religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion. Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke, ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1964), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Harris, "Burke and Religion," in David Dwan and Christopher J Insole eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Edmund Burke'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns.&lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt; He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;Harris, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==False quotations==
===When good men do nothing===
The statement that "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" is often attributed to Burke despite the debated origin of this quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bromwich|title=The Intellectual Life of Edmund Burke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wWMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175|year=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=175–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Garson|title=The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/12/04/good-men-do/|website=Quote Investigator|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, however, it is known that in "[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]", Burke wrote that:
{{quote|…when bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrGAIvlkf-sC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=1990 |title=Edmund Burke: appraisals and applications |isbn=978-0-88738-328-1 |author=Daniel Ritchie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbouAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA106| title=Thoughts on the cause of the present discontents |year=1770 |author=Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Stuart Mill]] later made a similar statement in an inaugural address delivered before the University of St. Andrews during 1867:
{{quote|Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DFNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 ''Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St. Andrews, Feb. 1st 1867'' (1867)], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Those who don't know history===
Burke is sometimes credited with [[George Santayana]]'s quote: "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it", but scholars have not found any reliable evidence indicating that Burke actually spoke (or wrote) those words.&lt;ref&gt;It is not among the 67 authentic Burke quotes in ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations''. See {{cite book |last=Bartlett |first=John |editor-last=Kaplan |editor-first=Justin |title=Bartlett's Familiar Quotations: A Collection of Passages, Phrases, and Proverbs Traced to Their Sources in Ancient and Modern Literature |date=1992|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Co |pages=330–332|edition=16th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early work, he elaborated critiques of [[historicism]] and of [[psychologism]] in [[logic]] based on analyses of [[intentionality]]. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called [[Bracketing (phenomenology)|phenomenological reduction]]. Arguing that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] [[consciousness]] sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl re-defined phenomenology as a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental-idealist]] philosophy. Husserl's thought profoundly influenced the landscape of [[20th-century philosophy|twentieth-century philosophy]], and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.

Husserl studied mathematics under the tutelage of [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Leo Königsberger]], and philosophy under [[Franz Brentano]] and [[Carl Stumpf]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper-Wiele, J. K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=HHKhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Totalizing Act: Key to Husserl’s Early Philosophy''] ([[Dordrecht]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Academic Publishers]], 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; He taught philosophy as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]] from 1887, then as professor, first at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] from 1901, then at [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive. Following an illness, he died in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Kockelmans, J. K., ''Phenomenology and the Natural Sciences: Essays and Translations'' ([[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]: [[Northwestern University Press]], 1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rX9QFsqTKv4C&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Youth and education===
Husserl was born in 1859 in [[Proßnitz]], a town in the [[Margraviate of Moravia]], which was then in the [[Austrian Empire]], and which today is [[Prostějov]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children (boy, boy, girl, boy). His father was a [[milliner]]. His childhood was spent in Proßnitz, where he attended the secular elementary school. Then Husserl traveled to [[Vienna]] to study at the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' there, followed next by the Staatsgymnasium in [[Olomouc]] (Ger.: Olmütz).&lt;ref name="KockelmansBiographical"&gt;Joseph J. Kockelmans, "Biographical Note" per Edmund Husserl, at 17–20, in his edited ''Phenomenology. The Philosophy of Edmund Husserl and Its Interpretation'' (Garden City NY: Doubleday Anchor 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HusserlPage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.husserlpage.com/hus_bio.html|title=Husserl Page: Husserl's Biography in Brief|website=www.husserlpage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Leipzig]] from 1876 to 1878, Husserl studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[astronomy]]. At Leipzig he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], one of the founders of modern psychology. Then he moved to the [[Frederick William University]] of [[Berlin]] (the present-day [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]) in 1878 where he continued his study of mathematics under [[Leopold Kronecker]] and the renowned [[Karl Weierstrass]]. In Berlin he found a mentor in [[Thomas Masaryk]], then a former philosophy student of [[Franz Brentano]] and later the first president of [[Czechoslovakia]]. There Husserl also attended [[Friedrich Paulsen]]'s philosophy lectures. In 1881 he left for the [[University of Vienna]] to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of [[Leo Königsberger]] (a former student of Weierstrass). At Vienna in 1883 he obtained his PhD with the work ''Beiträge zur Variationsrechnung'' (''Contributions to the [[Calculus of variations|Calculus of Variations]]'').&lt;ref name="KockelmansBiographical"/&gt;

Evidently as a result of his becoming familiar with the [[New Testament]] during his twenties, Husserl asked to be baptized into the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1886. Husserl's father Adolf had died in 1884. [[Herbert Spiegelberg]] writes, "While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience." At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral "renewal". Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational ''autonomy'' in all things, Husserl could also speak "about his vocation and even about his mission under God's will to find new ways for philosophy and science," observes Spiegelberg.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelberg, H. ''The Phenomenological Movement. A historical introduction''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. {{ISBN|9024702399}}. Vol. I, pp. 85–87. It was reported "from witnesses of Husserl's last days – that Husserl had something like a deathbed conversion." Spiegelberg (1971) at I:85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his PhD in mathematics, Husserl returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to [[Karl Weierstrass]]. Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy. Then professor Weierstrass became very ill. Husserl became free to return to Vienna where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to [[philosophy]]. In 1884 at the [[University of Vienna]] he attended the lectures of [[Franz Brentano]] on philosophy and philosophical [[psychology]]. Brentano introduced him to the writings of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[John Stuart Mill|J. Stuart Mill]], and [[David Hume]]. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e.g., with regard to [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelberg, H., ''The Context of the Phenomenological Movement'' (Berlin/Heidelberg: [[Springer Science+Business Media]], 1981), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XVVFBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134 p. 134].&lt;/ref&gt; Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed [[Carl Stumpf]], a former student of Brentano, to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], seeking to obtain his [[habilitation]] which would qualify him to teach at the university level. There, under Stumpf's supervision, he wrote ''Über den Begriff der Zahl'' (''On the Concept of Number'') in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik]]'' (1891).&lt;ref&gt;Kockelmans, "Biographical Note" per Edmund Husserl, 17–20, at 17–18, in his edited ''Phenomenology'' (Doubleday Anchor 1967). 'Husserl's 'Philosophie der Arithmetik'' is further discussed here below.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 Husserl married Malvine Steinschneider, a union that would last over fifty years. In 1892 their daughter Elizabeth was born, in 1893 their son [[Gerhart Husserl|Gerhart]], and in 1894 their son Wolfgang. Elizabeth would marry in 1922, and Gerhart in 1923; Wolfgang, however, became a casualty of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="HusserlPage" /&gt; Gerhart would become a philosopher of law, contributing to the subject of [[comparative law]], teaching in the United States and after the war in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerhart Husserl; by H. Pallard and R. Hudson |url=http://www.mta.ca/~rhudson/papers/husserl.htm |archivedate=7 February 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207205639/http://www.mta.ca/~rhudson/papers/husserl.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor of philosophy===
[[File:Edmund Husserl 1900.jpg|thumb|Edmund Husserl c. 1900]]
Following his marriage Husserl began his long teaching career in philosophy. He started where he was in 1887 as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. In 1891 he published his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic|Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen]]'' which, drawing on his prior studies in mathematics and philosophy, proposed a psychological context as the basis of mathematics. It drew the adverse notice of [[Gottlob Frege]], who criticized its [[psychologism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., "Illustrative extracts from Frege's Review of Husserl's ''Philosophie der Arithmetik''", translated by P.T.Geach, at 79–85, in Peter Geach and Max Black, editors, ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ Edmund Husserl]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: What the exact impact this criticism by Frege may have had on Husserl's subsequent positions is the subject of debate. See below herein the section "Husserl and the Critique of Psychologism" and the subsection "Philosophy of Logic and Mathematics".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 Husserl with his family moved to the [[University of Göttingen]], where he taught as ''extraordinarius professor''. Just prior to this a major work of his, ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (Halle, 1900–1901), was published. Volume One contains seasoned reflections on "pure logic" in which he carefully refutes "psychologism".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl's ''Logische'', in its disentangling of psychology from logic, also served as preparation for the later development of his work in [[phenomenological reduction]]. [[Marvin Farber]], "Husserl and Philosophical Radicalism. The ideas of a presuppositionless philosophy" 37–57 at 47–48, in Kockelmans, ed., ''Phenomenology'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Paul Ricœur]], ''Husserl. An Analysis of His Phenomenology'' (Northwestern University 1967) at 29–30. Ricœur traces Husserl's development from the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' to his later ''Ideen'' (1913), as leading from the psychological to the transcendental, regarding the intuition of essences (which the methodology of the [[phenomenological reduction]] allows). The book ''Husserl'' contains translations of Ricœur's essays of 1949–1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey. Two years later in Italy he paid a visit to Franz Brentano his inspiring old teacher and to [[Constantin Carathéodory]] the mathematician. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] were also now influencing his thought. In 1910 he became joint editor of the journal ''Logos''. During this period Husserl had delivered lectures on ''internal time consciousness'', which several decades later his former student Heidegger edited for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Vorlesungen zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins'' (1928), translated as ''The Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness'' (Indiana University 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 at Freiburg the journal ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung'' ("Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research") was founded by Husserl and his school, and which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930. His important work ''Ideen''&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideen au einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie'' (1913), translated as ''Ideas. General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'' (New York: Macmillan 1931; reprint Collier), with "Author's Preface to the English Edition" at 5–22. Therein, Husserl in 1931 refers to "Transcendental Subjectivity" being "a new field of experience" opened as a result of practicing [[phenomenological reduction]], and giving rise to an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' science not empirically based but somewhat similar to mathematics. By such practice the individual becomes the "transcendental Ego", although Husserl acknowledges the problem of [[solipsism]]. Later he emphasizes "the necessary stressing of the difference between transcendental and psychological subjectivity, the repeated declaration that transcendental phenomenology is not in any sense psychology... " but rather (in contrast to naturalistic psychology) by the phenomenological reduction "the life of the soul is made intelligible in its most intimate and originally instuitional essence" and whereby "objects of the most varied grades right up to the level of the objective world are there for the Ego... ." ''Ibid.'' at 5–7, 11–12, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in its first issue. Before beginning ''Ideen'' Husserl's thought had reached the stage where "each subject is 'presented' to itself, and to each all others are 'presentiated' (''Vergegenwärtigung''), not as parts of nature but as pure consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, Paul (1967). ''Husserl. An Analysis of His Phenomenology''. p. 33. In his "''Ideen'' period" (1911–1925) Husserl also produced two unpublished manuscripts later referred to as ''Ideen II'' and ''Ideen III''. Ricœur (1967) at 35.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ideen'' advanced his transition to a "transcendental interpretation" of phenomenology, a view later criticized by, among others, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, "La Transcendance de L'Ego. Esquisse d'une description phénoménologique" in ''Recherches Philosophiques'', VI (1937), translated as ''The Transcendence of the Ego. An existentialist theory of consciousness'' (New York: The Noonday Press 1957). Sartre's "disagreement with Husserl seems to have facilitated the transition from phenomenology to the existentialist doctrines of ''[[Being and Nothingness|L'Être et le Néant]]'' [1943]." F. Williams and R. Kirkpatrick, "Translator's introduction" 11–27, at 12, to ''Transcendence of the Ego'' (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ideen'' [[Paul Ricœur]] sees the development of Husserl's thought as leading "from the psychological cogito to the transcendental cogito." As phenomenology further evolves, it leads (when viewed from another vantage point in Husserl's 'labyrinth') to "transcendental subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, Paul (1967). ''Husserl. An Analysis of His Phenomenology''. Northwestern University. pp. 29, 30; cf., 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in ''Ideen'' Husserl explicitly elaborates the eidetic and [[phenomenological reduction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideen'' (1913), translated as ''Ideas'' (1931), e.g., at 161–165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, ''Husserl'' (1967) at 25–27. ''Ideen'' does not address the problem of solipsism. Ricœur (1967) at 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 [[Karl Jaspers]] visited Husserl at Göttingen.

In October 1914 both his sons were sent to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front of World War I]] and the following year one of them, Wolfgang Husserl, was badly injured. On 8 March 1916, on the battlefield of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], Wolfgang was killed in action. The next year his other son [[Gerhart Husserl]] was wounded in the war but survived. His own mother Julia died. In November 1917 one of his outstanding students and later a noted philosophy professor in his own right, [[Adolf Reinach]], was killed in the war while serving in [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name="HusserlPage" /&gt;

Husserl had transferred in 1916 to the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]] ([[Freiburg im Breisgau]]) where he continued bringing his work in philosophy to fruition, now as a full professor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Koestenbaum, "Introductory Essay" ix–lxxvii, at lxxv, in Husserl, ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Stein]] served as his personal assistant during his first few years in Freiburg, followed later by [[Martin Heidegger]] from 1920 to 1923. The mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]] began corresponding with him in 1918. Husserl gave four lectures on Phenomenological method at [[University College, London]] in 1922. The [[University of Berlin]] in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. In 1926 Heidegger dedicated his book ''Sein und Zeit'' (''[[Being and Time]]'') to him "in grateful respect and friendship."&lt;ref&gt;In the 1962 translation ''Being and Time'' by Macquarrie and Robinson, Heidegger states: "Dedicated to ''Edmund Husserl'' in friendship and admiration. Todnauberg in Baden, Black Forest, 8 April 1926".&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl remained in his professorship at Freiburg until he requested retirement, teaching his last class on 25 July 1928. A ''[[Festschrift]]'' to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 April 1929.

Despite retirement, Husserl gave several notable lectures. The first, at Paris in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Pariser Vorträge'' [1929], translated as ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967), by Peter Koestenbaum, with an "Introductory Essay" at ix–lxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; led to ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'' (Paris 1931).&lt;ref&gt;This work was published first in French. Husserl, ''Méditations cartésiennes'' (Paris: Armand Colin 1931), translated by Gabrielle Peiffer and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. A German edition ''Cartesianische Meditationen'' (which Husserl had reworked) came out in 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl here reviews the ''epoché'' or transcendental reduction, presented earlier in his pivotal ''Ideen'' (1913), in terms of a further reduction of experience to what he calls a 'sphere of ownness.' From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts in order to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad.  This '[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental [[intersubjectivity]], which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings.  There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl's description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject.  One argument against Husserl's description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego's gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl's ego in the ''Cartesian Meditations'' itself becomes transcendent. It remains, however, alone (unconnected). Only the ego's grasp "by analogy" of the Other (e.g., by conjectural reciprocity) allows the possibility for an 'objective' intersubjectivity, and hence for community.&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, Paul (1967). ''Husserl. An Analysis of His Phenomenology''. Northwestern University. pp. 82–85, 115–116, 123–142. Ricoeur wonders whether here Husserl does not "square the circle" regarding the issue of [[solipsism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, the [[Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|racial laws]] of the new Nazi regime were enacted. On 6 April Husserl was suspended from the University of Freiburg by the [[Baden|Badische]] Ministry of Culture; the following week he was disallowed any university activities. Yet his colleague Heidegger was elected [[Rector (academic)|Rector]] of the university on 21–22 April, and joined the [[Nazi Party]]. By contrast, in July Husserl resigned from the ''Deutsche Academie''.&lt;ref name="HusserlPage" /&gt;

[[File:Kiepenheuer Institut Freiburg.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics]] in Freiburg, Husserl's home 1937-1938]]
Later Husserl lectured at [[Prague]] in 1935 and [[Vienna]] in 1936, which resulted in a very differently styled work that, while innovative, is no less problematic: ''Die Krisis'' (Belgrade 1936).&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Die Krisis der europäischen Wissenschaften un die transzendentale Phänomenologie'' (Belgrade 1936). "As a Jew who was denied any public platform in Germany, Husserl had to publish, as he had lectured, outside his own country." ''Philosophia'' in Belgrade began its publication. David Carr, "Translator's Introduction" xv–xliii, at xvii, to Edmund Husserl, ''The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' (Northwestern University 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Lauer, "Introduction" 1–68, at 6–7, in Edumund Husserl, ''Phenomenology and the Crisis of Philosophy'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row/Torchbook 1965); translated are two works by Husserl: the 1935 Prague lecture "Philosophy and the Crisis of European Man" [Philosophie und die Krisis der europäischen Menschentums], and the 1911 essay "Philosophy as Rigorous Science" [Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft].&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl describes here the cultural crisis gripping Europe, then approaches a philosophy of history, discussing [[Galileo]], Descartes, several British philosophers, and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The apolitical Husserl before had specifically avoided such historical discussions, pointedly preferring to go directly to an investigation of consciousness. [[Merleau-Ponty]] and others question whether Husserl here does not undercut his own position, in that Husserl had attacked in principle [[historicism]], while specifically designing his phenomenology to be rigorous enough to transcend the limits of history. On the contrary, Husserl may be indicating here that historical traditions are merely features given to the pure ego's intuition, like any other.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David (1970) "Translator's Introduction" xv–xliii, at xxx–xxxi, xxxiv–xxxv, xxxvii–xxxviii (historicism), xxxvi–xxxvii (as given), to Husserl, ''The Crises of European Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ricœur, Paul (1949) "Husserl et le sens de l'histoire", as translated in his ''Husserl. An Analysis of His Phenomenology'' (1967) at pp. 143–174.&lt;/ref&gt; A longer section follows on the "[[life world]]" [''Lebenswelt''], one not observed by the objective logic of science, but a world seen in our subjective experience.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''The Crises of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'' (Northwestern University 1970), e.g., at 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet a problem arises similar to that dealing with 'history' above, a chicken-and-egg problem. Does the life world contextualize and thus compromise the gaze of the pure ego, or does the phenomenological method nonetheless raise the ego up transcendent?&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David (1970) "Translator's Introduction" xv–xliii, at xxxviii–xlii, to Husserl, ''The Crises of European Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; These last writings presented the fruits of his professional life. Since his university retirement Husserl had "worked at a tremendous pace, producing several major works."&lt;ref name="KockelmansBiographical"/&gt;

After suffering a fall the autumn of 1937, the philosopher became ill with [[pleurisy]]. Edmund Husserl died at Freiburg on 27 April 1938, having just turned 79. His wife Malvine survived him. [[Eugen Fink]], his research assistant, delivered his [[eulogy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ Edmund Husserl]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Ritter]] was the only Freiburg faculty member to attend the funeral, as an anti-Nazi protest.

===Heidegger and the Nazi era===
Husserl was incorrectly rumoured to have been denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation of April 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Ott, ''Martin Heidegger, Unterwegs zu seiner Biographie''. Campus Verlag p.168, Walter Biemel "Erinnerungsfragmente" in Erinnerung an Martin Heidegger Neske 1977 S.22&lt;/ref&gt; However, among other disabilities Husserl was unable to publish his works in Nazi Germany; cf. above footnote to ''Die Krisis'' (1936). It was also rumoured that his former pupil [[Martin Heidegger]] informed Husserl that he was discharged, but it was actually the previous rector.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (Cambridge, Mass., &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Apparently Husserl and Heidegger had moved apart during the 1920s, which became clearer after 1928 when Husserl retired and Heidegger succeeded to his university chair. In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed:  e.g., Heidegger substituted ''Dasein'' ["Being-there"] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl. Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of [[Max Scheler]], were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various ''Kant Societies'' in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled ''Phänomenologie und Anthropologie''.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971). ''The Phenomenological Movement. A historical introduction''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. {{ISBN|9024702399}}. Vol. I. pp. 281–283. "Around this time, Husserl also began to refer to Heidegger and Scheler as his philosophical antipodes." Spiegelberg (1970) at p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1997). ''Psychological and Transcendental Phenomenology and the Confrontation with Heidegger (1927–1931)'', translated by T. Sheehan and R. Palmer. Dordrecht: Kluwer. {{ISBN|0792344812}}, which contains his "Phänomenologie und Anthropologie" at pp. 485–500.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the war-time 1941 edition of Heidegger's primary work, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (''Sein und Zeit'', first published in 1927), the original dedication to Husserl was removed. This was not due to a negation of the relationship between the two philosophers, however, but rather was the result of a suggested censorship by Heidegger's publisher who feared that the book might otherwise be banned by the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name = "mohzpp"&gt;"Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten". ''Der Spiegel'', 31 May 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication can still be found in a footnote on page 38, thanking Husserl for his guidance and generosity. Husserl, of course, had died several years earlier. In post-war editions of ''Sein und Zeit'' the dedication to Husserl is restored. The complex, troubled, and sundered philosophical relationship between Husserl and Heidegger has been widely discussed.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl is mentioned by [[Bernard Stiegler]] in the 2004 film ''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 1933, Professor Edmund Husserl addressed the recent regime change in Germany and its consequences:&lt;blockquote&gt;The future alone will judge which was the true Germany in 1933, and who were the true Germans—those who subscribe to the more or less materialistic-mythical racial prejudices of the day, or those Germans pure in heart and mind, heirs to the great Germans of the past whose tradition they revere and perpetuate.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Evans, ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' (Penguin 2003), p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After his death, Husserl's manuscripts, amounting to approximately 40,000 pages of "''[[Gabelsberger shorthand|Gabelsberger]]''" [[stenography]] and his complete research library, were in 1939 smuggled to [[Belgium]] by the Franciscan priest [[Herman Van Breda]]. There they were deposited at [[Leuven]] to form the ''Husserl-Archives'' of the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Peter Koestenbaum, "Introductory Essay" ix–lxxvii, at lxxv–lxxvi, in his edited Edmund Husserl, ''The Paris Lectures'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 2d ed. 1967). His widow Malvine Husserl was instrumental in this rescue project; she became a convert to Catholicism in 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the material in his research manuscripts has since been published in the [[Husserliana]] critical edition series.&lt;ref&gt;Kockelmans, "The Husserl-Archives", at 20–21, in his edited ''Phenomenology'' (Doubleday Anchor 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of his thought==

===Several early themes===
In his first works Husserl tries to combine mathematics, psychology and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects.

From Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between ''proper'' and ''improper'' presenting. In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900–1901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as [[mereology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Peter | last=Simons | author-link=Peter Simons (professor) | title=Parts: A Study in Ontology | publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is [[intentionality]], the notion that the main characteristic of [[consciousness]] is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as "aboutness" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of ''mental phenomena'', by which they could be distinguished from ''physical phenomena''. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the ''[[intentional object]]''). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression "intentional inexistence" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Roderick M. (1967). "Intentionality". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 4: 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The elaboration of phenomenology&lt;!--linked from 'Michel Henry'--&gt;===
Some years after the 1900–1901 publication of his main work, the ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (''Logical Investigations''), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by "[[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called ''[[epoché]]''. These new concepts prompted the publication of the ''Ideen'' (''Ideas'') in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the ''Logische Untersuchungen''.

From the ''Ideen'' onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what we perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]. Husserl proposed that the world of objects—and of ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects—is normally conceived of in what he called the "natural standpoint", which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them. Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we, in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually "constitute" them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply "external" and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or "type". The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but "bracketed" as a way in which we regard objects{{emdash}}instead of a feature that inheres in an object's essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. In order to better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things we perceive (or an assumption underlying how we perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl's thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.&lt;ref name="Boer1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodorus Boer|title=The Development of Husserl's Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XsudxFWboC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=31 December 1978|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-2039-2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of [[intersubjectivity]], specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'', Meditation V). Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] to scientific inquiry (and specifically to [[psychology]]) and what it means to "bracket" the natural attitude. ''The Crisis of the European Sciences'' is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of [[Western philosophy]] and [[science]], emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) [[empirical]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] orientation. Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis,&lt;ref&gt;This assumption led Husserl to an idealistic position (which he originally had tried to overcome or avoid). On Husserl's phenomenological idealism see [[Hans Köchler]], ''Die Subjekt-Objekt-Dialektik in der transzendentalen Phänomenologie. Das Seinsproblem zwischen Idealismus und Realismus''. (''Monographien zur philosophischen Forschung'', Vol. 112.) Meisenheim a. G.: Anton Hain, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and that a science of the mind ('[[:de:Geisteswissenschaft|Geisteswissenschaft]]') must be established on as scientific a foundation as the [[natural science]]s have managed: "It is my conviction that intentional phenomenology has for the first time made spirit as spirit the field of systematic scientific experience, thus effecting a total transformation of the task of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;''Crisis of European Humanity'', Pt. II, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
{{Further|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
Husserl's thought is revolutionary in several ways, most notably in the distinction between "natural" and "phenomenological" modes of understanding. In the former, sense-perception in correspondence with the material realm constitutes the known reality, and understanding is premised on the accuracy of the perception and the objective knowability of what is called the "real world".&lt;ref name="Keen2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Keen|title=Exile and Restoration in Jewish Thought: An Essay In Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZc5313lR8wC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-5308-2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously "presuppositionless" by means of what Husserl calls "[[phenomenological reduction]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology'', tr. W. R. Boyce Gibson (New York: Macmillan, 1962) 96–103, 155–67.&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction is not conditioned but rather transcendental: in Husserl's terms, pure consciousness of absolute Being.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideas'' 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In Husserl's work, consciousness of any given thing calls for discerning its meaning as an "intentional object".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideas'' 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an object does not simply strike the senses, to be interpreted or misinterpreted by mental reason; it has already been selected and grasped, grasping being an etymological connotation, of ''percipere'', the root of "perceive".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, ''Ideas'' 105–109; Mark P. Drost, 'The Primacy of Perception in Husserl's Theory of Imagining,' ''PPR 1'' (1990) 569–82. The German ''begreifen'', cognate with English 'grip,' carries the same sense.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning and object===
From ''Logical Investigations'' (1900/1901) to ''Experience and Judgment'' (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]. He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object.&lt;ref&gt;Burgin, M., ''Theory of Knowledge: Structures and Processes'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FmptDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA468 p. 468].&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this are "the victor in Jena" and "the loser in Waterloo", or "the equilateral triangle" and "the equiangular triangle"; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: "Aristotle", "Socrates", and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called "universal names"; their meaning is a "[[concept]]" and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way we know sensible objects is called "[[Noumenon|sensible intuition]]".

Husserl also identifies a series of "formal words" which are necessary to form [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] and have no sensible [[wikt:correlate#Noun|correlates]]. Examples of formal words are "a", "the", "more than", "over", "under", "two", "group", and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls "formal categories". There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-[[ontological]] categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[Plural|forms of plural]], among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]], [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], part and whole, relation, and so on. The way we know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called "categorial intuition".

Through sensible intuition our [[consciousness]] constitutes what Husserl calls a "situation of affairs" (''Sachlage''). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented to us. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, we are able to constitute a "[[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]]" (''Sachverhalt''). One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. We can use it as basis to say, "''a''&lt;''b''" and "''b''&gt;''a''", two judgments which designate the same state of affairs. For Husserl a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] has a [[proposition]] or [[judgment]] as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base.

===Philosophy of logic and mathematics===
Husserl believed that ''truth-in-itself'' has as [[ontology|ontological]] correlate ''being-in-itself'', just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates. [[Logic]] is a formal theory of [[belief|judgment]], that studies the formal ''a priori'' relations among judgments using meaning categories. Mathematics, on the other hand, is formal ontology; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why we do not deal with sensible objects in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called "categorial abstraction." Through this faculty we are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.

Thanks to "eidetic intuition" (or "essential intuition"), we are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic intuition, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.

Husserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that give us objective knowledge of pure logic. All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted [[noema]]tically) as it is constituted by consciousness needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness).

Husserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it.
* The first stratum is what Husserl called a "morphology of meanings" concerning ''a priori'' ways to relate judgments to make them meaningful. In this stratum we elaborate a "pure grammar" or a logical syntax, and he would call its rules "laws to prevent non-sense", which would be similar to what logic calls today "[[formal language|formation rules]]". Mathematics, as logic's ontological correlate, also has a similar stratum, a "morphology of formal-ontological categories".
* The second stratum would be called by Husserl "logic of consequence" or the "logic of non-contradiction" which explores all possible forms of true judgments. He includes here syllogistic classic logic, propositional logic and that of predicates. This is a semantic stratum, and the rules of this stratum would be the "laws to avoid counter-sense" or "laws to prevent contradiction". They are very similar to today's logic "[[formal language|transformation rules]]". Mathematics also has a similar stratum which is based among others on pure theory of pluralities, and a pure theory of numbers. They provide a science of the conditions of possibility of any theory whatsoever. Husserl also talked about what he called "logic of truth" which consists of the formal laws of possible truth and its modalities, and precedes the third logical third stratum.
* The third stratum is [[metalogic]]al, what he called a "theory of all possible forms of theories." It explores all possible theories in an ''a priori'' fashion, rather than the possibility of theory in general. We could establish theories of possible relations between pure forms of theories, investigate these logical relations and the deductions from such general connection. The logician is free to see the extension of this deductive, theoretical sphere of pure logic.

The ontological correlate to the third stratum is the "[[manifolds|theory of manifolds]]". In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner. It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all. Through the posit of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the [[Apodicticity|apodeictic]] connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved.

According to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s (both [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]), [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra|theory of extension]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s, [[Sophus Lie]]'s theory of [[transformation groups]], and [[Georg Cantor|Cantor's]] [[set theory]].

[[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to "desedimentize" mathematics and the mathematical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Klein's ''Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra'' (MIT Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Husserl and psychologism==

===Philosophy of arithmetic and Frege===
After obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the [[foundations of mathematics]] from a psychological point of view. In his [[habilitation thesis]], ''On the Concept of Number'' (1886) and in his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic (book)|Philosophy of Arithmetic]]'' (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano's descriptive psychology, to define the [[natural number]]s in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and other contemporary mathematicians. Later, in the first volume of his ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena of Pure Logic'', Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the ''Prolegomena'' did not apply directly to his ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''. Some scholars question whether Frege's negative review of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' helped turn Husserl towards [[modern Platonism]], but he had already discovered the work of [[Bernard Bolzano]] independently around 1890/91.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schramm, ''Meinongian Issues in Contemporary Italian Philosophy'', Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, [[G. W. Leibniz]] and [[Hermann Lotze]] as inspirations for his newer position.

Husserl's review of [[Ernst Schröder]], published before Frege's landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes [[sense]] from [[reference]]; thus Husserl's notions of [[noema]] and object also arose independently. Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'', Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept. Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by [[School of Brentano|Brentano and his school]], and may have surfaced as early as Brentano's 1870s lectures on logic.

Scholars such as [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty|J. N. Mohanty]], [[Claire Ortiz Hill]], and [[Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock]], among others, have argued that Husserl's so-called change from [[psychologism]] to [[Platonism]] came about independently of Frege's review.&lt;ref&gt;Consider [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty]], 1995, "The Development of Husserl's Thought" in [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and David Woodruff Smith, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Husserl'', Cambridge University Press. For further commentaries on the review, see Willard, Dallas, 1984. ''Logic and the Objectivity of Knowledge''. Athens OH: Ohio University Press, p. 63; J. Philip Miller, 1982. "Numbers in Presence and Absence, ''Phaenomenologica 90'' (Den Haag: Nijhoff): p. 19 ff.; and [[Jitendra Nath Mohanty]], 1984, "Husserl, Frege and the Overcoming of Psychologism", in Cho, Kay Kyung, ed., ''Philosophy and Science in Phenomenological Perspective, Phaenomenologica 95'' (Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster: Nijhoff), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the review falsely accuses Husserl of subjectivizing everything, so that no objectivity is possible, and falsely attributes to him a notion of [[abstraction]] whereby objects disappear until we are left with numbers as mere ghosts. Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl's ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' we already find two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective. Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work. Frege's attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass's Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives.

Furthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic''. Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind—that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset. He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;''Husserl-Chronik'', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change. In his ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege's ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', and again to question Frege's use of the word ''Bedeutung'' to designate "reference" rather than "meaning" (sense).

In a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the ''Philosophy of Arithmetic'' and Husserl's review of [[Ernst Schröder]]'s ''Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik''. In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schröder's book to analyze Husserl's notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.

Commentators argue that Husserl's notion of [[noema]] has nothing to do with Frege's notion of sense, because ''noemata'' are necessarily fused with [[noesis|noeses]] which are the conscious activities of consciousness. ''Noemata'' have three different levels:
* The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;
* The ''noematic'' senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;
* The [[Modal logic|modalities]] of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on).
Consequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema. Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence concepts with no objects have no [[truth value]] in arguments. Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a "state of affairs." Frege's notion of "sense" is unrelated to Husserl's noema, while the latter's notions of "meaning" and "object" differ from those of Frege.

In detail, Husserl's conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that [[arithmetic]] could be derived from logic. For Husserl this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of [[geometry]]) is the ontological correlate of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other.

===Husserl's criticism of psychologism===
Reacting against authors such as [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]], [[Christoph von Sigwart]] and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i.e. their conception of these abstract and ''a priori'' sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature. According to [[psychologism]], logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical "art" of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did)&lt;ref&gt;See the quotes in Carlo Ierna, “Husserl’s Critique of Double Judgments”, in: Filip Mattens, editor, ''Meaning and Language: Phenomenological Perspectives'', Phaenomenologica 187 (Dordrecht/Boston/London: Springer, 2008, pp. 50 f.&lt;/ref&gt; or a description of the factual processes of human thought. Husserl pointed out that the failure of [[Anti-psychologism|anti-psychologists]] to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side. Pure logic does not deal at all with "thoughts" or "judgings" as mental episodes but about ''a priori'' laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves.

:"Here ‘Judgement’ has the same meaning as ‘proposition’, understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning. This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic. Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions."&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', volume 1, edited by Dermot Moran, trans. by J.N. Findlay (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since "truth-in-itself" has "being-in-itself" as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism. Psychologists have also not been successful in showing how from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] or psychological processes we can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.

This confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as [[Biological determinism|biologism]] and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:

1. The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature. Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i.e., that logic itself proposes ''a priori'' laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic. Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: If we have a formula like "(a + b)(a – b) = a² – b²" it does not tell us how to think mathematically. It just expresses a truth. A proposition that says: "The product of the sum and the difference of a and b ''should'' give us the difference of the squares of a and b" does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement ''is based on'' the theoretical statement "(a + b)(a – b) = a² – b²".

2. For psychologists, the acts of judging, [[reason]]ing, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes. Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes. Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a "metábasis eis állo génos" ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] μετάβασις εἰς ἄλλο γένος, "a transgression to another field").{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} It is a metábasis because psychology cannot possibly provide any foundations for ''a priori'' laws which themselves are the basis for all the ways we should think correctly. Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities. It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on. Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not.

3. Judgments can be true or not true. Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become "evidently" true to us. This evidence, a psychological process that "guarantees" truth, is indeed a psychological process. Husserl responds by saying that truth itself, as well as logical laws, always remain valid regardless of psychological "evidence" that they are true. No psychological process can explain the ''a priori'' objectivity of these [[logical truth]]s.

From this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a Platonist conception of logic. This means that we should regard logical and mathematical laws as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general.

[[David Carr (phenomenology scholar)|David Carr]] commented on Husserl's following in his 1970 dissertation at Yale: "It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task" as originally intended by the radical new science.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David (1970) "Translator's Introduction" xv–xlii, at xxv, to Edmund Husserl, ''The Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology''. Northwestern University.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, he did attract philosophers to phenomenology.

[[Martin Heidegger]] is the best known of Husserl's students, the one whom Husserl chose as his successor at Freiburg. Heidegger's magnum opus ''[[Being and Time]]'' was dedicated to Husserl. They shared their thoughts and worked alongside each other for over a decade at the [[University of Freiburg]], Heidegger being Husserl's assistant during 1920–1923.&lt;ref&gt;Kockelmans, "Introduction [Martin Heidegger]" 267–276, 273, in Kockelmans, editor, ''Phenomenology'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/husserl/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Beyer|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=23 August 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger was at [[Marburg]] 1923–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's early work followed his teacher, but with time he began to develop new insights distinctively variant. Husserl became increasingly critical of Heidegger's work, especially in 1929, and included pointed criticism of Heidegger in lectures he gave during 1931.&lt;ref&gt;See above subsection "Heidegger and the Nazi era".&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger, while acknowledging his debt to Husserl, followed a political position offensive and harmful to Husserl after the [[Nazis]] came to power in 1933, Husserl being of Jewish origin and Heidegger infamously being then a Nazi proponent.&lt;ref&gt;The multivalent, including the "horrifying", aspects of Heidegger in a parallel context are recounted in Peter Eli Gordon, ''Rosensweig and Heidegger: Between Judaism and German Philosophy'' (University of California 2003) at 13–14 (Heidegger and Rosensweig's early "kinship" with him). "In 1929, however, one could still read Heidegger's philosophy without being drawn into a controversy concerning its relationship to [[National Socialism]], [[anti-semitism]], and the like. The German philosophical world as a whole still cloaked itself in a mantle of relative innocence." Gordon (2003) at 303–304. "Rosensweig's work represents the culmination of what is often called the German Jewish Tradition." Gordon, "Preface" (2003) at xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic discussion of Husserl and Heidegger is extensive.

At Göttingen in 1913 [[Adolf Reinach]] (1884–1917) "was now Husserl's right hand. He was above all the mediator between Husserl and the students, for he understood extremely well how to deal with other persons, whereas Husserl was pretty much helpless in this respect."&lt;ref&gt;Edith Stein, "Reinach as a Philosophical Personality'' [Selection from her memoirs] xxvii–xxix, at xxvii, in ''Aletheia'', III (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; He was an original editor of Husserl's new journal, ''Jahrbuch''; one of his works (giving a phenomenological analysis of the law of obligations) appeared in its first issue.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Reinach, "Die apriorischen Grundlagen des bürgerlichen Rechtes" in ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung'', I: 685–847 (1913), translated as "The A Priori Foundation of Civil Law" in ''Aletheia'', III: 1–142 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Reinach was widely admired and a remarkable teacher. Husserl, in his 1917 obituary, wrote, "He wanted to draw only from the deepest sources, he wanted to produce only work of enduring value. And through his wise restrain he succeeded in this."&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, "Reinach as a Philosophical Personality'' [Obituary notice] xi–xiv, at xi, in ''Aletheia'', III (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edith Stein]] was Husserl's student at Göttingen while she wrote her ''On the Problem of Empathy'' (1916). She then became his assistant at Freiburg 1916–1918. She later adapted her phenomenology to the modern school of [[Thomism|Thomas Aquinas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Waltraud Herbstrith, ''Edith Stein. A Biography'' ([1971]; New York: Harper and Row 1985) at 13–14, 24; 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Landgrebe]] became assistant to Husserl in 1923. From 1939 he collaborated with [[Eugen Fink]] at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy|Husserl-Archives]] in Leuven. In 1954 he became leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.

[[Eugen Fink]] was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the ''Sixth Cartesian Meditation'' which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work.  Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.&lt;ref name="HusserlPage" /&gt;

[[Roman Ingarden]], an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In his ''Spór o istnienie świata'' (Ger.: "Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt", Eng.: "Dispute about existence of the world") he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.

[[Max Scheler]] met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at Göttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung'' (1913). Scheler's work ''Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value'' appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler's legal troubles, and Scheler returned to [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;John Raphael Staude, ''Max Scheler'' (New York: Free Press 1967) at 19–20, 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Scheler later criticised Husserl's idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a "phenomenology of love", he states that he remained "deeply indebted" to Husserl throughout his work.

[[Nicolai Hartmann]] was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921 the prestige of Hartmann the Neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, was added to the Movement; he "publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of ''die Phänomenologie''." Yet Hartmann's connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him as a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelberg, Herbert (1971). ''The Phenomenological Movement''. pp. 258–259; 371 (Scheler), 379–384 (use of method).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Levinas]] in 1929 gave a presentation at one of Husserl's last seminars in Freiburg. Also that year he wrote on Husserl's ''Ideen'' (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl's ''Méditations cartésiennes'' (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in [[Lithuania]]. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.&lt;ref&gt;Unsigned "Preface" at vii–x, to ''Emmanuel Levinas. Basic philosophical writings'' (Indiana University 1996), edited by Adriaan Peperzak, Simon Critchley, and Robert Bernasconi.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Schutz]]'s ''Phenomenology of the Social World'' seeks to rigorously ground [[Max Weber]]'s interpretive sociology in Husserl's phenomenology. Husserl was impressed by this work and asked Schutz to be his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;George Walsh, "Introduction", Alfred Schütz, The Phenomenology of the Social World (Illinois 1997) p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] was also largely influenced by Husserl, although he later came to disagree with key points in his analyses. Sartre rejected Husserl's transcendental interpretations begun in his ''Ideen'' (1913) and instead followed Heidegger's ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''The Transcendent of the Ego. An Existentialist Theory of Consciousness'' [1937] (New York: Noonday 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' is influenced by Edmund Husserl's work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the influence of Husserl on Merleau-Ponty's conception of ''l'espace'' as expounded in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "A Phenomenological Account of the Ontological Problem of Space", ''Existentia Meletai-Sophias'', 12 (2002), pp.345–364&lt;/ref&gt; and temporality, including Husserl's theory of [[retention and protention]]. Merleau-Ponty's description of 'motor intentionality' and sexuality, for example, retain the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of ''Ideas I'', yet further concretize what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition.  Merleau-Ponty's most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, "the Philosopher and His Shadow."  Depending on the interpretation of Husserl's accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl's ''Phenomenological Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;Lectures, Summer Semester, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Experience and Judgment'', it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the "eidetic reduction" nor the "pure essence" said to result.&lt;ref&gt;Remy C. Kwant, "Merleau-Ponty's Criticism of Husserl's Eidetic Reduction" in Joseph J. Kochelmans, ''Phenomenology. The Philosophy of Edmund Husserl and its Interpretation'' (Garden City NY: Doubleday Anchor 1967) at 393–408, 394–395, 404–405.&lt;/ref&gt; Merleau-Ponty was the first student to study at the Husserl-archives in [[Leuven]].

[[Gabriel Marcel]] explicitly rejected existentialism, due to Sartre, but not phenomenology, which has enjoyed a wide following among French [[Catholic]]s. He appreciated Husserl, Scheler, and (but with apprehension) Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelberg, Herbert and Schuhmann, Karl (1982). ''The Phenomenological Movement''. Springer. pp. 438–439, 448–449.&lt;/ref&gt; His expressions like "ontology of sensability" when referring to the body, indicate influence by phenomenological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Caponigri, A. Robert (1971). ''A History of Western Philosophy''. University of Notre Dame. Vol. V, pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Gödel]] is known to have read ''[[Cartesian Meditations]]''. He expressed very strong appreciation for Husserl's work, especially with regard to "bracketing" or ''epoché''.

[[Hermann Weyl]]'s interest in [[intuitionistic logic]] and [[impredicativity]] appears to have resulted from his reading of Husserl. He was introduced to Husserl's work through his wife, Helene Joseph, herself a student of Husserl at Göttingen.

[[Colin Wilson]] has used Husserl's ideas extensively in developing his "New Existentialism," particularly in regards to his "intentionality of consciousness," which he mentions in a number of his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Colin Wilson]] |title=Introduction to the New Existentialism |year=1966 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=978-0704504158 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Carnap]] was also influenced by Husserl,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. W., and Thomasson, Amie L. (eds.), 2005, ''Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 8 n. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; not only concerning Husserl's notion of essential insight that Carnap used in his ''Der Raum'', but also his notion of "formation rules" and "transformation rules" is founded on Husserl's philosophy of logic.

Karol Wojtyla, who would later become became Pope [[John-Paul II|John Paul II]] was influenced by Husserl. Phenomenology appears in his major work, ''The Acting Person'' (1969). Originally published in Polish, it was translated by Andrzej Potocki and edited by [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] in the ''Analecta Husserliana''. ''The Acting Person'' combines phenomenological work with [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Wojtyla | first=Karol | author-link=Pope John Paul II | title=The Acting Person: A Contribution to Phenomenological Anthropology | publisher=Springer | year=2002 | isbn=90-277-0985-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edmund Husserl.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque commemorating Husserl in his home town of [[Prostějov]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
[[Paul Ricœur]] has translated many works of Husserl into French and has also written many of his own studies of the philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Paul Ricœur, ''Husserl. An analysis of his phenomenology'' (Northwestern University 1967), collected essays, translated.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other works, Ricœur employed phenomenology in his ''[[Freud and Philosophy]]'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;Ricœur, ''Freud and Philosophy: An essay in interpretation'' ([1965]; Yale University 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] wrote several critical studies of Husserl early in his academic career. These included his dissertation, ''The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy,'' and also his introduction to ''The Origin of Geometry''. Derrida continued to make reference to Husserl in works such as ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.

[[Stanisław Leśniewski]] and [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] were inspired by Husserl's formal analysis of language. Accordingly, they employed phenomenology in the development of [[categorial grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{citation | last=Smith | first=Barry | author-link=Barry Smith (ontologist) | title=On the Origins of Analytic Philosophy | journal=Grazer Philosophische Studien | volume=34 | year=1989 | pages=153–173 | url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/dummett.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Ortega y Gasset]] visited Husserl at Freiburg in 1934. He credited phenomenology for having 'liberated him' from a narrow neo-Kantian thought. While perhaps not a phenomenologist himself, he introduced the philosophy to [[Iberia]] and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelberg, Herbert and Schuhmann, Karl (1982). ''The Phenomenological Movement''. Springer. pp. 658–659.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilfrid Sellars]], an influential figure in the so-called "Pittsburgh School" ([[Robert Brandom]], [[John McDowell]]) had been a student of [[Marvin Farber]], a pupil of Husserl, and was influenced by phenomenology through him:

{{quote|Marvin Farber led me through my first careful reading of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' and introduced me to Husserl. His combination of utter respect for the structure of Husserl's thought with the equally firm conviction that this structure could be given a naturalistic interpretation was undoubtedly a key influence on my own subsequent philosophical strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Sellars | first=Wilfrid | author-link=Wilfrid Sellars | contribution=Autobiographical Reflections | contribution-url=http://www.ditext.com/sellars/ar.html | editor=[[Hector-Neri Castañeda]] | title=Action, Knowledge, and Reality: Critical Studies in Honor of [[Wilfrid Sellars]] | publication-date=1975 | place=Indianapolis | publisher=The Bobbs-Merrill Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hans Blumenberg]] received his habilitation in 1950, with a dissertation on 'Ontological distance', an inquiry into the crisis of Husserl's phenomenology.

[[Roger Scruton]], despite some disagreements with Husserl, drew upon his work in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Scruton, Roger |title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation |publisher=Phoenix |location=London |year=1994 |pages=3-4 |isbn=1-85799-100-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Husserlian phenomenological tradition in the 21st century extends beyond the confines of the European and North American legacies. It has already started to impact (indirectly) scholarship in [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern and Oriental thought]], including research on the impetus of philosophical thinking in the [[history of ideas]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest Between [[Avicenna]] and [[Heidegger]]'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY at Binghamton, 2000); and also refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "[[Avicenna]]'s ''De Anima'' between [[Aristotle]] and [[Husserl]]", in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed.

'''Friedrich Ueberweg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈyːbɐˌveːk|lang}}; 22 January 1826 – 9 June 1871), was a [[Germany|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[history of philosophy|historian of philosophy]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Leichlingen]], in [[Rhine Province|Rhenish Prussia]], where his father was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor.  Educated at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], he qualified at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in philosophy (1852). In 1862 he was called to [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]] as extraordinary professor, and in 1867 he was promoted to the ordinary grade. He married in 1863. Ueberweg died in [[Königsberg]] in 1871.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=556}}

==Philosophy==
At first he followed [[Friedrich Eduard Beneke]]'s [[empiricism]], and strongly opposed the subjectivistic tendency of the [[Kantianism|Kantian]] system, maintaining in particular the objectivity of [[space and time]], which involved him in a somewhat violent controversy. His own mode of thought he preferred later to describe as an ideal [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which refused to reduce reality to thought, but asserted a parallelism between the forms of existence and the forms of knowledge. Beneke and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] exercised most influence upon the development of his thought.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=556}}

==Selected works==
*''De elementis animae mundi Platonicae'' (''On the elements of the [[Platonic realism|Platonic world of ideas]]''), Dissertation, 1850
*''Die Entwicklung des Bewußtseins durch den Lehrer und Erzieher'' (''The development of consciousness by the teacher and educator'', 1853
*''System der Logik und Geschichte der logischen Lehren'' (''System of [[logic]] and history of logic teaching''), 1857;
*''Über Idealismus, Realismus und Idealrealismus'' (''On [[idealism]], realism and ideal-realism''), 1859
*''Über die Echtheit und Zeitfolge der platonischen Schriften'' (''On the authenticity and chronology of the Platonic writings''), 1861
*''[[:de:Grundriß der Geschichte der Philosophie|Grundriß der Geschichte der Philosophie]]'' (''Sketch of the history of philosophy''), I–III, 1863–1866;
*''Schiller als Historiker und Philosoph'' (''Schiller as historian and philosopher''), 1884
*''Gesammelte philosophische Abhandlungen'' (''Collected philosophical papers''), 1889

His compendious ''Sketch of the History of Philosophy'' is remarkable for its fullness of information, conciseness, accuracy and impartiality.

==Biography==

===Early years===
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Chartier was born on December 30, 1966, in [[Glendale, California]], at what is now [[Glendale Adventist Medical Center]], to physician Stanley E. Chartier and Helen L. Bloodworth Chartier, later a realtor. His parents were socially conservative [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s; his physician father had previously worked as an accountant and had taught the subject at local colleges.&lt;ref name=ChartierBio&gt;Gary Chartier, "[http://liberalaw.blogspot.com/2009/08/getting-from-there-to-here-political.html Getting from There to Here]," ''LiberaLaw'' (np, Aug. 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; When Chartier was in high school he became interested in [[political theory]] after reading books by [[Robert Nozick]], [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. He appeared as a guest on [[Wally George]]'s ''[[Hot Seat (talk show)|Hot Seat]]'' television show in 1986 to defend an anarchist manifesto he submitted to the show's producers.&lt;ref name=ChartierBio /&gt;

===College and graduate school===
Chartier received a [[bachelor's degree]] at what is now [[La Sierra University]] in 1987; he graduated ''magna cum laude'' and received the University President's Award. Though he had majored in history and political science, his undergraduate study of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] led to his enrollment in a doctoral program in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[theology]] at what was then [[Claremont Graduate School]]. While at Claremont, where he studied under [[John Hick]], he applied and was accepted into a PhD program in the [[Faculty of Divinity, Cambridge|Faculty of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where his teachers included [[Nicholas Lash]] and  Brian Hebblethwaite, and from which he was graduated in 1991. His dissertation, supervised by Hebblethwaite, focused on the idea of [[friendship]]; his examiners were [[Stephen R. L. Clark]] and  [[Michael Banner]]. By this time, his political views had taken a conventionally [[social democratic]] turn.&lt;ref name=ChartierBio /&gt;

===Law school and La Sierra University faculty appointment===
After working as the editor of a newspaper in [[Temecula]], California, and of a journal published by La Sierra University, and teaching courses in religion and philosophy at [[Loma Linda University]] and [[California Baptist University]], Chartier enrolled at the [[UCLA School of Law]]. At UCLA, he studied with philosophers including Stephen R. Munzer,  [[Seana Shiffrin]], and [[Pamela Hieronymi]], with the political theorist Stephen Gardbaum, with former California Supreme Court Justice [[Cruz Reynoso]], and with constitutional law scholar Kenneth L. Karst; he graduated in 2001 as a member of the [[Order of the Coif]] and as the recipient of the Judge Jerry Pacht Memorial Award in [[Constitutional Law]]. He had served during law school as lecturer in business ethics at La Sierra; a full-time academic appointment began in September 2001. Following a 2005 stint as lecturer in law at [[Brunel University]], Chartier was promoted to the rank of associate [[professor]] and [[tenured]] at La Sierra in 2008. He became associate [[Dean (education)|dean]] of La Sierra's [[business school]] in 2009; he was promoted to the rank of professor in 2012.

===University of Cambridge recognition===
In 2015, the [[University of Cambridge]] presented Chartier with an earned [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] in recognition of his work in legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;See Darla Tucker, "[https://lasierra.edu/article/detail/News/business-prof-awarded-doctor-of-law-degree-by-university-of-cambridge/ Business prof awarded Doctor of Law degree by University of Cambridge]," La Sierra University, Dec. 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional and community involvement===
Chartier serves as a member of the editorial board of the ''Libertarian Papers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarianpapers.org/editorial-board/ ''Libertarian Papers'': editorial board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728030111/http://libertarianpapers.org/editorial-board/ |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a member of the advisory board of and an article reviewer for the ''Journal of Philosophical Economics'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpe.ro/?id=b2 ''Journal of Philosophical Economics''; Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt; as a trustee and senior fellow of the Center for a Stateless Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://c4ss.org/content/author/garychartier C4SS: Gary Chartier]&lt;/ref&gt; a contributor to [[Spectrum (magazine)|''Spectrum'']] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrummagazine.org/authors/gary-chartier ''Spectrum'': Contributors]&lt;/ref&gt; and treasurer (formerly chair and Western Region vice-chair) of the [[Riverside County]] [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rclp.org/officers.htm RCLP: Officers]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a contributor to the ''Bleeding Heart Libertarians'' weblog; he has used the website to argue in favor of anarchy, and against having a criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;See Erik Kain, "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/08/21/criminal-justice-in-a-stateless-society/ Criminal Justice in a Stateless Society]," ''Forbes'', Aug. 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/author/gary-chartier/ Posts by Gary Chartier at ''Bleeding Heart Libertarians]; Also see: [[Bleeding-heart libertarianism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual development==
Chartier had abandoned his earlier libertarian views by the time he entered graduate school. Despite his support for the anti-authoritarian [[New Left]] and the fact that his doctoral dissertation had called for radical political decentralization,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Chartier, "Toward a Theology and Ethics of Friendship" (PhD diss., U of Cambridge 1991) ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; his earlier work in political theory was, perhaps somewhat inconsistently, [[Statism|statist]].&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Gary Chartier, "Peoples or Persons? Revising Rawls on Global Justice," ''Boston College International and Comparative Law Review'' 27.1 (Winter 2004): 1–97; "A Progressive Case for a Universal Transaction Tax," ''Maine Law Review'' 58.1 (2006): 1–16; ''The Analogy of Love: Divine and Human Love at the Center of Christian Theology'' (Exeter: Imprint Academic 2007) 126-8.&lt;/ref&gt; It assumed, without criticism, that remedying poverty and reducing subordination, especially in the workplace, required the activity of the state.

By contrast, Chartier's current work in political theory is [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[anarchist]] in flavor. His return to his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] roots reflects the impact of his encounters with the thought of contemporary [[left-libertarians]] [[Kevin Carson]], [[Roderick T. Long]], and Charles Johnson, as well as a renewed appreciation for [[Stephen R. L. Clark]]'s critique of state authority.&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen R. L. Clark, ''Civil Peace and Sacred Order'', Limits and Renewals 1 (Oxford: Clarendon-OUP 1989); "Slaves and Citizens" and "Anarchists against the Revolution," ''The Political Animal: Biology, Ethics, Politics'' (London: Routledge 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's work, in particular, provided a model for Chartier's reconciliation of his leftist politics with opposition to the state, and helped him to frame a version of [[left-libertarian]] [[market anarchism]] informed by insights from a version of [[natural law]] theory.&lt;ref name=ChartierBio /&gt;

===Moral, political, and legal philosophy===

====General themes====
Chartier defends a variant of natural law thinking, which he has employed in discussions of anarchism, economic life,&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier, ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' (Cambridge: CUP 2009). This book is principally an exercise in [[applied ethics]], in which differences from other natural law views are more described than defended; it nonetheless addresses some more fundamental theoretical issues. These include the differences between natural law views and others regarding the character of [[practical reason]] and the limits of the arguments offered by other natural law theorists regarding the authority of the [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the moral status and claims of non-human animals, as well as such other topics as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law, Same-Sex Marriage, and the Politics of Virtue," ''UCLA Law Review'' 48.6 (Aug. 2001): 1593–1632.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lie|lying]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Toward a Consistent Natural Law Ethics of False Assertion," ''American Journal of Jurisprudence'' 51 (2006): 43–64; "Self-Integration as a Basic Good: A Response to Chris Tollefsen," ''American Journal of Jurisprudence'' 52 (2007: 293–6)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

====Property and economic life====
Chartier offers an understanding of [[property rights]] as contingent but tightly constrained social strategies—reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate [[ownership]] and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust but non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier, ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'' (New York: Cambridge UP 2013) 44-156.&lt;/ref&gt; This account is distinguished both from [[Lockean]] and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from [[consequentialist]] accounts that might license widespread ''ad hoc'' interference with the possessions of groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier, "Natural Law and Non-Aggression," ''Acta Juridica Hungarica'' 51.2 (June 2010): 79–96 and, for an earlier version, ''Justice'' 32–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the [[natural law]] basis for the view that solidaristic wealth [[redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Justice'' 47–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He advances detailed arguments for [[workplace democracy]] rooted in such natural law principles as [[subsidiarity]],&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' 89–120.&lt;/ref&gt; defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier, "Pirate Constitutions and Workplace Democracy," ''Jahrbuch für Recht und Ethik'' 18 (2010): 449–67.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses natural law approaches to [[land reform]] and to the [[occupation of factories]] by workers.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' 123-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He objects on natural-law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally.&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier,' "Intellectual Property and Natural Law," ''Australian Journal of Legal Philosophy'' 36 (2011): 58–88.&lt;/ref&gt; And he develops a general natural law account of [[boycotts]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Justice'' 176-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anarchism====
Chartier identifies himself as a "[[left-wing]] [[market anarchist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Chartier offers this self-description in his [http://www.blogger.com/profile/05687278491211390956 Blogger profile].&lt;/ref&gt; His approach to [[market anarchism]] reflects his indebtedness to [[Kevin Carson]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], the new classical [[natural law]] theory elaborated by [[Germain Grisez]] and [[John Finnis]], the "anarcho-conservatism" of [[Stephen R. L. Clark]], the [[New Left]]-influenced [[Left libertarian#Radical free-marketeers|left-libertarian]] [[decentralism]] of [[Karl Hess]],&lt;ref&gt;For Hess's left-libertarian decentralism, see Karl Hess, ''Dear America'' (New York: Morrow 1975). Re. Chartier as left-libertarian, compare, for instance, blogger TGGP's [http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/the-john-birch-society-was-right/#comment-5165 claim] that "there are plenty of people on the left I would consider unquestionably libertarian. Left-libertarians like [[Kevin Carson]], [[Roderick T. Long|Roderick Long]], Charles Johnson, Gary Chartier, [[Sheldon Richman]] and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[socialism]] and [[individualist anarchism]] of [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;For Tucker's account of the two as compatible, see [http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm "State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree and Wherein They Differ,"] ''Instead of a Book: By a Man Too Busy to Write One'' (New York: Tucker 1897). Cp. Brad Spangler, [http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/473 "Market Anarchism as Stigmergic Socialism"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20110510102306/http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/473 |date=May 10, 2011 }}; Gary Chartier, [http://liberalaw.blogspot.com/2009/06/socialism-revisited.html "Socialism Revisited."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartier argues for anarchism on the basis that the state is unnecessary, illegitimate, and dangerous, and that the elimination of the state will unleash human creativity.&lt;ref&gt;See Chartier, ''Anarchy'' 157-241; Gary Chartier, ''The Conscience of an Anarchist: Why It's Time to Say Good-Bye to the State and Build a Free Society'' (Apple Valley, CA: Cobden 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; His affinity for anarchism differentiates him from other proponents of natural-law ethics. Natural law theorists from St. Thomas [[Aquinas]] to the present have frequently been statists. They have often rejected consent-based theories of state authority as unrealistic, arguing instead, in a manner similar to [[David Hume]]'s, that actually existing states deserve allegiance because of their capacity to preserve order. Chartier contends that the state is not needed to maintain social order, and that natural law theorists need not be attached to it in preference to other means of maintaining order, including [[Norm (sociology)|custom]], [[Convention (norm)|convention]], and various voluntary arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice'' 26-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also linked his concerns with [[anarchism]] and [[natural law]] theory indirectly by defending anarchism against objections levelled by natural law theorist Mark C. Murphy. Murphy has maintained that all arguments for "[[philosophical anarchism]]" fail because they misconstrue the nature of many people's support for the authority of state-made law and that people who believe in the authority of state-made law are entitled to retain their beliefs in the face of anarchist criticism. Chartier argues in response that for many people, at least, belief in state authority is defeasible and can rightly be undermined by positive arguments against particular justifications for the authority of state-made law.&lt;ref&gt;"In Defence of the Anarchist," ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'' 29.1 (2009): 115–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important to his defense of anarchism is his detailed justification for the conclusion that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the institutions of a consensual, polycentric legal order can enforce the law without becoming morally indistinguishable from states.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Chartier, "Enforcing the Law and Being a State," ''Law and Philosophy'' 31.1 (2012): 99–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'', which is not concerned particularly with [[anarchism]], he explicitly challenges the necessity of the [[Sovereign state|state]], and his discussion of ''law'' in a natural law context focuses on "communal norms, rules, and institutions"—which need not be maintained using force and which are intended to be understood as elements of a [[polycentric law|polycentric legal order]]—rather than on state-made laws.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier clearly intends ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' to be read as an anarchist text; see Gary Chartier, "[http://liberalaw.blogspot.com/2009/09/anarchist-text.html An Anarchist Text?]" For the brief challenge to state authority in the book, see ''Justice'' 26-9. Chartier's [[Thomist]] view that multiple possible property systems might (within tight constraints) be just allows for a broader range of property rules than, ''e.g.'', many modern Lockeans might find appropriate; see, ''e.g.'', ''Justice'' 32–46, 69–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Capitalism" and "freed markets"====
Chartier has been an active participant in discussions among [[market anarchists]] and others about the aptness of "capitalism" as a label for what some participants in the conversation have termed "freed markets"in order to distinguish them from existing economic arrangements, which they see as shot through with statist privilege.&lt;ref&gt;For this phrase, see William Gillis, [http://williamgillis.blogspot.com/2007/07/freed-market-one-of-tactics-ive-taken.html (The Freed Market)].&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject [[capitalism]] and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement, while emphasizing that the abuses the [[anti-capitalist]] movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, "it makes sense for [left-libertarians] to name what they oppose 'capitalism.' Doing so . . . ensures that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers—as well as ordinary people around the world who use 'capitalism' as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheldon Richman]], "[http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left: Free-Market Anti-Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal]," ''[[The American Conservative]]'' 10.3 (March 2011): 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt; He has joined [[Kevin Carson]], Charles Johnson, and others (echoing the language of [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Thomas Hodgskin]]) in maintaining that, because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen—by its proponents and by others—as part of the [[socialist]] tradition, and that market anarchists can and should call themselves "socialists."&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier, "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism," "Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?" session, annual conference, [[Association of Private Enterprise Education]] (Cæsar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, [http://c4ss.org/content/1738 "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'"]; Gary Chartier, [http://invisiblemolotov.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/socialist-ends-market-means/ ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays'']. Cp. Tucker, "Socialism."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-human animals====
While supporting vegetarianism and affirming that non-human animals have moral standing,&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Gary Chartier, "Natural Law and Animal Rights," ''Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence'' 23.1 (2010): 33–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Chartier follows [[Stephen R. L. Clark]] in rejecting consequentialist defenses of [[vegetarianism]] like those offered by [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion of [[consequentialism]] and meat purchases in Gary Chartier, "Consumers, Boycotts, and Non-Human Animals," ''Buffalo Environmental Law Journal'' 12 (Spring 2005): 123–94. Singer's own position is articulated in Peter Singer, ''Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals'', 2d ed. (London: Cape 1990); Peter Singer, ''Practical Ethics'', 2d ed. (Cambridge: CUP 1993) 55–63. For Clark's rejection of consequentialist arguments for the vegetarian position he himself endorses, see Stephen R. L. Clark, ''The Moral Status of Animals'', 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon-OUP 1984) x–xi; Stephen R. L. Clark, "Vegetarianism and the Ethics of Virtue," ''Food for Thought: The Debate over Eating Meat'', ed. Stephen F. Sapontzis (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus 2004) 139, 146; Stephen R. L. Clark, ''Animals and Their Moral Standing'' (London: Routledge 1998) 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer acknowledges that, on consequentialist grounds, it might seem as if there is little reason for individuals to be concerned about their dietary choices, since few of those choices will actually have consequences for any actual animals. But Singer maintains that some few dietary choices will, by crossing certain demand thresholds, dramatically increase production of animals for food and that taking this possibility into account provides good reason to avoid purchasing meat, since there is a small chance that a single meat purchase might lead to substantial negative consequences for many animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Singer]], "[[Utilitarianism]] and [[Vegetarianism]]," ''[[Philosophy and Public Affairs]]'' 9 (1980): 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Chartier dissects Singer's argument, maintaining that it is unsuccessful because it fails to take proper account of the actual characteristics of the meat production market (or any similarly enormous market). He examines in detail consequentialist, natural law, and virtue theoretic accounts of boycotting the meat industry, concluding that both natural law and [[virtue theory]] provide limited grounds on which a boycott might be defended, but that consequentialism does not. While he maintains, in tandem with the new classical natural law theorists, that consequentialism is in principle incoherent, he also challenges the factual predictions made by consequentialist proponents of the meat industry boycott.&lt;ref&gt;See Gary Chartier, "On the Threshold Argument against Consumer Meat Purchases," ''Journal of Social Philosophy'' 37.2 (Sum. 2006): 235–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of religion and philosophical theology===

====General topics====
Chartier's work in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology has focused especially on theodicy and divine action, but he has also addressed a range of other topics, including the significance of talk about God as personal, Christology, the relationship between God and ethics, and the idea of substitutionary atonement.

====The meaning of God-language====
Chartier has offered a reading of language about [[Personal god|God as personal]] that partly parallels logical [[behaviorist]] interpretations of talk about consciousness. He suggests that, because we cannot pretend to know what [[God]] is like ''in se'', this sort of reading, while inappropriate when applied to finite persons, could be helpful when used in relation to God.&lt;ref&gt;''Analogy'' 52-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Divine action and theodicy====
He suggests that talk about divine action provides a necessary starting point for theological reflection, and argues that the only reasonable way to think about divine action, in turn, is to begin by considering the constraints on credible talk about [[divine providence]] imposed by the reality of suffering and evil.&lt;ref&gt;For the latter point, see ''Analogy'' 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing a range of options in [[theodicy]], he concludes that, while their underlying assumptions (and accounts of creation) are different, classical [[free will]] [[theism]] and [[process theology]] lead to very similar predictions regarding what kinds of divine action are to be expected, and that, in connection with the task of constructive theology, there is therefore no need to choose between them,&lt;ref&gt;''Analogy'' 39–49.&lt;/ref&gt; though the differences continue to matter with respect to questions in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology.

When he does directly address questions related to [[theodicy]], he implies that [[process philosophy]] offers a more satisfactory theodicy than any alternative approach to theism, but he argues that even the process approach has significant difficulty taking proper account of the reality of animal suffering.&lt;ref&gt;"Non-Human Animals and Process Theodicy," ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]]'' 42.1 (2006): 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains that Christian attempts to use the [[Incarnation]] as a component of theodicy are rendered problematic by the need to articulate belief in incarnational Christology using a robust account of divine action, which seems likely itself to make it harder to resolve the problem of evil (if God is in the business of working miracles, as such a robust view implies, why aren't there more of them?).&lt;ref&gt;See "The Incarnation and the Problem of Evil," ''Heythrop Journal'' 49 (2008): 110–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theism and ethics====
Chartier argues that [[divine command]] views of [[ethics]] turn out to be inconsistent with talk about God's love for the world. Talk about love in this context is meaningful only if some intelligible sense can be given to the notion of the beloved's well being that is independent of the choice of the lover, so the [[theist]] cannot maintain that God is love without acknowledging that some objective sense can be given to the notion of creaturely flourishing apart from God's will. The range of reasonable moral principles is constrained by facts about flourishing, and basic moral norms seem credible independently of the divine volition. And imposing obligations over and above those following from these principles would itself be an unloving thing to do.&lt;ref&gt;''Analogy'' 112-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atonement====
Criticizing [[substitutionary atonement|substitutionary]] accounts of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], Chartier notes that such theories purport to be committed to belief in [[retributive justice]], and thus fall victim to standard objections to retributivism. At the same time, however, by allowing for substituted [[punishment]], they imply a view of justice unlikely to be satisfactory to retributivists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Analogy'' 213-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Chartier is the author of eight scholarly books—''An Ecological Theory of Free Expression'', ''The Logic of Commitment'', ''Public Practice, Private Law'', ''Anarchy and Legal Order'', ''Radicalizing Rawls'', ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'',&lt;ref name="Chartier2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Chartier|title=Economic Justice and Natural Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt14iCgzENUC|date=6 August 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Analogy of Love'', and ''The Conscience of an Anarchist''—and of articles in journals including the ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'', ''Law and Philosophy'', ''Legal Theory'', the ''UCLA Law Review'', and ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]]'', the co-editor (with Charles Johnson) of ''Markets Not Capitalism'' and (with David M. Hart, [[Roderick T. Long]], and Ross Kenyon) of ''Social Class and State Power'', and the editor of ''The Future of Adventism''.

===Reactions to publications===
[[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] praised ''Radicalizing Rawls'': "Chartier has written a book of outstanding merit. ''Radicalizing Rawls'' confirms his place as one of the best political philosophers of our time."&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon, "[https://mises.org/library/john-rawls-and-market-anarchy John Rawls and Market Anarchy]," ''Mises Review'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, March 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions to ''Anarchy and Legal Order'' have been mixed, though frequently positive.

Reviewing the book in ''Common Knowledge'', [[Peter Leeson]] described it as "intriguing" and classed it "among the most sophisticated ethical defenses of anarchy I have encountered."&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Leeson, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Common Knowledge'' 20.3 (2014): 505.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Anarchist Studies'', Eric Roark wrote: "Gary Chartier's ''Anarchy and Legal Order'' offers nothing less than a tremendous contribution to contemporary libertarian and anarchist thought." Roark highlighted what he characterized as a "compelling and rich vision of anarchy forged by a just legal regime."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Roark, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Anarchist Studies'' 21.2 (2013): 106-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Stringham characterized the book as "well written, thought provoking, and a welcome addition to the literature."&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Public Choice'' 159.3-4 (2014): 583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeon Skoble of Bridgewater State University suggested in a ''Reason'' review that Chartier's "arguments [in the book] are laid out with such elegance and precision that any intelligent lay reader should be able to understand them." Skoble writes: "''Anarchy and Legal Order'' is an impressive contribution to libertarian thought generally, and in particular to the ongoing debates on anarchism versus minarchism and on libertarianism's place vis-a-vis the left/right dichotomy. It's a must-read for those interested in political philosophy, and it may well challenge readers' long-held beliefs about the nature of government."&lt;ref&gt;Aeon J. Skoble, "[http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/22/is-anarchism-socialist-or-capitalist Is Anarchism Socialist or Capitalist?]," rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Reason'' (Reason Foundation, April 2013).
&lt;/ref&gt; In a symposium in ''Studies in Emergent Order'' devoted to the book, Skoble added: "Chartier's argument demonstrates not only that natural law theory is compatible with spontaneous order theory, but also that what this confluence points to is a voluntary, polycentric legal order. The book is thus valuable not only for offering a robust defense of polycentrism, but for doing so in a way that ties together two important threads from the liberal tradition, natural law and spontaneous order, and in doing so, enhances our understanding of both."&lt;ref&gt;Aeon J. Skoble, "[http://docs.sieo.org/SIEO_7_2014_Skoble.pdf Natural Law and Spontaneous Order in the Work of Gary Chartier]," ''Studies in Emergent Order'' 7 (2014): 311-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Also writing in the symposium, [[Jason Brennan]] criticized Chartier's reliance on the controversial new natural law theory and objected to his embrace of the theory's view that basic aspects of well being are incommensurable, a view Brennan suggested led to counterintuitive, implausible conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Brennan, "[http://docs.sieo.org/SIEO_7_2014_Brennan.pdf Controversial Ethics as a Foundation for Controversial Political Theory]," ''Studies in Emergent Order'' 7 (2014): 299-306; cp. Jason Brennan, [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/38159-anarchy-and-legal-order-law-and-politics-for-a-stateless-society/ rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier], ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'' (U of Notre Dame, March 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; While expressing some concerns about the feasibility of Chartier's proposals, Paul Dragos Aligica concluded: "''Anarchy and Legal Order'' is currently the book to read if one wants to explore the potential and limits of natural law, non-aggression maxim, praxeology based doctrines of stateless social order. Austrian scholars of all persuasions will benefit immensely from engaging with its arguments and the intellectual precedent it creates."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dragos Aligica, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Review of Austrian Economics'' 26.2 (June 2013): 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.law.uq.edu.au/academic-staff/staff.php?nm=jonathancrowe&amp;tab=profilelink Jonathan Crowe] called ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' "important and original." [http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/philos/chappell.htm Timothy Chappell] declared that it was "[e]ssential reading" and maintained that it was "elegant, clear, and well-informed." According to [http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/index.asp?page=627 Stephen Munzer], it was "perceptive, timely, and beautifully ordered" and featured arguments that were "probing and trenchant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521767200 ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' cover blurbs.]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, St. John's University economist [[Charles Clarke]] criticized the book's anarchism, evaluating it as insufficiently attentive to the need for governmental involvement in the economy and as unduly similar in tone to the work of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]].&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Clark, rev. of ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'', by Gary Chartier, ''Conversations in Religion and Theology'' 9.2 (Nov. 2011): 179-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was the focus of a [[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]] Society session at the April 2011 [[San Diego]] convention of the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s Pacific Division.&lt;ref&gt;The session was chaired by [[Roderick T. Long]]. The commentators were [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]], [[Douglas Rasmussen]], [[Douglas Den Uyl]], Jennifer Baker, and [[Kevin Carson]]. For details, see the Molinari Society's description of the program [http://praxeology.net/molinarisoc.htm#programs here].&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Analogy of Love'' received mixed reviews. In the course of a tepidly favorable assessment, [[Timothy Gorringe]] maintained that some passages disposed him to "reach for the whiskey bottle," though he also observed that the book did "not parade its erudition" and suggested that it was "consistently on the side of the angels."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Gorringe, rev. of ''The Analogy of Love'', by Gary Chartier, ''Theology'', Sep.-Oct 2008: 384–5.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[Ian Markham]] characterized the book as "a rare treat," labelling it "[c]ompelling, well-argued, crystal clear and deeply creative" and identifying it as "[a]n absolute must-read."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1845400917 ''Analogy of Love'' cover blurb.]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Ballard described ''Analogy'' as "extremely well informed and researched," as "comprehensive," and as "rich, sensitive and insightful." Ballard evaluated the book's "style of presentation" as "remarkably lucid and jargon free" and as "spare, simple, direct and logical, cutting to the heart of a discussion." &lt;ref&gt;See Paul Ballard, rev. of ''The Analogy of Love'', by Gary Chartier, ''Theological Book Review'' 20.1 (2008): 54–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephan Kinsella]] has described Chartier's third book as "the best of the crop of political 'conscience' books."&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella's comments appear as a jacket endorsement on the back cover of the book. For an earlier version, see Stephan Kinsella, "[http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/08/22/chartiers-conscience-of-an-anarchist/ Chartier's ''Conscience of an Anarchist'']." The title is a reference to such earlier works as [[Barry Goldwater]]'s ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'', [[Paul Krugman]]'s ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', [[Zell Miller]]'s ''A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat'', and [[Wayne Allyn Root]]'s ''The Conscience of a Libertarian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Riggenbach maintains that "[l]ibertarians who are now in their teens and twenties could do far worse than to let their own attention be captured by Gary Chartier's ''Conscience of an Anarchist''."&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Riggenbach, "[https://mises.org/daily/5355/The-Anarchist-Conscience The Anarchist Conscience]," ''Mises Daily'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, June 10, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aeon Skoble, "Chartier's arguments are logically well structured and rhetorically effective. His writing style is clear and straightforward." Skoble emphasizes that "[p]eople with a background in philosophy or economics will find the arguments interesting and not simplistic, yet any intelligent lay reader will find the book accessible."&lt;ref&gt;Aeon J. Skoble, [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=873 rev. of ''The Conscience of an Anarchist'', by Gary Chartier], ''Independent Review'' 3.16 (Winter 2012): 472.&lt;/ref&gt; Skoble says the book features "five chapters of convincing argument that the state causes terrible problems for no justifiable reason."&lt;ref&gt;Skoble 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''German Romanticism''' was the dominant intellectual movement of German-speaking countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influencing philosophy, aesthetics, literature and criticism. Compared to English Romanticism, the German variety developed relatively late, and, in the early years, coincided with [[Weimar Classicism]] (1772–1805). In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety of Romanticism notably valued wit, humour, and beauty.

The early period, roughly 1797 to 1802, is referred to as ''Frühromantik'' or [[Jena Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, ix&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophers and writers central to the movement were [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]] (1773–1798), [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854), [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] (1772–1829), [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767–1845), [[Ludwig Tieck]] (1773–1853), and [[Friedrich von Hardenberg]] (Novalis) (1772–1801).&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

The early German romantics strove to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, by viewing the [[Middle Ages]] as a simpler period of integrated culture; however, the German romantics became aware of the tenuousness of the cultural unity they sought.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-232415/German-literature |title=German literature – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late-stage German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the daily world and the irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. In particular, the critic [[Heinrich Heine]] criticized the tendency of the early German romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

==Composers==
[[Image:Richard Wagner, Paris, 1861.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=alt text|[[Richard Wagner]], 1860]]
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. In his earlier works, Beethoven was a Classicist in the traditions of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] (his tutor), but his Middle Period, beginning with his third symphony (the '[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'), bridges the worlds of Classical and Romantic music. Because Beethoven wrote some of his greatest music after he became totally deaf, he embodies the Romantic ideal of the tragic artist who defies all odds to conquer his own fate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} His later works portray the triumph of the human spirit, most notably his 'Choral' Symphony No. 9; the stirring '[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]' from this symphony has been adopted as the anthem of the [[European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Johannes Brahms]]. His works are cast in the formal moulds of Classicism; he had a profound reverence for Beethoven. Brahms was also attracted to the exoticism of Hungarian folk music, and used it in such pieces as his famous 'Hungarian Dances', the final movement of his Violin Concerto, and the 'Rondo alla zingarese' from his Piano Quartet No. 1, op. 25, in G minor.
* [[Franz Liszt]]. Liszt was by nationality a [[Hungary|Hungarian]], but nevertheless he spent many years in [[Germany]], and his first language was [[German language|German]]. Credited as the inventor of the [[tone poem]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In his old age, Liszt adopted a more dissonant, ominous flavour, characteristic works being 'la Lugubre Gondola' and 'Die Zelle in Nonnenwerth'—predating [[Impressionist music|Impressionism]] and 20th-century atonality.
* [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. A composer of the Early Romantic period, together with such figures as Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. One of the persons responsible for reviving interest in the almost-forgotten music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Franz Schubert]]. His body of work consists mainly of song cycles and German [[Lieder]] set to poems by his contemporaries, many of which are among the most common repertoire in those categories performed today.
* [[Robert Schumann]]. His works recall the nostalgia of lost childhood innocence, first love, and the magnificence of the German countryside.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} As an influential critic, he played a major role in discovering new talents, among them [[Chopin]] and Brahms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* [[Richard Wagner]]. The greatest composer of German opera; was an exponent of [[Leitmotif]]. One of the main figures in the so-called [[War of the Romantics]].
* [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. Perhaps the very first of Romantic musicians, if we exclude Beethoven, in the sense that Weber was the first major composer to emerge wholly as a product of the Romantic school, as contrasted with Beethoven, who had started off as a Classicist.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The emotional intensity and supernatural, folklore-based themes in his operas presented a radical break from the Neoclassical traditions of that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--In music, "neoclassical" usually refers to a 20th-century movement. Who refers to early 19th-century opera as "neoclassical"?--&gt;

'''Themes and projects'''

'''Existentialism''': the problem of evil and a search for universally valid principles, in a post-WWII-setting. ''Nihilisme? Eit ungt menneskes forsøk på å orientere seg'', 1958;  ''[[Nihilism]]? A Young Man’s Search for Meaning'', 1972. Literary essays in ''Ord'', 1984, and ''Undringa'', 2002.

'''[[Praxeology]]:''' case-oriented studies of what is necessarily (and most often ‘tacitly’) presupposed in basic human acts of different kinds; early Heidegger versus late [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]. ''Praxeology. An Anthology'', ed./co-auth., 1983.  

'''Theory of Truth:''' first, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]’s theory of truth, in a critical analytic perspective, ''Dei filosofiske vilkår for sanning'', 1966, ''Truth and Preconditions. An Interpretation of Heidegger’s Theory of Truth'', 1970; later, by the pragmatic turn, focusing on arguments in public reasoning and self-reflection, both as to universality and contextuality (in between [[Karl-Otto Apel|Apel]], [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], and late Wittgenstein), e.g. ''Rationality and Modernity. Essays in Philosophical Pragmatics'', 1993; ''Wahrheitstheorien'', ed./co-auth., 1977; “Wahrheit und Begründung. Überlegungen zu epistemischen Begriffen und Praktiken“ in ''Reflexion und Verantwortung'', co-ed./co-auth., 2003.

'''Transcendental Pragmatics''', conceived melioristically, focusing on improvement, in critical self-reflection, public reasoning, and ‘thinking through examples’, e.g. by ‘arguments from absurdity’. Mutual learning-processes and mutual recognition as fallible and reasonable human beings, by discursive will-formation. E.g. ''Rationality and Modernity. Essays in Philosophical Pragmatics'', 1993; ''Timely Thoughts''. ''Modern Challenges and Philosophical Responses: Contributions to Inter-Cultural Dialogues'', 2007; “On the Advantage and Disadvantage of Transcendental Pragmatics for Life. A historical perspective on the late [[Frankfurt School]] (Apel, Habermas, Wellmer)”, 2016. 

'''Political theory:''' neo-marxism, alienation, critique of ideology, ''Nymarxisme og kritisk dialektikk'', 1970; ''Er ideologiane døde?'' ed./co-auth., 1970. The notion of a Welfare State under difficult conditions, “The Idea of a Welfare State in a Future Scenario of Great Scarcity”, in ''The Rationality of the Welfare State'', 1996: 28-54; updated version, ''Ideen om ein velferdsstat under vanskelege vilkår'', 2015. The notion of citizenship in modern democracies haunted by multiple and complex crises. Personal autonomy (Mündigkeit) as a regulative idea. E.g. ''Krise og medansvar'' (Crisis and co-responsibility), 2016.

'''Eco-philosophy:''' Marxism and ecology, “Marxisme et écologie”, ''Esprit'' 11/1974, English version in ''The Greening of Marxism'', 1996: 129-136. Science and ecology, “Technological expertise and global ethics in an age of scientization and ecological crisis”, ''Timely'' ''Thoughts'', 2007. Capitalism and ecology, ''The Commercial Ark'', co-ed./co-auth., 1992, ''The Notion of Sustainability'', ed./co-auth., 1994, ''Økonomi, økologi, etikk'', 1999. Ethical gradualism, in ''Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie'' 31/1995; revised English version, “Ethical Gradualism, beyond Anthropocentrism and Biocentrism?” in ''Environment, Embodiment, and Gender'', 2005: 149-177. 

'''Philosophy of the sciences and the humanities:''' ''Objektivitetsproblemet i vitskapane'', ed./co-auth., 1984. ''Vit og vitskap'', 1998. ''Vitskapsteori – positive eller kritisk?'' 2004. “A crisis in the humanities?”, ''Timely Thoughts'', 2007.  At ''Senter for vitskapsteori'' (Center for the studies of the sciences and the humanities), when it was established at the University of Bergen in 1987, there was a research project (financed by the Norwegian Research Council) called “Modernitet – differensiering og rasjonalisering” (Modernity – differentiation and rationalization, in a Weberian sense). See next theme: 

'''Theory of Modernization''', conceived in terms of development of different scientific/scholarly and practice-based forms of rationality and ‘tacit knowing’ (not merely instrumental rationality, but also interpretive and argumentative rationality), historically situated in decisive actors, institutions, and collective experiences. A focus on general modernization processes, but also on special ones – e.g. in Scandinavia: ''Multiple Modernities. A Tale of Scandinavian Experiences'', 2011 (Norwegian version ''Norsk og moderne'', 2010). These countries are characterized by general trust, rule of law, and a general and generous welfare state – how come? (Cf Francis Fukuyama’s ideal: “getting to Denmark!”) Also, in a modern world: general pathologies and challenges; imbalance between institutions; imbalance between institutions and their cultural preconditions; globalized, technology-based capitalism, with ecological challenges, and mass migration. Also in ''Krise og medansvar'', 2016.

'''History of Western Thought:''' A history of philosophy from ancient Greece to the twentieth century, with special emphasis on the history of the sciences and the humanities and on political thinking. English version, ''A History of Western Thought'', 2000, together with Nils Gilje. Available in 17 languages. Norwegian original, ''Filosofihistorie'', first version 1970, 8th edition 2007. 

'''Freedom of expression:''' its justification and challenges, ''Vit og vitskap'', 1998: 88-128. Member of the Norwegian commission for the revision of § 100 (on freedom of expression) in the Norwegian Constitution (1993-1996). Freedom of expression as a precondition for science and democracy, not merely a “western value”. E.g. “On the normative foundation of the freedom of expression: the same freedom for all expressions?” in ''I første, andre og tredje person. Festskrift for Audun Øfsti'', 1999: 319-326. “Ytringsfridom i ei globalisert verd. Med striden om Muhammed-teikningane friskt i minne: korleis kan vi grunngje rettsprinsippet om ytringsfridom i eit globalisert verdssamfunn? ” ''Årbok for Det norske videnskaps-akademi'' 2007:266-282. 

'''Critique of Religion:''' the problem of evil in monotheism (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and its theological and practical implications (cf ''Nihilisme?'' 1958). The inherent need for an open and enlightened critique of religion. The need to avoid unintended blasphemy among strong believers without cultural enlightenment. E.g. ''Herausforderungen der Moderne aus wissenschaftsphilosophischer Sicht'', 2012. Challenges caused by a politicization of religion, without the moderating virtues of cultural enlightenment (be it in the Middle East or the Mid-West); especially in cases of “half-modernization” in terms of modern weaponry and means of communication and premodern mentalities and actions (as in ISIL and Boko Haram). ''Krise og medansvar'', 2016: 67-120.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5139">'''Jean Borella''' (born in [[Nancy, France]], 1930) is a [[Christian]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]]. Borella's works are deeply inspired by Ancient and Christian [[Neoplatonism]], but also by the [[Traditionalist School]] of [[René Guénon]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]].

==Biography==
Borella's father, who was Italian, made a career in military aviation before his death in 1937 in an air crash, when Jean was seven years old. Borella's mother was French from [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Borella had a [[Catholic]] education and traditional public school secondary studies which reinforced in him the idea that he would be a defender of the faith.  By age 14, Borella understood [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] proof of the existence of [[God]]. In 1950, he stayed for a short while in a [[Benedictine]] monastery, but left, disappointed.

Borella attended university in [[Nancy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://angelicopress.org/authors/jean-borella/ Angelico Press, Jean Borella]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Borella's philosophy professors had significant influence on him, [[Veorges Vallin]] and [[Guy Bugault]].  Vallin, [[France|French]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and philosopher, primarily taught the principles of [[Vedanta]].  Bugault taught the philosophy of [[Khâgne]]. While both Vallin and Bugault were readers of Guénon, they did not speak of Guénon in class or in private conversations with Borella. Borella graduated in 1953 with a degree in philosophy, and, in the same year, became familiar with Guénon, and then with Schuon, of whom Borella stated:
::"If there were in my life a man whom I actually regarded as a Master, it is well him."

In 1954, Borella married a Polish woman.

By 1957, Borella was a professor of philosophy in [[Gérardmer]].  In 1962, he became professor in [[Nancy, France]], where he taught philosophy and French until 1977. In 1982, he was at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre]].

Borella has three daughters, the youngest of which is a [[Benedictine]] [[nun]], and four grandchildren.

'''Joaquín Torres García''' (28 July 1874&amp;nbsp;– 8 August 1949) was a Spanish Uruguayan artist painter, sculptor, muralist, novelist, writer, teacher and theorist, active in Spain, United States, Italy, France and Uruguay.

[[File:Ramon Casas - MNAC- Joaquín Torres García- 027317-D 026088.jpg|thumb|[[Ramon Casas]], ''Portrait of Joaquín Torres García'', [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]]]]
Torres Garcia was an [[Avant-garde art|avant gardist]] whose influence encompasses [[Art of Europe|European]], [[Visual art of the United States|American]] and South American modern art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Torres-Garcia Constructions et Symbols|last = Lassaigne|first = Jacques|publisher = Musee d'art de la Ville de Paris|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|title=An Avant-Gardist Who Bridged the Archaic and the New|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/arts/design/an-avant-gardist-who-bridged-the-archaic-and-the-new.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dealt the eternal dilemma between the old and the modern, the classical and the avant-garde, reason and feeling, figuration and abstraction with a simple and brilliant metaphor: there is no contradiction or incompatibility. The same brush strokes serve for a primitive composition or for a mural of [[Renaissance]] inspiration. Like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], he seeks the integration between classicism and modernity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He is known for his collaboration with [[Gaudi]] in 1903 on the stained glass windows for the [[Palma Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coll Tomas|first1=Baltasar|title=Catedral de Mallorca|date=1977|publisher=Museo Capitular|location=Palma de Mallorca|isbn=84-400-3133-5|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sagrada Família]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torres-Garcia|first1=Joaquin|title=Historia de mi vida|date=1939|publisher=Publicaciones de la Asociacion de Arte Constructivo|location=Montevideo|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He decorated with monumental frescoes the medieval [[Palau de la Generalitat]]  seat of the Catalan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.president.cat/pres_gov/president/ca/presidencia/palau-generalitat/|title = El Palau de la Generalitat, seu de la Presidència, Sala 16, Sala de Torres-Garcia|date = |accessdate = |website = Generalitat de Catalunya|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924081358/http://www.president.cat/pres_gov/president/ca/presidencia/palau-generalitat/|archivedate = 24 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His art is associated with archaic universal cultures; Mediterranean cultural traditions, [[Noucentisme]], and Modern Classicism. From 1920 he developed a unique style, encompassing [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], [[De Stijl|Neo plasticism]], [[Primitivism|Primitivisme]], [[Surrealism]], [[Abstract art|Abstraction]] and coined the term Universal Constructivism.

As a theoretician he published more than one hundred and fifty books, essays and articles written in Catalan, Spanish, French, English; "admirable treaties on aesthetics and avant-garde literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jtorresgarcia.com/artist/|title=Artist|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=|website=Joaquin Torres-Garcia Archive|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his lifetime he gave more than 500 lectures. An indefatigable teacher who founded several art schools one in Spain and another in Montevideo and numerous art groups including the first European abstract art group and magazine [[Cercle et Carré]] (Circle and square) in Paris in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cercle et Carre art group|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Cercle-et-Carre|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many artists that have called him "Maestro" (teacher) are [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Hélion|Helion]], Pere Daura, Engel Rozier.

Retrospectives in Paris in 1955 and Amsterdam in 1961 are the earliest to document historically the place of Torres-García in the currents of [[abstract art]]. In the [[United States]] he had important exhibitions in the 1920s, in the 1930s at Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/424185 as] a master of the European Modern Art with [[Jean Arp|Arp]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Juan Gris|Gris]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].

[[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]] and Rose Fried Gallery sponsored important shows from the 1950s.

== Biography ==
==== 1874–1900 ====
Joaquín Torres-García was born in [[Montevideo, Uruguay]] on 28 July 1874. The first child of Joaquim Torras Fradera (son of Joan Torras and Rosa Fradera), an emigrant from [[Mataró]], Spain, and María García Pérez (daughter of José María García, from the [[Canary Islands]], and Misia Rufina Pérez, Uruguayan).  He grew up in his father's general store called the Almacen de Joaquín Torres.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robbins, Daniel (1970). ''Joaquin Torres-Garcia 1874–1949''. Providence: Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Torres "examined the picturesque store situated in the old Square of the Wagons, the arrival point of the raw material of the country for export to Europe. The colonial Montevideo had a port, trains, and a vibrant population dotted with countless gauchos wrapped in capes with whip ready in hand."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Schaefer, Claude (1949). ''Joaquin Torres-Garcia''. Buenos Aires: Editorial Poseidon.&lt;/ref&gt; "Much of his early education in that predominantly agricultural society came from his observation of the things around him&amp;nbsp;... He received his first formal art training when his family returned to Spain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Joaquin Torres-Garcia|last = Doyle Duncan|first = Barbara|publisher = University of Texas|year = 1971|isbn = |location = 1|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1891, Torres-García's father returned to Mataró, Spain, with his wife and three children who became naturalized citizens of Spain ("l'artista uruguaianocatalà Joaquim Torres Garcia").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=El Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya Resum de 600 anys d'art|last1=Roca|first1=Alfons|date=2012|publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya|location=Barcelona|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He  studied with a local painter. He soon showed a strong vocation. The family moved to Barcelona. Torres-García enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Barcelona (Escuela de Bellas Artes de Barcelona), the Baixas Academy (Academia Baixas) and the Saint Lluc Artists Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torres-Garcia Memorial Exhibition|last=Surio|first=Dario|publisher=Rose Fried Gallery|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Torres-García  and Picasso were contemporaries. Both began their artistic lives in modern Barcelona... whose privileged epicenter was the cafe [[Els Quatre Gats]]...The language came from Paris; the favorite models were Toulouse-Lautrec and Steinlen."&lt;ref&gt;Llorens, Tomas (2011). ''J. Torres-Garcia''. New York: Joaquin Torres-Garcia Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; His classmates and friends included [[Ricard Canals]], [[Manolo (sculptor)|Manolo Hugue]], [[Joaquin Mir Trinxet|Joaquim Mir]], [[Isidre Nonell]], Pablo Picasso, and [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio Gonzalez]]. Torres  assiduously  contributed drawings in all the principal newspapers and magazines of the time: ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', ''[[Iris (magazine)|Iris]]'', ''[[Barcelona Cómica]]'' and ''La Saeta''.

In 1900, Torres Garcia's father died.

==== 1901–1909 ====
Miguel Utrillo wrote an article titled "Joaquin Torres-Garcia, Decorator" in [[Els Quatre Gats|Pel i Pluma]], published with a portrait by [[Ramon Casas]], photographs of several paintings by Torres — one on the cover of the magazine — and his first article, called "Impressions".&lt;ref&gt;Utrillo, Miguel. "Joaquin Torres-Garcia, Decorator". ''Pèl i Ploma'' No. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoni Gaudí commissioned Torres in 1903 to create stained-glass windows for [[Palma Cathedral]]. "One of the key events in his career was his intervention (between 1902 and 1905) in the High Altar of the Cathedral of Palma de Majorca, a masterpiece of Spanish Gothic, for which he made the lateral stained glass windows and the small rose window in the apse. His interpretation, of the [[History of Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian symbols]] ... from the [[Song of Songs]] — in the words of Baltasar Coll Tomas — is one of the many dialogues proposed by Torres ... these symbols ... will be reinterpreted in every stage of Torres's long career: the sun, the moon, the star, the well, the garden, the tower, the temple. ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Torres-Garcia Pythagoras – Plato: A Geometric Dialogue, or The Eye of the Soul.|last = Armas Arocena|first = Nicolas|publisher = Museo Coleccao Berardo.|year = 2008|isbn = 978-84-482-5105-5|location = Lisbon|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned murals for Church of San Agustin, Church of the Divina Pastora, and the house [http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/coleccion/autor/torres-garcia-joaquin Torre del Campanar].

[[Eugeni d'Ors]], the intellectual father (and inventor of the term) [[noucentisme]], praised artworks that Torres Garcia shows at [[Sala Parés]] and the Cercle de Sant Lluc that same year. Later will write the prologue to Torres' show in the [[Galeries Dalmau]] in 1912 and includes frequent references of Torres's work in La Ben Plantada, the book which summarizes the ideology of the noucentista. But Torres is far from being an adherent of the ideology indicated by D'Ors; his evolution follows his own theoretical elaboration, explicit already in two texts published before the configuration of noucentisme as a trend around 1910: "Augusta et Augusta" (1904) and "La nostra ordinacio I el nostre cami" (1907). In Classicism, Torres searches for model of order, a language and an adequate cultural reference to overcome the realistic tendency of representation and to develop a Catalan art of capable of universal proportions. Objective which coincides with noucentisme, but Torres's radicalness paradoxically separate him from artists who follow this tendency — Sunyer, Canals, Aragay — and ultimately D'Ors.&lt;ref&gt;Sureda Pons, Joan (1998). ''Torres-Garcia, Pasion Clasica''. Madrid: [[Ediciones Akal]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres-García began teaching art in 1907 and "gradually became involved with an experimental school Colegio Mont d'Or founded by his friend the progressive educator Joan Palau Vera. Contrary to the academic expectations of the day, at Mount D'Or here were no copies from casts, prints or books; drawing went directly to reality: all the common objects of the house from the kitchen to the laboratory were paraded in front of students, as well as leaves, fruits, fish, flowers, animals. The vocabulary of universal constructivism was being developed as an exercise in progressive pedagogy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1909, he married Manuela Piña i Rubíes, a Catalan, with whom he would have four children.

==== 1910–1919 ====
Torres-García traveled to [[Brussels]] to paint a Pavilion in the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International]] World Fair. During this prolonged stay in Paris, he visited friends, museums and galleries. Though different, his art would later share values with [[Cubism]] and the theories exemplified in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (published in 1912), and revealed in the exhibition organized and named by a group of artists: [[Section d'Or]], in Paris (1912).

On his first trip to Italy and Switzerland, Torres-García observed the ancient and the modern: futurism.

In 1911 he exhibited in the VI International Exhibition of Art in Barcelona the iconic painting [http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/filosofia-presentada-palas-parnaso-filosofia-xa-musa-philosophy-presented-pallas "Philosophy X Musa"] which he donated by request of Prat de la Riba to the Institut d'Estudis Catalans where it still is today. "From the moment of its public appearance until today this work has been unanimously interpreted by the historiography as the foundational reference of noucentisme."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Painted a second version of this painting which today is part of the collection of the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.

In 1912 two exhibitions took place at the [[Galeries Dalmau]]: Joaquín Torres-García, with works from his Noucentista period; and Pablo Picasso, drawings from his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue Period]] (February - March 1912).&lt;ref&gt;Josep Palau i Fabre, ''Picasso a Catalunya'', Edicions Polígrafa, S.A., Barcelona, 1975, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934285&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en Exposició de dibuixos i pintures de Joaquim Torres García, Galeries Dalmau, 1912 (exhibition catalogue)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girona.cat/sgdap/movio2/en/index.php?pageId=60 Picasso, ''Veu de Catalunya'', 7 March 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1913, he published his first book, ''Notes sobre Art'' (''Notes on Art''). In the introduction he writes "Aquestes curtes notes poden tenir interès, demes, per anar estretament lligades, com quelcom de viu, a tot o que arrencant de la nostra tradició, en el pensament i en la realitat, tendeix a formar el ver Renaixement e Catalunya" (These short essays may be of interest also because they are closely related to, something that is alive, sprung from our tradition, in thought and in reality,  to form the true Renaissance of Catalonia). Founded the Escuela de Decoración (School of Decoration/Decorative Arts) in Sarrià.  "Prat de la Riba had then his newly formulated conception of Catalan nationalism, and sees in the Mediterranean tradition proposed a positive content for the national profile, rich in spiritual substance. Prat de la Riba protects the painter and commissions the famous frescoes of the Deputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=J. Torres-Garcia|last=Marquina|first=Eduardo|publisher=|year=1933|isbn=|location=Madrid|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he began to create murals for the decoration of the monumental atrium of the Municipal Palace of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Joaquin Torres-Garcia|last = Wheeler|first = Monroe|publisher = University Art Museum University of Texas at Austin|year = 1971|isbn = |location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Today the work of the Palace of the Generalitat of Catalonia is fortunately preserved faithfully in its most substantial core to its original architecture. It was not, however, until 1907, when Enric Prat de la Riba became chairman of the council, which began an important period dedicated to exalt building, parallel to the resurgence of the national political structure.&amp;nbsp;... Also began a series of mural paintings at the Salon Sant Jordi, an important work by the Uruguayan Catalàn artist Joaquim Torres-García, remaining unfinished at the death of Prat de la Riba in 1917, going beyond the utilitarian and decorative to become the new symbol of the Catalonia noucentista."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Roca|first1 = Alfons|title = El Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya Resum de 600 anys d'art|date = 2012|publisher = Generalitat de Catalunya|location = Barcelona|isbn = |page = 22|url = http://www.president.cat/pres_gov/estilos/president/pdf/palau_generalitat_resum_600_anys_art.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006005647/http://www.president.cat/pres_gov/estilos/president/pdf/palau_generalitat_resum_600_anys_art.pdf|archivedate = 6 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He designed, built, and decorated with frescoes his home in Tarrasa, "Mon Repos" and invites friends and pupils to an inauguration party.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcut invitation by artist dated 1915. ill. Eric Jardi 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

"For the next five years, he planned and executed murals in [[fresco]] technique, employing an "Iconostasis" composition, applied to a "pagan" subject matter and then to a modern theme, proving that classic is not solely associated to the Greek. He painted with orthogonal lines the rhythms of the structure used. This was an evolution he described in "El Descubrimiento de si mismo", and in the manifesto "Evolucionista" published in 1916. Torres-García would later use this same composition in his "Constructivist" works." What may be seen as a break in style of the figurative classical theme to the vibrant collage of images of "new" work is rather a deepening understanding the artist has for his work. " In one of the frescoes ...Torres-Garcia represented a gigantic Pan-god with a quote from Goethe's 'Faust' at his feet: 'The temporal is only a symbol'. "That is the key to all the poetics of Torres-García, the will to surrender to the ephemeral in order to reach eternity," explained Llorens. For Torres-Garcia, classicism was the door of a better future, not a brake for modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/culturas/encrucijadas-torres-garcia-llegan-al.html|title=Las encrucijadas de Torres-García llegan al MNAC|last=Penelo|first=Lidia|date=17 May 2011|website=Publico|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 "Torres-García can be seen exploring the grid structure,' on the one hand as an inherent characteristic of a modern city and on the other as a form to explore the symbolic potential of everyday motifs. He also explored the potential for language within images, as in the 1916–17 drawing 'Descubrimiento de si mismo (Discovery of Oneself)."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=Jeremy|date=2011|title=Creative Forks|url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/|journal=Apollo|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibition at Galeries Dalmau of "Joguines d'Art (Artistic Toys)". "The toys teach children which are the correct colors, the correct forms. Each toy is a form, a color that mixes with other shapes and colors and finally becomes a whole: a dog a car a city. The toys guide future generations to acquire a natural eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grandes Artistas: La mirada de los descendientes|last=Molins|first=Javier|publisher=IVAM Institut Valencia d'Art Modern|year=2003|isbn=84-482-3564-9|location=Valencia|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919,  Josep Puig i Cadafalch, the new president of the Mancomunitat cancelled the decoration Saló de Sant Jordi, in the old Palau de la Generalitat. Torres-Garcia decided to visit United States for a couple of years. "he determined to take the pulse of the greatest and most modern of cities, New York."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; " despite being one of the most important artists of the moment, Torres García did not lull, and in 1920 he went to New York to continue exploring what they called modernity, and began to cling to the ephemeral and temporal, what he drew in the city of skyscrapers connects with what John Dos Passos reflected in Manhattan Transfer."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/culturas/encrucijadas-torres-garcia-llegan-al.html|title=Las encrucijadas de Torres-García llegan al MNAC|last=Lidia Penelo|first=|date=&lt;!--Tomas Llorens--&gt;|website=publico.es|access-date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1920–1929 ====
Departs a second time for Paris, with thirty-two crates of paintings. After an encounter with his friend Picasso, who advised him not to leave Paris; "do not to go to America, because it will be like leaping into a void". His work turns from classicism to Cubism, while Picasso's from Cubism to classicism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torres-Garcia a les seves cruilles-Torres-Garcia en sus encrucijadas|last=Arocena Armas|first=Nicolas|publisher=Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|year=2011|isbn=978-84-8043-232-0|location=Barcelona|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Seeking to experience a modern city, he travels to New York with the intention of staying two years. 
He lived at 138 West 49th Street, then 14th Street on the very day he became 46 years old. Shortly afterward at 4 West 29th Street, between Broadway and Fifth Avenue.  Full of enthusiasm, he continued his series of book of sketches of cities he visited. He reflected symbolically the movement and atmosphere of New York. Paints a series of portraits, including one of [[Joseph Stella]]. The vertical city enhances the orthogonal structure of his cityscape. He works at painting scenery and costumes of ''The Great Way'', a story of the joyful, the sorrowful, the glorious. In 1922 he exhibits at The [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|Whitney Studio]] Gallery&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdm16694.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15405coll1/id/567/rec/1 Annual exhibition of painting and sculpture by members of the Club, New York, N.Y., Whitney Studio Club, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Society of Independent Artists]] together with [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and Szukalski. He described his work as "expressionistic and geometric at the same time, and very dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://jtorresgarcia.com/artist/|title = Joaquín Torres-García (1874–1949) One Man, Three Continents|accessdate = 5 October 2015|website = Joaquín Torres-García Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 settles in France, [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]]. In 1926 he has another solo exhibition at Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934429&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en Catàleg de l'Exposició de Joaquim Torres García, organitzada a les Galeries Dalmau del Passeig de Gràcia, del 12 al 25 de juny 1926 Barcelona]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moves to [[Paris between the Wars (1919-1939)|Paris]] for the third time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Throughout the next six years Torres becomes one of the principal animators of abstraction movement between the wars. An ample movement integrated by young artist of several European countries and from 1930 based mainly in Paris and organized in three movements Abstraction-Creation and Cercle et Carre.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
Exhibits 34 works, a series of large classical nudes and paintings from New York at Galerie A. G. Fabre. "Forty works make up this presentation of Torres-Garcia first exhibit here at Galerie Fabre: frescoes, fragments of large murals,  assembled architectural maquettes, still life or figures ...They show the artist under different aspects manifesting all the fiery wealth and complex diversity. Some urban landscapes will give an idea of the passage of Torres-Garcia by New York were feverish spectacle of the business city captivated some time his artistic inquietude in search of its rhythm. Although he has played a major role in the development of the Mediterranean school, Garcia is bent with such a force towards his personal inclination he has always cleared away from the prejudices of isms (schools) that might limit his personal growth"&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Gary.

As correspondent for the Catalan literary magazine Mirador, writes series of articles on painters including an interview of Georges Braque. 'But if Mondrian wanted to explore modernity by a single path, he (Torres-Garcia) wanted to get to the bottom by two paths at the same time, starting from reason but not avoiding intuition'&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== 1930-1939 ====
The structural familiarity of the neoclassical works of the years 1912-1916 with the constructive works of the early thirties is surprising since it contradicts the general opinion shared by critics and historians, that access to constructivism meant for Torres a conversion to [[neoplasticism]] produced by a kind of Parisian contagion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torres-Garcia|last=Llorens|first=Tomas|publisher=Editorial Ausa|year=2003|isbn=84-88810-63-6|location=|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torres finds system between representation and abstraction by the use of signs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"The friendship between [[Theo van Doesburg|Van Doesburg]] and Torres-Garcia will create the foundations for the three most important movements to promote abstract art: "Cercle et Carre" (1929–1930), "[[Art Concret]]" (1930); and "[[Abstraction-Création|Abstraction-Creation]]"(1931–1936)."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torres-Garcia a les seves cruilles-Torres-Garcia en sus encrucijadas|last=Llorens|first=Tomàs|publisher=Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|year=May 2011|isbn=978-84-8043-232-0|location=Barcelona, Spain|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ".. he founded the magazine Cercle et Carre with Theo Van Doesburg, and with many difficulties assembled a group of 80 artists who exhibited in No. 23 rue de la Boetie."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Prof '''John Veitch''' (October 24, 1829 – September 3, 1894), [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]], [[philosopher]], and [[historian]], son of a [[Peninsular War]] veteran, was born at [[Peebles]], and educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=uni&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2093&amp;type=P John Veitch]. University of Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt;

He was assistant lecturer successively to [[Sir William Hamilton, Bart|Sir William Hamilton]] and [[Alexander Campbell Fraser]] (1856–60). In 1860 he was appointed to the chair of [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[rhetoric]] at the [[University of St Andrews]], and in 1864 to the [[Professor of Logic and Rhetoric|corresponding chair at the University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

He lived at 8 Playfair Terrace in St Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;https://fifefhs.org/images/resources/records/parochial-directory/PARISH-OF-ST-ANDREWS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy an [[intuitionism|intuitionist]], he dismissed the [[idealism|idealist]] arguments with some abruptness, and thereby lost much of the influence gained by the force of his personal character. He will be remembered chiefly for his work on Border literature and antiquities. See ''Memoir'' by his niece, Mary RL Bryce (1896).&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

== Biography ==
Jovan is son of [[protoiereus]] Atanasije Došenović. He was born in [[Počitelj (Gospić)|Počitelj]]&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt; in [[Lika]] or [[Velika Pisanica]]. He studied at the [[University of Padua]], where he got his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and other academic degrees. He has lived for a while in his father’s home after returning to Lika, and then worked as a [[bookkeeper]] in [[Trieste]], in a big shop owned by [[Dositej Obradović]]’s friend [[Draga Teodorović]]. He remained there until [[1809]], when he went to [[Pešta]] to publish his writings. "Recommend, brother," Draga told him at their farewell, "let them write and work, there is a world in front of [everyone’s] eyes." "And as long as we have money," Došenović replied happily. In Pešta he printed his [[anthology]] of poems; it was ''Čislenica'' or ''Nauka računa'' (lit. ''Science of Mathematics''), Part I, and he was preparing to publish more to the world. There he got sick, but quickly recovered. After this event, trail on Jovan is lost. However, it is known that in [[1811]] Došenović was still alive; in [[1815]] he has been mentioned among deceased [[Serbs|Serbian]] writers. Besides [[Italian language]] in which he studied, he was able to speak [[French language|French]] and [[German language]]s. After finding some information on his work, [[Jernej Kopitar]] used to put Došenović’s humble beginnings among best products of [[Serbian literature]] of that time, and in literary discussions (via letters sent to friends) he mentioned Došenović’s name several times.&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

== Literary work and critical review ==
Jovan Došenović’s poems can be divided by origin, subject and form. In the first case, he used to translate more than to write on his own. His literary-historical significance is that he appears as the first person who was familiar with someone else’s [[art]] and [[poetry]], and is the first person who started translating poems from other languages. Only this way Serbian readers of that time could get familiar with a variety of poetic forms, seeing that except natural poetry (which was common in renewed Serbian literature) there were other artistic poetry forms, and that in fact this was the most important of all. Došenović cited sources for his translated poems in the [[preface]]s of his books, where he mentions [[Italians]] Iacopo Vittorelli (1749-1835) and [[Giovanni Battista Casti]], and [[Russians|Russian]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. It was not vanity dictating him not to tell for source for every single poem separately. He did not relied on this. Main ideal he was guided by was: is it possible to have different songs in [[Serbian language]] too? That possibility he believed was completely true, so he tried to make everyone else see his printing. While translating his [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]], he did not want to show them to the Serbian publicity. In them he was trying to find only support column, choosing what he thinks is important for [[Serbian literature|Serbian poetry literature]] by form and/or content. Subject he used to write about was love or depicting of natural beauties; by form they were [[anacreontics]], [[sonnet]]s and [[ode]]s. In every Došenović’s [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] it can be seen how hands of poets are being tied and freedom of movement for a used language being cut. He wanted to write poems in popular language spoken by an ordinary man; generally, he actually did write only in [[vernacular language]]. In order to reach a total clearance, he needed to do so much more so that could be achieved successfully. [[Orthography]] was another factor that influenced him as his language was not "clear"; however, he strived to make it that way everywhere...&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

Beginnings of some more specific [[lyricism]] in modern [[Serbian literature]] is directly related to the poetic work of Došenović. He was the first one to come out with new forms of already mentioned [[anacreontics]], [[sonnet]] and even more free [[ode]]s; he was first to begin translating other eminent poets; he was first to show greater freedom and agility in poetic terms, too. All he did was using the famous collection with the preface of the Serbian literature in large-scale, speaking of [[aesthetics]] [[literature]]. Thus, the Došenović is one of the first Serbian literary aestheticians.&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

Došenović did not want to surrender to the way of writing poems in that time; he knew what had to be different; he saw that in other [[people]]s, especially [[Italians]]; he wanted to make a Serbian poem really an ode poem; due to the latter, he gets into fights with anything that was slowing down artistic poetry: using form, language and orthography, and making some successes.&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

'''Manuel Esteban Ancízar Basterra''' (25 December 1812 — 21 May 1882) was a [[Colombia]]n lawyer, writer, and journalist. He founded a publishing house and a newspaper before joining the [[Chorographic Commission]] in 1850.&lt;ref name = "Ancízar"&gt;{{Cite web

==Personal life==
Manuel Esteban was born on 25 December 1812 in [[Fontibon]], [[Bogotá]] to José Francisco Ancízar y Zabaleta, Spaniard native of [[Navarre]], and Juana Bernarda Basterra y Abaurrea, Spaniard native of [[Biscay]]. In 1819 his father, who had served as ''[[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]]'' of [[Zipaquirá]] under the [[Viceroy of New Granada]], [[Juan José de Sámano y Uribarri]]; during the time of the [[Spanish Reconquista|Reconquista]], was forced to flee the capital when the Spanish forces fell at the [[Battle of Boyacá]] and the victorious forces of General [[Simón Bolívar]] entered the capital. The family arrived in [[Cartagena de Indias]], three of Manuel's siblings died in the arduous journey; in 1821 they had to flee again when this Spanish bastion fell to the forces of Admiral [[José Prudencio Padilla López]]. The Ancízar Basterra family landed this time in [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], a safe Spanish colony, where they remained under much impoverished circumstances as refugees; his mother and his only remaining sibling died few years after. In 1832 he graduated from the [[University of Havana|University of Saint Jerome]] in [[Civil law (Common law)|Civil Law]], and two years later received his degree in [[Canon Law]]. On 4 July 1857 he married [[Agripina Samper Agudelo]], sister of [[José María Samper|José María]] and [[Miguel Samper Agudelo]], both writers and prominent politicians in Colombia; together they had five children: Roberto, Pablo, Inés, Jorge, and Manuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Anuario Colombiano de Historia Social y de la Cultura |issue=26-27 |publisher=[[National University of Colombia]] |location=Bogotá |language=Spanish |issn=0120-2456 |oclc=1586457 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcel Gauchet''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡoʃɛ|lang}}; born 1946) is a French [[historian]], [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]]. He is professor emeritus of the [[Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron]] at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] and head of the periodical ''[[Le Débat]]''.

Gauchet is one of France's most prominent contemporary intellectuals. He has written widely on such issues as the political consequences of modern [[individualism]], the relation between [[religion]] and [[democracy]], and the dilemmas of [[globalisation]].

To date, only two of Gauchet's books have been translated into English, most notably ''The Disenchantment of the World: A Political History of Religion.''

Gauchet was awarded the Prix européen de l'essai, fondation Charles Veillon in 2018&lt;ref&gt;[https://fondation-veillon.ch/index.php?tag/2018-marcel-gauchet fondation-veillon.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike Lesser''' (28 September 1943 – 1 July 2015) was a [[mathematical]] [[philosopher]] and [[political activist]]. He was born in London.

==Early life==
The youngest member of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], he was sent, aged 16, to [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] Prison along with most of the Committee. He served two spells as contributor to London's [[Underground press|underground]] journal ''[[International Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|author=Heathcote Williams|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/30/mike-lesser-obituary|title=Mike Lesser obituary|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is an atlas of [[Emergence|emergent]] forms evolving from the apparently chaotic product of a set of iterated logical operations.

He was assistant to the Directing Professor, P. Allen, at the Institute for Ecotechnological Research at [[Cranfield University]].

{{Primary|date=May 2016}}

'''Neo-''völkisch'' movements''', as defined by the historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], cover a wide variety of mutually influencing groups of a radically [[ethnocentric]] character which have emerged, especially in the [[English-speaking world]], since [[World War II]]. These loose networks revive or imitate the ''[[völkisch]]'' movement of 19th- and early 20th-century [[Germany]] in their defensive affirmation of [[white people|white]] identity against [[modernity]], [[liberalism]], [[immigration]], [[multiracialism]], and [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name=GC2002:6&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Some identify as [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]], [[alt-right]], [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], or [[Third Position]]ist; others are politicised around some form of white [[ethnic nationalism]] or [[identity politics]],&lt;ref name=GC2002:6/&gt; and may show [[National Anarchism|right-wing anarchist]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;One example is the [[neo-tribalist]] paganism promoted by [[Else Christensen]]'s [[Odinist Fellowship (United States)|Odinist Fellowship]] (Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 261).&lt;/ref&gt; Especially notable is the prevalence of devotional forms and [[esotericism|esoteric]] themes, so that neo-''völkisch'' currents often have the character of [[new religious movements]].

Included under the neo-''völkisch'' umbrella are movements ranging from [[conservative revolutionary]] schools of thought (''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'', [[European New Right]], [[Julius Evola#Tradition|Evolian Traditionalism]]) to [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[white separatism|white separatist]] interpretations of Christianity, pantheism and paganism ([[Christian Identity]], [[Creativity Movement]], [[William Luther Pierce|Cosmotheism]],
[[Wotansvolk|Nordic racial paganism]]) to [[Neo-Nazi subcultures]] ([[Esoteric Hitlerism]], [[#Nazi Satanism|Nazi Satanism]], [[National Socialist black metal]]).

==Nazi Satanism==
{{Further|Theistic Satanism}}
Among the terms used are Nazi Satanism and Fascist Satanism. Sometimes these groups self-identify as "Traditional Satanism" and consist of small groups in Norway, Britain, New Zealand and France, under names such as [[Black Order (Satanist group)|Black Order]] or Infernal Alliance, which draw their inspiration from the [[Esoteric Nazism]] of [[Miguel Serrano]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 106.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uww'', founder of [[black metal]] fanzine ''Deo Occidi'', denounced [[Anton LaVey]] as a "moderate Jew", and embraced the "esoterrorism" of the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Scandinavian Black Metal]] milieu. Small Satanist grouplets catering to the black metal Satanist fringe include the Black Order, the [[Order of Nine Angles]] (ONA), the Ordo Sinistra Vivendi (formerly the Order of the Left Hand Path) and the Order of the Jarls of Baelder.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne 2002: 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief initiator of Nazi Satanism in Britain has been alleged to be [[David Wulstan Myatt]] (b. 1950), active in neo-Nazi politics from the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The ONA was allegedly led by Myatt&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 218.&lt;/ref&gt; who converted to [[Islam]] in 1998, but renounced Islam in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/biog.html#N11a |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728223342/http://www.davidmyatt.ws/biog.html#N11a |dead-url=yes|title=The Promethean Peregrinations of David Myatt |publisher=Davidmyatt.ws |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of his own Numinous Way philosophy.&lt;ref name="ntnu.no"&gt;Senholt, Jacob C:  ''Political Esotericism &amp; the convergence of Radical Islam, Satanism and National Socialism in the Order of the Nine Angles''.

The Order of Nine Angles "represent a dangerous and extreme form of Satanism" &lt;ref&gt;Per Faxneld: ''Post-Satanism, Left Hand Paths, and Beyond'' in Per Faxneld &amp; Jesper Petersen (eds) ''The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity'', Oxford University Press (2012), p.207. {{ISBN|9780199779246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first attracted public attention during the 1980s and 1990s after being mentioned in books detailing Satanist and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] groups.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;Lewis 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ankarloo and Clark 1999: 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The ONA was formed in the [[United Kingdom]], and rose to public note during the 1980s and 1990s. Presently, the ONA is organized around clandestine cells (which it calls ''traditional nexions''){{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} and around what it calls ''sinister tribes''.&lt;ref name="ntnu.no"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntnu.no/iar/konferanser/satanisminthemodernworld/papers|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120904135538/http://www.ntnu.no/iar/konferanser/satanisminthemodernworld/papers|deadurl=yes|title=Papers, Satanism in the Modern World 19-20 November 2009 - NTNU - NTNU|author=|date=4 September 2012|archivedate=4 September 2012|website=ntnu.no|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy of Satan ministries is another notable [[satanism|satanic]] organization that combines elements of Nazism with Theistic Satanism, believing that the "Aryan race" was genetically-engineered from Nordic extraterrestrials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2006/national-socialist-movement-implodes|title=The National Socialist Movement Implodes|author=|date=|website=splcenter.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order of the Jarls of Baelder==
The Order of the Jarls of Baelder (OJB - which was dissolved in early 2005) was a [[British neopagan]] non-political and non-aligned educational society founded in 1990 by Stephen Bernard Cox who was briefly associated, in the 1980s, with the [[Order of Nine Angles]],&lt;ref&gt;Long, Anton: ''Bealuwes Gast – Of Mythos, Sorcery, and a Mad Mage'', Thormynd Press, Third Edition, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-257-89657-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arkadiusz Sołtysiak. ''NEOPOGAŃSTWO I NEONAZIZM. KILKA SŁÓW O IDEOLOGIACH DAVIDA MYATTA I VARGA VIKERNESA''. Antropologia Religii. Wybór esejów. Tom IV, (2010), s. 173-182&lt;/ref&gt; Cox having published the ONA's book ''Naos'' in 1990 under the imprint of his Coxland Press&lt;ref&gt;Order of Nine Angles: ''Naos'', Coxland Press, England, 1990, {{ISBN|1-872543-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, in 1993, ''Antares'' by the ONA's C. Beest.&lt;ref&gt;''Antares, The Dark Rites of Venus'', Coxland Press, 1993, {{ISBN|1-872543-27-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anti-fascistische Actie Nederland, "The Order of the Jarls or Baelder belonged in the nineties of the last century to the international network of satanic Nazi organizations which the Order of the Nine Angles (ONA) played a pivotal role." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afa.home.xs4all.nl/alert/3_7/mystiek2.html|accessdate=2011-07-13|title=Pieter Zoomers: De mystieke vrienden van een spritueel blad}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OJB - ([[Jarl (title)|Jarl]] is [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] for [[earl]]) - which was renamed the Arktion Federation in 1998 - was also described by Partridge as a fascist Satanist group.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge 2005: 230.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the OJB these allegations are incorrect. Instead, the OJB claimed to have advocated [[Pan-European identity|pan-European]] [[neo-tribalism]], which involved celebration of the rich tapestry of cultural diversity of humanity, study of [[Race Life of the Aryan Peoples|Aryan traditions and heritage]], pursuing the "aeonic destiny of Europe" and the emergence of the elitist [[super race]], as an element of the unfolding of variant global/continental cultural forms. The activities of the OJB, which functioned as a spiritual and heritage group for people of any race or religion, included such activities as [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]], [[hiking]], and the study of [[runes]].&lt;ref name="Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke 2002"&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (2002). ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity''. New York University Press. {{ISBN|0-8147-3124-4}}. (Paperback, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-3155-4}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay]] members were encouraged to join because it was felt they added to the [[male bonding]] of the organization.  The OJB symbol formerly consisted of the [[valknut]] combined with the [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] sign within a broken curved-armed [[swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Its symbol was later changed to a representation of the world tree embracing the [[yin-yang]] and maze with sun and stars.

==Nordic racial paganism==
{{Further|Germanic neopaganism|Neopaganism in German-speaking Europe|Viking revival}}
As defined by Goodrick-Clarke, Nordic racial paganism is synonymous with the [[Odinist]] movement (including some who identify as [[Wotansvolk]]). He describes it as a "spiritual rediscovery of the Aryan ancestral gods...intended to embed the white races in a sacred worldview that supports their tribal feeling", and expressed in "imaginative forms of ritual magic and ceremonial forms of fraternal fellowship".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of research by [[Mattias Gardell]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently published in Gardell's ''Gods of the Blood''.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke traces the original conception of the Odinist religion by [[Alexander Rud Mills]] in the 1920s, and its modern revival by [[Else Christensen]] and her [[Odinist Fellowship (United States)|Odinist Fellowship]] from 1969 onwards. Christensen's politics were left-wing, deriving from [[anarcho-syndicalism]], but she believed that leftist ideas had a formative influence on both Italian Fascism and German National-Socialism, whose totalitarian perversions were a betrayal of these movements' socialist roots. Elements of a leftist and libertarian racial-socialism could therefore be reclaimed from the fascism in which they had become encrusted.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 261.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christensen was also convinced that the diseases of Western culture demanded a spiritual remedy. Mills' almost-forgotten writings inspired her with a programme for re-connecting with the gods and goddesses of the old Norse and Germanic pantheons, which she identified with the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] in [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of the racial [[collective unconscious]]. According to Christensen, therefore, Odinism is organically related to race in that "its principles are encoded in our genes".&lt;ref&gt;Christensen 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ásatrú]] movement as practiced by [[Stephen McNallen]] differed from Christensen's Odinist Fellowship in placing a greater emphasis on ritual and a lesser focus on racial ideology. In 1987, McNallen's [[Asatru Free Assembly]] collapsed from prolonged internal tensions arising from his repudiation of Nazi sympathizers within the organization. A group of these, including [[Wyatt Kaldenberg]], then joined the Odinist Fellowship (as its [[Los Angeles]] chapter) and formed an association with [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], which led to a further rebuff since "Else Christensen thought Metzger too racist, and members of the Arizona Kindred also wanted the Fellowship to be pro-white but not hostile to colored races and Jews".&lt;ref name="GC262"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2002: 262.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of defections from both of the main US-based organizations created secessionist groups with more radical agendas, among them Kaldenberg's ''Pagan Revival'' network and [[Jost Turner]]'s ''[[National Socialist Kindred]]''.&lt;ref name="GC262"/&gt;

Kaplan and Weinberg note that "the religious component of the Euro-American radical right subculture includes both pagan and Christian or pseudo-Christian elements," locating Satanist or Odinist Nazi Skinhead sects in the United States ([[Ben Klassen]]'s atheistic [[Creativity (religion)|Creativity Movement]]), Britain ([[David Myatt]]), Germany, Scandinavia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Weinberg 1998: 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups and terrorists&amp;mdash;including several with neo-fascist or neo-Nazi leanings&amp;mdash;have built their ideologies around pagan religious imagery, including Odinism or Wotanism. One such group is the [[White Order of Thule]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlet and Vysotsky 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members of [[The Order (white supremacist group)|the Order]] were Wotanists (a racial form of Odinism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3578/www.fbi.gov/library/megiddo/megiddo.pdf|title=Project Megiddo|last=Federal Bureau of Investigations|first=|date=1999|website=United States Government Publishing Office|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Behring Breivik|Anders Brievik]], a Norwegian terrorist who committed the [[2011 Norway attacks|2011 Oslo attacks]], identified himself as an Odinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dagen.no/Nyheter/hedning/Breivik-mener-Jesus-er-%C2%ABpatetisk%C2%BB-272638|title=Breivik believes Jesus is "pathetic".|last=Rognsvåg|first=Silje|date=2015|website=Dagen|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wotansvolk|Wotanism]] is another religion that has appeared in the US white supremacist movement, and also utilizes imagery derived from paganism. [[Odalism]] is a European ideology advocated by the defunct [[Heathen Front]] and the [[National Socialist Black Metal]] musician [[Varg Vikernes]].

The question of the relationship between Germanic neopaganism and the neo-Nazi movement is controversial among German neopagans, with opinions ranging across a wide spectrum. Active conflation of neo-fascist or [[far right]] ideology with paganism is present in the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'' and ''[[Deutsche Heidnische Front]]''. In Flanders, ''[[Werkgroep Traditie]]'' combines Germanic neopaganism with the ideology of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]''.

In the [[United States]], Michael J. Murray of [[Ásatrú Alliance]] (in the late 1960s an [[American Nazi Party]] member)&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 1997; [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=451 The New Barbarians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227160315/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=451 |date=27 December 2007 }} (Southern Poverty Law Center intelligence report, Winter 1998). Since the Alliance's foundation in 1988, Murray has emphasized that it "does not advocate any type of political or racial extremist views or affiliations" towards sympathizing Neo-Nazis.&lt;/ref&gt; and musician/journalist [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] (who turned to "[[metagenetic]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golem-net.de/Ausg13/interview.htm |title=2003 interview with the German esotericist magazine '&amp;#39;Der Golem'&amp;#39; |publisher=Golem-net.de |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518204113/http://www.golem-net.de/Ausg13/interview.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asatru in the mid-1990s),&lt;ref name=ESOTERRA5&gt;"Wulfing One" 1995 (interview with Michael Moynihan in ''EsoTerra'' magazine).&lt;/ref&gt; though Moynihan states that he has no political affiliations.&lt;ref name=WWLORD&gt;Zach Dundas. "Lord of Chaos: ACTIVISTS ACCUSE PORTLAND WRITER AND MUSICIAN MICHAEL MOYNIHAN OF SPREADING EXTREMIST PROPAGANDA, BUT THEY'RE NOT TELLING THE WHOLE STORY".

Mattias Gardell claims that while older US racist groups are Christian and patriotic ([[Christian Identity]]), there is a younger generation of [[white supremacism|white supremacists]] who have rejected both  Christianity and mainstream right-wing movements.&lt;ref name="Kaplan 1997"&gt;Kaplan 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Many neo-Nazis have also left Christianity for neopaganism because of Christianity's Jewish roots, and patriotism in favour of Odinism because they view both Christianity and the United States government as responsible for what they see as the evils of a liberal society and the [[White genocide conspiracy theory|decline of the white race]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardell 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan claims that there is a growing interest in one form of Odinism among members of the radical racist right-wing movements.&lt;ref name="Kaplan 1997"/&gt; Berger judges that there has been an aggregation of both racist and non-racist groups under the heading of "Odinism", which has confused the discussion about neo-Nazi Neopagans, and which has led most non-racist Germanic neopagans to favour terms like "Ásatrú" or "Heathenry" over "Odinism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger 2005: 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the 1999 [[Project Megiddo]] report issued by the [[FBI]] used "Odinism" as referring to white supremacist groups exclusively, sparking protests by the [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]], Stephen McNallen expressing concern about a "pattern of anti-[[European-American]] actions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/FBI_007.htm CESNUR] (Center for Studies on New Religions) news release, 10 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tempelhofgesellschaft==
The older ''Tempelhofgesellschaft'' (THG) was built in the 1980s by a few members of the Nazi "Erbengemeinschaft der Tempelritter". The leader of this group was the former police officer Hans-Günter Fröhlich who resided in Germany/Homburg. The group had close links to the German-speaking far-right network. Its first publication was ''Einblick in die magische Weltsicht und die magischen Prozesse'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Strube, 2012"&gt;Strube, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Tempelhofgesellschaft was founded in [[Vienna]] in the early 1990s by [[Norbert Jurgen-Ratthofer]] and [[Ralft Ettl]] to teach a [[Dualistic cosmology#Duotheism, bitheism, ditheism|dualist]] form of [[Christianity|Christian]] religion called [[Marcionism]] and a form of [[gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity
By [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] NYU Press {{ISBN|9780814732373}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWAslJvCK3IC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=Tempelhofgesellschaft+gnosticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh0arRib3RAhVhwlQKHaHVAqoQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Tempelhofgesellschaft%20gnosticism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This one was a part of the main THG/Homburg. The group identifies an "evil creator of this world," the [[Demiurge]] with [[Jehovah]], the God of [[Judaism]], and holds that [[Jesus Christ]] was an [[Aryan]], not Jewish. They distribute pamphlets claiming that the [[Aryan race]] originally came to [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] from the star [[Aldebaran]] (this information is supposedly based on "ancient [[Sumer]]ian manuscripts"). They maintain that the Aryans from Aldebaran derive their power from the [[vril]] energy of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]. They teach that since the Aryan race is of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin it has a divine mission to dominate all the other races. It is believed by adherents of this religion that an enormous space fleet is on its way to Earth from Aldebaran which, when it arrives, will join forces with the ''[[Nazi UFOs|Nazi Flying Saucers from Antarctica]]'' to establish the ''Western Imperium''.&lt;ref name="Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strube, 2012"/&gt; Its major publication is called ''Das Vril-Projekt'' (1992).

After the THG had been dissolved, Ralf Ettl founded the ''Freundeskreis'' (circle of friends) Causa Nostra. It remains active and maintains relations to far-right publishers like the Swiss Unitall-Verlag.&lt;ref name="Strube, 2012"/&gt;

The '''Nokdong Seowon''' in Urok-ri, Gachang-myeon, [[Daegu]], [[South-Korea]] was erected in 1789 to worship the memory of [[Kim Chung-seon]]  (1571–1642), a Japanese general who defected to Korea during the Japanese invasion (1592–1598). This [[seowon]] was abolished in 1864 as part of the regent [[Daewon-gun]]'s general campaign against the seowons, but was reestablished in 1914 under [[Korea under Japanese rule|the Japanese colonial regime]].  The Nokdong Seowon remains a popular destination for Japanese tourists in Daegu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daegutour.or.kr/eng/citytour/citytour3_15a.html|title=Nokdong Seowon|work=Daegutour.or.kr|author=Daegu Tourist Information Center|accessdate=2007-02-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008092415/http://www.daegutour.or.kr/eng/citytour/citytour3_15a.html|archivedate=2007-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utour.daegu.go.kr/eng/guide/news/news/1200698_2730.asp|title=Nokdong Seowon|work=Daegutour.go.kr|author=Daegu Tourist Information Center|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Oliver Letwin''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRSA}} (born 19 May 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/dorsetwest/ |title=Election Guide 2010 » Dorset West |work=UK Polling Report |year=2013 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician. He has served as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[West Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|West Dorset]] since 1997. He was [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] from 2014 to 2016.

Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], Letwin was given overall responsibility for the [[Cabinet Office]] and became a full member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] in the [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative government]]. Previously, he had been the Minister of State for Government Policy from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/minister-of-state-cabinet-office-providing-policy-to-the-prime-minister-in-the-cabinet-office#previous-holders-of-this-role |title=Minister of State for Government Policy |work=[[GOV.UK]] |date=11 May 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also chairman of the [[Conservative Research Department]] and chaired the [[List of UK Conservative Party general election manifestos|Conservative Party's Policy Review]] from 2005 to 2010.

==Early life and education==
Letwin is the son&lt;!-- siblings ? --&gt; of [[William Letwin]] (14 December 1922 – 20 February 2013), [[emeritus professor]] at the [[London School of Economics]], and the [[conservatism|conservative]] academic [[Shirley Robin Letwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3602801/Letwins-parents-are-the-key-to-his-soul.html |title=Letwin's parents are the key to his soul – Telegraph |first=Melanie |last=McDonagh |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=20 February 2004 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/dec/07/oliver-letwin-profile-meeting |title=Oliver Letwin: more at home in a senior common room than at a public meeting |first=Michael |last=White |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were "[[Jewish-American]] intellectuals from [[Chicago]] whose parents had fled persecution from [[Kiev]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9908371/Professor-William-Letwin.html |title=Obituary: Professor William Letwin |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=4 March 2013 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[The Hall School, Hampstead]], at [[Eton College]] and then at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliamentaryrecord.com/content/profiles/mp/Oliver-Letwin/West-Dorset/680 |title=Oliver Letwin MP: Personal Details |work=Westminster Parliamentary Record |year=2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219065849/http://www.parliamentaryrecord.com/content/profiles/mp/Oliver-Letwin/West-Dorset/680 |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Letwin was a member of the [[Cambridge University Liberal Club]]. When asked about his membership of the Liberal Club he explained: "I was also a member of the [[Fabian Society]].  But I am sorry to have to tell you that this was because I was interested in the thoughts of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and Fabians (and still am) rather than because I was ever a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] or a Fabian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/business/oliver-letwin-is-the-reasonable-politician-who-bankers-feel-they-can-trust-6554783.html |title=Oliver Letwin is the reasonable politician who bankers feel they can trust |first=Chris |last=Blackhurst |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to 1981, Letwin was a visiting fellow (a Procter Fellow) of [[Princeton University]], then a research fellow of [[Darwin College, Cambridge]], from 1981 until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliamentaryrecord.com/content/profiles/mp/Oliver-Letwin/West-Dorset/680#Non-Parliamentary-Career |title=Oliver Letwin MP: Non Parliamentary Career |work=Westminster Parliamentary Record |year=2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219065849/http://www.parliamentaryrecord.com/content/profiles/mp/Oliver-Letwin/West-Dorset/680#Non-Parliamentary-Career |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis, ''Emotion and Emotions'', earned a [[PhD]] awarded by the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Cambridge|Cambridge Philosophy Faculty]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=10785 |title=Newton Library Catalogues |work=Cambridge University Library |year=2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
From 1983 to 1986, he was a member of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Number 10 Policy Unit|Policy Unit]].

According to official government documents from 1985, released in December 2014 under the [[Thirty-year rule|30 years rule]], Letwin recommended the Prime Minister to "use Scotland as a trail-blazer for the pure residence charge", i.e. the controversial [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] or 'Poll tax', having trialled it there first, and to implement it nationwide should "the exemplifications prove... it is feasible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/interactive/2014/dec/30/scotland-poll-tax-thatcher-letwin-national-archives |title=Oliver Letwin's memorandum recommending Scottish poll tax trial in 1985 |work=The Guardian |date=30 December 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 1985 internal memo released in December 2015 showed Letwin's response to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]], which blamed the violence on the "bad moral attitudes" of the predominantly Afro-Caribbean rioters, claiming that "lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale". It also criticised some of the schemes proposed to address inner-city problems, suggesting [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young's]] proposed scheme to support black entrepreneurs would founder because the money would be spent on the "disco and drug trade”. Letwin later apologised, saying that parts of the memo had been "both badly worded and wrong."&lt;ref name="BBC_2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letwin apologises over 1985 Broadwater Farm riot memo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35192265|accessdate=30 December 2015|publisher=BBC|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holton|first1=Kate|title=British policy chief apologises for 30-year-old race comments|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-race-letwin-idUKKBN0UD0VQ20151230|accessdate=30 December 2015|agency=Reuters|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= |title= Oliver Letwin blocked help for black youth after 1985 riots|work= The Guardian |date= 30 December 2015&lt;!--|accessdate=30 December 2015--&gt;| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letwin co-authored ''Britain's biggest enterprise: ideas for radical reform of the NHS'', a 1988 [[Centre for Policy Studies]] pamphlet written with [[John Redwood]] which advocated a closer relationship between the [[National Health Service]] and the private sector. This is regarded as providing a theoretical justification for NHS reforms carried out by subsequent governments, particularly the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~alexss/nhs.pdf |title=Liberating the NHS: source and destination of the Lansley reform |first1=Dr. Lucy |last1=Reynolds |first2=Dr. John |last2=Lister |first3=Dr. Alex |last3=Scott-Samuel |first4=Professor Martin |last4=McKee |work=University of Liverpool |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letwin stood unsuccessfully against [[Diane Abbott]] in [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] at the 1987 election, and against [[Glenda Jackson]] for the [[Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Highgate]] seat in the 1992 election.

He won the historically safe Conservative seat of [[West Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|West Dorset]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], achieving a majority of 1,840 votes over the next candidate.

===Shadow cabinet===
As [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] [[William Hague]] appointed Letwin as a member of his [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury|Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] in September 2000. He supported [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]] in their consecutive tenures as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

He had previously been an official Opposition spokesman on Constitutional Affairs, Scotland and Wales from 1998, and was promoted to [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury|Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] in 1999.

During the campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Letwin expressed an aspiration to curtail future [[public spending]] by £20&amp;nbsp;billion per annum relative to the plans of the [[Labour Government 1997-2007|Labour government]]. When this proposal came under attack as regressive, Letwin found few of his colleagues to defend it, and he adopted a low profile for the remainder of the campaign. He went into hiding during the 2001 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334380.stm|title=Letwin comes out of exile|publisher=BBC News|date=16 May 2001|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this election, his majority in his [[West Dorset]] [[constituency]] was cut to 1,414 votes.

In September 2001, he was appointed [[Shadow Home Secretary]] by the new Conservative Party leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. In this role, he attracted plaudits for his advocacy of a "neighbourly society", which manifested itself in calls for street by street neighbourhood policing, modelled on the philosophy of the police in New York. He was also largely credited with forcing the then [[Home Secretary]] to withdraw his proposal in 2001 to introduce an offence of incitement to religious hatred. He successfully argued that such an offence would be impossible to define, so there would be little chance of prosecution. He also argued that Muslims would feel persecuted by such a law. In late 2003, [[Michael Howard]] appointed Letwin as his successor as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. As Shadow Chancellor he focused on reducing waste in the public sector.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the Conservative Party claimed to have found £35&amp;nbsp;billion worth of potential savings, to be used for increased resources for front-line services and for tax cuts. This approach was credited with forcing the government to introduce bureaucracy reduction and cost-cutting proposals of their own. In May 2005, Letwin's majority in his seat increased to 2,461 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/199.stm |title=Election 2005 Results: Dorset West |work=[[BBC News]] |date=23 May 2005 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Letwin was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that he had requested a role less onerous than his former Treasury brief so that he would have time to pursue his career in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charter|first=David| url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/letwin-asks-for-less-demanding-job-vjrsc96g9lm|title=Letwin asks for less demanding job |work=The Times|date=10 May 2005|accessdate=20 April 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until December 2009, he was a non-executive director of the merchant bank [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|NM Rothschild Corporate Finance Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Register of Members' Interests, 6 September 2010 |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/regmem/?d=2010-09-06#10355 |work=They Work For You |publisher=MySociety |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Michael Howard]]'s decision to stand down as Conservative Party leader after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], Letwin publicly backed the youngest candidate and eventual winner [[David Cameron]].

In the lead-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Letwin played an important role in the development of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative policy]], and was described by [[Daniel Finkelstein]] as "the [[Gandalf]] of the process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The wizard behind Cameron’s little blue book |first=Daniel |last=Finkelstein |authorlink=Daniel Finkelstein |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/daniel_finkelstein/article7096751.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |title=Profiles of men trying to negotiate a Tory-Lib Dem deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8672065.stm |work=BBC News |location=London| date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 general election saw him increase his majority to 3,923 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/f07.stm |title=Election 2010 : Constituency Dorset West |work=[[BBC News]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government and Cabinet Minister===
British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] appointed Letwin to the newly-created office of [[Cabinet Office|Minister of State for Government Policy]] in the newly-formed [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government]] in May 2010. His responsibilities included developing government policies with the Cabinet Office, as set out in the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition's programme for government]], as well as implementing departmental business plans. He also attended the Cabinet, although not as a full member or Cabinet Minister.

Letwin was appointed as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] on 14 July 2014, succeeding [[Lord Hill of Oareford]] who became the [[United Kingdom]]'s next [[European Commissioner]]. Letwin also continued in his role as Minister for Policy until the 2015 general election, when the position was abolished.

He was returned with a much increased majority of 16,130 votes by his West Dorset constituents at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. Following that election, Letwin remained [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and Cameron also appointed him as a full member of the new Conservative government's [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] with responsibility for overall charge and oversight of the [[Cabinet Office]].

After the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]], the new Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] put Letwin in charge of the "Brexit unit" on 14 July; and he ceased to be the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-oliver-letwin-eu-referendum-live-updates-minister-baby-no-plan-contingency-a7121126.html|title=Minister for Brexit defends doing absolutely no contingency planning for Brexit|date=5 July 2016|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814 |title=Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out? |publisher=BBC News |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public sector spending==
Letwin maintains the public is willing to increase taxes carefully for large numbers of people to pay for improved public services.  Letwin said, “It may well be, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a little more on the crucial public services that do need more spent on them”.  Letwin wants to see better public services rather than higher public sector pay.  Letwin believes reducing the deficit is important so Britain is protected when the next downturn comes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-40428817/letwin-well-judged-and-careful-tax-increases Letwin: 'Well-judged and careful tax increases'] Retrieved 28 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/28/oliver-letwin-government-tax-rises-public-services-nhs Oliver Letwin: government must look at tax rises for sake of public services] ''[[The Guardian]]'' Retrieved 28 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===1985 Broadwater Farm memo controversy===
In 1985 Letwin and [[Hartley Booth]] wrote a five-page document&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/oliver-letwin-newly-released-papers-reveal-ministers-appalling-attitude-towards-black-rioters-a6790026.html | title=Oliver Letwin: Minister apologises after newly-released papers reveal 'racist' attitude towards black rioters Archive revealed ‘disgusting’ advice delivered to Mrs Thatcher | work=The Independent | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015 | last1=Milmo|first1=  Cahal | last2=Wright|first2= Oliver | last3=Morris|first3= Nigel}}&lt;/ref&gt; as members of then-Prime Minister Thatcher's policy unit in response to the widespread 1985 unrest in Britain’s inner cities – with riots in [[Broadwater Farm riot|Broadwater Farm estates]] in [[Tottenham]], [[North London]], [[1985 Handsworth riots|Handsworth]], [[1985 Brixton riot|Brixton]], [[Peckham]] and [[1981 Toxteth riots#1985 riot|Toxteth]].&lt;ref name=BBC2540397&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_2540000/2540397.stm|title=1985: Riots in Brixton after police shooting|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=28 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/30/brixton-riots-1985-archive|title=From the archive: Riots in Brixton after police shooting|first=Gareth |last=Parry|first2= Susan |last2=Tirbutt |first3=David |last3=Rose|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28248588|title=Police blamed over 1985 Cherry Groce Brixton shooting|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28248588|title=Police blamed over 1985 Cherry Groce Brixton shooting|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2486315&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/1/newsid_2486000/2486315.stm|title=1985: Riots erupt in Toxteth and Peckham|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper Letwin and Booth urged "Thatcher to ignore reports that rioting in mainly black urban areas was the result of social deprivation and racism."&lt;ref name="NYT_2015_12_dec" /&gt; In 1985 Letwin was then considered to be a "young star" of the Conservative Party.

Letwin claimed it would not ameliorate the situation but would do little more than "subsidise Rastafarian arts and crafts workshops" stating that black "entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade."&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_dec_30"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/30/oliver-letwin-blocked-help-for-black-youth-after-1985-riots | title=Oliver Letwin blocked help for black youth after 1985 riots: Cameron’s policy chief makes apology over advice to Thatcher that assistance would benefit ‘disco and drug trade’ and Rastafarian crafts | work=The Guardian | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015 | last=Travis|first= Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the 1985 paper was released to public record by the [[Cabinet Office]] along with other Whitehall papers under accelerated procedures of the [[Thirty-year rule|30 years rule]] into the public record through the National Archives in [[Kew]], West London&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; on 30 December 2015, a chastened Letwin apologised on the same day for "the offence caused."&lt;ref name="NYT_2015_12_dec"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/world/europe/oliver-letwin-riots.html?_r=0 | title=Release of 1985 Race Riots Memo Prompts Apology From Cameron Aide | work=New York Times | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015 | last=Erlanger|first= Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_dec_30"/&gt;

[[Trevor Phillips]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], former head of the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] observed that, "I don’t think these remarks would have raised a single eyebrow at the time."&lt;ref name="Guardian_2015_Perraudin"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/30/oliver-letwin-1985-memo-darcus-howe-david-lammy | title=Oliver Letwin memo borders on criminality, says Darcus Howe Civil liberties campaigner condemns comments about black communities made in 1985 as David Cameron’s policy chief issues an apology | work=The Guardian | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015 | last=Perraudin|first= Frances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1985 Broadwater Farm memo argued the riots were caused by bad behaviour not social conditions.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35192265 | title=Letwin apologises over 1985 Broadwater Farm riot memo | publisher=BBC | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy unit proposed a programme for creating "better attitudes," including measures to encourage the establishment of 'old-fashioned independent schools' which Cabinet Secretary Sir [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Robert Armstrong]] warned in 1985 constituted [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering.]]&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

{{quote|"The root of social malaise is not poor housing, or youth 'alienation' or the lack of a middle class....Lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years in appalling slums without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale; in the midst of the depression, people in Brixton went out, leaving their grocery money in a bag at the front door, and expecting to see groceries there when they got back...Riots, criminality and social disintegration are caused solely by individual characters and attitudes. So long as bad moral attitudes remain, all efforts to improve the inner cities will founder...[Lord] Young’s new entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade; Kenneth Baker’s refurbished council blocks will decay through vandalism combined with neglect; and people will graduate from temporary training or employment programmes into unemployment or crime."|Oliver Letwin and Hartley Booth. November 1985. Policy Broadwater Farm memo to Prime Minister Thatcher (released to public domain on 30 December 2015)}}

Labour MP [[Chuka Umunna]] said the tone of the memo was "positively Victorian." "The attitudes towards the black community exhibited in the paper are disgusting and appalling...The authors of this paper illustrate a complete ignorance of what was going on in our community at that time, as evidenced by their total and utter disregard of the rampant racism in the Met Police which caused the community to boil over – there is no mention of that racism in their paper."&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; In July 2014 the [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], apologised "unreservedly" for the shooting and the time it had taken to say sorry" following an inquest into the death of Dorothy "Cherry" Groce, whose shooting by the Metropolitan Police triggered the riots. The jury inquest blamed the Metropolitan Police for failures that contributed to Groce's death.&lt;ref name=BBC28248588&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28248588|title=Police blamed over 1985 Cherry Groce Brixton shooting|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28248588|title=Police blamed over 1985 Cherry Groce Brixton shooting|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2486315&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/1/newsid_2486000/2486315.stm|title=1985: Riots erupt in Toxteth and Peckham|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expenses===
''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported in 2009 that Letwin agreed to repay a bill for £2,145 for replacing a leaking pipe under the tennis court at his constituency home in Dorset, which he had claimed on his parliamentary expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5314236/Oliver-Letwin-repays-2000-tennis-court-bill-MPs-expenses.html |title=Oliver Letwin repays £2,000 tennis court bill |first=Gordon |last=Rayner |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 May 2009 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sector reform===
Speaking to consultancy firm [[KPMG]] on 27 July 2011, Letwin caused controversy after stating that you cannot have "innovation and excellence" without "real discipline and some fear on the part of the providers" in the public sector. This was widely reported, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' headline stating Letwin says 'public sector workers need "discipline and fear"'.&lt;ref name="Guardian_2015_july_publicsector"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/30/public-sector-jobs-oliver-letwin?CMP=twt_gu |title= Public sector workers need 'discipline and fear', says Oliver Letwin: Coalition's policy chief on reforms believes excellence would be achieved through fear of losing jobs and real discipline|work= The Guardian |date= 30 July 2015|accessdate=30 December 2015| location=London|last=Boffey |first=Daniel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government document disposal===
In October 2011 the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported a story that Letwin had thrown away more than 100 secret government documents in public bins in [[St. James's Park]], with no real care to dispose of them properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/oliver-letwin-caught-throwing-away-85337 |title=Oliver Letwin caught throwing away secret papers in public bins |first=Andrew |last=Gregory |work=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=14 October 2011 |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=9975-9950 |oclc=223228477 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8826113/Oliver-Letwin-Cabinet-Office-minister-threw-documents-into-park-bins.html |title=Oliver Letwin: Cabinet Office minister threw documents into park bins |first=James |last=Kirkup |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 October 2011 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enquiries made by the Information Commissioner's Office found that although Letwin did not dispose of any government documents, he had in fact disposed of constituents' personal and confidential letters to him and therefore did breach data protection rules.&lt;ref name="guardian_2011_nov"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/15/oliver-letwin-breached-data-protection |title=Oliver Letwin breached data protection laws, report confirms: Information commissioner forces minister who dumped documents in park bin to sign pledge on personal data |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letwin later apologised for his actions.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Personal life==
Letwin married Isabel Davidson in 1984; the couple have two children.

In 2003, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported Letwin saying that he would "go out on the streets and beg" rather than send his children to the state schools in [[Lambeth]] where he and his family lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Clarkson |title=The World According to Clarkson |chapter=Chapter 74 |publisher=Penguin |year=2004 |isbn=0-14-101789-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/letwin-id-rather-beg-than-send-child-to-innercity-school-90698.html |title=Letwin: I'd rather beg than send child to inner-city school |first=Paul |last=Waugh |work=[[The Independent]] |date=10 October 2003 |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media|INM]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0951-9467 |oclc=185201487 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two strangers on his London street had asked if they could use his lavatory in 2002, and he agreed to let them do so, they then stole his credit cards and other belongings. He retrieved his credit cards after chasing the accomplices in his dressing gown and pyjamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9248392/Wealthy-Cabinet-minister-Oliver-Letwin-takes-in-lodgers-at-his-London-home.html |title=Wealthy Cabinet minister Oliver Letwin takes in lodgers at his London home |first=Richard |last=Eden |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=6 May 2012 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1748347.stm |title=Tories signal law and order shift |work=[[BBC News]] |date=8 January 2002 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter of Capua'''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Capuano, Pietro Capuano or Caputo, Pietro Cardinale di Capua, Petrus Capuanus&lt;/ref&gt;  (died August 1242) was an Italian theologian and [[scholastic philosopher]], and a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]&lt;ref&gt;From 1193.[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories-xii.htm], as Pietro Caputo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[papal legate]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Maleczek,''Papst und Kardinalskolleg von 1191 bis 1216' (Wien, 1984) pp.117-124''' &lt;/ref&gt;

Peter was a member of an [[Amalfi]]tan family. After a being a teacher at the [[University of Paris]], he was employed by [[Pope Innocent III]] as legate.  He made trips to [[Poland]] and [[Bohemia]] in 1197, bringing decision of introducing [[celibacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paweł Jasienica]] ''Polska Piastów'' (first edition PIW 1960, last edition Czytelnik 1996, {{ISBN|83-07-02415-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as legate to France from 1198. He made a truce between [[Richard I of England]] and [[Philip II of France]], in December 1198.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08013a.htm], [http://san.beck.org/AB20-Europe12thCentury.html], {{cite web |url=http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/maxpages/classes/His311/Lecture%20Two/Crusades.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831170950/http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/maxpages/classes/His311/Lecture%20Two/Crusades.html |archivedate=2006-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Peter's meeting with Richard and [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], the northerners found Peter's appearance and obsequious style of diplomacy to be repellent. Peter did succeed in convincing Richard to agree to a conditional five-year truce, but when he persisted in asking that Richard also release [[Philip of Dreux]] (a [[Bishop of Beauvais-Noyon-Senlis|Bishop of Beauvais]] whom the king intensely hated) Richard lost his temper and threatened to castrate Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jonathan. ''The Fourth Crusade and the Siege of Constantinople''. 2004. page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter then took part in the [[Fourth Crusade]]. While in [[Constantinople]] he acquired [[relics]], including the purported body of [[St. Andrew]], which he brought in the end to [[Amalfi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryscathedral.co.uk/standrew.html National Shrine to St Andrew&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811164307/http://stmaryscathedral.co.uk/standrew.html |date=2013-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22414">In [[metaphysics]], the '''problem of universals''' refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.&lt;ref name="Moreland, Universals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moreland|first=J.P.|title=Universals|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773522697|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[property (philosophy)|Properties]] are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common. The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], are referred to as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of ''being circular'' or ''exemplifying circularity'',&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; or two daughters that have in common ''being the female offsprings of Frank.'' There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in [[reality]] or merely in thought and speech.

==Positions&lt;!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as example, three positions are:
* [[Platonic realism]] (also called "'''extreme realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Herbert Hochberg, "Nominalism and Idealism," ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;): beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.
* [[Aristotelian realism]] (also called "'''strong realism'''"&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;): beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.
* [[Anti-realism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.

Extreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable variant of anti-realism is [[nominalism]].&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;

===Realism&lt;!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Metaphysical realism}}
The realist school claims that universals are real—they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res'') and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus'').&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. For example, a common realist argument, supposedly found in Plato, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence "[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician". The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.&lt;ref&gt;(MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §1b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominalism&lt;!--&lt;!--linked from 'Anti-realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Nominalism}}
Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term "nominalism" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' ("name"), since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name, not a real quality, in common. There are various forms of nominalism; four major varieties are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt; 

Nominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by [[Occam's razor]] or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities.

Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]], [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental idealism===
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
{{see also|German idealism}}

[[Transcendental idealist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] posited that universals are not real, but are ideas in the mind of rational beings. Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.

Thus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient philosophy==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or [[substantial form|forms]]: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have [[knowledge]] about the latter.  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §1b.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.

One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said "I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=57|isbn=0-912516-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into "[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s.

Consider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.

==Medieval philosophy==

===Boethius===
The problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:

"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|first=|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duns Scotus===
[[Duns Scotus]] argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard.

===Ockham===
[[William of Ockham]] argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words/names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Spade|first=Paul Vincent|last2=Panaccio|first2=Claude|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval realism===
{{main|Medieval realism}}
Realism was argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;&lt;ref&gt;On Being and Essence, Ch I.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle. [[Scotist realism]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[Formal distinction]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these opinions were denied by Scotus' pupil William of Ockham.

===Medieval nominalism===
{{main|Medieval nominalism}}
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism.

==Modern and contemporary philosophy==

===Mill===
{{also|Psychologism}}
The 19th-century British philosophy [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, "The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object".

However, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:

{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

In other words, we may be "temporarily unconscious" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.

===Peirce===
The 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that "Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of "the possibility of forming the simplest general conception". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. "If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called "thirdness", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.

===James===
[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had "kidnapped" the term and eventually to call himself a "pragmaticist" instead.) Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:

{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars:  the moral/political answer, the mathematical/scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.

===Weaver===
The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of "the fateful doctrine of nominalism" was "the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence".&lt;ref name="Hoeveler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Hoeveler|title=Watch on the right: conservative intellectuals in the Reagan era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JocfGWYGciMC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=15 February 1991|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-12810-4|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotchie1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Scotchie|title=The vision of Richard Weaver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUZ7Mjv4WMC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-212-3|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocchiarella===
[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads ("Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.

===Armstrong===
The Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to "natural classes" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist "trope" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as "particularism"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.

===Penrose===
[[Roger Penrose]] contends that the [[philosophy of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]] can't be understood absent the Platonic view that "mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198519737|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">'''Public philosophy''' is a label used for at least two separate philosophical projects. One project often called "public philosophy" is to address issues of public importance through philosophy, especially in the areas of [[public policy]], [[morality]] and [[social issues]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} In this conception, public philosophy is a matter of content, not style.{{cn|date=June 2017}} It must concern certain philosophical issues, but may be undertaken in any venue.{{cn|date=June 2017}}   The second project often called public philosophy is to engage in philosophy in public venues. This view  is exemplified by the ''Essays in Philosophy'' special issue on public philosophy (Vol 15, issue 1, 2014), which defined public philosophy as "doing philosophy with general audiences in a non-academic setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Jack Russell | year = 2014 | title = Public Philosophy: Introduction | url = | journal = Essays in Philosophy | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.7710/1526-0569.1485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public philosophy, in this conception, is a matter of style not content. It must be undertaken in a public venue but might deal with any philosophical issue. 

Some public philosophers are academic professionals, but others may work outside of the usual academic contexts of teaching and writing for [[peer-reviewed journals]].

==Perspectives==
According to one of the founders of the Public Philosophy Network, Sharon Meagher, “'public philosophy' is not simply a matter of doing philosophy in public. A truly public philosophy is one that demands that the
philosopher both become a student of community knowledge and reflect on his or her public engagement, recognizing that philosophy can benefit at as much from public contact as can the public benefit from contact with philosophy. The publicly engaged philosopher does not assume that he or she knows the questions in advance, but draws on his or her experiences in the community to
develop and frame questions. Further, publicly engaged philosophy demands accountability on the part of the philosopher to his or her publics—understanding that philosophers are themselves members of those publics."&lt;ref&gt;http://api.ning.com/files/C*75Xw4bA4cU7vHOHS-zlLRmkdBskXa9IzuVBCJKtjhmSgMrQy8tWTu1s9vqumPuG2gyJfaPzwWJ1Tu4*NoJIUVYUXtPpC37/KetteringreportfinalcorrectedFeb2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who hold the alternative view, that public philosophy is simply philosophy undertaken in public venues, are engaged in two projects. One of these is to educate the public and the other to engage with the public collaboratively to identify and address public problems. The second approach is often inspired by  [[John Dewey]]'s work on democracy and the need to reconstruct philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See part two of Volume I of The Essential Dewey: Pragmatism, Education, Democracy edited by Larry A Hickman and Thomas M. Alexander, Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The two approaches are not exclusive. For instance, John Pace Dewey, philosopher [[Michael J. Sandel]] describes public philosophy as having two aspects. The first is to "find in the political and legal controversies of our day an occasion for philosophy". The second is "to bring moral and political philosophy to bear on contemporary public discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael J. |last=Sandel |authorlink=Michael J. Sandel |title=Public Philosophy: Essays on Morality in Politics |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2005 |isbn=0-674-01928-8 |oclc=60321410 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]] says, "The role of a public philosophy is to address public affairs", but this "can be done in many different ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Tully |authorlink=James Tully (philosopher) |title=Public Philosophy in a New Key: Volume 1, Democracy and Civic Freedom |series=Ideas in Context series |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-521-44961-8 |oclc=316855971 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tully's approach emphasizes ''practice'' through the contestable concepts of citizenship, civic freedom, and nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], especially Chapter 9 "On local and global citizenship: an apprenticeship manual," ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom''. Ideas in Context series. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp. 243-309.&lt;/ref&gt; Public philosophy, in some conceptions, is a matter of content rather than style. Public philosophy, in this sense, need not be undertaken in a public venue but must deal with a particular subset of philosophical problems.

The American Philosophical Association created a Committee on Public Philosophy in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apaonline.org/members/group.aspx?id=110441&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Public Philosophy Network has been holding conferences once every two years on advancing public philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicphilosophynetwork.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of individuals have been identified, either by themselves or others, as public philosophers. These include academics such as [[Cornel West]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Richard Rorty]],&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline |first=Richard A. |last=Posner |authorlink=Richard Posner |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2003 |isbn=0-674-01246-1 |oclc=491547976 |edition=paperback |pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]], and non-academics such as social activist [[Jane Addams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/addams-jane/ |title=Jane Addams |last=Hamington |first=Maurice |editor-first=Edward N.

In the [[philosophy of religion]], '''Reformed epistemology''' is a school of philosophical thought concerning the nature of knowledge ([[epistemology]]) as it applies to religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/|title=The Epistemology of Religion|last=|first=|date=|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central proposition of Reformed epistemology is that beliefs can be justified by more than evidence alone, contrary to the positions of [[evidentialism]], which argues that while belief other than through evidence may be beneficial, it violates some epistemic duty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/truth/religious-epistemology|title=Religious Epistemology|last=Craig|first=William Lane|date=|website=BeThinking|publisher=|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to Reformed epistemology is the proposition that belief in God may be "[[basic belief|properly basic]]" and not need to be inferred from other [[truth]]s to be rationally warranted.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://sigevuxa.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/warrant-the-current-debate.pdf|title=Warrant: The Current Debate|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=9780195078619|volume=1|location=Oxford|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Lane Craig]] describes Reformed epistemology as "One of the most significant developments in contemporary Religious Epistemology&amp;nbsp;... which directly assaults the evidentialist construal of rationality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Alvin Plantinga]] distinguishes between what he calls ''de facto'' from ''de jure'' objections to Christian belief. A ''de facto'' objection is one that attempts to show that Christian truth claims are false. In contrast, ''de jure'' objections attempt to undermine Christian belief even if it is, in fact, true. Plantinga argues that there are no successful objections to Christian belief apart from ''de facto'' (fact-based) objections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reformed epistemology was so named because it represents a continuation of the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Reformed]] theology of [[John Calvin]], who postulated a ''[[sensus divinitatis]]'', an innate divine awareness of God's presence.&lt;ref&gt;See Calvin's ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' Bk. I, Chap. III.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent influences on reformed epistemology are found in philosopher [[Nicholas Wolterstorff|Nicholas Wolterstorff's]] ''Reason within the Bounds of Religion,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reason within the bounds of religion|last=Wolterstorff|first=Nicholas|publisher=Eerdmans, William B.

Although Plantinga's Reformed epistemology developed over three decades, it was not fully articulated until 1993 with the publication of two books in an eventual trilogy: ''Warrant: The Current Debate,''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Warrant and Proper Function|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=9780195078640|volume=2|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third in the series was ''Warranted Christian Belief,''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warranted Christian Belief|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0195131925|volume=3|location=Oxford|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2000. Other prominent defenders of Reformed epistemology include William Lane Craig, [[William Alston]], and [[Michael C. Rea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowan|first1=Steven|title=Five Views on Apologetics|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0-310-22476-1|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts, definitions, and background==
[[Alvin Plantinga]]'s Reformed epistemology includes two arguments against classical [[foundationalism]]. The first grew out of his earlier argument in ''God and Other Minds'' (1967). In that work  Plantinga argued that if our belief in other minds is rational without propositional or physical evidence, then belief in God is also rational. In his 1993 works, Plantinga argued that according to classical foundationalism most of us are irrational for having many beliefs we cannot justify, but which foundationalism does not accept as properly basic. Plantinga's second argument against classical foundationalism is that it is self-referentially incoherent. It fails the test of its own rules, which require that it be either self-evident, incorrigible, or evident to the senses.

In Plantinga's view, warrant is defined as the property of beliefs that makes them knowledge. Plantinga argues that a properly basic belief in God is warranted when produced by a sound mind, in an environment supportive of proper thought in accord with a design plan successfully aimed at truth.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford UP, 1993, viii&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is an epistemically possible model according to which [[theism|theistic belief]] is properly basic and designed to form true belief in God, belief in God is probably warranted if theism is true. Plantinga does not argue that this model is true, but only that ''if'' it is true, theistic belief is also likely true, because then theistic belief would result from our belief-forming faculties functioning as they were designed.

This connection between the [[truth value]] of theism and its positive epistemic status suggests to some that the goal of showing theistic belief to be externally warranted requires reasons for supposing that theism is true (Sudduth, 2000). This point is answered by many theistic arguments which purport to provide sufficient propositional and physical evidence to warrant that belief, apart from reformed epistemology.

===Plantinga's Reformed epistemology===
The best-known defender of reformed epistemology is Alvin Plantinga. According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and due to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called "Proper functionalism", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour]], [[William Alston]], and [[Alvin Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls "warrant"—what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second book, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.&lt;ref&gt;
Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's "proper function" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's "belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers" are functioning properly—"working the way it ought to work".&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a "design plan", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: "it is perhaps possible that [[Evolution (term) | evolution]] (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans",&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;WPF, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as "naturalistic", including the "functional generalization" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 199-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the "A/C" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the "Extended A/C" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation, etc.{{huh?|date=January 2017}} can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

James Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga's ''Warrant'' trilogy, and specifically of his ''Warranted Christian Belief'', is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so "the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief"&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
rather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.

==Criticisms==
Although Reformed epistemology has been defended by several theistic philosophers, it has both Christian and non-Christian critics.

===Great Pumpkin Objection===

A common objection, known as "[[The Great Pumpkin]] Objection", which [[Alvin Plantinga]] (1983) describes as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that [[the Great Pumpkin]] returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Rebuttal====
Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for "proper basicality" propounded by [[Foundationalism#Classical foundationalism|classical foundationalism]] (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector "knows" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Other objections===

Other common criticisms of Plantinga's Reformed epistemology are that belief in God--like other sorts of widely debated and high-stakes beliefs--is "evidence-essential" rather than properly basic;&lt;ref&gt;Wykstra, Stephen. "Toward a Sensible Evidentialism: on the Notion of ‘Needing Evidence’." In ''Philosophy of Religion'', 2d ed., edited by William Rowe and William Wainwright. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1989): 426-437. &lt;/ref&gt; that plausible naturalistic explanations can be given for humans' supposedly "natural" knowledge of God;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Justin L., 2004, ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'', Lanham: AltaMira. &lt;/ref&gt;; that it is arbitrary and arrogant for Christians to claim that their faith-beliefs are warranted and true (because vouched for by the Holy Spirit) while denying the validity of non-Christians' religious experiences;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Richard. “Plantinga on Exclusivism”. In ''Faith and Philosophy'' 20 (2003): 85-90. &lt;/ref&gt; and that there are important possible "defeaters" of Christian belief that Plantinga fails to address (e.g., passages in the Bible that seem hard to reconcile with his assumption of divine authorship and inerrancy).

'''Robert Payne''' (1596–1651) was an English cleric and academic, known also as a [[natural philosopher]] and experimentalist. He was associated with the so-called [[Welbeck Academy]] by his position as chaplain (with duties as secretary) to [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Newcastle]]. The position also brought him a close friendship with [[Thomas Hobbes]].
Known for editing The Civl War in Spain

==Life==
Payne was borne at [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], and was educated at [[John Roysse grammar school]]. He matriculated at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1611, and graduated B.A. in 1614. He was a contemporary as student of [[William Backhouse]], who later showed him friendship at the end of the [[First English Civil War]]. In 1624 he became the second Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]]. He put himself forward as candidate for [[Gresham Professor of Astronomy]] in 1626.&lt;ref name="NorthRoche1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John David North|author2=John James Roche|title=The Light of nature: essays in the history and philosophy of science presented to A.

In 1630 Payne entered the Cavendish orbit with his nomination as rector of [[Tormarton]] by the Earl of Newcastle.&lt;ref name=Pyle&gt;{{Pyle|Payne, Robert|635–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mathematical correspondence with [[Charles Cavendish (Nottingham)|Charles Cavendish]] led him out of academia. He was taken on as chaplain, by April 1632, at [[Welbeck Abbey]], where he assumed multiple roles in the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted-Larry Pebworth|title=Literary circles and cultural communities in Renaissance England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih1sRzuOAhMC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=2012-04-03|year=2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1317-4|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted-Larry Pebworth|title=Literary circles and cultural communities in Renaissance England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih1sRzuOAhMC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=2012-04-03|year=2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1317-4|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of his life, from which his notability as an intellectual figure arises, was cut short in 1638. At that point Newcastle took on responsibility for the upbringing of the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37837|title=Payne, Robert|first=Mordechai Feingold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyle then returned to Oxford, as a canon of Christ Church. He was created D.D. in 1642, and was deprived of his living in 1646.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; At this period Payne did what he could to circulate the ideas and manuscripts of Hobbes in Oxford, and to reduce the hostility of [[Gilbert Sheldon]].&lt;ref name="Tyacke1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Tyacke|title=Seventeenth-century Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J06RQ3tXuuQC&amp;pg=PA414|accessdate=2012-04-03|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-951014-6|page=414–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliamentary visitation of Oxford]] in 1648 saw Payne deprived of his college position. He ended his life with family, in Abingdon.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Payne was not a published author: his significant work was left in manuscript.&lt;ref name=Pyle/&gt; He undertook some chemical experiments with Newcastle in the 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle|author2=Susan James|title=Political Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wb7DPL26L0C&amp;pg=PR11|accessdate=2012-04-03|date=28 August 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63350-5|page=11|authorlink1=Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported later by Newcastle, one involved ''lapis prunellae'' (a mixture here of [[saltpetre]] and [[sulphur|brimstone]]), as a form of [[indoor firework]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle]], [[Charles Harding Firth]] (editor), ''The Life of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, to which is added The true relation of my birth, breeding and life'' (1886), p. 200 note; [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwilliamca00newcuoft#page/200/mode/2up archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

He translated a work by [[Galileo]], ''Della scienza mecanica'', from Italian to English in 1636, from a manuscript copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juhana Lemetti|title=Historical Dictionary of Hobbes's Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N_-lu-p7IoC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=2012-04-03|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5065-1|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year he had also translated the second half of ''Della misura dell'acque correnti'' of [[Benedetto Castelli]], a work on [[fluid mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cornelis Hendrik Leijenhorst|author2=Cees Leijenhorst|title=The mechanisation of Aristotelianism: the late Aristotelian setting of Thomas Hobbes' natural philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=2012-04-03|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11729-7|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malcolm2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noel Malcolm|title=Aspects of Hobbes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_x_KthbDyHQC&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=2012-04-03|date=11 November 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927540-3|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original manuscripts were obtained from [[Marin Mersenne]], and the work was for Charles Cavendish.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Scholarly debate continues as to the possible attribution of manuscripts from the Cavendish circle to Payne: the discussion goes deeper than handwriting, since Payne acted also as a copyist. One work, the ''Short Tract on First Principles'' initially thought to be by Hobbes, is now thought by Timothy Raylor and Noel Malcolm to be by Payne. Mordechai Feingold suggests another candidate.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6472">'''Roman Frigg''' (born 1972) is a Swiss [[philosopher]], Professor at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] and director of its [[Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/profile.aspx?KeyValue=r.p.frigg%40lse.ac.uk Frigg, Roman; Professor Roman Frigg] at ''lse.ac.uk.'' Accessed 2017-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he was awarded the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2016/05/10/roman-frigg-wins-bessel-research-award/ Professor Roman Frigg has won the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation’s prestigious Bessel Research Award] at ''lse.ac.uk,'' 2016/05/10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Born in [[Basel]], Switzerland, Frigg obtained his MSc in Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Basel]]. In 2003 he obtained his PhD in Philosophy at the [[University of London]] under [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] with the thesis, entitled ''Re-presenting Scientific Representation''.

After graduation Frigg started his academic career at the London School of Economics. After some years he was appointed Professor of Philosophy in its Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method. He is also visiting professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] at its Munich Centre for Mathematical Philosophy. 

== Philosophy ==
Frigg's philosophy also draw from his physics background. He often takes examples from the field to demonstrate how order is emergent, holistic, and contextual by universal and exceptionless laws.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Order: After the Laws of Nature|last=Cartwright|first=Nancy|last2=Ward|first2=Keith|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781474244060|location=London|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, together with Robert Bishop, he explained that there is self-organization and patterns of emergent order in the universe rather than a system being built up just from independently calculated movement of its part.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This theory is applied to explain phenomena such as heavenly bodies, global politics, and even family life, among others with the view that a domain is regarded as ordered once its objects are seen as behaving according to a general law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Along with some philosophers like Gabrielle Contessa and [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], Frigg also theorizes that there are parallels between theoretical modelling and works of fiction that involve fictional characters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Models as Make-Believe: Imagination, Fiction and Scientific Representation|last=Toon|first=Adam|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9780230301214|location=New York|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the philosopher, the best way to understand [[Mathematical model|mathematical models]] is to approach it as if they were more closely related to literary fictions than to bits of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simulation and Similarity: Using Models to Understand the World|last=Weisberg|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199933662|location=New York|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be demonstrated in the way Frigg draws from [[Kendall Walton]]'s theory, which offers a framework of understanding games of make-believe and uses it to understand the nature and varieties of representation in the arts of art and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Frigg proposed that scientists' prepared descriptions are analogous to props in games of make believe and that the descriptions do not require imaginings about actual objects but ask us to imagine a model-system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is believed that this approach addresses the concept of model individuation - that "if models are simply mathematical objects, then when two distinct models use the same mathematics, we will not be able to individuate them as separate objects."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Sammelband''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|æ|m|əl|b|æ|n|t}} {{respell|ZAM|əl|bant}}, plural '''Sammelbände''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|æ|m|əl|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|d|ə}} {{respell|ZAM|əl|BEN|də}} or '''Sammelbands'''),&lt;ref name="RBMS"&gt;ALA ACLR RBMS BSC. [https://rbms.info/vocabularies/provenance/tr106.htm Provenance Evidence Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes '''nonce-volume''', is a book comprising a number of separately printed or manuscript&lt;ref name="Beal"&gt;Beal, Peter. ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000''. Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199576128.001.0001/acref-9780199576128-e-0909 online publication 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; works that are subsequently bound together.&lt;ref name="Gillespie"&gt;Gillespie, Alexandra.

==Sammelbände and William Caxton==

[[William Caxton]] appeared to follow the established manuscript tradition of producing booklets or [[fascicle (book)|fascicles]] of individual works or groups of works that would later be bought together for a patron or buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Paul. The Printer and the Pardoner. From The English Historical Review.  Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Nearly forty of these tract volumes have been reconstructed from the evidence of now separately bound parts.  They indicate the nature of early readership of Caxton’s work, and they also allow historians to infer something about Caxton’s own sense of his projects.

Perhaps most famous and extensive of his sammelbände work was the collection made out of Caxton's 1476-8 productions, known since the time of Caxton scholar [[William Blades]] as “the volume purchased by King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] from the estate of Bishop [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]] in 1714.”&lt;ref&gt;Blades, William. The Life and Typography of William Caxton, vol. II, pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This volume is a compendium of Caxton’s first run of vernacular poetry, and the texts within appear as follows:

::[[John Lydgate]], ''Stans ad Mensam'' 
::Burgh, ''[[Cato’s Distichs]]''
::John Lydgate, ''The Churl and the Bird'' (2nd edn)
::John Lydgate, ''Horse Goose and Sheep'' (2nd edn)
::John Lydgate, ''The Temple of Glas''
::[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''The Temple of Brass'' (''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]''), also containing [[Henry Scogan]]'s ''Moral Balad'', and Chaucer’s ballads ''Truth'', ''Fortune'', and the ''Envoy to Scogan''
::''The Book of Cutesye''
::Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[Anelida and Arcite]]'', also containing the ''Complaint to his Purse'' and a collection of verses known as the ''Sayings of Chaucer''

==Sammelbände from the Tudor Period==

Modern students of early [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] literature only rarely encounter extant ''Sammelbände'', most of which were disbound in the nineteenth century. 

Yet printed editions of works by (or ascribed to) Geoffrey Chaucer, John Lydgate, [[Richard Rolle]], [[Margery Kempe]], [[Stephen Hawes]], [[John Skelton]], and writers involved in Tudor religious controversy from [[John Wycliffe]] to [[William Tyndale]] may all be traced to such composite volumes.&lt;ref name="Gillespie"/&gt;

==Effects on literature==

In Caxton’s case specifically, he presents a Lydgatenized&lt;ref name="Lerer"&gt;Lerer, Seth. “William Caxton.” From The Cambridge History of Medieval Literature. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer, even to the point of giving the ''Parliament of Fowls'' a unique new title, ''The Temple of Brass'', to follow Lydgate’s ''Temple of Glas''. It is a testimony both to Caxton’s understanding of vernacular poetry and to the tastes of his clientele.  It is a volume centered on a particular publishing event, a volume that contains not only the key texts by canonical authors, but the critical instruction for their understanding: ''The Book of Curtesye''. 

Generally, the creation of sammelbände can have various effects on the readership of texts. It offers people a larger framework for the understanding of texts within the volumes; these volumes also used [[prologue]]s and [[epilogue]]s in order to provide a further framework for readership. These explanatory additions and the use of advertisements, such as Caxton’s “new and improved edition” of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' shows the movement away from privileged, aristocratic readership towards the readership of the middle class, solidifying printing as a business and a social progression.

The '''sixteen characteristics''' are an extended elaboration of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. For each truth, they describe four characteristics.

==Tibetan tradition==
The Tibetan tradition emphasizes the study of the sixteen characteristics of the [[Four Noble Truths]], as described in the ''Abhisamayalamkara''. The Mahayana text ''Ornament of Clear Realization ([[Abhisamayalamkara]])'' identifies four characteristics of each truth, for a total of sixteen characteristics, which are presented as a guide to contemplating and practicing the four noble truths.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 741-743}} The ''Ornament of Clear Realization'' is a key text in the curriculum of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and study colleges, and this method of study and practice is emphasized in the Tibetan tradition.

==Description==
These sixteen characteristics are identified as follows:{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 2305-2310}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/lam-rim/the-five-paths-to-liberation-enlightenment/the-sixteen-aspects-of-the-four-noble-truths ''The Sixteen Aspects of the Four Noble Truths'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truth of suffering===
These characteristics refer to the [[five aggregates]]{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 736-837}}
#impermanence - the five aggregates are impermanent and change from moment to moment
#suffering - the five aggregates have come into being because of [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidya]] (ignorance) and [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] (disturbing emotions), and they are under the influence of the avidya and kleshas
#emptiness - there is no "self" outside of the five aggregates that controls or makes use of the five aggregates
#selflessness - there is no "self" to be found within the five aggregates that controls or makes use of the five aggregates

===Truth of origin===
These characteristics refer to [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]], [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], and avidya (ignorance){{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 1587-1600}}
#causes - karma, kleshas, and avidya are constantly arising within our mental continuum, and because of their nature they have the quality of being the causes of suffering.
#origin - kleshas and karma are the actual origin of suffering, not just intermediate links. 
#strong production - avidya, kleshas, and karma act forcefully as the main causes of suffering (they are not just passive ingredients)
#condition - avidya, kleshas, and karma are more than just the main causes of suffering, they are also the contributory causes

===Truth of cessation===
These characteristics refer to cessation{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 1886-1900}}
#cessation - cessation is the ceasing of all kleshas and avidya forever
#pacification - cessation pacifies the torment of suffering, brings true peace
#being superb - cessation is supreme in bringing about the source of all health and happiness
#definite emergence - cessation will definitely bring us out of samsara

===Truth of the path===
These characteristics refer to the path{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 2289-2309}}
#path - the path leads to cessation
#awareness - the path leads us to a full and complete understanding of the root of cyclic existence ([[samsara]]) and the means to escape it
#achievement - through the path, we can definitely achieve the result of liberation and enlightenment
#deliverance - the path delivers us from the bondage of our conditioned existence

'''Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship''' or '''SFF''' was founded by [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]] in 1956. Their mission is to be "an [[interfaith]], [[non-profit]] movement" of religious leaders, writers, and business and professional persons who feel a kinship with and have a concern for the growing Western interest in [[altered states of consciousness]] and [[mystical experience]]s.

'''Iḥiyāʾ ʿulūm ad-dīn''' ({{lang-en|The Revival of the Religious Sciences|italics=yes}} {{Lang-ar|احياء علوم الدين}}) is an 11th-century book written by [[Al-Ghazali|Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=bYPdAAAAQBAJ|title=One Nation Under God?: Religion and American Culture|first=Marjorie|last=Garber|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=raF1swEACAAJ&amp;dq=ihya+uloom+al-din&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy-PWa-b7aAhVGDCwKHdzNAYEQ6AEINzAE |title=Ihya Ulum Al-din |last=Ghazzālī |date=1978 |publisher=Sind Sagar Academy |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=yRj7swEACAAJ&amp;dq=ihya+uloom+al-din&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy-PWa-b7aAhVGDCwKHdzNAYEQ6AEIPDAF|title=Ihya' Ulum Al-din|first=|last=al-Ghazzali|date=16 April 1997|publisher=Dar al-Tauzi'|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was composed in [[Arabic]] and was based on personal religious experience. It is regarded as one of his chief works and as the perfect introduction to the pious Muslim’s way to God.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Montgomery. "Ghazali, /Abu /Hamed /Mohammad, ii, iii." Encyclopedia Iranica. 1-12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally spanning over 40 volumes, it deals with the principles and practices of Islam and demonstrates how these can be made the basis of a reflective religious life, thereby, attaining the higher stages of Sufism. 
Some consider [[The Alchemy of Happiness|Kimya-e-Sa'adat]] as a rewrite of the Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen, which is a common misconception. Kimya-e-Sa'adat is shorter than Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen, however Ghazali said that he wrote Kimiya-e-Sa'adat to reflect the nature of Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen and a few of his other theological writings.&lt;ref&gt;Netton, Ian R. "(Untitled)." Rev. of The Alchemy of Happiness Translated by Claud Field. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Apr. 1993: 117-18. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ghazali was the student of [[Al-Juwayni]], under whom he studied religious sciences, including [[Islamic law]] and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=RwPnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq|title=THE BIOGRAPHIES OF THE ELITE LIVES OF THE SCHOLARS, IMAMS &amp; HADITH MASTERS: Biographies of The Imams &amp; Scholars|date=2 May 2015|publisher=Zulfiqar Ayub|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] vizier, recognized the great potential in Ghazali as a scholar and appointed him as the head of [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|Nizamiyya madarasa]] in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/portrait/2018/04/14/abu-hamid-al-ghazali-revelation-against-rationalism|title=Abu Hamid al-Ghazali: Revelation against rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghazali, at the peak of his fame and scholarship went into a spiritual and intellectual crisis. He left his post at the institution on request of [[pilgrimage]]. He went into a long journey, travelling to [[Damascus]], [[Jerusalem]] and finally to [[Mecca]] to perform the pilgrimage. Ghazali throughout the journey, was going through an inner spiritual struggle, and he became attracted towards the pathway of [[Sufis]]. This journey influenced Ghazali to write first on his autobiography ''[[Deliverance from Error]]'' and then his famous book ''The Revival of the Religious Sciences'', explaining in detail about [[mysticism]], [[theology]], Islamic rituals and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/ibrahim-kalin/2016/06/15/reading-al-ghazali-in-ramadan|title=Reading al-Ghazali in Ramadan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=htx2zqa0TNkC|title=The Alchemy of Happiness|first=|last=Al-Ghazzali|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The book is divided into four parts, each containing ten books. It explains the doctrines and practices of [[Islam]] and showed how these can be made the basis of a profound devotional life, leading to the higher stages of [[Sufism]], or [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali#ref240531|title=al-Ghazali - Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maktabah.org/en/item/59-ihya-ulum-al-din-by-imam-ghazali|title=Ihya Ulum al-Din {إحياء علوم الدين} by Imam Ghazali - Maktabah Mujaddidiyah|first=Imam|last=Ghazali|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part one deals with knowledge and the essentials of faith. 
* Part two discusses people and social customs.
* Parts three and four are dedicated to the inner soul and explains first the vices that people must master in overcoming them and then the virtues that they must work hard to fulfil.

== Influence ==
The ''Iḥiyāʾ ʿulūm ad-dīn'' became the most frequently read Islamic book after the [[Quran]] and the [[hadith]]. Its great accomplishment was to bring orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together in a useful, comprehensible manner to guide every aspect of Muslim life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt Janin, The Pursuit of Learning in the Islamic World 610-2003, p 83. {{ISBN|0786429046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well received by Islamic scholars such as [[Nawawi]] who stated that: "Were the books of Islam all to be lost, excepting only the ''Ihya'', it would suffice to replace them all."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Islam, Fundamentalism, and the Betrayal of Tradition: Essays by Western Muslim Scholars, p. 291. {{ISBN|0941532607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minhaj al-Qasidin ==
Al-Ghazali, despite being a scholar, was not an expert in the field of hadith and thus the hadith narrations contained in his book were scrutinized. Hadith experts like [[Ibn al-Jawzi]] and [[Ibn Qudamah|Ibn-ul-Qudamah al-Maqdisi]] researched and sorted out the hadith narrations contained in the book on the basis of their authenticities. They then wrote the ''Minhaj-al-Qasidin'' and its overview called ''Mukhtasar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=DQJJswEACAAJ|title=Mukhtasar minhaj al-qasidin|first=Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn Qudamah|last=al-Maqdisi|date=19 May 1998|publisher=Dar al-manar|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The book was then carefully reworked by Ibn al Jawzi (597 AH) and the result of his work was named ''Minhaj-al-Qasidin wa Mufidush Shadiqin''. Ibn al-Jawzi's efforts in rewriting the book is considered important and while he had similarities with Al-Ghazali in terms of mastery in mysticism, he also had the superiority of expertise in the knowledge of the hadiths. The reworking by Ibn al-Jawzi focused on the re-examination of the existing hadiths, elimination of weak and disputed hadiths and their replacement with the authentic and sound ones so that the integrity of the book was not compromised. 
Minhaj al-Qasidin was a fairly thick book and it was summarized in the form of Mukhtasar by Imam Ibn Qudamah. Whenever Ibn al Jawzi focused on the study of hadith, he found the ''Mukhtasar'' book in line with its name, aiming at summarizing and making the essence of the previous book to be more concise, organized, and easy to understand. It also added additional notes so that it may become an easy book for students to read. Ibn Qudamah remarked that whenever he read Ibn al Jawzi's Minhajul Qasidin, he felt that this book was very useful for society, so he would read it again in order to absorb the deeper meaning for the second time. He said that his admiration for the book grew such that he also added some important missing topics that were readily available in other prominent books of his time with additional notes such as hadith and commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Fx9LDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:2745176595&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixzamwoJ7bAhXOa1AKHSDvCMAQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=ABSTRACT OF THE GUIDE FOR THE ONES TRAVELING TOWARDS ALLAH - Google Search|website=books.google.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Theosophical Society (Pasadena)''' is a branch of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] based in [[Pasadena, California]]. It claims to be the successor organization to the [[Theosophical Society|original Theosophical Society]] founded by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] and others in 1875 in [[New York City]]. Currently is the second largest Theosophical group in members and international reach after the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]].&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammer|first1=Ovlav|title=Handbook of the Theosophical Current|date=2013|publisher=Leiden Boston|url=https://books.google.co.cr/books?id=0VozAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=adyar+theosophical+membership+and+chapters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ywsE5MGXQ5&amp;sig=KAb9Jm7-ygoC5g_MInAb--wiKgw&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh546xmpXYAhUIOSYKHbqqDBgQ6AEIVjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=adyar%20theosophical%20membership%20and%20chapters&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It traces its roots to the line of [[William Quan Judge]] established Leader in 1895 was recognized by a portion of The Society after Blavatsky's death due to a dispute surrounding [[Annie Besant]] regarding the existence of The Masters.  The juxtaposed positions are put as this: he was either "faithful to the teachings of the Mahatmas" (the stance of the modern Pasadena organization) or as Besant claimed, had forged the letters claiming them to be from the Mahatmas (the stance of the modern Adyar organization). The corresponding faction led by [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Annie Besant]], whose organization, based in India, is known today as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society - Adyar]].

Judge led the American group for nearly a year prior to his sudden death in 1896 while traveling across India, at which time [[Katherine Tingley]] became Leader.  Although initially supported by Ernest Temple Hargorve, he and a group of roughly 200 members disputed Tingley's leadership chose to secede and formed a new faction of the Brotherhood, dubbed the [[Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove)]].  In 1900 Tingley moved the Theosophical Society's headquarters from New York City to [[Lomaland]] at [[Point Loma, San Diego]] located in [[Southern California]]. It later moved to [[Covina, California|Covina]] in Los Angeles County in 1942, and finally found a home in Altadena California in 1945.

[[Max Heindel]] was vice president during 1904 and 1905. Leaders of The Theosophical Society Pasadena have include [[Gottfried de Purucker]], 1929–42; [[Grace Knoche]], and currently [[Randell Grubb]].

The Theosophical Society of Pasadena devotes the majority of their time in the furthering of the realization of the Divine Wisdom.
