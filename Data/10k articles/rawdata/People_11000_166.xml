'''Akuma''' (悪魔, [[ Japanese language|Japanese]] for "Devil" or "Demon"), known in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''Gouki'''|豪鬼|Gōki|lit. "Great Demon" or "Great Ogre"}}, is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series of [[fighting game]]s by [[Capcom]]. Akuma made his debut in ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' as a [[Player character|secret character]] and hidden [[Boss (video gaming)|Boss]]. In the storyline of the ''Street Fighter'' video games, he is the younger brother of [[Gouken]], [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]'s and [[Ken Masters|Ken]]'s master. In some games he also has an enhanced version named '''Shin Akuma''', or {{Nihongo|'''Shin Gouki'''|真・豪鬼|Shin Gōki|the "true Great Demon"}} in Japanese. Since his debut, Akuma has appeared in several subsequent titles and has been well received by both fans and critics.

==''Street Fighter'' series==
Akuma made his debut in ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'', the fifth arcade iteration of the ''Street Fighter II'' games, where he appears as a hidden and unnamed character. After meeting certain requirements, Akuma appears prior to the player's final match with [[M. Bison]] and obliterates M. Bison before challenging the player. In the Japanese arcade version of the game, Akuma would introduce himself to the player before the match, proclaiming himself to be {{nihongo|the "Master of the Fist"|拳を極めし者|Ken o Kiwameshi Mono}}. He also has two endings in the game as well: one for defeating M. Bison, and another against himself. While these endings were omitted from the international releases of the arcade game, they were edited into one ending and included in the English localization of ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo|Super Turbo Revival]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Shin Akuma is, however, an unlockable playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival'', as well as the Japan-only [[Dreamcast]] version of the game, ''Super Street Fighter II X for Matchmaking Service''. In the latter version, another version of Akuma referred to as ''Tien Gouki'' can also be selected.

Akuma appears in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha|Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams]]'',  where he was given his name, once again as a hidden opponent and unlockable character. His backstory remains the same as in ''Super Turbo''. Akuma was added to the immediate roster in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', with a powered-up version of the character named "Shin Akuma" appearing as a hidden opponent. The character's relation with other ''Street Fighter'' characters begins to be fleshed out, establishing rivalries with [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], [[List of Street Fighter characters#Adon|Adon]], [[Gen (Street Fighter)|Gen]] and Ryu. Shin Akuma, rather than "Final Bison", is Evil Ryu's final boss in the console versions of ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]''.

Akuma and Shin Akuma are featured in ''[[Street Fighter EX]]'' as hidden boss characters, where he is one of the few characters able to move out of the 2D playing field, during his teleport. Akuma also appears in the arcade and home video game console adaption of ''[[Street Fighter: The Movie (arcade game)|Street Fighter: The Movie]]'' despite not appearing in the movie.

Akuma is featured in the ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' sub-series beginning with ''[[Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact|Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant Attack]]''. Like in his debut in ''Super Turbo'', Akuma is both a secret opponent who serves as an alternate final boss and unlockable character, with the CPU-controlled version being the "Shin Akuma" incarnation introduced in ''Alpha 2''. He is a regular character in ''[[Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike|Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future]]''. Akuma reappears in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', once again as a hidden boss in the Single Player Mode as well as an unlockable secret character in both the arcade and home console versions. Shin Akuma also returns as a hidden boss in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]''.

{{anchor|Oni}}Both secret boss and playable versions of a new form of Akuma, known as {{nihongo|Oni|狂オシキ鬼|Kuruoshiki Oni, lit. The Mad Demon}}, were confirmed in [[Super Street Fighter IV#Arcade Edition|''Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition'']] by leaked videos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shoryuken.com/content/clear-video-ultras-oni-evil-ryu-super-street-fighter-4-3262/ Shoryuken: Clear Video and Ultras of Oni and Evil Ryu in Super Street Fighter 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226215318/http://shoryuken.com/content/clear-video-ultras-oni-evil-ryu-super-street-fighter-4-3262/ |date=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Shin Akuma, Oni is the being that would consume Akuma after mastering the Satsui no Hadou.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Akuma returns in ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' as a downloadable character.

===Character design and gameplay===
Akuma has dark red hair, dark skin tone, glowing red eyes with black [[sclera]], wears [[prayer beads]] around his neck, a dark gray [[karate gi]] and a piece of twine around his waist in lieu of an [[obi (sash)|obi]]. The [[kanji]] "ten" ([[天]]) — meaning "Heaven" — can be seen on his back when it appears during certain win animations. Shin Akuma's appearance is very similar to Akuma's; for example, in the ''Street Fighter Alpha'' series, Shin Akuma had a purple karate gi instead of a dark gray one and marginally darker skin tone. Akuma's introduction in ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' stemmed from the development team's desire to introduce a "mysterious and really powerful" character, with his status as a hidden character within the game resulting from later discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Staff |year=1996 |title=A Fighter Speaks |journal=Game On! |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6 |publisher=Horibuchi, Seiji}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked regarding the presence of Akuma as a secret character in several of Capcom's fighting games, [[Capcom]]'s Noritaka Funamizu stated that, while he did not personally support the concept, he said, "Akuma is a character that can fit in any game design nicely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Game Informer |issue=70 |date=February 1999 |title=An Interview with Noritaka Funamizu |page=11  |author =Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Edwards of Capcom Europe considered Akuma the most powerful ''Street Fighter'' character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/nov/19/most-powerful-street-fighter-can-only-be-matched-ingrid-fighting-evolution-capcom-shares-top-5-strongest-characters-franchise/|title=The most powerful Street Fighter can only be matched by Ingrid from Fighting Evolution—Capcom UK shares top 5 strongest characters in the franchise|first=Steven|last=Chavez|work=EventHubs|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akuma's play style incorporates the trademark techniques of Ryu and Ken, the series' protagonists, only noticeably stronger in comparison along with additional techniques. Akuma has also been one of the characters with the lowest health and stun meter in most of the games he has appeared in. As the franchise expanded, the three characters have been differentiated somewhat while still retaining their common techniques (e.g. different regular attacks, throws, Super moves). In games where Akuma has appeared as a boss, he has had many upgrades, from extra meter to being able to use EX moves without meter at all.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Rich Knight of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' described Akuma as "a character who must constantly be on the offense, because he takes a shit ton of damage when he's not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/08/best-street-fighter-history/akuma |title=7. Akuma—"Street Fighter": The Best Warriors in the History of the Series|first=Rich|last=Knight |work=Complex|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other video games==
[[File:Tekken 7 - Fated Retribution - Akuma Reveal.webm|thumb|Akuma's trailer from ''[[Tekken 7]]''|alt=|left]]

Akuma has appeared in some form or another through many Capcom games outside the ''Street Fighter'' franchise. The first of these appearances was in the fighting game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'', where Akuma (in his ''Super Turbo'' incarnation) appears as a nameless hidden character. He would appear in the later [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]-licensed fighting games (see ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series). In ''[[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]]'', he is a regular character but–in a nod to his hidden character status in other games–his select box is hidden. In ''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'', he appears both as a selectable character and as "'''Cyber Akuma'''", a [[cyborg|mechanized]] version enhanced by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] acting as the horseman of Death and the final boss. He is absent from ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]''; in his stead, Ryu has a Hyper Combo that changes his fighting style to incorporate Akuma's moveset. He reappears as a playable character in the sequels: ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''. He is also an unlockable character in ''[[Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix]]''. He also appears in [[Namco x Capcom]]. He appears as both a playable character and one of the final boss characters in the crossover fighting game ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]''. Akuma also appears in the fighting video game ''[[Street Fighter X Mega Man]]'', as a hidden boss.

In the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom (series)|SNK vs. Capcom]]'' series, Akuma appears in ''Capcom vs. SNK'' and ''SVC Chaos'' as both regular Akuma and as a version of "Shin Akuma". In ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'', a different form of Shin Akuma appears. This form of Akuma achieves a new level of power when a dying [[Rugal Bernstein]] pours his Orochi power into him. His name is spelled in Japanese as {{nihongo2|神・豪鬼}}, with the "Shin" character meaning "God" instead of the usual "True".

Akuma also appears in ''[[Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo]]'' as the final boss, ''[[Pocket Fighter]]'', and in the Japanese console version of ''[[Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness]]'' as a mecha named "Zero Gouki." Also, various version of Akuma have appeared in the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'' series. He is featured in a DLC episode of the action video game ''[[Asura's Wrath]]'', alongside Ryu as an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/28/asuras-wrath-dlc-details-2|title=Asura's Wrath DLC Details|last=Krupa|first=Daniel|date=March 28, 2012|work=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akuma appears as a special guest character in ''[[Tekken 7]]''. In the game's story, he seeks to repay a debt to [[List of Tekken characters#Kazumi Mishima/Devil Kazumi|Kazumi Mishima]] for saving his life from an unknown critical situation, who asks him to kill her husband [[Heihachi Mishima|Heihachi]] and his son [[Kazuya Mishima|Kazuya]] for her if she dies. When Heihachi is finally dead for good at the hands of Kazuya, he is Akuma's only target left. Similar to his appearances in the ''Street Fighter'' series, Akuma replaces Kazumi as a secret arcade mode final boss if certain conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/tekken-7-fated-retribution-announced-the-first-new-character-is-street-fighter-s-akuma-326097.phtml|title=Tekken 7: Fated Retribution announced, the first new character is Street Fighter's Akuma|first=Joe|last=Parlock|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=December 12, 2015|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
Akuma made cameo appearances in ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]'' and in the Japanese TV series ''[[Street Fighter II V]]''. Actor and martial artist [[Joey Ansah]] played Akuma in the short film ''[[Street Fighter: Legacy]]''. Akuma also appears in ''[[Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist]]'', an online series by Capcom and the creators of ''Street Fighter: Legacy'' with Ansah reprised his role from Legacy and Gaku Space as Young Gouki. In ''Assassin's Fist'', both of Akuma's names are used; Akuma being the moniker Gouki had assumed after the Satsui no Hado took him over completely. Both Ansah and Space will return for the second season titled ''Street Fighter: World Warrior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/07/13/third-times-the-charm-live-action-street-fighter-assassins-f/|title=Third time's the charm: Live-action Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist series announced|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|date=July 13, 2012|work=Joystiq|publisher=[[AOL|AOL Inc.]]|accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/comic-con-capcom-greenlights-street-fighter-sequel-series-world-warrior-1201269367/|title=Comic-Con: Capcom Greenlights ‘Street Fighter’ Sequel Series ‘World Warrior’|last=Graser|first=Marc|date=July 25, 2014|work=Variety.com|publisher=[[Variety Media]]|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akuma's first speaking appearance in animation was in an episode of the American [[Street Fighter (TV series)|''Street Fighter'' animated series]] titled "Strange Bedfellows". He reappears in another episode, "The World's Greatest Warrior", in which he defeats Ryu and Ken's master Gouken, and challenges Gouken's two students to a duel.

Akuma also figures in the Japanese [[Original video animation|OVA]] ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]'', where Ryu's encounters with Akuma triggers the "Dark Hadou" in Ryu. Akuma is also the central focus in the OVA ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: Generations]]'', which explores his past and ties the character's past with Ryu's. He appears in the beginning of the movie ''[[Street Fighter IV|Street Fighter 4: The Ties That Bind]]'', where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him.

[[UDON Entertainment]]'s line of ''[[Street Fighter (UDON comics)|Street Fighter]]'' comics sets Akuma in his origin story on how he became a demon and murdering Goutetsu with the power of the Dark Hadou; he fights against Gouken ten years later, as they fight, Gouken eventually wins against Akuma as he falls off a cliff; Gouken tries to save him, but Akuma willingly drops himself into a river, only for him to survive the drop.

In July 2012, the band MegaDriver released a song about Akuma's character, called "Wrath Of The Raging Demon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megadriver.com.br/3.0/en/?page_id=4&amp;act=search|title=MUSIC MegaDriver Official Homepage|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, band Skelator released a song about Akuma, called "Raging Demon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trueskelator.bandcamp.com/|title=Skelator|date=2014-11-11|accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, rapper Tauz released a tribute song to Akuma, called "Rap do Akuma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TauzOficial/status/580512345056813057|title=Rap do Akuma (Street Fighter)|date=2015-03-24|accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akuma was featured in [[ScrewAttack]] internet series ''Death Battle'' where he fought against [[Shang Tsung]] from ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''. They fought a hypothetical battle, and Akuma defeated Shang Tsung with the Raging Demon. He was also featured in Death Battle spin-off series ''One Minute Melee'' where fought against [[Kenpachi Zaraki]] from ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' in Season 1. He ended up winning when he sent Kenpachi flying with Demon Armageddon. They fought in a rematch in Season 2, and Akuma won again when he transformed into Oni and knocked Kenpachi out with Misogi. They fought in another and final rematch in Season 4, and Akuma was again victorious, when he, in Oni form, killed Kenpachi with Wrath of the Raging Demon. He was also featured in another Death Battle spin-off series ''DBX'' where he fought and won against [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] from [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ILewNiRIM|title=Death Battle - Akuma VS Shang Tsung|date=2010-12-21|publisher=ScrewAttack|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiD9Uixq84|title=One Minute Melee - Akuma vs Kenpachi Zaraki (Street Fighter vs Bleach)|date=2014-10-06|publisher=ScrewAttack|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvR8JHWAJfA|title=One Minute Melee - Oni vs Kenpachi (Street Fighter vs Bleach)|date=2015-07-06|publisher=ScrewAttack|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nefmSagkuQ|title=One Minute Melee S4 EP1 - Oni vs Kenpachi Round 3 (Street Fighter vs Bleach)|date=2016-09-18|publisher=Hyun's Dojo|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roosterteeth.com/episode/dbx-season-2-iron-fist-vs-akuma|title=DBX - Iron Fist VS Akuma|date=2017-08-05|publisher=Screwattack|accessdate=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oni (SSFIVAE).jpg|thumb|upright|Oni in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition]]''|alt=]]

{{Nihongo|'''Oni'''|鬼|Oni|"Demon"}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''Kuruoshiki Oni'''|狂オシキ鬼|Kuruoshiki Oni|"Mad Demon"}} is a character who makes his debut in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition]]'' as a secret boss and a playable character. Oni is in fact Akuma, who has become one with the Satsui no Hado entirely.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Oni appears as a far more muscular and noticeably larger version of Akuma. He has dark blue skin, glowing yellow-red eyes, spiky shoulder-length hair, akin to the Super Saiyan of the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series. He also gains fangs and short protrusions on his forehead, resembling growing horns. The top half of his gi has been blown off by the amount of dark ki he emanates, showing off his musculature; the prayer beads that were once around his neck now float about disconnected around his body. He also has claws on his fingers and toes, and no longer wears sandals; his voice also sounds much more demonic. When using fierce attacks or powerful physical attacks of any kind, his arms and legs glow a superheated color. While it is difficult to spot, the kanji of "heaven" (天 ten) also appears on his back during the same animations, seemingly having branded itself on his back. Oni's moveset is similar to Akuma's but with additional moves and modifications. Oni can perform a fireball that disappears unless charged. To replace the Shankunetsu Hadouken, Oni has an electrical variant. His standing fierce punch cancels out fireballs. Added to Oni is a dashing spinning punch which can vary depending on what kick button is pressed. While jumping, Oni can do an evasive dash backward or forward or even perform a downward attack.  He also uses an overhead smash attack. Oni's gameplay consists of high-damage combos and reversal potential, combined with his above-average walk speed, that allows players to create massive-pressure situations while remaining mobile and flexible via buffering moves into other attacks, although he has below-average stamina, stun and short-range Focus Attack.

Oni appears in the second half of the second DLC Lost Episode The Strongest vs. The Angriest of the video game ''[[Asura's Wrath]]'', given the epithet of "Destroyer of Heaven". A Pandora version of Oni appears in Akuma's ending in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]''. He also appears as a playable character in strategic RPG ''Blood Brothers 2''.

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote= Akuma is the boogeyman of the martial arts world. A twisted monster who murdered (sort of) his own brother to prove a point. He wants to drive [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] to darkness for the sake of competition. He literally tears people’s souls apart with his bare hands in a move so out of control that we aren’t allowed to even see it happen. Yet at the end of the day, it’s hard to even label him as simply "evil." He’s beyond the duality. He foregoes the ideas of being merciless for the sake of being merciless. He’s strangely respectful to children and doesn’t kill unless he has reason—either because someone has agreed to a fight to the death or because someone outright tries to go after him.|source=—Gavin Jasper, ''[[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]'', 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/street-fighter/252283/street-fighter-ranking-all-the-characters/page/0/6|title=Street Fighter: Ranking All the Characters|first=Gavin|last=Jasper|work=Den of Geek|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=July 17, 2016|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30%}}
Akuma has received much critical acclaim from various [[Video game journalism|gaming media]] outlets. Japanese magazine ''Gamest'' named him one of their "Top 50 Characters of 1996", in a three-way tie for 37th.&lt;ref name=gamest10th&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ishii |first=Zenji |date=December 1996 |title=第10回ゲーメスト大賞 |journal=Gamest|volume=188 |issue= |page=46 |id= |url=http://www.netlaputa.ne.jp/~dummy/gamest/magazine/gamest/v188.html|language=Japanese |accessdate=December 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed first in ''[[Game Informer]]'s'' 2009 list of their "Top Ten Best Fighting Game Characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Top Ten Best Fighting Game Characters|journal=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=GameStop Corporation|date=August 2009|issn=1067-6392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Clements of IGN said in 2009: "Although M.

However, Akuma has often been criticized for his perceived status as an excessively powerful character in the ''Street Fighter'' series. Scott Baird of ''Screen Rant'' named him the second-"most unfairly overpowered fighting game character" behind [[Meta Knight]] of ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' in 2016, for the potency of his offensive attacks that resulted in Akuma being banned from ''SSFII Turbo'' tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/overpowered-fighting-video-game-characters/?view=all|title=15 Most Unfairly Overpowered Fighting Game Characters|first=Scott|last=Baird|work=Screen Rant|date=October 3, 2016|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' considered Akuma one of the "Most Broken Characters in Videogame History", for his "ridiculously powerful" moves that were "the bane of newbies and veterans alike,"&lt;ref name="gamepro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/222808/six-of-the-most-broken-characters-in-videogame-history/|title=Six of the Most Broken Characters in Videogame History|work=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|date=September 11, 2011 |author=Kat Bailey, et al.|accessdate=September 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/222808/six-of-the-most-broken-characters-in-videogame-history/&amp;date=2011-11-30+22:16:18|archivedate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment that was echoed by Christopher Hooton of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/05/18/noob-tube-to-pikachu-10-video-game-weapons-and-characters-that-were-just-too-good-3783830/|title=10 video game weapons and characters that were just too good|first=Christopher|last=Hooton|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro.co.uk]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|date=May 18, 2013|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Stephen Nadee of ''WhatCulture'' ranked Akuma as the second-worst boss in "great" fighting games: "For balancing issues Akuma is usually given a paper thin defense since his introduction ... [but] give him to the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] and you’d have quite a fight on your hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-worst-bosses-in-great-fighting-games.php/10 |title=10 Worst Bosses In Great Fighting Games » Page 10 of 11|first=Stephen|last=Nadee|work=WhatCulture |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Lucas Sullivan of ''GamesRadar'' ranked Akuma eleventh in his list of "12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit" in 2014. "Even if you ever do manage to finally defeat Akuma, it somehow doesn't feel earned. It's more like the [[Central processing unit|computer]] felt sorry for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/12-unfair-fighting-game-bosses-almost-made-us-rage-quit/ | title=12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit | last=Sullivan|first=Lucas | work=GamesRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|date=April 14, 2014 | accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Akuma was named by [[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] as the "Strongest Street Fighter character", with comments "In 1996’s ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'', Akuma evolved into a more powerful form, Shin Akuma, and he evolved into the even more powerful Oni in 2010’s ''Super Street Fighter IV''. Since he’s able to split mountains in that form, that version of Akuma stands as the most powerful being the Street Fighter universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/strongest-street-fighters/|title=World Warriors: The 20 Strongest Street Fighter Characters, Officially Ranked|publisher=CBR|date=2018-08-26|accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akuma's Oni incarnation has received a mixed reception. Joe Pring of ''WhatCulture'' observed in 2015: "Oni couldn't be more of a [[Marmite]] character, really. For every fan of Akuma's ascended form, there exists another that despises his very existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/street-fighter-v-15-huge-roster-omissions-that-must-return?page=9|title=Street Fighter V: 15 Huge Roster Omissions That Must Return|first=Joe|last=Pring|work=WhatCulture|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WatchMojo ranked him as the ninth-"Most Powerful Video Game Character" in 2016: "Possessing the stronger versions of all of Akuma's techniques, as well as even less humanity if that's possible, this is the closest a ''Street Fighter'' character actually gets to achieving godhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchmojo.com/video/id/16815/|title=Top 10 Most Powerful Video Game Characters|first=Alex|last=Crilly-McKean|first2=Dan|last2=Paradis|work=WatchMojo|date=September 19, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both characters shared the top spot in ''Screen Rant's'' rating of the "12 Most Powerful ''Street Fighter'' Characters" the same year. "Akuma alone has destroyed an entire island, so whoever has to stand against the unbridled destructive force of Oni, all we can say is God help them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/most-powerful-street-fighter-characters/12/|title=12 Most Powerful Street Fighter Characters|first=Christopher|last=Isaac|work=Screen Rant|date=April 18, 2016|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another ''Screen Rant's'' list "Street Fighter: 8 Most Powerful (And 8 Most Worthless) Characters", Akuma placed first. "Whether he is Oni, Akuma, or something in-between (Shin Akuma, for instance), the dark master easily proves that he is at the top of the SF heap in terms of both in-universe power and effectiveness among players who have mastered using him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/street-fighter-most-powerful-worthless-characters-ranked/|title=Street Fighter: 8 Most Powerful (And 8 Most Worthless) Characters, Ranked|publisher=Screen Rant|date=2018-01-19|accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Imran Khan of ''Paste'' rated Oni as one of the "all-time worst" series characters: "Oni strips away the few bits of Akuma that are actually interesting as a character and turns him into a castaway from a ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' movie in design and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-10-worst-street-fighter-characters-of-all-time.html?a=1|title=The 10 Worst Street Fighter Characters of All Time|first=Imran|last=Khan|work=pastemagazine.com|publisher=Paste Media Group|date=February 11, 2016|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph Ramsay of ''GameSpot'' considered Oni "one of the least interesting additions" to ''Super Street Fighter IV'', as he utilized moves similar to those of other characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ponnappa is an alumnus of the National Defence Academy. He was previously Commander of ''Shakti Vijay Brigade'' in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in 2012. As a representative of the [[Indian army]] he had flagged off an educational cum motivational tour under ''Operation Sadhbhavana'' in Tangdar area of north Kashmir’s [[Kupwara]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Army flags off educational tour |url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2012/Aug/25/army-flags-off-educational-tour-65.asp |accessdate=9 September 2014 |work=25 August 2012 |agency=Greater Kashmir |publisher=Rashid Makhdoomi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200043/http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2012/Aug/25/army-flags-off-educational-tour-65.asp |archivedate=10 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN Peacekeeping==
Later in 2012 he was sent to [[Goma]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] as part of [[India and the United Nations|India's UN Peacekeeping force]]. He was made [[MONUSCO]]'s [[North Kivu]] Brigade (NKB) Commander and addressed as '[[Brigadier General]]'. During the [[M23 rebellion]] in North Kivu the UN Peacekeepers secured the airport and maintained status quo while the security responsibilities of Goma was shared between the police deployment, the formed police of MONUSCO and the MONUSCO military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congo: UN peacekeepers patrol conflict-hit Goma|url=http://news.bdtv.in/2012/12/congo-un-peacekeepers-patrol-conflict.html|accessdate=9 September 2014|agency=BDTV|publisher=Beyond Dimensions Television|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR CONGO / GOMA PEACEKEEPERS|url=http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/unifeed/2012/12/dr-congo-goma-peacekeepers/|accessdate=9 September 2014|agency=UNIFEED|publisher=MONUSCO (United Nations)|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponnappa served under Brazilian Lt. General [[Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz]] who succeeded India's [[Chander Prakash]] as Force Commander of MONUSCO  in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/sga1407.doc.htm |title=Secretary-General Appoints Lieutenant General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz |publisher=United Nations |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his command, [[North Kivu]] Brigade were blamed for not stopping the [[March 23 Movement|M23]] rebel group from marching into Goma. In fact, M23 passed right beside [[Munigi]] Hill which was occupied by NKB.

In 2013, the [[Indian Army]] planned and implemented a water treatment plant at Otobora, a Congolese village in Walikale, D R Congo, with MONUSCO's approval. The facility was inaugurated by Brigadier General C B Ponnappa on 4 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IMQ in Indian Army|title=Indian Army Provides Treated Water to Congolese Village (October 7, 2013)|url=http://indianmilitaryquotes.com/indian-army-provides-treated-water-to-congolese-village/|website=Indian Military Quotes|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biff Howard Tannen''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]]. [[Thomas F. Wilson]] plays Biff in all three films as well as the [[Universal Studios]] ride, and voiced the character in the [[Back to the Future: The Animated Series|animated series]]. He is the [[main antagonist]] of the [[Back to the Future|first]] [[Back to the Future Part II|two]] films, and a villainous lesser character in the [[Back to the Future Part III|third]] film (which dealt with his [[Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen|great-grandfather]]).

Biff is portrayed as a towering, violent and aggressive bully who obtains what he wants by intimidating others into doing his work for him, or by cheating. He and his family members are shown to misuse [[idiom]]s in a way that makes them appear stupid and pathetic despite their intention to insult or scare. His favorite insult is "butthead".

==Character biography==

===Early life===
Biff was born in [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]], [[California]]. He is the great-grandson of [[Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen]] and grandfather of [[Griff Tannen]]. Rather than studying in high school, he prefers to bully [[George McFly]] into doing his homework for him while he drinks and hangs out with his friends. Feared by most of his schoolmates, he is less brave without his gang ([[List of Back to the Future characters#Match, Skinhead, and 3-D|Match, Skinhead, and 3-D]]). The only person at Hill Valley High school that Biff is afraid of is [[List of Back to the Future characters#Gerald Strickland|Mr. Strickland]]. He has been living with his grandmother, Gertrude Tannen, at 1809 Mason Street for some time by November 1955.

===Relationships===
In 1955, Biff had a crush on [[Lorraine Baines McFly|Lorraine Baines]] who does not return the sentiments.  However, the alternate 1985 reveals that Lorraine, widowed after the murder of George McFly, ended up marrying Biff so her children could live a better life.  In the original 1985, Biff's marital status is unknown as no mention of a wife was ever made in the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/back_to_the_future_original_draft.html |title=Back To The Future |publisher=Scifiscripts.com |date=1952-03-18 |accessdate=2015-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095351/http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/back_to_the_future_original_draft.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
By 2015, Biff has a teenage grandson, Griff, suggesting that Biff had at least one child by 1985. The animated series reveals that Biff has a son, Biff Jr.

==Character creation==
The character is named for studio executive [[Ned Tanen]] following an incident years earlier where Tanen reacted aggressively to a script being pitched by the film's writers [[Bob Gale]] and [[Robert Zemeckis]]. Tanen accused the two of attempting to produce an antisemitic work with their 1978 film ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Freer|Freer, Ian]]. "The making of Back to the Future", ''[[Empire (magazine)]]'', January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Q&amp;A with Director Robert Zemeckis &amp; Producer Bob Gale","Back to the Future DVD -, Bonus Materials&lt;/ref&gt;  Drafts of "Back to the Future" show Biff with the middle initial of "H", but this detail was omitted in further revisions.

As the films' important October 2015 date approached, commentators began noting the similarities between the older version of Biff Tannen and then presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]]. When the comparison was brought to Gale's attention in an interview, he stated that elements of Tannen's personality were actually based on Trump, who was already well known in the late 1980s for his work in real estate and tabloid controversies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/21/how-back-to-the-future-predicted-trump.html# Daily Beast: Biff Tannen Is Based on Donald Trump]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blas Roca Calderio''' (24 July 1908 – 25 April 1987) was a Cuban politician and [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theorist]] who served as President of the National Assembly of People's Power in [[Cuba]] from 1976 to 1981. He was also head of the pre-1959 revolution [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|Communist Party of Cuba]] for 28 years and editor of the communist newspaper ''Hoy''. He was a signatory of the Cuban Constitution of 1940 and chaired the committee that wrote the country's first socialist constitution in 1976.

==Political life==
Blas Roca, born Francisco Calderio in [[Manzanillo, Cuba]], a leading [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] of the [[Cuban Revolution]] who led Cuba's pre-revolutionary Communist Party for 28 years, left school at the age of 11 and began shining shoes to help support his poor family. He changed his name to Roca, meaning 'rock', after he joined the Communist Party in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/27/obituaries/blas-roca-cuban-communist-and-party-theoretician-dies.html The Newyork Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, he was elected Secretary General of the Union of Shoemakers of Manzanillo. In August 1931 he was elected to the [[Central Committee]] of the Communist Party and appointed head of his organization in the East. During this stage he displayed a wide journalistic activity in the labor press and led popular protests that culminated in the historic general strike of August 1933, which overthrew the [[Gerardo Machado|Machado]] dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-66678253/ongoing-problems-construction-sector.html AccessMyLibrary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blas had grown remarkably in a few years as result of his abilities and participation in intensive popular and workers' struggles. He was called to the capital at a time the party needed a strong guiding direction, and replaced the party leader and poet [[Rubén Martínez Villena]], who would make his last public appearance in September 1933 at the burial of fellow communist [[Julio Antonio Mella|Julio Antonio Mella's]] ashes. Thus, at 26 years of age, Blas had become the leader of the Cuban Communists and would remain so until the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. He is credited for shifting the party from an ultra left sect to an influential national organization.

In August 1935, Blas Roca attended the 7th Congress of the [[Communist International]] in Moscow, where [[Georgi Dimitrov]] outlined what became the new popular front strategy. Roca was instrumental in adapting the popular front to Cuban conditions. Originally identifying [[Fulgencio Batista]] with fascism, in 1938 at the Party's Tenth Plenary Assembly in Havana Blas Roca told the party leaders that circumstances had changed and Batista "ceased to be the leading figure in the reactionary camp." According to K.S. Karol (Guerrillas in Power), Blas explained the threat of an economic and political crisis had split the Cuban Right into two camps: the fascists, who favored brute force to solve the crisis on the backs of the people, and the Batista forces who favored reforms and dialogue.

An alliance with the Batista forces led to the legalization of the communist-led Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC), the party daily ''Hoy'' and the party itself, then known as the Unión Revolucionaria Comunista (Revolutionary Communist Union). The alliance continued into the Constituent Assembly elections of 1939 in which the communists elected 6 delegates, led by Roca and Juan Marinello. Roca would serve 12 years in the legislature. The resulting [[Cuban Constitution of 1940]], with Blas Roca as one of the signers, embodied many progressive and socialist provisions. In the following presidential election, the communists supported Batista's candidacy as part of his [[Democratic Socialist Coalition]]. Years later, when Batista accused Fidel Castro's revolutionaries of being communist led, Castro reminded readers of the magazine [[Bohemia]] that Batista had been endorsed by the communists in 1940 and that former party members were then serving in the Batista government.

In the 1930s, Roca's communist party also organized support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], with a formidable campaign that included not only moral and material assistance but also sending about a thousand Cuban combatants to the [[International Brigades]].

Under Blas Roca's direction, Cuba's communist party grew in size and influence with key control over trade unions and other support organizations. During World War II, two communists served in Batista's war-time cabinet as ministers without portfolio, [[Carlos Rafael Rodriguez]] and [[Juan Marinello]], both of whom would later serve in top positions under Fidel Castro. The party operated a popular radio station, [[Radio Mil Diez]], and membership was in the tens of thousands.

The party's influence grew tremendously during the Second World War as the U.S. and Cuba were allied with the Soviet Union. Support for the party was strongest among Cuban intellectuals and artists, and counted among its members and sympathizers such notable Cubans as the novelist [[Alejo Carpentier]], the poet [[Juan Marinello]], who served as the party's chair, the painter [[Wifredo Lam]], the national poet [[Nicolás Guillén]], the writers [[Félix Pita Rodríguez]], [[Mirta Aguirre]], and [[Pablo de la Torriente Brau]], and the economists Jacinto Torres and Raúl Cepero Bonilla. As Tad Szulc wrote in his biography of Fidel Castro about the Cuban communists, "In truth, there were few creative personalities in Cuba since 1930 who were not on the left, or the extreme left" (Fidel: A Critical Portrait, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;131).

During the 1940s, the Cuban Communists renamed the [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|Popular Socialist Party]] (PSP) followed the lead of U.S. Communist leader [[Earl Browder]]. Following the Second World War, as tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. intensified, the world communist movement condemned [[Browderism]] as a form of class collaboration and revisionism. The Cuban party, which under Roca's leadership had hewed closest to the Browder positions, such as forming a broad democratic alliance pushing policies to the left, denounced Browder and his views while remaining loyal to Stalinist principles.

With Batista's coup of March 10, 1952, the party now weakened under the anti-communist [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] administration, condemned the actions. After Fidel Castro's July 26, 1953 attack on the Moncada army barracks, the Cuban communists condemned the attack as a "putsch" which did not involve mass struggle.  At the time of the Moncada attack, party leaders were involved in a clandestine conference in Santiago and were also celebrating Roca's birthday (July 24). Batista quickly blamed the communist party for the "criminal incident."

As the party's ability to operate openly was blocked, key leaders began to rethink their attitude towards Fidel Castro's [[26th of July Movement]] and the strategy of armed struggle.

During the 1950s, the party went underground, and Blas Roca spent a whole year living in China in 1955-1956. Returning to Cuba with the victory of the revolution, Roca reorganized the party and firmly reoriented it under the leadership of Fidel Castro. In fact, Roca praised Castro for his armed strategy and criticized the party for failing to prepare for armed struggle.  Blas Roca told the Eighth National Assembly of the PSP in August 1960:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guerrillas in Power: The Course of the Cuban Revolution|last=Karol|first=K.S.|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

″We rightly foresaw, and greatly looked forward to, the prospect that in response to conditions created by the tyranny, the masses would organize and eventually engage in armed struggle or popular insurrection. But for a long time we failed to take any practical steps to hasten that prospect, because we believed that these struggles, including a prolonged general strike, would culminate in armed insurrection quite spontaneously. Hence, we did not prepare, did not organize or train armed detachments.... That was our mistake. Fidel Castro's historical merit is that he prepared, trained, and assembled the fighting elements needed to begin and carry on armed struggle as a means of destroying the tyranny.″ (K.S. Karol, Guerrillas in Power, p.&amp;nbsp;149, footnote, 1970).

Under Roca's leadership the Cuban communists were instrumental in providing an organizational and ideological structure for Castro's socialist revolution as well as playing a pivotal role using the party's long-standing ties with the Soviet Union to promote increasingly closer ties during the early days of the revolution. In 1961, Blas Roca, leading a party delegation, presented a Cuban flag to [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during a meeting of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

Shortly afterwards the communists dissolved into the [[Integrated Revolutionary Organizations]], along with the 26th of July Movement and the Directorio Revolucionario, with communists holding at least 10 of the 24 National Directorate positions. Roca served on the first central committee and politburo of the new [[Communist Party of Cuba]] founded in 1965.

Roca also served from 1976 through 1981 as president of the National Assembly of Popular Power, having chaired the committee that drafted the 1976 Cuban socialist constitution.

His remains were buried in a simple grave near the monument to Cuban independence leader [[Antonio Maceo Grajales|Antonio Maceo]] just outside Havana.

Roca's son, [[Vladimiro Roca]], is an outspoken dissident and critic of the current Cuban party and government, arrested numerous times for his public activities advocating for democratic reforms.

==Books==
Roca wrote numerous books, articles and pamphlets before and after the revolution, including ''The Foundations of Socialism in Cuba,'' published in 1943. The book was the primary text used in educating communist party militants from the 1940s on. After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, it was one of the main textbooks used by the Schools of Revolutionary Instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom|last=Thomas|first=Hugh|publisher=Harper and Row|year=1971|isbn=0060142596|location=New York|pages=1314|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Escuelas de Instrucción Revolucionaria) to train leaders and party cadres in the newly-formed Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, the party merging the July 2nd Movement, the Popular Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Directorate, and eventually becoming the new [[Communist Party of Cuba]] in 1965.

'''Charles Graham Spoonhour''' (June 23, 1939 – February 1, 2012) was an American [[basketball]] coach.

Spoonhour was born in [[Mulberry, Kansas]], attended high school in [[Rogers, Arkansas]], and received an education degree from the [[University of the Ozarks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisenbath|first=Mike|title=As Cincy Visits, Bills Still Groping|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=January 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent seven seasons as a high school basketball coach, then fourteen seasons bouncing between [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] assistant coaching positions and junior college head coaching positions. This included a four-year stretch from 1969 to 1973 as an assistant coach on the staff of head coach Bill Thomas at then-[[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] [[Missouri State Bears men's basketball|Missouri State]].&lt;ref name=BR1&gt;{{cite web|last=Novak|first=Thad|title=Mike Anderson to Arkansas: Top 10 Coaches Who Starred Where They Were Assistants|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/646319-mike-anderson-to-arkansas-top-10-coaches-who-starred-where-they-were-assistants#/articles/646319-mike-anderson-to-arkansas-top-10-coaches-who-starred-where-they-were-assistants/page/3|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=7 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, Spoonhour was on the staff of [[Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball|Nebraska]] coach [[Moe Iba]], when he was hired as the head coach of [[Missouri State Bears men's basketball|Missouri State]] for the 1983–84 season, a year after the Bears had moved up to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. He led the Bears to five [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances in a six-season stretch from 1987 to 1992. His best season was in 1986–87 when the Bears won the [[Mid-Continent Conference]] with a 13–1 mark and finished 28–6. Behind future [[NBA]] [[point guard]] [[Winston Garland]],&lt;ref name=BR1/&gt; they made it to the second round of the [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987 NCAA Tournament]] as a #13-seed, beating fourth-seeded [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]], 65–60 ,before losing to fifth-seeded [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], 67–63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2010-11 Missouri State Men's Basketball Annual|year=2011|publisher=Missouri State University|pages=158|url=http://www.issuu.com/msubearsathletics/docs/2010-11mbb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1991–92 season, he went to [[Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball|Saint Louis University]], where he led the Billikens to three NCAA tournament appearances in seven seasons.  In 2001, he went to the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], where he retired from coaching following the 2003-04 season.

In 2010, he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and placed on the recipient list for a lung transplant. He received the lung transplant at [[Duke University Hospital|Duke University Medical Center]] in August 2010, and was said to be in good condition, according to the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]. He spent the next six months recuperating at Duke.

On February 1, 2012, Spoonhour died at the age of 72.

On April 6, 2012, Spoonhour's son, [[Jay Spoonhour]], was named the head men's basketball coach at [[Eastern Illinois University]].

The '''death of Yehuda Shoham''' occurred as a consequence of a 5 June 2001 [[Palestinian stone-throwing|stoning attack attributed to Palestinians]] on the civilian vehicle, near the Israeli village of [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin|Eli]] and Palestinian settlement of [[Isawiya]] in the [[West Bank]], in which the five-month-old [[American-Israeli]] Yehuda Shoham was seated. Rocks crashed through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. Shoham died of severe [[brain damage]] on 11 July 2001.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Memorial/2001/Yehuda+Shoham.htm|title=Yehuda Shoham // In Memory of the Victims of Palestinian Violence and Terrorism in Israel|publisher=[[mfa.gov.il]]|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeadlyReality&gt;{{cite web|title=The Deadly Reality of Palestinian Rock Throwing|url=https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/02/24/deadly-reality-palestinian-rock-throwing/|publisher=[[Israel Defense Forces]]|date=2014-02-24|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and, according to [[B'tselem]], sparked a [[Israeli settlement|settler]] attack on two Palestinian villages, in which a Palestinian youth was shot while Israeli soldiers watched (or even participated).{{r|btselem}}{{r|rampage}}
Both incidents were part of a [[Second Intifada]] that started in September, 2000 and by 12 June 2001 had claimed the lives of 489 Palestinians and 109 Israelis.{{r|sevareid}}

==The attack==
The incident occurred as Benny and Batsheva Shoham and their only child Yehuda approached Eli after paying a [[Shiva (Judaism)#Visiting a shiva home|shiva call]] in [[Ra'anana]].&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;

Near Eli, Palestinians hiding at the roadside hurled rocks at the car which broke through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt; The father continued driving, worried about an ambush, and at a nearby intersection, the couple noticed their baby's head injuries.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt; Batsheva performed [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] on Yehuda until the arrival of paramedics.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;

Yehuda was taken to an intensive care unit at the [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Hospital]] in Jerusalem, where he lay unconscious and with severe head injuries. He was attached to a respirator for nearly a week before dying of severe brain damage on 11 July.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/disproportionate-number-of-anglos-slain-olmert-praises-families-dignity-1.67914|title=Disproportionate number of Anglos slain; Olmert praises families' dignity|first=Charlotte|last= Halle|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Jewish"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Jewish Year, Book 2002|publisher=VNR AG|author1=Singer, David  |author2=Grossman, Lawrence|year=2003|page=561|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDuzdSm5W5AC&amp;pg=PA561&amp;lpg=PA561|isbn=0874951178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the hospital, Yehuda's parents gave him a second name, "Chaim," which means life, hoping that he would live.&lt;ref name=defeat&gt;{{cite news|title='Arafat must be defeated,' protesters say.

==Background==
The [[Al-Aqsa intifada|Second Intifada]], which began 8 months earlier, marked a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence. On 22 May, Sharon declared a unilateral ceasefire and refrained from retaliating against Palestinian attacks. On Friday, 1 June, [[Dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing|a suicide bombing outside a Tel Aviv disco]] occurred which killed 21 people, mainly Israeli teenagers who had immigrated from Russia.&lt;ref name=hobart/&gt; The day after, Saturday, June 2, Yasser Arafat's call for a cease-fire staved off Israeli retaliation.&lt;ref name=lavie&gt;Mark Lavie, [http://lubbockonline.com/stories/060601/upd_075-3294.shtml "U.S. sending CIA director for security talks"], ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', 6 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the meantime, Israel took a variety of measures to reduce tension, with Defense Minister [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]] citing a "significant reduction in the number of attacks". Though Palestinians would be subject to strict closure confining them to their towns, Israel eased some travel restrictions and Palestinians were to be allowed to return from Jordan and Egypt, raw materials would be permitted to enter and exit the Palestinian territories, and Palestinians would be allowed to return to their jobs in an industrial zone near the [[Erez Crossing|Erez crossing point]]. Palestinian security commanders traveled to trouble spots in the [[Gaza Strip]] to consult with local officers over the cease-fire enforcement.&lt;ref name=lavie/&gt;

When news of Yehuda's wounding spread on Tuesday, 5 June, Sharon began to be urged by far-right settlers to retaliate.&lt;ref name=rampage&gt;{{cite news|title=Settler rampage makes CIA chief's peace mission harder|work=The Scotsman|date=7 June 2001|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%200F687B6ED9801F04%20%29&amp;p_docid=0F687B6ED9801F04&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0F687B6ED9801F04&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=V5BQ57OOMTM0NDc5Nzk4NS4xNTA0NDU6MToxMzoxOTIuMTYwLjIxNi4w&amp;&amp;p_multi=EDSC|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident angered Israel's 200,000 settlers who urged Ariel Sharon to end Israel's "policy of restraint", and abandon the ceasefire.  ''[[The Independent]]'' suggested that the incident would be cited by many Israelis as reason for stepping up military measures.&lt;ref name="I" /&gt; The morning after Yehuda's wounding, at least 300 settlers, arriving in buses, assailed two villages adjacent to Shiloh, [[Zawiya, West Bank|Assawiya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:MWSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0ECC8CA763BA20B8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=Settlers attack Palestinian village - Injury to baby triggers fury|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=7 June 2001|author=Nomi Morris|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya|Luban al-Sharkiya]], which lay under [[curfew]] and within Israel's security responsibility, and, according to [[B'tselem]], in the presence of, and according to local testimony, with the assistance of the IDF, fired a wheat harvest, a hothouse, a carpentry shop and a school, stole tools and shot a Palestinian youth in the stomach&lt;ref name="btselem"&gt;Ron Dudai,[http://www.btselem.org/sites/default/files/publication/200110_free_rein_eng.pdf "Free Rein: Vigilante Settlers and Israel's Non-Enforcement of the Law"], [[B'tselem]], October 2001, pp 9-11:'Israeli security forces were present throughout the events but did not prevent the violence.

There were rock-throwing battles between settlers and Palestinians at the site of the attack on the Shohams' car during which one Israeli and seven Palestinians were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:BPOC&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F687B6FDF9E3AC5&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=Sharon attack blows away uneasy calm|work=The Birmingham Post|date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keyser&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon supporters warn they're tired of Israeli restraint|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:APAB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F8922A1308850F6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|author=Jayson Keyser|publisher=Associated Press Archive|date=6 June 2001|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, settlers in [[Hebron]] also attacked local Palestinian shopkeepers. The settlers had been a focal target of Palestinian militancy during an eight-month uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:MWSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0ECC8CA763BA20B8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=Settlers attack Palestinian village - Injury to baby triggers fury|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=7 June 2001|author=Nomi Morris|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two settlers were arrested by Israeli police as a result of the riots.&lt;ref name=sevareid/&gt;

Though reluctant to become involved in the conflict, the U.S. dispatched C.I.A. director [[George Tenet]], who was scheduled to meet separately with the Israeli and Palestinian sides on Thursday, June 7, in order to re-establish co-operation on security issues between the two parties, which had broken down after the IDF had shot at the car of the Gaza Strip security chief [[Mohammad Dahlan]] in mid-April, and had fired on the home of their West Bank security chief [[Jibril Rajoub]] in late May.&lt;ref name="rampage"/&gt;

Tenet's visit backed up an effort by the [[European Union]] to seize on Arafat's declaration in order to transform the ceasefire into a genuine halt to the reciprocal blood-letting.&lt;ref name="rampage"/&gt; On Wednesday, 6 June, the eve of Tenet's scheduled visit, the IDF announced it would award medals to the commanders and troops serving at [[Muhammad al-Durrah incident|Netzarim Junction]], where the child, [[Mohammed al-Dura]] had been shot dead. The news was seen as a blow to the restoration of trust. Thousands of demonstrators protested in Jerusalem against what they termed Sharon's "restraint policy".&lt;ref name="rampage"/&gt; That same evening, Palestinians were outraged when Sharon called Arafat a "murderer" and "pathological liar" in an interview addressing the Russian community that had been angered at his failure to retaliate for the disco bombing. The broadcast was carried on Israeli television. Though given the red-carpet treatment abroad, he added, Arafat did not act like a head of state but rather like the chief of terrorists and murderers.&lt;ref name="lavie"/&gt; 
 
On Thursday, 7 June, speaking to reporters at a rally urging Ariel Sharon to retaliate for the attack on Yehuda and other recent attacks, Yehuda's father said "Unfortunately, our government is showing a lot of weakness in its response to terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israelis urge Sharon to End Restraint Plan|publisher=Press of Atlantic City|date=7 June 2001|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also declared:&lt;blockquote&gt;This is our land, these are our roads, and if we are afraid of driving to Tel Aviv &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Tel Aviv]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and Netanya &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Netanya]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; also.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Negotiations, funeral and reactions==
Tenet’s meeting with both sides was postponed until Sunday, June 10, after the Americans realized the extent of their differences. Matters were buffeted by the killing of three [[Bedouin]] women, struck by Israeli tank shells while in their tents in the Gaza Strip over the weekend, and the critical injuries sustained by an [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] member in a car-bombing, which the group suspected as being the work of Israel.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1383717.stm Mid-East ceasefire talks break up], [[BBC News]] 11 Monday 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that Israel desist from attacking Palestinian targets and withdraw to the positions they held on [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|28 September 2000]]. He asked Palestinians to thwart attacks on Israeli positions, to end what Israelis view as incitement in the media, and to proceed to arrest militant gunmen.&lt;ref name=bbcnews/&gt;

On Monday, 11 June, the day Yehuda died, Israeli Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]] met the Palestinian minister for international co-operation, [[Nabil Shaath]] in Luxembourg to explore a compromise. Tenet eventually presided over a tense 4-hour meeting the following day, which was broken off after the gaps failed to be bridged. The Israelis insisted on the arrest of people they suspected of terrorism before they would allow a cooling-off period, while the Palestinians demanded that security arrangements be followed by an Israeli pledge to freeze to all construction in settlements in the occupied territories.&lt;ref name=frantz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/12/world/israeli-palestinian-negotiations-break-off-after-4-hours.html|title=Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations Break Off After 4 Hours|first=Douglas|last=Frantz|publisher=NYT|date=12 June 2001|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinians refused to conduct what they called arbitrary arrests. The chief of staff of the Israeli army, General [[Shaul Mofaz]], called the truce itself an optical illusion.&lt;ref name=bbcnews/&gt;

The funeral procession for Yehuda began with settlers gathering in front of [[Ariel Sharon]]'s office in Jerusalem&lt;ref name=hobart/&gt; with the child's body carried before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish settlers in West Bank urge revenge for dead baby|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4596021.html|date=12 June 2001|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Sharon stepped up to a podium to address them, settlers shouted "Vengeance!" and "Go to war".&lt;ref name=sevareid&gt;{{cite news|title=Injury to baby triggers rampage by Israeli settlers|first=Susan|last=Sevareid|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010612&amp;slug=mide12|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|others=''[[Reuters]] contributed to this report.''|date=7 June 2001|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Sharon spoke to the funeral procession outside his office,&lt;ref name=hobart&gt;{{cite news|title=Settlers blame Sharon for baby's death|publisher=Hobart Mercury|date=13 June 2001|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AHMB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FDC728F9943E7A7&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, acknowledging the settlers' impatience with a ceasefire,&lt;ref name=sevareid/&gt; said:&lt;blockquote&gt;If we stand firm and grit our teeth, and carry on even when the tears are choking us, we will win...&lt;ref name="hobart"/&gt; I am not here to make a speech, but to weep, to weep together with you.

Sharon also asked for prayers for the infant, and accused the [[Palestinian Authority]] of inciting violence.&lt;ref name=frantz/&gt; From there the procession walked to the northern West Bank settlement of [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]] where Yehuda was buried.

In Yehuda's memory, his parents decided to collect donations for dormitories at the [[yeshiva]] in Shiloh.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} His parents also established the Yehuda Fund in January 2002 "in their son's memory."&lt;ref name="Yehuda Fund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yehuda-fund.org|title=Yehuda Fund|publisher=Yehuda Fund|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deva''' in the [[New Age movement]] refers to any of the spiritual forces or beings behind [[nature]].  The origin of the word 'deva' comes from the Sanskrit language. According to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] devas represent a separate [[Evolution (philosophy)|evolution]] to that of [[human race|humanity]]. The concept of devas as nature-spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist [[Geoffrey Hodson]]. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the [[ecology]] function better.  It is asserted they can be observed by those whose [[third eye]]s have been activated.&lt;ref name="Hodson, Geoffrey 1952"&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods''. 1952. {{ISBN|0-7661-8134-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the [[Sun]], the indwelling [[solar deity]] of which Theosophists call the ''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]]''—these devas are called ''solar angels'', or sometimes ''solar devas'' or ''solar spirits''.  Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated.&lt;ref name="Hodson, Geoffrey 1952"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W  ''A Textbook of Theosophy''. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution''. London:1930. The Theosophical Publishing House. See the chart on page 44 called "The Evolution of Life"--this ''lifewave chart'' shows the various life forms that evolving souls inhabit as they reincarnate. The ''solar spirits'' living inside the Sun are shown at the top of the chart as the most advanced life forms in our [[solar system]].&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other [[star]]s besides [[Sun|Sol]]; these are called ''stellar angels''.

In the [[Findhorn Foundation|Findhorn]] material, the term refers to [[archetype|archetypal]] spiritual intelligences behind species, in other words the group soul of a species.

Some New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of [[Etheric plane|etheric matter]]--[[elemental]]s, [[nature spirit]]s (including the various types of nature spirits such as [[fairy|fairies]], [[Undine (alchemy)|ondines]], etc.). The pre-New Age etymology of the term is described in the article [[Deva (Hinduism)]].

'''Donald Southam Lawrence''' (17 November 1928 – 29 December 2003) was a British comic book artist and author.

Lawrence is best known for his [[comic strip]]s ''[[Trigan Empire|The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire]]'' in the British weeklies ''[[Ranger magazine|Ranger]]'' and ''[[Look and Learn]]'' and the ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' series, first published in the Dutch weekly ''[[Eppo (comics)|Eppo]]'' (later relaunched as ''[[Sjors &amp; Sjimmie]]'') and subsequently in album form. Famous for his realistic and detailed style, he was an inspiration for later UK comic-book artists such as [[Brian Bolland]], [[Dave Gibbons]] and [[Chris Weston]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/nyregion/don-lawrence-75-science-fiction-illustrator.html Don Lawrence, 75, Science Fiction Illustrator]&lt;/ref&gt; (indeed, Weston was taught by Lawrence), and influenced Indonesian artist Apri Kusbiantoro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/09/04/apri-kusbiantoro-indonesian-successor-of-don-lawrence.html Apri Kusbiantoro: Indonesian successor of Don Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[East Sheen]], a suburb of London, Lawrence was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St. Paul's School]], [[Hammersmith]]. After joining the Army for his [[National Service]], Lawrence used his gratuity to study art at Borough Polytechnic Institute (now the [[London South Bank University]]) but failed his final exams. Shortly before, a former student had visited the school to show students the work he was doing as a [[letterer]] on [[comic strips]]. Lawrence was inspired to take some samples to an editor at [[Fleetway|Amalgamated Press]] who suggested he try showing them to Mick Anglo, who ran a studio packaging comic strips for a London publisher and magazine distributor, Len Miller.

==Career==
Lawrence worked for Anglo for four years, drawing the adventures of [[superhero]] ''[[Marvelman]]'' and various [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[comic strips]]. After an argument with Anglo over pay rates, he found work with Odhams Press, drawing ''[[Wells Fargo]]'' for [[Zip (comic)|Zip]], and with the Amalgamated Press (now renamed [[Fleetway|Fleetway Publications]]), contributing episodes of ''[[Billy the Kid (comic)|Billy the Kid]]'' to the comic [[Sun (comic)|Sun]]. When the ailing Sun merged with [[Lion (comic)|Lion]], Lawrence switched to [[Swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] historical strips, ''[[Olac the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Karl the Viking]]'' and ''[[Maroc the Mighty]] (written by [[Michael Moorcock]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/21/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries Obituary: Don Lawrence | Global | The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

A colour strip produced for ''Lion Annual 1965'' ('Karl the Viking and the Tideless Sea') led to Lawrence being offered colour work in [[Bible Story]] magazine and the sprawling [[science fantasy]] ''[[Trigan Empire|The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire]]'' which debuted in [[Ranger magazine|Ranger]] in 1965. Lawrence was to draw the strip in the pages of Ranger and [[Look and Learn]] until 1976.

In 1976 Lawrence attended the London comic book convention called ''Comics 101'', the first convention dedicated to British comic book creators. There he learned that The Trigan Empire was syndicated all over Europe. When his publisher refused to give him any form of royalties or compensation, he departed from his old employer and was immediately offered work on a new Dutch comic called ''[[Eppo (comics)|Eppo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.com/british-artist-don-lawrence-dies-at-75/ British Artist Don Lawrence Dies at 75]&lt;/ref&gt; After an abortive start on a strip entitled ''Commander Grek'' written by his friend [[Vince Wernham]], Lawrence found success with ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]''. The first volume, ''The Deep World'', was based on a concept by [[Martin Lodewijk]] but written by [[Philip Dunn (cartoonist)|Philip Dunn]]. A further 22 volumes followed.

Lawrence did not limit himself solely to Trigan Empire and Storm and other strips he drew include ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' and ''[[Tarzan|The Adventures of Tarzan]]'' for [[TV Century 21]], ''Carrie'' for the [[men's magazine]] [[Mayfair (magazine)|Mayfair]] and a number of one-off strips for various Dutch publishers.

A number of partly completed and unpublished comic strips appeared in the series [[Don Lawrence Collection]], published in the Netherlands. The final Storm serial (completed by Lawrence's former assistant [[Liam Sharp]] appeared in the magazine ''Pandarve'' published by the Don Lawrence Fanclub in 1999–2001. One of his last illustrations was the cover of volume 6 of the Storm -the collection- from 2002.

In the mid 80s he was looking for an assistant and accepted then 17-years old [[Liam Sharp]] as his apprentice, but after realizing he did not want to step back as much as he had though he would, he helped Sharp develop his own style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/british-comic-book-artist-liam-sharp-on-his-career-dc-or-marvel-and-advice-for-his-younger-self-1.620089 British comic-book artist Liam Sharp on his career, DC or Marvel, and advice for his younger self]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1995, he lost sight of his right eye, caused by an infection after an unsuccessful [[cataract]] operation. With his [[depth perception]] gone, he could no longer see when the tip of his pen and brush touched the paper's surface, forcing him to teach himself an alternative drawing technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/biography/en/just75.php The World of Don Lawrence – Just 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

He went through a new cataract operation in 1999, this time without medical complications. But his general health was starting to decline, and when he was diagnosed with [[emphysema]] and put on medication, he permanently retired from comics and art.

Lawrence died in December 2003 of emphysema at the age of 75.

'''Gabriel Dumont''' (December 1837 – May 1906)  was a Canadian political figure best known for being a prominent leader of the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] people. Dumont was well known for his movements within the [[North-West Rebellion]] at the Battles of [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]], [[Fish Creek (Saskatchewan)|Fish Creek]], and [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan|Duck Lake]] as well as for his role in the signing of treaties with the Blackfoot tribe, the traditional main enemy of the Métis.

Dumont was born to Isidore Dumont and Louise Laframboise in 1837 in [[Red River Valley|Red River]]. Growing up Dumont had little in the way of education – he was [[illiterate]] but could speak seven languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gabriel Dumont Speaks|last=Dumont|first=Gabriel|publisher=Talonbooks|year=1993|isbn=9780889226258|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|pages=5, 7, 27, 69, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of his life, Dumont relied on [[Bison hunting|buffalo hunting]] in order to gain a source of food. His family made a living through hunting buffalo and trading with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. After his time leading the Métis people alongside Louis Riel, Dumont spent time travelling throughout the United States where he spoke at public speaking events and political campaigns. In 1889 he dictated his [[memoirs]] in Quebec.

Dumont known throughout the Métis community for his various political and military endeavours. Among his chiefest political campaigns was the severing of a treaty between the Métis and the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] in 1882. Just one year later, Dumont was elected hunt chief of the [[Saskatchewan]] Métis. Dumont was known as the [[adjutant]] general of the Métis people – he played a large role in the well-being of the Métis community and their subsequent resistance against the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] during the North-West Rebellion. Dumont also figured prominently in the [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan|Duck Lake]] conflict, as well as the battles of [[Fish Creek (Saskatchewan)|Fish Creek]] and [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]]

Dumont's legacy is marked by his grave in Batoche, as well as through his mark on the Métis people. Gabriel Bridge, a bridge that spans the [[Saskatchewan River]], is named after Dumont, as are several research institutions and schools. In addition, many books and poems have been written about Dumont's life, his works, and his legacy as a political figure.

==Early life==
Dumont was the grandson of the French-Canadian commoner Jean-Baptiste Dumont and his First Nation wife Josette of the Tsuu T’ina-Crow tribe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/dumont-gabriel|title=Gabriel Dumont|last=Gaudry|first=Adam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Isidore Dumont (known commonly as Ekapow)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?BioId=40814|title=Biography – DUMONT, GABRIEL – Volume XIII (1901-1910) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Louise Laframboise, who made their home in the [[Red River Colony]]'''.''' Dumont was born as the fourth child, the eldest son of eleven children to Isidore and Louise in the year 1837 in what is now known as [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His indigenous background signalled that Dumont's early life was often marred by a lack of education, considering the circumstances of his family this was not entirely uncommon. He spent the majority of his childhood travelling across the [[prairie]] following the [[bison]] and learning the skills to become a [[hunter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dumont family was known throughout the settlement of Red River as a prominent Métis buffalo hunting family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to this distinction, they held a long-vaunted relationship with the Saskatchewan area as leaders of a brigade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Dumont family made their fortune through hunting in the lands controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company, with the primary source of their income coming through the trade of pemmican with the company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dumont was introduced to the art of Métis buffalo hunting in his childhood years, and over time mastered the nuances of prairie life. This would equip him in the years to come for the conflict he would endure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madeline Welke – the daughter of a Scottish trader and his Indian wife – married Dumont in 1858. Throughout his travels as a hunter, Dumont traded with different tribes and picked up different languages making him more valuable to his tribe. In 1868, Dumont and his wife settled in the Batoche area permanently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dumont was known for his incredible versatility both as a huntsman and as a convenor of [[multilingualism]]. It was purported that Dumont could converse with an individual in no less than seven separate languages (although it was noted that Dumont never learned more than a few small phrases in English).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His skills as a huntsman and [[marksman]] were another finely honed trait, in both the disciplines of bow and rifle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to these traits, Dumont was known as a proficient horseman. In much the same vein as many of the other prominent Métis leaders of his day such as [[Louis Riel]], Dumont had mastered the fine art of [[diplomacy]] in the northern plains of the West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Military Actions &amp; Conflicts==
Dumont was first introduced to plains warfare at the young age of 13 in 1851, where he fought in the [[Battle of Grand Coteau]] against the much larger contingent of [[Yankton Sioux Tribe|Yankton Sioux.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dumont's actions in that conflict including defending a large Métis encampment against the advances of a [[Dakota people|Dakota]] war party.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1862 at the age of 24, Dumont served as the intermediary between the Métis and the Dakota whilst being accompanied by his father. Later on, Dumont helped to sign a treaty with the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]], an action that led to a long state of peace with the traditional enemies of the Métis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although he was considered one of the figureheads of the Métis movement at the time, Dumont was not involved in the [[Red River Rebellion|Red River Resistance]] that took place from 1869-1870. However, Dumont did move quickly to [[Fort Garry]] in order to offer his military assistance during Colonel Garnet Wolseley's movement on the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around the time of 1885, the [[North-West Rebellion]] broke out. Dumont's army of 300 Métis [[soldier]]s organized near [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan|Duck Lake]] on the 26th of March, and conflict broke out between the ranks of the Métis and the [[North-West Mounted Police]] later that day. Among the dead on the Métis side was Dumont's brother, Isidore – the victim of a botched parley attempt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dumont was dealt a glancing blow to his head from a stray bullet during the battle, cutting an [[artery]] and was thereafter confined to nursing his injury while the rest of the North-West Resistance played out. However, this injury suffered during the Duck Lake confrontation did not prevent Dumont from leading his soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dumont also played a key role in discovering the traitors within the Saskatchewan Métis. In particular, Dumont was a part of the arrest of [[Alexander Monkman]]. Dumont ensured the safety of Louis Riel by jumping in front of Monkman's revolver when he pulled it on Riel, leading to Monkman's quick arrest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dumont was acutely aware that more Canadian troops led by General Frederick Middleton were streaming towards their location. In order to combat the advancing threat, Dumont proposed a campaign of terror that focused on uprooting railroads and prolonged periods of violence against Canadian soldiers. Riel was more inclined towards a peaceful resolution to proceedings, and Dumont deferred to Riel's judgements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dumont's contingent of 300 Métis soldiers clashed with the opposing Canadian soldiers on the 24th of April at a place dubbed [[Fish Creek (Saskatchewan)|Fish Creek]] by the Canadians.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The valiant efforts of the Métis soldiers caused General Middleton to pause in his advancement towards Batoche.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With the battle only lasting one day, the Métis soldiers were outnumbered five to one. Dumont's skillful military leadership allowed them to drive off the attackers and enabled the Métis soldiers to eventually retreat to the relative safety of Batoche.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Once the Canadian soldiers reached Batoche, Dumont led a valiant defence of the Métis community that lasted four days. After the first day there was no clear winner amongst the two sides, despite the Métis being once again vastly outnumbered.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebellion in the North-West: Louis Riel|last=Flanagan, Rocan|first=Thomas, Claude|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they lacked the numbers to truly put a dent in the Canadian forces, Dumont's group handicapped a military steamer and managed to repel several of Middleton's infantry pushes. The Métis utilized the tactic of digging holes approximately every seventy-five meters to allow for the Métis troops to hide and advance throughout a vast majority of land,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; allowing for a place to watch the English and easily attack.  By the fourth day of the defence, the Métis soldiers were out of [[ammunition]] and shooting [[nail (fastener)|nail]]s and pieces of [[metal]]. That day, the Canadian soldiers broke through Dumont's lines and took Batoche.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many Métis were saved because of the holes that were previously dug.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For days afterwards, Dumont remained in the vicinity of Batoche to ensure that blankets were distributed to the now homeless Métis women and children. During this period Dumont also searched for Riel, who had surrendered to the Canadian soldiers in the interim on May 15.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When Dumont learned of Riel's fate, he quickly left Batoche and travelled to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After crossing the border into the United States via the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] in [[Montana]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dumont and his companion Michel Dumas were detained almost immediately. However, Dumont and Dumas were quickly released following a memo sent from the [[Oval Office]] ordering their release immediately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although Dumont hid for some time in the United States, he was still wanted in Canada and had developed into something of a [[folk hero]] in Saskatchewan. While Dumont was indeed in hiding, it was rumoured that the soldiers looking for him made a rather feeble attempt to find him after learning that ''"le petit"'', his famous [[rifle]], was still in his possession.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In July 1886 the Canadian government made the announcement that there was an [[amnesty]] made available to Dumont.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He eventually returned to Batoche, where he spent time dictating two separate [[memoir]]s of the [[North-West Rebellion|North-West Resistance]].

== Political History ==
Dumont's [[Heredity|hereditary]] skills gained from his heritage as a buffalo hunter quickly gave rise to his influence politically. By the year 1863, the ranks of the buffalo hunters amongst the Saskatchewan Métis numbered around 200 – enough to require some form of formal organization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1863 he was first elected as the hunt chief of the Saskatchewan Métis, a position he remained in until 1881 – around the time that the buffalo herds had almost entirely disappeared from the region that Dumont was hunt chief of.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dumont's experience on the buffalo hunt gave him a great vision for the downturn of the buffalo trade during the 1870s.

He was known as a leader with a vision for the Métis, as he recognized that the declining numbers of the buffalo in [[Western Canada]] coupled with the encroaching Canadian [[Agriculture|agricultural]] movement spreading from the east would spark a great amount of change on the prairies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His political agenda consisted of maintaining the [[independence]] of the Saskatchewan Métis both politically and economically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In December 1873, after a meeting Dumont called in order to form a government for the Métis at [[St. Laurent de Grandin, Saskatchewan|St. Laurent (De Grandin)]], Dumont was immediately elected leader of the council of St. Laurent. Through his position as the leader of the council, Dumont created and put into place a [[constitution]] for the Métis that was followed for some time afterwards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his role as president of the council, Dumont's responsibilities included overseeing a committee of elected Métis councillors, and mediating relations between the council and the people of St. Laurent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this period of time the Canadian government had begun to lay claim to the position of governing body in the region, which sparked conflict with Dumont and his council. At first Dumont was passive, informing the government that the purpose of the local government was simply that – to govern locally. The goal of the council was not to form a rebellion according to Dumont. Reassured by Dumont's implorements, colonial officials saw little cause to panic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Incidentally however, Dumont did seek a degree of complete authority. When land surveyors from the Canadian government began to arrive in Saskatchewan during the 1870s, they showed a complete lack of regard for the Métis system of [[land tenure]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the [[North-West Mounted Police]] arrived on the plains in 1874, it proved the volatility of the situation – Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]'s government had no plans to treat the Métis as a self-governing entity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dumont was re-elected president and leader of the council at St. Laurent in December 1874.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In order to ensure that order was kept in the region, Dumont's government attempted to impose fines on Métis who ignored the rules of the [[Bison hunting|buffalo hunt]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These individuals did not appreciate the tactics Dumont's government was employing, and complained to the Hudson's Bay Company factor [[Lawrence Clarke (politician)|Lawrence Clarke]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/expositions-exhibitions/batoche/docs/proof_en_dumont_bio.pdf|title=Gabriel Dumont (1837-1906): Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Virtual Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke sent their concerns on to [[Alexander Morris (politician)|Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; claiming that the Métis were in open revolt against [[Canadian Government|Ottawa]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After this incident the North-West Mounted Police were dispatched to investigate, and found no issue with Dumont's dealings. However, the incident did spell the virtual end of the rule of the governing council at St. Laurent, although the council itself remained.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the 1880s Dumont's council sent [[petition]]s to the capital in Ottawa imploring the government to recognize the traditional land holdings (tenure) of the Métis. When these petitions went unanswered by the prime minister and his [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]], Dumont and the Métis felt compelled to protect the land through a more direct method.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In March 1884, a meeting was called by Dumont at the house of Abraham Montour, in which Dumont proceeded to call for Louis Riel to take up the mantle of leadership that Dumont had been previously holding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Subsequently, a delegation consisting of Dumont and three of his closest companions was sent to Riel requesting that he travel to Saskatchewan in order to provide insight into how best to protect Métis lands and freedoms. Dumont and three others travelled to [[St. Peter's Mission Church and Cemetery|St. Peter's Jesuit Mission]] in Montana, and convinced Riel to ride north to Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From that point onwards, Dumont and Riel maintained a close friendship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In March 1885, Dumont called a general meeting of the Métis of St. Laurent at Batoche. During the meeting, several of the indigenous people present suggested a more violent approach to proceedings – defending their lands against the Canadian government through the use of [[Weapon|arms]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the conclusion of the meeting, a new [[provisional government]] had been formed led by Dumont, known as the [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan]]. This new government served as a direct competitor to Ottawa's rule.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dumont was chosen to be the adjutant governor of this new government. While Riel was officially the figurehead and overruled Dumont in terms of decision power, Dumont remained responsible for many of the Métis political and military decisions until his retirement from active governing duty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Later Life &amp; Death==
During the years of the 1870s and the 1880s, Dumont owned a farm near the [[South Saskatchewan River]], where he chose to spend his days working said farm and operating a ferry across the South Saskatchewan nicknamed "Gabriel’s Crossing" around ten kilometres upstream from the ferry that Francois Xavier Letendre dit Batoche began around the same time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dumont and his wife Madeleine were among the many Métis families that had been pushed out of [[Manitoba]] by the Canadian government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In June 1886, Dumont was briefly employed in a western show named [[Wild West shows|Buffalo Bill's Wild Wild West Show]], where he was billed as a [[Outlaw|desperado]] and a crack shot&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; until the latter half of the summer when he travelled to the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern States]] to engage in [[Public speaking|public speaking events]] and [[Political campaign|political campaigns.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dumont soon grew tired of politics and returned to the Wild Wild West Show before settling down at a relative's property to return to [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[trapping]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He passed away at the age of sixty-eight on the 19th of May 1906 in Batoche,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the result of a tragic [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
The legacy of Dumont as a Métis leader is one that is only outshone by that of Louis Riel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gabriel Dumont has left a legacy behind that is known through schools, museums, institutions, books and landmarks. In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister [[Christine Tell]] proclaimed at Duck Lake, that "the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the Prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with government forces and how it has shaped Canada today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021102620/http://www.gov.sk.ca/news?newsId=3ceddf25-86ef-4433-86ea-cfe3cc69472d|title=TOURISM AGENCIES TO CELEBRATE THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NORTHWEST RESISTANCE/REBELLION – Government of Saskatchewan|date=2009-10-21|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batoche – the site of a Métis Provisional Government, has been declared a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metismuseum.ca/browse/index.php/484|title=The Virtual Museum of Métis History and Culture|website=www.metismuseum.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabriel Dumont Institute|The Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research]] in Saskatchewan was named in his honour when it was founded in 1980. In 1985, a scholarship fund was formed in his name with a 1.24 million dollar capital investment. In 1993, an agreement was set up between the institute and the [[University of Saskatchewan]] creating the Gabriel Dumont College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gdins.org/about/overview/history/|title=History {{!}} Gabriel Dumont Institute|last=http://gdins.org|first=Gabriel Dumont Institute –|website=gdins.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gabriel Dumont Bridge was built in 1969 over the South Saskatchewan River east of [[Rosthern|Rosthern, Saskatchewan.]] It is located at the site of Gabriel's Crossing, where he ran a small store, [[Billiard hall|billiards hall,]] and [[ferry]] service in the late 1870s and early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMKZFH_Gabriels_Crossing|title=Gabriel's Crossing – Saskatchewan Historical Markers on Waymarking.com|website=www.waymarking.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the public [[French immersion|French-first]]-language [[Secondary school|high school]] in [[London, Ontario]], was renamed [[École secondaire Gabriel-Dumont]] in Dumont's honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csviamonde.ca/nos-ecoles/trouver-une-ecole/fiche-ecole/ecole-secondaire-gabriel-dumont/|title=École secondaire Gabriel-Dumont|website=Conseil scolaire Viamonde|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Early life and education}}Early life and education==
Girish Raghunath Karnad was born in [[Matheran]], in present-day [[Maharashtra]], in 1938. His mother Krishnabai née Mankikar was a young widow with a son, and while training to be a nurse, met Dr. Raghunath Karnad who was a doctor in the Bombay Medical Service. For five years they could not get married because of the prevailing prejudice against widow remarriage. Finally their marriage was sanctified under the dispensation of the Arya Samaj. Girish was the third of the four children born thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caravanmagazine.in/essay/beginnings&lt;/ref&gt;

Girish Karnad's initial schooling was in Marathi. In [[Sirsi, Karnataka]], he was exposed to travelling theatre groups, Natak Mandalis, as his parents were deeply interested in their plays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ku|Kumar, p.115]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a youngster, Karnad was an ardent admirer of [[Yakshagana]] and the theater in his village.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museindia.com/showcont.asp?id=10 |title=Conversation with Girish Karnad |work=Bhargavi Rao on [[Muse India]] |publisher=Muse India |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316065029/http://www.museindia.com/showcont.asp?id=10 |archivedate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Dharwad]] in Karnataka when he was 14 years old, where he grew up with his two sisters and niece.&lt;ref name=mint&gt;{{cite web| title = Conversation: ‘I wish I were a magician’|publisher=Livemint| url = http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ZzkS8xw8yBGc5o2lZkuRAM/Conversation--I-wish-I-were-a-magician.html|date= 11 October 2013| accessdate = 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in mathematics and statistics from Karnatak Arts College, [[Dharwad]] ([[Karnataka University]]), in 1958. Upon graduation Karnad went to England and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen]] in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] (1960–63), earning his [[Master of Arts]] degree in philosophy, [[political science]] and economics.&lt;ref name=hin/&gt; Karnad was elected President of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1963.

==Career==

===Literature===
[[File:Girish-Karnad.jpg|thumb|Girish Karnad in 2010]]
Karnad is known as a playwright. His plays, written in [[Kannada]], have been translated into English and some Indian languages. [[Kannada language|Kannada]] is his language of choice.

When Karnad started writing plays, [[Kannada literature]] was highly influenced by the renaissance in [[Western literature]]. Writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of native soil. [[C. Rajagopalachari]]'s version of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' published in 1951, left a deep impact on him&lt;ref name=sachi58&gt;[[#Sa|Sachindananda, p. 58]]&lt;/ref&gt; and soon, sometime in the mid-1950s, one day he experienced a rush of dialogues by characters from the Mahabharata in Kannada. "I could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears ... I was just the scribe," said Karnad in a later interview. ''Yayati'' was published in 1961, when he was 23 years old. It is based on the story of King [[Yayati]], one of the ancestors of the [[Pandavas]], who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor, [[Shukracharya]], who was incensed at Yayati's infidelity. Yayati in turn asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him, and one of them agrees. It ridicules the ironies of life through characters in ''Mahabharata''. It became an instant success, immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages.&lt;ref name=today&gt;{{cite web |title=PROFILE: GIRISH KARNAD: Renaissance Man |url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/12041999/arts.html |date=12 April 1999 |work=[[India Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karnad found a new approach of drawing historical and mythological sources to tackle contemporary themes and [[existentialist]] crisis of modern man through characters locked in psychological and philosophical conflicts. His next was ''Tughlaq'' (1964), about a rashly idealist 14th-century [[Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], and allegory on the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]vian era which started with ambitious idealism and ended up in disillusionment.&lt;ref name=sachi58/&gt; This established Karnad, now 26 years old, as a promising playwright in the [[India|country]]. It was staged by the [[National School of Drama]] Repertory under the direction of [[Ebrahim Alkazi]], with the actor [[Manohar Singh]], playing the visionary king who later becomes disillusioned and turns bitter, amidst the historic [[Purana Qila]] in Delhi. It was staged in London by the National School of Drama for the Festival of India in 1982.&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;&lt;ref name=today/&gt;

''Hayavadana'' (1971) was based on a theme drawn from ''The Transposed Heads'', a 1940 novella by [[Thomas Mann]], which is originally found in the 11th-century Sanskrit text ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]''. Herein he employed the folk theatre form of [[Yakshagana]]. A German version of the play was directed by [[Vijaya Mehta]] as part of the repertoire of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Deutsches National Theatre, Weimar]].

''Naga-Mandala'' (Play with Cobra, 1988) was based on a folk tale related to him by A. K. Ramanujam, brought him the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award for the Most Creative Work of 1989. It was directed by J. Garland Wright, as part of the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of Guthrie Theatre, Minneapolis. The theatre subsequently commissioned him to write the play, ''Agni Mattu Male'' (The Fire and the Rain). Though before it came ''[[Taledanda]]'' (Death by Beheading, 1990) which used the backdrop, the rise of [[Veerashaivism]], a radical protest and reform movement in 12th century Karnataka to bring out current issues.&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia|author=Don Rubin |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=0-415-05933-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MUiXjMUl34C&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=hindi+theatre#v=onepage&amp;q=hindi%20theatre&amp;f=false |page=196|ref=Ru }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movies===
Karnad made his acting as well as screenwriting debut in a Kannada movie, ''[[Samskara (film)|Samskara]]'' (1970), based on a novel by [[U.R. Ananthamurthy]] and directed by Pattabhirama Reddy. That movie won the first [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|President's Golden Lotus Award]] for [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada cinema]].

In television, he played the role of Swami's father in the TV series ''[[Malgudi Days (TV series)|Malgudi Days]]'' (1986–1987), based on [[R. K. Narayan]]'s books. He also hosted the science magazine [[Turning Point (Doordarshan)|Turning Point]] on Doordarshan, in the early 1990s.

He made his directorial debut with ''[[Vamsha Vriksha]]'' (1971), based on a [[Kannada language|Kannada]] novel by [[S. L. Bhyrappa]]. It won him [[National Film Award for Best Direction]] along with [[B. V. Karanth]], who co-directed the film. Later, Karnad directed several movies in [[Kannada]] and [[Hindi]], including ''[[Godhuli]]'' (1977) and ''[[Utsav]]'' (1984). Karnad has made number of documentaries, like one on the Kannada poet [[D. R. Bendre]] (1972), ''Kanaka-Purandara'' (English, 1988) on two medieval [[Bhakti]] poets of Karnataka, [[Kanaka Dasa]] and [[Purandara Dasa]], and ''The Lamp in the Niche'' (English, 1989) on Sufism and the [[Bhakti movement]]. Many of his films and documentaries have won several national and international awards.

Some of his famous Kannada movies include ''[[Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane]]'', ''[[Ondanondu Kaladalli]]'', ''Cheluvi'' and ''[[Kaadu (1973 Kannada film)|Kaadu]]'' and most recent film ''Kanooru Heggaditi'' (1999), based on a novel by Kannada writer [[Kuvempu]].

His Hindi movies include ''[[Nishaant]]'' (1975), ''[[Manthan]]'' (1976), ''[[Swami (1977 film)|Swami]]'' (1977) and ''[[Pukar (2000 film)|Pukar]]'' (2000). He has acted in a number of [[Nagesh Kukunoor]] films, starting with ''[[Iqbal (film)|Iqbal]]'' (2005), where Karnad's role of the ruthless cricket coach got him critical acclaim. This was followed by ''[[Dor (film)|Dor]]'' (2006), ''[[8 x 10 Tasveer]]'' (2009) and ''[[Aashayein]]'' (2010). He played a key role in movies "[[Ek Tha Tiger]]"(2012) and its sequel "[[Tiger Zinda Hai]]"(2017) produced by Yash Raj Films.

Karnad has acted in the Kannada gangster movie ''[[Aa Dinagalu]]''.

==Controversies==

At the Tata Literary Festival held in [[Mumbai]] in 2012, Karnad was invited to speak about "his life in theater" in an hour-long session. Instead of talking about the subject, he took the opportunity to lash out at [[V. S. Naipaul]] for his "antipathy towards Indian Muslims". V. S. Naipaul had earlier been conferred the Lifetime achievement award by the festival's organisers. Karnad also criticized the organizers for having honored Naipaul.

The audience, which had gathered to hear Karnad speak, had mixed reactions to the speech. Some, like organizer [[Anil Dharker]], tried ineffectually to steer the speech toward less controversial waters. Others were amused by the episode, and some commented on the research and logic that had gone into the speech (unfortunately overshadowed by its 'scandalous' nature).&lt;ref name=ie&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/girish-karnad-slams-v-s-naipaul-for-his-antiislam-views-questions-his-mumbai-fest-award/1026127/0 Girish Karnad slams V S Naipaul for his anti-Islam views, questions his Mumbai fest award], ''[[Indian Express]]'', 3 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few weeks after this, Karnad again created controversy by claiming that [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a second-rate playwright and that his plays were "unbearable".&lt;ref name=dc&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/rabindranath-tagore%E2%80%99s-plays-unbearable-girish-karnad-074]''[[Deccan Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-09/india/35015880_1_girish-karnad-rabindranath-tagore-bengali-theatre|title=Rabindranath Tagore a 'second-rate playwright', Girish Karnad says |accessdate=9 November 2012 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, during celebrations marking the anniversary of 18th-century Muslim ruler [[Tipu Sultan]]'s birth, Karnad stated that [[Kempegowda International Airport|Bangalore International Airport]] should have been named after Tipu Sultan instead of [[Kempe Gowda I|Kempe Gowda]]. This created a furore among right-wing groups. Karnad apologised the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/karnataka-simmers-over-tipu-sultan-controversy-1242517 |title= Karnataka Simmers Over Tipu Sultan Row, Girish Karnad Offers Apology |publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/girish-karnad-offers-apology-over-remarks-on-kempegowda/article7866724.ece |title= Girish Karnad offers apology over remarks on Kempegowda |work=[[The Hindu]]|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Karnad is married to Dr. Saraswathy Ganapathy and they have two children. He lives in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref name=hin&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011230180843/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1603/16031170.htm AWARDS: The multi-faceted playwright] ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'', Vol. 16, No. 3, 30 Jan.–12 Feb 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Girish Karnad, while working in Madras for Oxford University Press on his return from England, met his future wife Saraswathi Ganapathy at a party. They decided to marry but the marriage was only formalised ten years later, when Karnad was 42 years old. Saraswathi was born to a [[Parsi]] mother, Nargis Mugaseth, and a Kodava father, Kodandera Ganapathy.&lt;ref name=ourkarnataka&gt;http://www.ourkarnataka.com/Articles/starofmysore/gkarnad.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
He is a proponent of  multi-culturalism and freedom of expression, Girish Karnad has been a critic of [[religious fundamentalism]] and [[Hindutva]] in India. He publicly condemned the [[demolition of Babri Masjid]] in 1992 and later spoke against the attempts to create controversy about the Idgah Maidan in [[Hubli]].&lt;ref name=hin/&gt; He is a proponent of secularism and has opposed [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]], [[BJP]] and other Hindu organizations on several occasions. He opposed [[Narendra Modi]] for the Prime Minister's post in the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 parliament elections]].

'''Ida Bagus Oka''' (16 April 1936 &amp;ndash; March 7, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.balidiscovery.com/messages/message.asp?Id=5869&lt;/ref&gt;) was the Governor of [[Bali]], Indonesia from 1988 to 1993. He was also a [[Development Reform Cabinet#State Ministers|State Minister of Population/Chairman of Planned Families National Coordinating Body]] in the [[Development Reform Cabinet]] under [[Jusuf Habibie]].  During the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966]], Ida Bagus Oka instigated the Balinese [[Hinduism|Hindus]]  to hunt down PKI supporters.  He told Hindus: "There can be no doubt [that] the enemies of our revolution are also the cruelest enemies of religion, and must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots".[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSU3mFK1gMUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Making+Indonesia+By+George+McTurnan+Kahin,+Daniel+S.+Lev&amp;ei=tNmyS-y-AYKOkATSjMibDQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Ida%20Bagus%20Oka&amp;f=false]  During this period, an estimated 80,000 Balinese were killed, roughly 5 percent of the island's population at the time.[https://books.google.com/books?id=_w6Mn4xRLt8C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Friend,+T.+(2003).+Indonesian+Destinies.&amp;ei=YtqyS_7cJ4bqlQSNqozNBw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Bali&amp;f=false].

'''Igor Vovkovinskiy''' ({{lang-uk|Ігор Вовковинський}} (aka ''Igor Ladan'') born September 18, 1982) is a [[Ukrainian-American]] law student, interviewee, and actor, best known for being the current tallest person living in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=BBCTMEV/&gt; at {{convert|7|ft|8.33|in|cm|sigfig=4}}, overtaking the record from [[George Bell (basketball)|George Bell]]. 
[[File: ESC2013 - Ukraine 04.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Vovkovinskiy performing during the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]]]]
Originally from [[Ukraine]], Vovkovinskiy moved to [[Rochester, Minnesota]] in 1989 (at the age of seven) to be treated at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. At that time he was already 5 ft 4 in tall and weighed 110 pounds.

Most recently, he has acted in commercials and films, notably the 2011 comedy film ''[[Hall Pass]]'', and also became well known for wearing a T-shirt that read "World's Biggest [[Barack Obama|Obama]] Supporter." He is also the first tallest living person from two countries. In 2013, Vovkovinskiy joined singer [[Zlata Ognevich]] as part of [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|Ukraine's]] stage performance at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]].&lt;ref name=BBCTMEV&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22566260 Eurovision Song Contest won by Denmark], [[BBC News]] (19 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vovkovinskiy's height has been attributed to having a [[tumor]] pressing on his [[pituitary gland]], causing his body to have released excessive amounts of [[growth hormone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4464">'''Isidore Dyen''' (16 August 1913 in [[Philadelphia]] &amp;ndash; 14 December 2008 in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]) was an [[United States|American]] linguist, Professor Emeritus of Malayo-Polynesian and Comparative Linguistics at [[Yale University]]. He was one of the foremost scholars in the field of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian linguistics]],&lt;ref name="Nothofer"&gt;{{harvtxt|Nothofer|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing extensively on the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstruction]] of [[Proto-Austronesian]] [[phonology]] and on [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] within the [[language family]], the latter principally by means of [[lexicostatistics]].&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{harvtxt|Blust|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest son of a [[rabbi]] and his wife who had [[immigrate]]d from [[Kiev, Ukraine]], "Iz" (as he was known to friends) grew up speaking [[Yiddish]] at home and studying [[Hebrew]] at [[Gratz College]] in preparation for rabbinical training. However, during the course of earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1933, an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1934, and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1939 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], his interests shifted to [[comparative linguistics]]. After completing a [[dissertation]] on "The Sanskrit indeclinables of the Hindu grammarians and lexicographers"&lt;ref name="Blust" /&gt; he planned to specialize in [[Slavic languages]],&lt;ref name="Nothofer" /&gt; but the needs of the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]] drew him into languages in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]].

He learned [[Malay language|Malay]] well enough to teach it to troops headed for the Southwest Pacific&lt;ref name="Nothofer" /&gt; and to produce a 2-volume pedagogical text, ''Spoken Malay'' (1943). After the war, he did fieldwork on two more genetically and typologically disparate Austronesian languages, [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]] (rendered as "Trukese" at that time) and [[Yapese language|Yapese]], as a member of the Tri-Institutional Coordinated Investigation of [[Micronesia]]n [[Anthropology]] sponsored by Yale University, the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]], and the [[Bernice P. Bishop Museum]]. Out of this came his ''A Sketch of Trukese grammar'' (1965).&lt;ref name="Blust" /&gt;

At the same time, he began applying his [[comparative method]] to revise and elaborate phonological reconstructions that had earlier been published by [[Otto Dempwolff]] (1934&amp;ndash;38). A series of articles such as "The Malayo-Polynesian word for ‘two’" (1947), "The Tagalog reflexes of Malayo-Polynesian D" (1947), "Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *Z" (1951), and "Dempwolff’s *R" (1953), eventually culminated in a monograph, ''The Proto-Malayo-Polynesian laryngeals'' (1953). His application of the same methods to his own new data from Chuukese led to a monograph ''On the history of the Trukese vowels'' (1949), which brilliantly demonstrated how the nine vowels of Chuukese had derived quite regularly from the four-vowel system Dempwolff had reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian.&lt;ref name="Blust" /&gt;

'''James Chesnut Jr.''' (January 18, 1815 &amp;ndash; February 1, 1885) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from [[South Carolina]] to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]] from 1861 to 1862. He also served as a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[Confederate States Army]] in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] of the [[American Civil War]].

Chesnut, a lawyer prominent in [[South Carolina]] state politics, served as a Democratic [[United States Senator|senator]] in 1858-60, where he proved moderate on the slavery question. But on Lincoln’s election in 1860, Chesnut resigned from the U.S. Senate and took part in the South Carolina secession convention, later helping to draft the [[Confederate States Constitution]].

As aide to General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], he ordered the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|firing on Fort Sumter]] and served at [[First Manassas]]. Later he was aide to [[Jefferson Davis]] and promoted to Brigadier-General. Chesnut returned to law practice after the war.

His wife was [[Mary Boykin Chesnut]], whose published diaries reflect the Chesnuts' busy social life and prominent friends such as [[John Bell Hood]], [[Louis T. Wigfall]], [[Wade Hampton III]], and Jefferson Davis.

==Early life and education==
James Chesnut Jr., was born the youngest of fourteen children and the only (surviving) son of James Chesnut Sr. (1775&amp;ndash;1866) and his wife, Mary Cox (1777&amp;ndash;1864)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of the Cox and Chesnut Families, 1792-1858|url=http://scmemory.org/collection/papers-of-the-cox-and-chesnut-families-1792-1858/|website=South Carolina Digital Library|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Mulberry Plantation (James and Mary Boykin Chesnut House)|Mulberry Plantation]] near [[Camden, South Carolina]].  Chesnut Sr. was one of the wealthiest [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] in the South, who owned 448 slaves and many large plantations totaling nearly five square miles before the outbreak of the Civil War. Chesnut Jr. graduated from the law department of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) in 1835, and initially rose to prominence in [[South Carolina]] state politics.

==Political career==
[[Admission to the bar|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, Chesnut Jr. commenced practice that year in Camden.  He was later elected as a member of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] (1840&amp;ndash;52) and the [[South Carolina Senate]] (1852&amp;ndash;58, serving as its president 1856&amp;ndash;58). He was a delegate to the [[Nashville Convention|southern convention]] at [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1850.

In 1858 Chesnut was elected by the [[South Carolina Legislature]] to the [[U.S. Senate]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to replace [[Josiah J. Evans]]. He served there for two years alongside Senator [[James Henry Hammond]] of South Carolina. Although a defender of [[slavery]] and [[states' rights]], Chesnut opposed the re-opening of the [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave trade]] and was not as staunch a [[secessionist]] as most of the South Carolinian politicians. Moderate in his political views, he believed in extending protections for slavery's westward expansion while remaining within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

But the political atmosphere tightened towards the [[Presidential election of 1860|Presidential Election of 1860]], since the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and its presidential candidate, [[Abraham Lincoln]], opposed slavery. After the results of the election were known, Chesnut decided that he could no longer stay in his office in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House'', pp. 277 and 289, Cauthen, ''South Carolina Goes to War'', pp. 49&amp;ndash;50, Sinha, ''The Counterrevolution of the Slavery'', pp. 134, 138, 176&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Lincoln's election, he was the first Southern senator to withdraw from the Senate, on November 10, 1860. (He was [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expelled]] ''in absentia'' from the Senate the next year.)

Chesnut participated in the South Carolina secession convention in December 1860 and was subsequently elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He was a member of the committee which drafted the Confederate States Constitution.

==American Civil War==
[[File:James Chesnut, Jr.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Col. James Chesnut, [[Circa|c.]] 1862]]

In the spring of 1861, he served as an [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] and was sent by the general to demand the surrender of [[Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. After the commander of the fort, Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] of the [[U.S. Army]] declined to surrender, Chesnut gave orders to the nearby Fort Johnson to open fire on Fort Sumter. In consequence the first shots of the Civil War were fired, on April 12, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Beauregard'', pp. 57&amp;ndash;58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1861 Chesnut also took part in the [[First Battle of Bull Run|First Battle of Manassas]] as an aide-de-camp to Beauregard.

In 1862 Chesnut served as a member of the South Carolina's Executive Council and the Chief of the Department of the Military of South Carolina. Later in the war he served the Confederate Army as a [[colonel]] and an aide to [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]]. In 1864 he was promoted to [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] and given command of South Carolina reserve forces until the end of the war. He was third in command of the confederate forces at the [[Battle of Tulifinny]]. He was in overall command before the arrival of Maj. Gen. [[Samuel Jones (Confederate Army officer)|Samuel Jones]] and later Brig. Gen. [[Lucius Jeremiah Gartrell|Lucius Gartrell]]. After the war, he returned to the practice of law in Camden and formed the [[Conservative Party (South Carolina)|Conservative Party]].

==Personal life==
Although James Chesnut Jr. was the only son, his father had given him little of his extensive property.  Because his father lived to the age of 90 and gave his son but a small allowance, the son James had to live mainly on his law practice. The Chesnut fortune declined in the course of the war and thus, after his father died in 1866, Chesnut inherited little more than the extensive debts that encumbered the Mulberry and Sandy Hill plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Muhlenfeld, ''Mary Boykin Chesnut'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesnut married seventeen-year-old [[Mary Chesnut|Mary Boykin Miller]] (1823&amp;ndash;86), on April 23, 1840. She later became well known for her book on life during the Civil War, published as a diary but revised extensively from 1881 to 1886. The daughter of U.S. Senator [[Stephen Decatur Miller]] (1788&amp;ndash;1838) and Mary Boykin (1804&amp;ndash;85), she was well-educated and intelligent and took part in her husband's career. The Chesnuts' marriage was at times stormy due to difference in temperament (she was hot-tempered and passionate and came occasionally to regard her husband as cool and reserved). Their companionship was mostly warm and affectionate but they had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Chesnut, ''Mary Chesnut's Civil War'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple resided at [[Chesnut Cottage]] in Columbia during the Civil War period.&lt;ref name = scdah&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chesnut Cottage, Richland County (1718 Hampton St., Columbia) | work = National Register Properties in South Carolina | publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/richland/S10817740016/index.htm | accessdate =2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mary Chesnut described in depth in her diary, the Chesnuts had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the society of the South and the Confederacy. Among their friends were, for example, Confederate general [[John Bell Hood]], ex-Governor [[John L. Manning]], Confederate general and politician [[John S. Preston]] and his wife Caroline, Confederate general and politician [[Wade Hampton III]], Confederate politician [[Clement Claiborne Clay|Clement C. Clay]] and his wife [[Virginia Clay-Clopton|Virginia]], and Confederate general and politician [[Louis T. Wigfall]] and his wife Charlotte. The Chesnuts were intimate family friends of President Jefferson Davis and his wife [[Varina Howell]]. James Chesnut was also a first cousin of fellow Confederate general [[Zachariah C. Deas]].

==Death==
James Chesnut was "regarded as an amiable, modest gentleman of decent parts [gifts]",&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, ''Secret And Sacred'', p.&amp;nbsp;214.&lt;/ref&gt; who performed his duties with ability and dignity both in political and military life. He died at home in Camden in 1885; interment was in Chesnut Family Cemetery, [[Kershaw County, South Carolina]].

==Biography==
Hunker received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Harvard College]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard Business School]]. He joined the [[Boston Consulting Group]] before becoming an advisor in the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] and the founding director of the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (later subsumed by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[National Protection and Programs Directorate]]).

Hunker was also a Vice President at [[Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.]], [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Heinz College]] at [[Carnegie Mellon]], and a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].

Hunker's research is primarily concerned with Homeland and Information Security. Prof. Hunker was also the Carnegie Mellon Representation for the [[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection]].

In 2008 Hunker was charged three times with [[driving under the influence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08240/907173-53.stm |title=CMU professor charged with drunken driving three times in past eight days - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by another incident on Thanksgiving 2009. In May 2010 Hunker pleaded guilty  to these four drunken driving charges and was sentenced to 3 to 6 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/22599352/detail.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327231858/http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/22599352/detail.html |date=March 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was paroled at sentencing and was sentenced to 24 months probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_680998.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentence was terminated early on June 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;(see CC2008-17527,CC2008-17526,CC2008-17530,CC2009-17737, Judge Kevin Sasinoski, Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, 436 Grant Street, Pittsburgh PA 15219, Court of Clerks Kate Barkman, 412 350 2910)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 his book ''Creeping Failure: How We Broke the Internet and What We Can Do to Fix It'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Hunker |url=http://www.mcclelland.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771041488 |title=Books &amp;#124; Creeping Failure by Jeffrey Hunker |publisher=McClelland.com |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published by McClelland and Stewart, a division of Random House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771041488 |title=Creeping Failure by Jeffrey Hunker - Book - eBook |publisher=Random House |date= |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creeping Failure is a Scientific American magazine Recommended Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Kate |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=recommended-nov-10 |title=Recommended: The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs |publisher=Scientific American |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a second edition was released. Also in 2010 he was co-editor of Insider Threats in Cyber Security &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/50872833/Insider-Threats-in-Cyber-Security |title=Insider Threats in Cyber Security |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his article (co-authored with Christian Probst)The Risk of Risk Analysis and its Relation to the Economics of Insider Threats appears in The Economics of Information Security and Privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wt54g6h3821g886g/ |title=The Risk of Risk Analysis And its Relation to the Economics of Insider Threats |date= |accessdate=2013-06-29 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_14 |journal=Economics of Information Security and Privacy |pages=279–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; he is best known for the novels ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1869) and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/facing-death-with-tolstoy |title=Facing death with Tolstoy |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Beard |first=Mary |date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; often cited as pinnacles of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, ''[[Childhood (novel)|Childhood]]'', ''[[Boyhood (novel)|Boyhood]]'', and ''[[Youth (Leo Tolstoy novel)|Youth]]'' (1852–1856), and ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]'' (1855), based upon his experiences in the [[Crimean War]]. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several [[novella]]s such as ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' (1886), ''[[Family Happiness]]'' (1859), and ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]'' (1912). He also wrote [[play (theater)|plays]] and numerous philosophical essays.

In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work ''[[A Confession]]'' (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], caused him to become a fervent [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] and [[anarcho-pacifist|pacifist]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Tolstoy's ideas on [[nonviolent resistance]], expressed in such works as ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (1894), were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]],&lt;ref name="ResistNotEvil"&gt;[http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/Resist_Not.html Martin E.

== Origins ==
The [[Tolstoy family|Tolstoys]] were a well-known family of old [[Russian nobility]] who traced their ancestry to a mythical nobleman named Indris described by [[Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy|Pyotr Tolstoy]] as arriving "from Nemec, from the lands of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]" to [[Chernigov]] in 1353 along with his two sons Litvinos (or Litvonis) and Zimonten (or Zigmont) and a [[druzhina]] of 3000 people.&lt;ref name='rummel'&gt;''Vitold Rummel, Vladimir Golubtsov (1886)''.

Suvorin Publishing House, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='bunin'&gt;[[Ivan Bunin]], ''The Liberation of Tolstoy: A Tale of Two Writers'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; While the word "Nemec" has been long used to describe [[Germans]] only, back in the days it was applied to any foreigner who didn't speak Russian (from the word ''nemoy'' meaning ''mute'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovardalja.net/word.php?wordid=19618 Nemoy/Немой] word meaning from the [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language|Dahl's Explanatory Dictionary]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Indris was then converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] under the name of Leonty and his sons — as Konstantin and Feodor, respectively. Konstantin's grandson Andrei Kharitonovich was nicknamed Tolstiy (translated as ''fat'') by [[Vasily II of Moscow]] after he moved from Chernigov to Moscow.&lt;ref name='rummel' /&gt;&lt;ref name='bunin' /&gt;

Because of the [[pagan]] names and the fact that Chernigov at the time was ruled by [[Demetrius I Starshy]] some researches concluded that they were [[Lithuanians]] who arrived from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], then part of the [[State of the Teutonic Order]].&lt;ref name='rummel' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7kDJ3s1mcZcC&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=tolstoy%20lithuanian&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=tolstoy%20lithuanian|title=Tolstoy|publisher=|isbn=9780802137685|last1=Troyat|first1=Henri|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/books/six-centuries-of-tolstoys.html|title=Six Centuries of Tolstoys|date=6 November 1983|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Robinson|first1=Harlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, no mention of Indris was ever found in the 14th – 16th-century documents, while the [[Old Russian Chronicles|Chernigov Chronicles]] used by Pyotr Tolstoy as a reference were lost.&lt;ref name='rummel' /&gt; The first documented members of the Tolstoy family also lived during the 17th century, thus Pyotr Tolstoy himself is generally considered the founder of the noble house, being granted the title of [[count]] by [[Peter the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gerbovnik.ru/arms/162.html Tolstoy coat of arms] by All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses of the Russian Empire.

== Life and career ==
[[File:Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy 1848.jpg|thumb|left|Tolstoy at age 20, circa 1848]]

Tolstoy was born at [[Yasnaya Polyana]], a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Tula, Russia]], and 200 kilometers (120&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Moscow]]. He was the fourth of five children of [[Count]] Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy (1794–1837), a veteran of the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]], and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (née Volkonskaya; 1790–1830). After his parents died during his childhood,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; Tolstoy and his siblings were brought up by relatives.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at [[Kazan University]]. His time there was not a success however, with teachers describing him as "both unable and unwilling to learn."&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillanreaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ads.leotolstoy.pdf |title=Author Data Sheet, Macmillan Readers |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much of his time in Moscow, [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], leading a lax and leisurely lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; He began writing during this period,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; including his first novel ''[[Childhood (novel)|Childhood]]'', a fictitious account of his own youth, which was published in 1852.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]] and joined the [[Imperial Russian Army|army]]. Tolstoy served as a young artillery officer during the [[Crimean War]] and was in Sevastopol during the 11-month-long [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|siege of Sevastopol]] in 1854–55,&lt;ref name="BBCTen" /&gt; including the [[Battle of the Chernaya]]. During the war he was recognised for his bravery and courage and promoted to lieutenant.&lt;ref name="BBCTen"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3GL3DPct7D5GPQzB7GlrrBW/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-tolstoy Ten Things You Didn't Know About Tolstoy]". BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in warfare,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; and left the army after the end of the Crimean War.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

His conversion from a dissolute and privileged society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his latter days was brought about by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed the same path were [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that would mark the rest of his life. Writing in a letter to his friend [[Vasily Botkin]]: "The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson, ''Tolstoy'' (1988), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's concept of [[non-violence]] or [[Ahimsa]] was bolstered when he read a [[Tirukkural translations into German|German version]] of the [[Tirukkural]].&lt;ref name="PearlsOfInsp_Rajaram"&gt;{{cite book

His European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met [[Victor Hugo]], whose literary talents Tolstoy praised after reading Hugo's newly finished ''[[Les Misérables]]''. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Apart from reviewing Proudhon's forthcoming publication, ''La Guerre et la Paix'' (''War and Peace'' in French), whose title Tolstoy would borrow for his masterpiece, the two men discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: "If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time."

Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the children of Russia's peasants, who had just been [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated from serfdom in 1861]]. Tolstoy described the school's principles in his 1862 essay "The School at Yasnaya Polyana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tolstoy | first = Lev N. |author2=Leo Wiener |author3=translator and editor | title = The School at Yasnaya Polyana – The Complete Works of Count Tolstoy: Pedagogical Articles.

However, as a direct forerunner to [[A. S. Neill]]'s [[Summerhill School]], the school at Yasnaya Polyana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W.

== Personal life ==
The death of his brother Nikolay in 1860 had an impact on Tolstoy, and led him to a desire to marry.&lt;ref name=AuthorDataSheet /&gt; On September 23, 1862, Tolstoy married [[Sophia Tolstaya|Sophia Andreevna Behrs]], who was 16 years his junior and the daughter of a court physician.

The marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose ''War and Peace'' and ''Anna Karenina'' with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and handwriting his epic works time after time. Tolstoy would continue editing ''War and Peace'' and had to have clean final drafts to be delivered to the publisher.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/W/bo20274891.html|title=War and Peace and Sonya|author=|date=|website=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, their later life together has been described by [[A. N. Wilson]] as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works.

Some of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Soviet Union]], and many of Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the [[United States]]. Among them are Swedish jazz singer [[Viktoria Tolstoy]] and the Swedish landowner Christopher Paus, whose family owns the major estate [[Herresta]] outside [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Puzin, ''The Lev Tolstoy House-Museum In Yasnaya Polyana'' (with a list of Leo Tolstoy's descendants), 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his great-great-grandsons, [[Vladimir Tolstoy]] (born 1962), is a director of the [[Yasnaya Polyana]] museum since 1994 and an adviser to the [[President of Russia]] on cultural affairs since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ypmuseum.ru/en/2011-04-13-17-30-44/mhistory/65-2011-08-19-09-30-03.html Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy] at the official [[Yasnaya Polyana]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/catalog/persons/311/biography|title=Persons ∙ Directory ∙ President of Russia|author=|date=|website=President of Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilya Tolstoy]]'s great-grandson, [[Pyotr Olegovich Tolstoy|Pyotr Tolstoy]], is a well-known Russian journalist and TV presenter as well as a [[7th State Duma|State Duma]] deputy since 2016.

== Novels and fictional works ==
[[File:Leo Tolstoy 1897, black and white, 37767u.jpg|thumb|Tolstoy in 1897]]
Tolstoy is considered one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' and novellas such as ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]'' and ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''.

Tolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels [[Childhood (novel)|''Childhood'']], [[Boyhood (novel)|''Boyhood'']], and [[Youth (Tolstoy novel)|''Youth'']] (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.

Tolstoy served as a [[second lieutenant]] in an artillery regiment during the [[Crimean War]], recounted in his ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]''. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent [[pacifism]] and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.&lt;ref&gt;''Government is Violence: essays on anarchism and pacifism''. Leo Tolstoy – 1990 – Phoenix Press&lt;/ref&gt;

His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy: the making of a novelist. E'' Crankshaw – 1974 – Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cossacks (novel)|The Cossacks]]'' (1863) describes the [[Cossack]] life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. ''Anna Karenina'' (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in ''War and Peace'', Levin in ''Anna Karenina'' and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in ''Resurrection''.

''War and Peace'' is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], from the court of [[Alexander I of Russia]] to the battlefields of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the [[Decembrist revolt]], to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider ''War and Peace'' to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy and the Development of Realism. G Lukacs. ''Marxists on Literature: An Anthology'', London: Penguin, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; ''War and Peace'' (which is to Tolstoy really an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that ''Anna Karenina'' was his first true novel.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy and the Novel''. J Bayley – 1967 – Chatto &amp; Windus&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Anna Karenina'', Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' (1886) and ''[[What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' develop a radical [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifist]] Christian philosophy which led to his [[excommunication]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''Church and State''. L Tolstoy&amp;nbsp;– On Life and Essays on Religion, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; For all the praise showered on ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace'', Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Women in Tolstoy: the ideal and the erotic'' R.C. Benson – 1973 – University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of [[Georgism]], of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.

Tolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as ''Volga-bogatyr'' and ''Oaf'' stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his ''Russian Book for Reading'', a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the ''New Azbuka'' textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, "Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time". According to [[Valentin Bulgakov]], he criticised poets, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], for their "false" epithets used "simply to make it rhyme".&lt;ref&gt;''Leo Tolstoy (1874)''.

== Critical appraisal by other authors ==
Tolstoy's contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], who died thirty years before Tolstoy's death, thought him the greatest of all living novelists. [[Gustave Flaubert]], on reading a translation of ''War and Peace'', exclaimed, "What an artist and what a psychologist!" [[Anton Chekhov]], who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, "When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature." The 19th-century British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] opined that "A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life."&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Later novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote "I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism."&lt;ref name="ACD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Arthur Conan|title=My Favourite Novelist and His Best Book|date= January 1898|location=London|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306981h.html|accessdate=6 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]] declared him "the greatest of all novelists."&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[James Joyce]] noted that "He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!" [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: "Seldom did art work so much like nature." [[Vladimir Nabokov]] heaped superlatives upon ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and ''Anna Karenina''; he questioned, however, the reputation of ''War and Peace'', and sharply criticized ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' and ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]''.

After reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, August 30, 1869&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chapter VI of ''[[A Confession]]'', Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explained how the nothingness that results from complete [[self-denial|denial of self]] is only a relative nothingness, and is not to be feared. The novelist was struck by the description of Christian, [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: &lt;blockquote&gt; But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for [[eternal salvation]] is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[simple living|voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus [[Buddha]] [[Sakyamuni]] was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: "Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?" and who replied: "I have made a far more beautiful choice!" "Whom?" "''La povertà'' (poverty)": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, §&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called ''What I Believe'', in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[Teachings of Jesus|teachings]] and was particularly influenced by the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the injunction to [[turn the other cheek]], which he understood as a "commandment of non-resistance to evil by force" and a doctrine of [[pacifism]] and [[nonviolence]]. In his work ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a "perversion" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American [[Quakers]] who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as [[George Fox]], [[William Penn]] and [[Jonathan Dymond]]. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the consequences of being a pacifist, and the apparently inevitable waging of war by government, are the reason why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.

Later, various versions of "Tolstoy's Bible" would be published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.&lt;ref&gt;Orwin, Donna T. ''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy''. Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and other residents of [[Tolstoyan movement#Africa|Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]]

Tolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner self-perfection through following the [[Great Commandment]] of loving one's neighbor and God rather than looking outward to the Church or state for guidance. His belief in [[nonresistance]] when faced by conflict is another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings. By directly influencing [[Mahatma Gandhi]] with this idea through his work ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (full text of English translation [[s:The Kingdom of God Is Within You|available on Wikisource]]), Tolstoy's profound influence on the nonviolent resistance movement reverberates to this day. He believed that the aristocracy were a burden on the poor, and that the only solution to how we live together is through [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

He also opposed [[private property]] in land ownership&lt;ref&gt;I Cannot Be Silent. Leo Tolstoy. ''Recollections and Essays'', 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; and the institution of marriage and valued the ideals of chastity and sexual abstinence (discussed in ''[[Father Sergius]]'' and his preface to ''The Kreutzer Sonata''), ideals also held by the young Gandhi. Tolstoy's later work derives a passion and verve from the depth of his austere moral views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=editor on September 8, 2009 |url=http://coastlinejournal.com/2009/09/08/why-leo-tolstoy-wouldn%E2%80%99t-super-size-it/ |title=Sommers, Aaron (2009) ''Why Leo Tolstoy Wouldn't Supersize It'' |publisher=Coastlinejournal.com |date=September 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of the temptation of Sergius in ''Father Sergius'', for example, is among his later triumphs. Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before himself and Chekhov and that Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Other later passages of rare power include the personal crises that were faced by the protagonists of ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'', and of ''[[Master and Man (short story)|Master and Man]]'', where the main character in the former or the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists' lives.

Tolstoy had a profound influence on the development of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/TheContemporaryRelevanceOfLeoTolstoy |title=The Contemporary Relevance of Leo Tolstoy's Late Political Thought |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2009|quote=Tolstoy articulated his Christian anarchist political thought between 1880 and 1910, yet its continuing relevance should have become fairly self-evident already.|publisher=International Political Science Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tolstoyan]]s were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion, [[Vladimir Chertkov]] (1854–1936), to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the ''[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Petr Chelčický|Chojecki]], [[Hans Denck|Denk]] and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[property right]]s, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason.

With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'') a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present [[property law]]s. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Kropotkin |year=1911 |publisher= New York : Encyclopaedia Britannica|location= |isbn= |page=918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/918/mode/2up |accessdate= |quote=Anarchism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China, Tolstoy praised the Boxers. He was harshly critical of the atrocities committed by the Russians, Germans, Americans, Japanese, and other western troops. He accused them of engaging in slaughter when he heard about the lootings, rapes, and murders, in what he saw as Christian brutality.

In hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by [[Kropotkin]] and [[Proudhon]] to his readers, whilst rejecting anarchism's espousal of [[propaganda of the deed|violent revolutionary means]]. In the 1900 essay, "On Anarchy", he wrote; "The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man." Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's "Words of a Rebel", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel]]''. G Woodcock, I Avakumović.1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of [[Henry George]], incorporating it approvingly into later works such as ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' (1899), the book that played a major factor in his excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wenzer |first= Kenneth C. |year= 1997 |title= Tolstoy's Georgist Spiritual Political Economy (1897–1910): Anarchism and Land Reform |journal= [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]] |volume= 56 |issue= 4, Oct |pages= 639–667 |jstor= 3487337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parel|first=Anthony J.|author-link=Anthony Parel|contribution=Gandhi and Tolstoy|editors=M. P. Mathai, M. S. John, Siby K. Joseph|title=Meditations on Gandhi : a Ravindra Varma festschrift|pages=96–112|publisher=Concept|place=New Delhi|year=2002|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kcpDOVk5Gp8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlining his belief in non-violence as a means for India to gain independence from [[British Raj|British colonial rule]]. In 1909, a copy of the letter was read by Gandhi, who was working as a lawyer in South Africa at the time and just becoming an activist. Tolstoy's letter was significant for Gandhi, who wrote Tolstoy seeking proof that he was the real author, leading to further correspondence between them.&lt;ref name="PearlsOfInsp_Rajaram" /&gt;

Reading Tolstoy's ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'' also convinced Gandhi to avoid violence and espouse [[nonviolent resistance]], a debt Gandhi acknowledged in his autobiography, calling Tolstoy "the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced". The correspondence between Tolstoy and Gandhi would only last a year, from October 1909 until Tolstoy's death in November 1910, but led Gandhi to give the name Tolstoy Colony to his second [[ashram]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy and Gandhi, men of peace: a biography''. MB Green – 1983 – Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; Besides nonviolent resistance, the two men shared a common belief in the merits of [[vegetarianism]], the subject of several of Tolstoy's essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Tolstoy |first= Leo |title= The First Step |year= 1892 |accessdate= 2016-05-21 |url= http://www.ivu.org/history/tolstoy/the_%20first_step.html |quote= ... if [a man] be really and seriously seeking to live a good life, the first thing from which he will abstain will always be the use of animal food, because ... its use is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to the moral feeling – killing}}. Preface to the Russian translation of [[Howard Williams (humanitarian)|Howard William's]] [http://www.ivu.org/history/williams/index.html ''The Ethics of Diet'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy also became a major supporter of the [[Esperanto]] movement. Tolstoy was impressed by the pacifist beliefs of the [[Doukhobors]] and brought their persecution to the attention of the international community, after they burned their weapons in peaceful protest in 1895.  He aided the Doukhobors in migrating to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, H.G. "Resurrection:Tolstoy and Canada's Doukhobors." The Beaver 79.October/November 1999:38–44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Tolstoy condemned the war and wrote to the Japanese Buddhist priest [[Soyen Shaku]] in a failed attempt to make a joint pacifist statement.

Towards the end of his life, Tolstoy become more and more occupied with the economic theory and social philosophy of [[Georgism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy: Principles For A New World Order, David Redfearn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wealthandwant.com/auth/Tolstoy.htm|title=Tolstoy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosper.org.au/about/geoists-in-history/leo-tolstoy/|title=Leo Tolstoy|work=Prosper Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/tolstoy-leo_on-the-doctrine-of-henry-george-1898.html{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke of great admiration of [[Henry George]], stating once that "People do not argue with the teaching of George; they simply do not know it. And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching, for he who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree."&lt;ref&gt;“A Great Iniquity,” letter to the London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a preface to George's ''[[Social Problems]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/tolstoy-leo_preface-to-henry-george-social-problems-1883.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115174640/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/tolstoy-leo_preface-to-henry-george-social-problems-1883.html |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income of the passive Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy so heavily criticized) whilst simultaneously both rejecting a centrally planned [[socialist]] economy. Some assume that this development in Tolstoy's thinking was a move away from his [[anarchist]] views, since Georgism requires a central administration to collect [[economic rent|land rent]] and spend it on infrastructure. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have also been proposed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-state.com/geo/foldvary1.html|title=Geoanarchism|authorlink=Fred E. Foldvary|first=Fred E.|last=Foldvary|accessdate=2009-04-15|date=2001-07-15|publisher=anti-state.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's 1899 novel ''Resurrection'' explores his thoughts on Georgism in more detail and hints that Tolstoy indeed had such a view. It suggests the possibility of small communities with some form of local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods; whilst still heavily criticising institutions of the [[Sovereign state|state]] such as the [[justice system]].

== Death ==
[[File:Graf Tolstoj op Jasnaja Poljana.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Tolstoy's grave with flowers at Yasnaya Polyana]]

Tolstoy died in 1910, at the age of 82. Just prior to his death, his health had been a concern of his family, who were actively engaged in his care on a daily basis. During his last few days, he had spoken and written about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he had finally gathered the nerve to separate from his wife, and left home in the middle of winter, in the dead of night.&lt;ref&gt;''The last days of Tolstoy''. VG Chertkov. 1922. Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape unannounced from Sophia's jealous tirades. She was outspokenly opposed to many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of the attention which it seemed to her Tolstoy lavished upon his [[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyan]] "disciples".

Tolstoy died of [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Leo Tolstoy''. EJ Simmons – 1946 – Little, Brown and Company&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lev Tolstoy (rural locality)|Astapovo]] train station, after a day's rail journey south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n14/james-meek/some-wild-creature|title=James Meek reviews 'The Death of Tolstoy' by William Nickell, 'The Diaries of Sofia Tolstoy' translated by Cathy Porter, 'A Confession' by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Anthony Briggs and 'Anniversary Essays on Tolstoy' by Donna Tussing Orwin · LRB 22 July 2010|pages=3–8|newspaper=London Review of Books|date=2010-07-22|last1=Meek|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station master took Tolstoy to his apartment, and his personal doctors were called to the scene. He was given injections of [[morphine]] and [[camphor]].

The police tried to limit access to his funeral procession, but thousands of peasants lined the streets. Still, some were heard to say that, other than knowing that "some nobleman had died", they knew little else about Tolstoy.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstaya, S.A. ''The Diaries of Sophia Tolstoy'', Book Sales, 1987; Chertkov, V. "The Last Days of Leo Tolstoy," http://www.linguadex.com/tolstoy/index.html, translated by Benjamin Scher&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, Tolstoy spent the last hours of his life preaching love, nonviolence, and [[Georgism]] to his fellow passengers on the train.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C. Wenzer, "Tolstoy's Georgist spiritual political economy: anarchism and land reform – 1897–1910", Special Issue: Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Death of Henry George, ''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Oct, 1997; http://www.ditext.com/wenzer/tolstoy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== In films ==
A 2009 film about Tolstoy's final year, ''[[The Last Station]]'', based on the novel by [[Jay Parini]], was made by director [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]] with [[Christopher Plummer]] as Tolstoy and [[Helen Mirren]] as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including ''[[Departure of a Grand Old Man]]'', made in 1912 just two years after his death, ''How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were'' (1913), and ''Leo Tolstoy'', directed by and starring [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov]] in 1984.

There is also a famous [[lost film]] of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer [[Burton Holmes]] visited Yasnaya Polyana with [[Albert J. Beveridge]], the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that documentary evidence of a meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in ''The Sunday Gentleman''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1965. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leone Sextus Denys Oswolf Fraudatifilius Tollemache-Tollemache de Orellana Plantagenet Tollemache-Tollemache''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|l|m|eɪ|k|_|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|m|æ|k}} {{respell|TOOL|mayk|TOL|mak}}; 10 June 1884 – 20 February 1917) was a [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the [[British Army]] who died during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Bill ''Mother Tongue'' Penguin, London 1990, p191&lt;/ref&gt; He has been stated, incorrectly, to have had the longest English surname on record,&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of Records 1974; ''Jeremy Beadle's Today's the Day'', [[Jeremy Beadle]], 1979, p.106.[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJtmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Leone+Tollemache-Tollemache&amp;dq=Leone+Tollemache-Tollemache&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt; or the English surname with the most [[Double-barrelled name|multiple barrels]].&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of Records 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  His last name is the [[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]] "Tollemache-Tollemache"; his other names (including the first instance of "Tollemache-Tollemache") are forenames{{cn|date=March 2015}} which have been mistaken by some chroniclers as part of his last name. 

==Biography==
[[File:Leone Tollemache1891 census.jpg|thumb|Extract from 1891 Census return for South Witham, Lincolnshre showing the Tollemache family. Leone is recorded as "Leone S. D. O. F. F. T. T. D. O. P.", in the second line from below.]]

Leone was born in [[Lincolnshire]], the sixth son of the eccentric clergyman [[Ralph Tollemache-Tollemache]]. He was the eighth of Ralph's many children by his second wife, Dora Cleopatra Maria Lorenza de Orellana. In common with his many brothers and sisters, his father gave him an unconventional name.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;K. D. Reynolds, "Tollemache, Ralph William Lyonel Tollemache- (1826–1895)", [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71299, accessed 29 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

His surname at birth was "Tollemache-Tollemache", his father having doubled his original surname, "Tollemache", in 1876 after his second marriage. "de Orellana" derives from the [[Spanish naming customs|naming customs of Spain]], where his mother came from, and is a forename rather than part of his surname. The first "Tollemache-Tollemache" also seems to be an unusual forename. Leone was Ralph's sixth son, hence "Sextus". "Fraudatifilius" is [[Latin]] for "son of the [[fraud|defrauded]] one". "Leone" repeats a pattern seen in the names of his elder brothers and sisters (Lyonel, Lyonesse, Lyulph, Lyona, Leo, Lyonella and Lyonetta). His first five initials, "LSD OF", may include a reference to the divisions of the pre-decimal British currency, [[£sd]], for pounds, shillings, and pence followed by half-pence (''ob.'', "[[Obol (coin)|obol]]") and farthings (''i.e.'', quarter-pence). This may be a reference to a financial dispute between his father Ralph and Ralph's first wife's trustees which had driven him bankrupt in 1863.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; Similarly, an elder brother was named Lyulph Ydwallo Odin Nestor Egbert Lyonel Toedmag Hugh Erchenwyne Saxon Esa Cromwell Orma Nevill Dysart Plantagenet Tollemache-Tollemache&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasury of Name Lore|author=Elsdon Coles Smith|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=London|year=1967|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;—his first 15 initials spell "LYONEL THE SECOND". In practice, Leone shortened his name to "Leone Sextus Tollemache".

He joined the British Army, attending the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in 1902. He was commissioned into the [[Leicestershire Regiment]] in 1903. Before the First World War, he served in [[British India]] and at [[Fermoy]] in Ireland.

He married an Irishwoman, Kathleen Mary Mills (daughter of Joseph Mills and Charlotte née Bloomfield), at [[Acomb, North Yorkshire]] on 23 April 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Births Marriages and Deaths, Great Ouseburn Vol 9a Page 169 – Leone S D O F T T de O P Tollemache-Tollemache &amp; Kathleen M Mills&lt;/ref&gt; They honeymooned in Fermoy. Their son was born on 12 January 1915 in White House in Acomb; Kathleen died in childbirth, but the son, Denys Herbert George, survived.

On the outbreak of the First World War, he was sent to France on the [[Union-Castle Line|Union-Castle steamer]] [[SS Braemar Castle|SS ''Braemar Castle'']] in September 1914. He kept a personal diary of his experiences. In 1916, Leone was seconded to serve as [[brigade major]] in the [[3rd Brigade (Australia)|3rd Australian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Australian Division]] after it was redeployed from [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] to [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]]. He died on active service in 1917, from [[influenza]]. He is buried in the communal war cemetery in [[Dernancourt]] near [[Albert, France|Albert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/427534 Casualty Details for TOLLEMACHE, LEONE SEXTUS] from the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leone's elder brother Leo (Quintus Tollemache-Tollemache de Orellana Plantagenet) also served in France, in the 1st Battalion of the [[Lincolnshire Regiment]]. He went missing, presumed killed, on 1 November 1914 and his body was never found. He is commemorated on the [[Menin Gate]] memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1626624 Casualty Details for TOLLEMACHE, LEO DE ORELLANA] from the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucy Christiana, Lady Duff-Gordon''' (née '''Sutherland'''; 13 June 1863 – 20 April 1935) was a leading British [[fashion designer]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who worked under the professional name '''Lucile'''.

The first British-based designer to achieve international acclaim, Lucy Duff-Gordon was a widely acknowledged innovator in [[Haute couture|couture]] styles as well as in fashion industry [[public relations]]. In addition to originating the "mannequin parade", a precursor to the modern fashion show, and training the first professional models, she launched liberating slit skirts and low necklines, popularized less restrictive [[corset]]s, and promoted alluring and pared-down [[lingerie]].&lt;ref&gt;Etherington-Smith, Meredith, ''The "It" Girls'' (1986), 56–57; Mendes, Valerie D., ''Lucile Ltd'' (2009), 22, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening branches of her London house, Lucile Ltd, in Chicago, New York City, and Paris, her business became the first global couture brand, dressing a trend-setting clientele of royalty, nobility, and stage and film personalities.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, Georgina, ''The Encyclopedia of Fashion'' (1986), 164; Bowles, Hamish, "The Look of the Century", ''Vogue'', Nov. 1999, 453&lt;/ref&gt; Duff-Gordon is also remembered as a survivor of the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912, and as the losing party in the precedent-setting 1917 [[contract law]] case of ''[[Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]]'', in which Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] wrote the opinion for New York's highest court, the [[New York Court of Appeals]], upholding a contract between Duff-Gordon and her [[advertising agency|advertising agent]] that assigned the agent the sole right to market her name.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Don, ''Titanic: An Illustrated History''(1992), 182–185; 222 N.Y. 88, N.E.214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The daughter of [[civil engineer]] Douglas Sutherland (1838–1865) and his Anglo-French-Canadian wife Elinor Saunders (1841–1937), Lucy Christiana Sutherland was born in [[London, England]], and raised in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, after her father's death from [[typhoid fever]]. When her mother remarried in 1871 to the bachelor David Kennedy (d. 1889), Lucy moved with them and her sister, the future novelist [[Elinor Glyn]], to [[Saint Helier]] on the [[Jersey|Isle of Jersey]]. Lucy acquired her love of fashion through dressing her collection of dolls, by studying gowns worn by women in family paintings, and by later making clothes for herself and Elinor.&lt;ref&gt;Duff Gordon, Lucy, ''Discretions and Indiscretions''(1932), 6, 9, 17; Glyn, Elinor, ''Romantic Adventure''(1936), 47&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Jersey, after a visit to relatives in England in 1875, Lucy and Elinor survived the wreck of their ship when it ran aground in a gale.&lt;ref&gt;Glyn, Elinor, ''Romantic Adventure'', 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1884, Lucy married for the first time, to James Stuart Wallace, with whom she had a child, Esme (1885–1973; later wife of the [[Earl of Halsbury|2nd Earl of Halsbury]] and mother of [[John Giffard, 3rd Earl of Halsbury|Anthony, 3rd Earl of Halsbury]]). Wallace was an alcoholic and regularly unfaithful, and Lucy sought consolation in love affairs, including a long relationship with the famous surgeon Sir [[Morell Mackenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;Duff Gordon, Lucy, ''Discretions and Indiscretions'', 22, 23, 33–35; Glyn, Elinor, ''Romantic Adventure'', 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Wallaces separated circa 1890, and Lucy started divorce proceedings in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Date of 1890–1891 estimated from Lucy Duff Gordon's autobiography, ''Discretions and Indiscretions'', 35; also see "She Changed Eve's Dress", ''London Daily Sketch'' (22 April 1935), 2: "The six years of my marriage to Jim were the worst years I ever knew." The Wallaces' divorce was finalized in 1895, as recorded in Supreme Court archives, and quoted in ''Lucile Ltd'' by Valerie D. Mendes and Amy de la Haye (2009), 216. Also see

==Fashion career==
In order to support herself and her daughter after the end of her first marriage, Lucy Duff-Gordon began working as a dressmaker from home. In 1893, she opened Maison Lucile at 24 Old Burlington St., in the heart of the fashionable [[West End of London]], having worked for a year previously from her mother's flat at 25 Davies Street.&lt;ref&gt;"At the Shops: Modes at the Maison Lucile," ''Hearth and Home'', 4 January 1894&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, Lucy Duff-Gordon opened a larger shop at 17 [[Hanover Square, Westminster]], before a further move (c.&amp;nbsp;1903–04) to 14 [[George Street, Oxford]]. In 1903, the business was incorporated as "Lucile Ltd" and the following year moved to 23 Hanover Square, where it operated for the next 20 years. Duff Gordon was eventually bankrupted after she revealed in the American press that she was not designing  much of the clothing that was attributed to her name. She spent her later years selling imported clothing and smaller collections in a succession of unsuccessful small 'boutiques'.

[[File:1912 evening dress.jpg|thumb|upright|Evening dress, Spring 1913, Lucile (1863–1935) V&amp;A Museum no. T.31-1960]]

Lucile Ltd served a wealthy clientele including aristocracy, royalty, and theatre stars. The business expanded, with salons opening in New York City in 1910, Paris in 1911, and Chicago in 1915, making it the first leading couture house with full-scale branches in three countries.&lt;ref&gt;"A High Priestess of Clothes," ''Vogue'', 15 April 1910, 27ff; "How London Now Dresses Paris: Lady Duff Gordon's Work in the Gay City," ''Tatler'', 23 April 1913, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nightgown by Lucile (Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon), 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|Nightdress from a bride's trousseau, 1913. V&amp;A Museum]]

Lucile was most famous for its lingerie, [[tea gown]]s, and [[evening gown|evening wear]]. Its luxuriously layered and draped garments in soft fabrics of blended pastel colors, often accentuated with sprays of hand-made silk flowers, became its hallmark.&lt;ref&gt;"Dream Dresses", Philadelphia Museum of Art (1998), ''Best Dressed'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lucile also offered simple, smart tailored [[suit (clothing)|suits]] and daywear.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, Madeleine, ''Four Hundred Years of Fashion'' (1984), 81&lt;/ref&gt; The dress illustrated at right typifies the classically draped style often found in Lucile designs. Lucy Duff-Gordon originally designed it in Paris, for Lucile Ltd's spring 1913 collection, and later specially adapted it for London socialite [[Heather Firbank]] and other well-known clients, including actress [[Kitty Gordon]] and dancer [[Lydia Kyasht]] of the [[Ballets Russes]]. The example illustrated was worn by Miss Firbank and is preserved in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Duff Gordon, Lady ("Lucile"), "The Last Word in Fashions," ''Harper's Bazaar'', July 1913, 26; also "Mousseline Now Holds First Place," ''New York Times'', 6 July 1913, and "Vogue Points," ''Vogue'', 15 May 1913; Gown worn by [[Heather Firbank]]. The original design included beading, lost or omitted from this example.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy Duff-Gordon is also widely credited with training the first professional fashion models (called ''mannequins'') as well as staging the first runway or "[[Runway (fashion)#Catwalk|catwalk]]" style shows.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Georgina, ''Vogue Women'' (1998), 85; Mulvey, Kate, and Richards, Melissa, ''Decades of Beauty: The Changing Image of Women, 1890s–1990s'' (1998), 35; "Fashion's Stage: The Methods of the Theatre at the Dressmaker's," ''The Illustrated London News'', 13 June 1908; "Lady Duff-Gordon – 'Lucile,'" ''Harper's Bazaar'', Aug. 1914, 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; These affairs were theatrically inspired, invitation-only, tea-time presentations, complete with a stage, curtains, mood-setting lighting, music from a string band, souvenir gifts, and programmes.

Another innovation in the presentation of her collections was what she called her "emotional gowns". These dresses were given descriptive names, influenced by literature, history, popular culture and her interest in the psychology and personality of her clients.&lt;ref&gt;Aspinwall, Grace, "Lady Duff Gordon: A Titled Designer of Clothes Who Aims to Dress the Soul," ''Good Housekeeping'', Nov. 1910, 572–573&lt;/ref&gt;

Some well-known clients, whose clothing influenced many when it appeared in early films, on stage, and in the press, included: [[Vernon and Irene Castle|Irene Castle]], [[Lily Elsie]], [[Gertie Millar]], [[Gaby Deslys]], [[Billie Burke]], and [[Mary Pickford]]. Lucile costumed numerous theatrical productions, including the London première of [[Franz Lehár]]'s operetta ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907), the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' revues on Broadway (1915–21), and the [[D. W. Griffith]] silent movie ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Sir Cecil ''The Glass of Fashion'' (1954), 32–34, 94; Castle, Irene, ''Castles in the Air'' (1958), 135–136; Baral, Robert, ''Revue: The Great Broadway Period'' (1962), 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucile creations were also frequently featured in [[Pathé]] and [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] newsreels of the 1910s and 20s, and Lucy Duff-Gordon appeared in her own weekly spot in the British newsreel "Around the Town" (c.&amp;nbsp;1919–21).&lt;ref&gt;Leese, Elizabeth, ''Costume Design in the Movies'' (1991), 75; Hammerton, Jenny, ''For Ladies Only:Eve's Film Review/Pathe Cinemagazine, 1921–33'', 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Lucile Ltd sketches, archived at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], provide evidence that in 1904 the salon employed at least one sketch artist to record Lucy Duff-Gordon's designs for in-house use.  As demands grew on her time, especially in the United States during [[World War I]], she was aided by sketch artists Robert Kalloch, Roger Bealle, Gilbert Clarke, [[Howard Greer]], Shirley Barker, [[Travis Banton]], and [[Edward Molyneux]], who created ideas based on the "Lucile look". In her memoir, Lucy Duff-Gordon credited her corps of assistants for their contributions to the success of the New York branch of Lucile Ltd. Many of these assistants' drawings were published in the press and signed "Lucile",  though occasionally the signature of the artist, such as Molyneux, appeared. It was general practice for couture houses to use professional artists to execute drawings of designs as they were being created, as well as of the artist's own ideas for each season's output and for individual clients. These drawings were overseen by Lucy Duff-Gordon, who often critiqued them, adding notes, instructions, dates, and sometimes her own signature or initials, indicating she approved the design.

Like many couturiers, Lucy Duff-Gordon designed principally on the human form. Her surviving personal sketchbooks indicate her limited technical ability as a sketch artist, but a skill at recording colour. Surviving Lucile Ltd sketches reveal numerous artists of varying talent levels, and these are often mis-attributed to herself.  Howard Greer admitted in his autobiography that the sketches he and his colleagues executed were often confused interpretations of the Lucile style that did not match their employer's vision. Moreover, he claimed customers were not always pleased by the actual dresses created from the sketches he and the other assistants submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Duff Gordon, Lady, ''Discretions and Indiscretions'' (1932), 243; Bigham, Randy Bryan, ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'' (2012), 120–122; Mendes, Valerie D., ''Lucile Ltd'' (2009), 33; Greer, Howard, ''Designing Male'' (1950), 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unprecedented for a leading couturière, Lucy Duff-Gordon promoted her collections journalistically. In addition to a weekly syndicated fashion page for the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] newspaper syndicate (1910–22), she wrote monthly columns for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' (1912–22). A Hearst writer ghost wrote the newspaper page after 1918,  but the designer herself penned the ''Good Housekeeping'' and ''Harper's Bazaar'' features throughout their duration, although the responsibility of producing a regular piece proved difficult, and she missed several deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, Valerie and Haye, Amy de la, ''Lucile Ltd'' (2009), 15, 170, 171, 179, 190, 196.; Evans, Caroline, ''The Mechanical Smile: Modernism and the First Fashion Shows in France and America, 1900–1929'' (2013), 107, 214, 277; Bigham, Randy Bryan, ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'' (2012), 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucile fashions also appeared regularly in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''Femina'', ''Les Modes'', ''L'art et la Mode'', and other leading fashion magazines (1910–22). Along with Hearst publications, Lucile contributed to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''Dress'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', ''[[The London Magazine]]'', ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', and ''[[Munsey's Magazine|Munsey's]]''.

In addition to her career as a couturière, costumier, journalist, and pundit, Lucy Duff-Gordon took significant advantage of opportunities for commercial endorsement, lending her name to advertising for brassieres, perfume, shoes, and other luxury apparel and beauty items.&lt;ref&gt;Etherington-Smith, Meredith, ''The "It" Girls'' (1986), 196; Mendes, Valerie D., Lucile Ltd (2009), 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most adventurous of her licensing ventures were a two-season, lower-priced, mail-order fashion line for [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck]] &amp; Co. (1916–17), which promoted her clothing in special de luxe catalogues, and a contract to design interiors for limousines and town cars for the [[Chalmers Automobile|Chalmers Motor Co.]], later [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] (1917).&lt;ref&gt;Olian, JoAnne, ''Everyday Fashions, 1909–1920: As Pictured in Sears Catalogs'', 3–4; ''The Saturday Evening Post'', "Interiors by Lady Duff Gordon," 7 October 1916, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==RMS ''Titanic''==

In 1912, Lucy Duff-Gordon traveled to America on business in connection with the New York branch of Lucile Ltd. She and her husband, Sir Cosmo, booked first class passage on the ocean liner {{RMS|Titanic}} under the alias "Mr. and Mrs. Morgan", a possible explanation being that they hoped to avoid publicity on landing in New York.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Her secretary, Laura Mabel Francatelli, nicknamed "Franks", accompanied the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan, "Lady Duff Gordon: Saved From the Titanic",  ''Titanic Commutator'', Spring 1991, 5–11&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April, at 11:40&amp;nbsp;pm the ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg and began to sink. During the evacuation, the Duff-Gordons and Francatelli escaped in [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat No. 1|Lifeboat No. 1]]. Although the boat was designed to hold 40 people, it was lowered with only 12 people aboard, seven of them male crew members.&lt;ref&gt;Lifeboats No. 1 and No. 2 differed from other lifeboats in that they were intended as emergency cutters.  See: [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat No. 1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the ''Titanic'' sank, while afloat in Lifeboat No. 1, Lucy Duff-Gordon reportedly commented to her secretary, "There is your beautiful nightdress gone."&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Walter, ''A Night to Remember'' (1955), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]], annoyed by her comment, replied that while the couple could replace their property, he and the other crew members had lost everything in the sinking. Sir Cosmo then offered each of the men £5 (equivalent to £{{inflation|UK|5|1912}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}) to aid them until they received new assignments. While on the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']], the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] liner that rescued ''Titanic'''s survivors, Sir Cosmo presented the men from Lifeboat No. 1 with checks drawn on his bank, [[Coutts]]. This action later spawned gossip that the Duff-Gordons had bribed their lifeboat's crew not to return to save swimmers out of fear the vessel would be swamped.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

These rumors were fueled by the tabloid press in the United States and, eventually, in the United Kingdom. On May 17, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon testified at the London hearings of the [[British Titanic inquiry|British Board of Trade inquiry into the disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', May 18, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, Lady Duff-Gordon took the stand. The couple's testimony attracted the largest crowds during the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Don, ''Titanic: An Illustrated History'' (1992), 183–185&lt;/ref&gt;

While Sir Cosmo faced tough criticism during cross-examination, his wife had it slightly easier. Dressed in black, with a large, veiled hat, she told the court she remembered little about what happened in the lifeboat on the night of the sinking, due to seasickness, and she could not recall specific conversations. Lawyers did not seem to have pressed her very hard.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff Gordon at the Titanic Inquiry", ''The Sketch'', May 22, 1912, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Duff-Gordon noted that for the rest of her husband's life he was brokenhearted over the negative coverage by the "[[Yellow journalism|yellow press]]", during his cross-examination at the inquiry. The final report by the inquiry determined that the Duff-Gordons did not deter the crew from any attempt at rescue through bribery or any other method of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conduct of Sir Cosmo-Duff Gordon and Mr. Ismay|work=Titanic Inquiry Project|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTReport/BOTRepConduct.html|accessdate=2 January 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028064512/http://titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTReport/BOTRepConduct.html|archivedate=28 October 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a box of documents and letters concerning the Titanic sinking belonging to the Duff-Gordons was rediscovered at the London office of [[Veale Wasbrough Vizards]], the legal firm that merged with [[Tweedies]], which had represented the couple. Among the papers was an inventory of the possessions Lucy Duff Gordon had lost, the total value listed as £3,208 3s 6d. One letter detailed what she wore when leaving the ship: two dressing gowns "for warmth", a [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]], and her "[[motor hat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/titanic-anniversary/9202821/Titanic-survivors-vindicated-at-last.html|title=Titanic survivors vindicated at last|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A faded grey silk [[kimono]] with typical [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]]-style black cord edging, for some time thought to have been worn by her that night, is now understood to have belonged to her daughter Esme, Countess of Halsbury, as its distinctive print dates the item to post [[World War I]].)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dr. Lou, ''Mario Fortuny Venise'', Brighton Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wwd.com/eye/people/a-titanic-controversy-over-a-robe-5861664/&lt;/ref&gt; An apron said to have been worn by Francatelli can be seen at the [[Maritime Museum]] in Liverpool, and her life-jacket was sold, along with correspondence about her experiences in the disaster, at [[Christie's]] auction house, London, in 2007.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===In popular culture===

The ''Titanic'' episode is one of the most prominent aspects of Lucy Duff-Gordon's life, thanks partly to motion pictures. The films, however, portrayed her without great attention to accuracy. She has been portrayed by Harriette Johns in ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'' (1958); by [[Rosalind Ayres]] in [[James Cameron]]'s epic ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997); and by [[Sylvestra Le Touzel]] in the British miniseries ''[[Titanic (2012 TV miniseries)|Titanic]]'' (2012).

==RMS ''Lusitania''==
Lucy Duff-Gordon had another close call three years after surviving the ''Titanic'', when she booked passage aboard the final voyage of the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']]. It was reported in the press that she cancelled her trip due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Duff Gordon Ill," ''Women's Wear Daily'', 29 April 1915, 1; "Friends of Lady Duff Gordon Thankful for her Escape," ''Women's Wear Daily'', 10 May 1915, 11; other references to her plans to sail on ''Lusitania'' include M.D.C. Crawford's ''Ways of Fashion'' (1948), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lusitania'' was [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sunk]] by a German torpedo on 7 May 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmslusitania.info/lusitania/sinking/|title=The Lusitania Resource|publisher=rmslusitania.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon''==
In 1917, Lucy Duff-Gordon lost the [[New York Court of Appeals]] case of ''[[Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]]'', in which Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] established precedent in the realm of [[contract law]] when he held the designer to a contract that assigned the sole right to market her professional name to her advertising agent, Otis F. Wood, despite the fact that the contract lacked explicit consideration for her promise. Cardozo noted that, "A promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be 'instinct with an obligation'" and, if so, "there is a contract." 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917).

Cardozo famously opened the opinion with the following description of the designer:

{{Quote|The defendant styles herself "a creator of fashions." Her favor helps a sale. Manufacturers of dresses, millinery, and like articles are glad to pay for a certificate of her approval. The things which she designs, fabrics, parasols, and what not, have a new value in the public mind when issued in her name.}}

Although the term "creator of fashions" was part of the tagline in 'Lucile's' columns for the Hearst papers, some observers have claimed that Cardozo's tone revealed a certain disdain for her position in the world of fashion. Others accept that he was merely echoing language used by the defendant in her own submissions to the court as well as in her publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Duff Gordon, Lady ("Lucile"), "Spider Web Fashions," ''San Francisco Examiner'', 12 July 1917; 177 A.D. 624, 164 N.Y.S. 576 and 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Lucy Duff-Gordon's connection to her design empire began to disintegrate following a restructuring of Lucile, Ltd in 1918–19. An acrimonious battle emerged in the press, culminating in her public acknowledgement that many Lucile dresses were not designed by her. Lucy Duff-Gordon's autobiography acknowledges that this had been the case since at least 1911.

By September 1922, she had  ceased designing for the company, which effectively closed. A completely new 'Lucile' was formed, using the same premises in Paris, and different designs,  but it gradually failed.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robert Forrest, ''Paris on Parade'' (1924), 67&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, its founder (who continued to be known as 'Lucile') worked from private premises designing personally for individual clients.&lt;ref&gt;Milbank, Caroline Rennolds, ''Couture: The Great Designers'', (1985), 69&lt;/ref&gt; She was briefly associated with the firm of Reville, Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Duff Gordon Resigns," ''Women's Wear Daily'', 23 March 1927, 3&lt;/ref&gt; maintained a ready-to-wear shop of her own&lt;ref&gt;"Ready-to-Wear Gowns Featured in Lady Duff Gordon's London Shop," ''Women's Wear Daily'', 29 May 1924, 2&lt;/ref&gt; and lent her name to a wholesale operation in America.&lt;ref&gt;"Dufgor, Inc," ''Women's Wear Daily'', 16 August 1926, 2; "The People's Store," ''Charleston Gazette'', 17 March 1929, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy Duff-Gordon also continued as a fashion columnist and critic after her design career ended, contributing to London's ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' and ''[[Daily Express]]'' (1922–1930), and she penned her best-selling autobiography ''Discretions and Indiscretions'' (1932).

==Death==
Lady Duff-Gordon died of [[breast cancer]], complicated by [[pneumonia]], in a [[Putney]], London nursing home in 1935, aged 71.&lt;ref&gt;"Died:Lady Duff Gordon," ''Time'', 29 April 1935, 67; "Lady Duff Gordon Dies at 71," ''New York Herald Tribune'', 22 April 1935, 10; "Lady Duff Gordon, Style Expert Dies," ''New York Times'', 22 April 1935, 17; "She Changed Eve's Dress," ''London Daily Sketch'', 22 April 1935, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of her death, 20 April, was the fourth anniversary of her husband's death.

==Legacy==
In addition to her mark on culture, history, and the law, there has been a resurgence of interest in her work as a designer. She originated the fashion component of her sister [[Elinor Glyn]]'s '[[It girl]]' concept.

===Books===

'''Metrocles''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Μητροκλῆς}}; fl. c. 325 BC) was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] [[philosopher]] from [[Maroneia]]. He studied in [[Aristotle]]’s [[Lyceum]] under [[Theophrastus]], and eventually became a follower of [[Crates of Thebes]] who married Metrocles’ sister [[Hipparchia of Maroneia|Hipparchia]]. Very little survives of his writings, but he is important as one of the first Cynics to adopt the practice of writing moral [[anecdotes]] (''chreiai'') about [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] and other Cynics.

==Life==
The supposed story of Metrocles' conversion to [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]ism is reported by [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref name="diog94"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Metrocles had apparently [[flatulence|farted]] while practicing a speech, and became so upset that he shut himself up in his home, attempting to commit suicide by [[starving]] himself. [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]] visited him and made him a dinner of [[lupin beans|lupines]],&lt;ref&gt;Lupin beans were notorious for causing flatulence.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining to him that what he had done was according to nature and therefore nothing to be ashamed of. When Crates himself farted to demonstrate how natural it was, Metrocles was persuaded to let go of his shame.

Whether or not this story is true, the [[symbol]]ism for the Cynics is that it demonstrated the worthlessness of Metrocles' education up until that time. As a pupil of [[Theophrastus]] he may have learned a lot of information, but he was still obsessed with social conventions and good manners, to the point of being ready to die from embarrassment.  With Crates' help he was able to let go of his old ways and embrace a Cynic life free from convention, and find true [[happiness]].

Equally significant is a passage preserved in the writings of [[Teles the Cynic|Teles]], who tells how Metrocles as a young student of the [[Lyceum]] and the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] could not keep up with the extravagant life-style requirements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When he was studying with Theophrastus and Xenocrates, although many things were being sent to him from home, he was in constant fear of dying from [[hunger]] and was always destitute and in want. But when he later changed over to Crates, he could feed even another person though nothing was sent from home. For in the former case he had to have [[shoes]],... then a [[cloak]], a following of [[slaves]], and a grand [[house]]; for the common table he had to see that the [[bread]]s were pure, the delicacies above the ordinary, the [[wine]] sweet, the entertainment appropriate, so that here there was much expense.  For among them such a way of life was judged to be 'liberal.'&lt;ref&gt;Teles, ''Fragment 4a'', quoted in David A. Holgate (1999), ''Prodigality, Liberality and Meanness in the Parable of the Prodigal Son'', page 151. Continuum International. and in J. Bryant, (1996), ''Moral Codes and Social Structure in Ancient Greece'', page 525. SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Hecato of Rhodes]], Metrocles burned all his writings, but others said it was only the notes he took in the school of Theophrastus that he burned.&lt;ref name="diog95"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 95&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been via Metrocles that his sister [[Hipparchia of Maroneia|Hipparchia]] met Crates, whom she later married, thus also becoming a Cynic. [[Plutarch]] represents Metrocles as sleeping in the winter amongst [[sheep]], and in the summer in the porches of [[Greek temple|temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Moralia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently knew the [[Megarian school|Megarian]] philosopher [[Stilpo]] and disputed with him,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Tranquilliate Animi'', vi. 468&lt;/ref&gt; and Stilpo wrote a dialogue called ''Metrocles''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ii. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of Metrocles, Diogenes Laërtius seemingly lists a number of his pupils,&lt;ref name="diog95"/&gt; but the list probably refers to Crates.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Cazé, (2000), ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy'', page 398. Cf. page 392 pointing out that Diogenes Laertius vi. 98 also returns to the biography of Crates.&lt;/ref&gt; Metrocles died at a great age, and is said to have deliberately [[suffocated]] himself.&lt;ref name="diog95"/&gt;

==Writings==
Metrocles was a man of great ability,&lt;ref name="diog94"/&gt; and wrote several works, but little of his thought survives. He objected to [[wealth]] unless it was put to good use; and he divided things into those that can be bought with [[money]] (such as a [[house]]), and those that take time and care, like [[education]].&lt;ref name="diog95"/&gt; One of his works was called ''[[Chreia]]i'' ({{lang-el|Χρεῖαι}}), that is, ''Anecdotes'', or ''Maxims''. Thus he became one of the first to contribute to the most important literary art-form for the Cynics: thousands of anecdotes were accumulated (and invented) concerning [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]] and other Cynics, all of them providing moral messages through the actions of the Cynics. An anecdote written by Metrocles concerning Diogenes is preserved by Laërtius:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On one occasion Diogenes went with his head half-shaved into an entertainment of young men, as Metrocles tells us in his ''Chreiai'', and so was beaten by them. And afterwards he wrote the names of all those who had beaten him, on a white tablet, and went about with the tablet round his neck, so as to expose them to insult, as they were generally condemned and reproached for their conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Michel Warschawski (Mikado)''' ({{lang-he|מיכאל ורשבסקי (מיקאדו)}}) is an [[Israel]]i [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] activist. He led the Marxist [[Revolutionary Communist League (Israel)|Revolutionary Communist League]] (previously [[Matzpen]]-Jerusalem) until its demise in the 1990s, and founded the  [[Alternative information center|Alternative Information Center]], a joint Palestinian-Israeli [[non-governmental organization]], in 1984.

== Biography ==
[[File:Michel Warschawski.jpg|thumb|Michel Warschawski, July 2005.]]
Michel Warschawski was born 1949 in [[Strasbourg]], France, where his father was the Rabbi. At the age of 16 Warschawski moved to Jerusalem, in order to study the Talmud—he is a graduate of [[Mercaz HaRav]]. He later studied philosophy at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Despite having long since stopped being religious, fellow-activists on occasion turn to him to elucidate subtle points of the Jewish religion.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In 1982, Warschawski was one of the co-founders of [[Yesh Gvul]], a term that plays on three meanings: (1) "there is a border": "there is a limit": and "enough's enough".&lt;ref&gt;Daphne Golan, "Between Universalism and Particularism: the 'Border' in Israeli Discourse", in V. Y. Mudimbe (ed.), ''Nations, Identities, Cultures'', Duke University Press, 1997 (pp. 75–94), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Warschawski established the Alternative Information Center (AIC), an organization uniting Israeli and Palestinian anti-Zionist activists.

In 1987, Warschawski was arrested for "providing services for illegal (Palestinian) organizations" and sentenced in 1989 to twenty months in prison, with a 10-month suspended sentence, for typesetting a booklet that the judges ruled had come from  members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], which described torture and interrogation techniques allegedly employed by Israel's security apparatus, with advice on how to withstand them. The court determined that Warschawsky was unaware of the booklet's origins, but guilty of closing his eyes to the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Daphne Golan, 1997, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warschawski is a writer and journalist, whose articles appear regularly in ''[[International Viewpoint]]'', ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', [[ZNet]], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', ''Siné Hebdo'' and other publications. He has also been interviewed for [[the Real News Network]]. In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]] to the [[Knesset]], he was a candidate on the list of an Arab Israeli party ballot (the [[National Democratic Assembly]]). He was a candidate for the [[Joint List]] in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 election]].

Warschawski is married to attorney and [[human rights]] activist [[Leah Tsemel]], and is the father of two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalsace.fr/actualite/2011/04/25/nous-avions-de-bonnes-raisons-de-revoir-michel-warschawski-en-janvier-dernier-a-paris "Michel Warschawski, un pacifiste venu d’Alsace en Terre Sainte", L'Alsace, 25 April 2011] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Omar Derdour and a group of fellow students founded a division of the Algerian Muslim Scholars Association and became active in education in the fields of religious and national awareness.{{sfn|Obituary - Sheikh Omar}} In 1937, Derdour returned to his village to establish a [[madrasa]] for the education of children and adults.{{sfn|Bouseloua|Guerfi|Mokhtari|Thiriez|2011|p=64}} Ben Badis considered him the "soul of the Islahiste{{efn|The Islahiste movement was a reform movement, which among other things gave women a greater role in religious matters.{{sfn|Barrak|Muller|1996|p=102}}}} movement in the Aures".{{sfn|Le parcours de Cheikh Omar Derdour étudié}} At the end of 1937, the French authorities became aware of his activities and imprisoned him in [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]] for "inciting the population to civil disobedience".{{sfn|Ghrib|2009}} Derdour was released on 6 January 1938, but was imprisoned a second time in August 1939 to complete his four-month sentence and was fined 8,000 francs. He was released in September 1939 upon the outbreak of World War II (1939-1945).{{sfn|Sheikh Sidi Abu al-Qasim Omar}} During the war the authorities suppressed all political activities, and he was forced to limit himself to non-political education.{{sfn|Obituary - Sheikh Omar}}

Omar Derdour directed the [[Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty|AML Party]]'s Federation in Constantine, and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 until 1951.{{sfn|Derradji|2002|p=577}} The purpose of the AML party was to publicize and defend the [[Manifest du Peuple Algerien]]; anti-French, it demanded equal rights for the Muslim population and an [[autonomy|autonomous]] Algeria federated with France, the colonial power.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=242}} Between July 1955 and January 1956 he lived in [[Vichy]], France, working with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) on defining the objectives and approach of the revolution.{{sfn|Obituary - Sheikh Omar}} Derdour moved to Cairo, meeting Sheikh Mohammed Bashir Brahimi and other members of the Revolutionary Command.

==Independent Algeria==

After Algeria gained independence, Omar Derdour devoted himself to teaching Islam and Arabic. He founded the first Islamic institute in Batna in May 1963, followed by the creation of similar institutions in several cities across the country, reaching 10,000 students.{{sfn|Le parcours de Cheikh Omar Derdour étudié}} 
In 1981, Derdour was appointed director of the institute in [[Sidi Okba]] for training imams and regional inspectors of religious affairs in Batna, [[Khenchela]] and [[Oum El Bouaghi]], holding this position until his retirement.{{sfn|Bouseloua|Guerfi|Mokhtari|Thiriez|2011|p=65}} In 1986, Derdour was appointed regional inspector of Religious Affairs in [[Batna Province|Batna]] and [[Khenchela Province|Khenchela]] provinces.{{sfn|Obituary - Sheikh Omar}} In the 2000s he built a mosque and a zawiya in the locality of El Hamza in the municipality of [[Oued Taga]] and a school in the village of his birth.{{sfn|Bouseloua|Guerfi|Mokhtari|Thiriez|2011|p=65}} 

On 19 March 2009 Abou El Kacem Omar Derdour died after a long battle against the effects of a stroke.{{sfn|Bouseloua|Guerfi|Mokhtari|Thiriez|2011|p=65}} He was buried in [[Tazoult]].

'''Pyotr Demianovich Ouspenskii''' (known in English as '''Peter D. Ouspensky''', {{lang|ru|Пётр Демья́нович Успе́нский | Pyotr Dem'yanovich Uspenskiy}}; 5 March 1878 – 2 October 1947),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ouspensky.info/ouspenskyeng.htm |title= Ouspensky Foundation|first= |last= |work= ouspensky.info |year= 2002|accessdate= 7 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720081012/http://www.ouspensky.info/ouspenskyeng.htm|archivedate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Russia]]n [[esotericism| esotericist]] known for his expositions of the early work of the [[Greek people|Greek]]-[[Armenian people|Armenian]] teacher of esoteric doctrine [[G.I. Gurdjieff|George Gurdjieff]], whom he met in [[Moscow]] in 1915.  Ouspensky was associated{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} with the ideas and practices originating with Gurdjieff from then on. He shared the (Gurdjieff) "system" for 25 years in [[England]] and the [[United States]], having separated from Gurdjieff in 1924 personally, for reasons he explains in the last chapter of his book ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]''.

All in all, Ouspensky studied the Gurdjieff system directly under Gurdjieff's own supervision for a period of ten years, from 1915 to 1924. His book ''In Search of the Miraculous'' recounts what he learned from Gurdjieff during those years. While lecturing in London in 1924, he announced that he would continue independently the way he had begun in 1921. Some, including his close pupil [[Rodney Collin]], say that he finally gave up the system in 1947, just before his death, but his own recorded words on the subject ("A Record of Meetings", published posthumously) do not clearly endorse this judgement, nor does Ouspensky's emphasis on "you must make a new beginning" after confessing "I've left the system".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ouspensky was born in [[Moscow]] in 1878. In 1890, he was studying at the Second Moscow Gymnasium, a government school attended by boys from 10 to 18. At the age of 16, he was expelled from school for painting graffiti on the wall in plain sight of a visiting inspector; thereafter, he would be more or less on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirley |first=John |title=Gurdjieff |page=111 |year=2004 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=1-58542-287-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, he was working in the editorial office of the Moscow daily paper ''The Morning''. In 1907 he discovered Theosophy. In the autumn of 1913, age 35, before the beginning of [[World War I]], he journeyed to the East in search of the miraculous, visited Theosophists in Adyar but was forced to return to Moscow after the beginning of the Great War. There he met George Gurdjieff and married Sophie Grigorievna Maximenko. He had a mistress by the name of Anna Ilinishna Butkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moore |first=James |title=Gurdjieff |page=73 |year=1999 |publisher=Element Books Ltd |isbn=1-86204-606-9 |quote=The meaning of life is an eternal search. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His first book, ''The Fourth Dimension'', appeared in 1909; his second book, ''[[Tertium Organum]]'', in 1912. ''A New Model of the Universe'', as explained by Ouspensky in the foreword of the second edition, was written and published as articles by 1914, updated to include "recent developments in physics" and republished as a book in [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1917. The work, as reflected in its title, shows the influence of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Max Müller]] and has been interpreted as an attempt to reconcile ideas from [[natural science]] and the burgeoning field of [[religious studies]] with occultism in the tradition of Gurdjieff and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences |location = Chicago| publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X |page = 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed that that book was lost to the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]]'s violence, but it was then republished in [[English language|English]] (without his knowledge) in 1931. Since the earliest lectures this work attracted a [[who's who]] of philosophy (see below) and has been to this day a widely accepted authoritative basis for a study of metaphysics, or rather, to exceed the limits of the same by his "psychological method", which he defines as (paraphrasing p.&amp;nbsp;75.) "a calibration of the tools of human understanding to derive the actual meaning of the thing itself."

This term is one of three high concepts of the material presented, along with "the esoteric method" which as he sums up (p.&amp;nbsp;76) depends on the first to derive the possibility of something beyond ordinary human effort entirely. In high concept terms: "The idea of esotericism ... holds that the very great majority of our ideas are not the product of evolution but the product of the degeneration of ideas which existed at some time or are still existing somewhere in much higher, purer and more complete forms." (p.&amp;nbsp;47) Ouspensky's reputation is presently degenerated to being a follower of Gurdjieff rather than a partner (see below) and the apex of esotericism, self-knowledge, and metaphysical thought. The title itself promises a model of the universe, or unified theory of everything, which it is. He also wrote the novel ''[[Strange Life of Ivan Osokin]]'', which explored the concept of eternal recurrence or the [[eternal return]].

He traveled in Europe and the East — India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Egypt — in his search for knowledge. After his return to Russia and his introduction to Gurdjieff in 1915, Ouspensky spent the next few years studying with him, and supporting the founding of a school.

Denying the ultimate reality of space and time in his book ''Tertium Organum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P. D. |title=Tertium Organum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myhW9upOw3sC&amp;dq=Ouspensky+Tertium+Organum+1912 |year=1912 |edition=2nd |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=1-60506-487-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also negates [[Aristotle]]'s Logical Formula of Identification of "A is A" and finally concludes in his "higher logic" that A is both A and not-A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouspensky |first=P. D. |title=Tertium Organum |page=266 |quote=A is both A and Not-A |publisher=Book Tree |year=2003 |isbn=1-58509-244-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbeknown to Ouspensky, a Russian émigré by the name of Nicholas Bessarabof took a copy of ''Tertium Organum'' to America and placed it in the hands of the architect [[Claude Bragdon]] who could read Russian and was interested in the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman ''In Search of P. D. Ouspensky'', p. 174, Quest Books, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tertium Organum'' was rendered into [[English language|English]] by Bragdon who had incorporated his own design of the [[hypercube]]&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bragdon, ''A Primer of Higher Space'', Omen Press, Tucson, Arizona, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3y04AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Claude+Bragdon+A+Primer+of+Higher+Space A primer of higher space (the fourth dimension)] by Claude Fayette Bragdon, plates 1, 20 and 21 (following p. 24)&lt;/ref&gt; into the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] Chamber of Commerce building.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Rucker, ''Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension'', Dover Publications Inc., 1977, p. 2. {{ISBN|0-486-23400-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bragdon also published the book and the publication was such a success that it was finally taken up by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. At the time, in the early 1920s, Ouspensky's whereabouts were unknown until Bragdon located him in [[Constantinople]] and paid him back some royalties.

Ouspensky's lectures in London were attended by such literary figures as [[Aldous Huxley]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Gerald Heard]] and other writers, journalists and doctors. His influence on the literary scene of the 1920s and 1930s as well as on the [[Russian avant-garde]] was immense but still very little known.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman ''In Search of P. D. Ouspensky'', pp. 177-8, Quest Books, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said of Ouspensky that, though nonreligious, he had one prayer: not to become famous during his lifetime.

Ouspensky also provided an original discussion of the nature and expression of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in his ''A New Model of the Universe''; among other things, he draws a distinction between [[erotica]] and [[pornography]].

During his years in Moscow, Ouspensky wrote for several newspapers and was particularly interested in the then-fashionable idea of the fourth dimension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NW9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Hinton+the+fourth+dimension&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1 Geometry of four dimensions] by Henry Parker Manning&lt;/ref&gt; His first published work was titled ''The Fourth Dimension''&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Ouspensky, ''The Fourth Dimension'', Kessinger Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|1-4253-4935-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he explored the subject along the ideas prevalent at the time in the works of [[Charles H. Hinton]],&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Rudolf, editor, ''Speculations on the Fourth Dimension: Selected Writings of Charles H. Hinton'', Dover Publications Inc., 1980. {{ISBN|0-486-23916-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth dimension being an extension in space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EF06AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Hinton+the+fourth+dimension&amp;as_brr=1 Scientific Romances] by Charles Howard Hinton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=txIQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Hinton+the+fourth+dimension&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1 A new era of thought] by Charles Howard Hinton&lt;/ref&gt; Ouspensky treats time as a fourth dimension only indirectly in a novel he wrote titled ''[[Strange Life of Ivan Osokin]]''&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Ouspensky, ''[[Strange Life of Ivan Osokin]]'', Lindisfarne Books, 1947. {{ISBN|1-58420-005-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where he also explores the theory of eternal recurrence.

==Later life==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:P D Ouspensky grave.jpg|thumb|alt=Ouspensky's gravestone|Ouspensky's grave at the Holy Trinity Church in [[Lyne, Surrey]], England, photographed in 2013]]
After the [[Bolshevik revolution]], Ouspensky travelled to [[London]] by way of [[Istanbul]].
[[G. R. S. Mead]] became interested in the fourth dimension and Lady Rothermere, wife of [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere]], the press magnate, was willing to spread the news of Ouspenky's ''Tertium Organum'', while Ouspensky's acquaintance [[A. R. Orage]] was telling others about Ouspensky. By order of the British government, Gurdjieff was not allowed to settle in London. Gurdjieff finally went to France with a considerable sum of money raised by Ouspensky and his friends and settled down near Paris at the Prieuré in [[Communauté de communes de Fontainebleau-Avon|Fontainebleau-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Owen ''The Place of Enchantment'', p. 232, University of Chicago Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-226-64201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time, after Gurdjieff founded his [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] in [[France]], that Ouspensky came to the conclusion that he was no longer able to understand his former teacher and made a decision to discontinue association with him, setting up his own organisation, [[The Study Society|The Society for the Study of Normal Psychology]], which is now known as The Study Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Hodgkinson|title=[http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/product/in-search-of-truth/ In Search of Truth]|publisher=Shepheard-Walwyn (Publishers)|year=2010 |isbn=978-0-85683-276-5}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Ouspensky wrote about Gurdjieff's teachings in a book originally entitled ''Fragments of an Unknown Teaching'', only published posthumously in 1947 under the title ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]''. While this volume has been criticized by some of those who have followed Gurdjieff's teachings as only a partial representation of the totality of his ideas, it nevertheless provides what is probably the most concise explanation of the material that was included. This is in sharp contrast to the writings of Gurdjieff himself, such as ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson]]'', where the ideas and precepts of Gurdjieff's teachings are found very deeply veiled in [[allegory]]. Initially, Ouspensky had intended this book to be published only if ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson]]'' were not published. But after his death, Mme Ouspensky showed its draft to Gurdjieff who praised its accuracy and permitted its publication.

Ouspensky died in [[Holloway Sanatorium#Lyne Place|Lyne Place]], [[Surrey]], in 1947. Shortly after his death, ''The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution'' was published, together with ''In Search of the Miraculous''. A facsimile edition of ''In Search of the Miraculous'' was published in 2004 by Paul H. Crompton Ltd. London. Transcripts of some of his lectures were published under the title of ''[[Fourth Way (book)|The Fourth Way]]'' in 1957; largely a collection of question and answer sessions, the book details important concepts, both introductory and advanced, for students of these teachings.

Ouspensky's papers are held at [[Yale University Library]]'s Manuscripts and Archives department.

==Teaching==

After Ouspensky broke away from Gurdjieff, he taught the "[[Fourth Way]]", as he understood it, to his independent groups.

===Fourth Way===

Gurdjieff proposed that there are three ways of self-development generally known in esoteric circles. These are the Way of the Fakir, dealing exclusively with the physical body, the Way of the Monk, dealing with the emotions, and the Way of the Yogi, dealing with the mind. What is common about the three ways is that they demand complete seclusion from the world. According to Gurdjieff, there is a Fourth Way which does not demand its followers to abandon the world. The work of self-development takes place right in the midst of ordinary life. Gurdjieff called his system a school of the Fourth Way where a person learns to work in harmony with his physical body, emotions and mind. Ouspensky picked up this idea and continued his own school along this line.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno de Panafieu-Jacob Needleman-George Baker-Mary Stein ''Gurdjieff'', p. 218, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1049-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ouspensky made the term "Fourth Way" and its use central to his own teaching of the ideas of Gurdjieff. He greatly focused on Fourth Way schools and their existence throughout history.

'''Students'''

Among his students were [[Rodney Collin]], [[Maurice Nicoll]], [[Robert S de Ropp]], [[Kenneth Walker (author)|Kenneth Walker]], [[Remedios Varo]] and Dr [[Francis Roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1947-1960-dr-f-c-roles-new-beginnings/|title=1947–1960 Dr F.C. Roles: New Beginnings – Ouspensky Today|website=www.ouspenskytoday.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-remembering===

Ouspensky personally confessed the difficulties he was experiencing with "self-remembering," which has later been defined by Osho as 'witnessing'. The present phraseology in the teachings of Advaita is to be in awareness, or being aware of being aware. It is also believed to be consistent with the Buddhist practice of 'mindfulness'. The ultimate goal of each is to be always in a state of meditation even in sleep. It was {{what|date=March 2017}}a technique to which he had been introduced by Gurdjieff himself. Gurdjieff explained to him this was the missing link to everything else. While in Russia, Ouspensky himself experimented with the technique with a certain degree of success and in his lectures in London and America, he emphasized its practice. The technique requires a division of attention, so that a person not only pays attention to what is going on in the exterior world but also in the interior. A.L. Volinsky, an acquaintance of Ouspensky in Russia mentioned to Ouspensky that this was what professor [[Wundt]] meant by [[apperception]]. Ouspensky disagreed and noted how an idea so profound to him would pass unnoticed by people whom he considered intelligent. Gurdjieff explained the [[Rosicrucian]] principle that in order to bring about a result or manifestation, three things are necessary. With self-remembering and self-observation two things are present. The third one is explained by Ouspensky in his tract on Conscience: it is the non-expression of negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;P. D.

'''Peter Fanucchi''' is a [[california wine|Californian wine]]grower in the [[Russian River Valley AVA]]. His winery, Fanucchi Vineyards began using grapes from a plot of land bought by his father in 1972. Already planted with planted at the end of the 19th century [[Zinfandel]], Fanucchi's father originally wanted to pull it out but Fanucchi retrained the vines and for nearly a decade it went into [[White Zinfandel]] for. In 1992, he started his own commercial brand and began producing red Zinfandel wine.&lt;ref&gt;W.

'''Sheikh Pierre Gemayel''' ({{lang-ar| بيار الجميّل}}) (6 November 1905 – 29 August 1984) (last name also spelt '''Jmayyel''', '''Jemayyel''' or '''al-Jumayyil'''; [[Sheikh]] is an honorific title in [[Arab]] countries) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] political leader. He is remembered as the founder of the [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Kataeb Party]] (also known as the '''Phalangist Party'''), as a parliamentary powerbroker, and as the father of [[Bachir Gemayel]] and [[Amine Gemayel]], both of whom were elected to the [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|Presidency]] of the Republic in his lifetime.  He opposed the [[France|French]] [[League of Nations Mandate|Mandate]] over Lebanon in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and advocated an independent state, free from foreign control. He was known for his deft political maneuvering, which led him to take positions which were seen by supporters as pragmatic, but by opponents as contradictory, or even hypocritical. Although publicly sympathetic to the [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] cause, he later changed his position due to Palestinian support of the [[Lebanese National Movement]] and its calls to end the [[National Pact]] and establish [[non-sectarian]] democracy.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Bachir Gemayel with his father Pierre Gemayel at the Kataeb anniversary event in 1977.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Bachir Gemayel]] with his father Pierre Gemayel and [[William Hawi]]'s family at the [[Kataeb]] anniversary event in 1977]]

Pierre Gemayel was born on 6 November 1905 in [[Bikfaya]], Lebanon into a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCCpUI6rYlc|title=شيخ بيار الجميل|publisher=You Tube|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father Amine Bachir Gemayel, known as Abou Ali, and his uncle were forced to flee to [[Egypt]] after being [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in 1914 for opposing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, returning to Lebanon only at the end of [[World War I]].

Gemayel was educated at [[Jesuit]] school. He went on to study pharmacy&lt;ref name=day30aug/&gt; at the French faculty of medicine in [[Beirut]], where he later opened a pharmacy. He owned a pharmacy in [[Haifa]], Palestine. The pharmacy was located in Sahat Al Hanatir (Carriage Square).

He also took an interest in sport, and attended the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic games]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Fisk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisk|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Fisk|title=Pity The Nation|year=2002|publisher=Nation Books|pages= 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Entelis1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Pierre Entelis|title=Pluralism and Party Transformation in Lebanon: Al-Kataʼib, 1936-1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bAfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=22 October 2012|year=1974|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03911-7|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the games, he also visited various Central European countries.&lt;ref name=Entelis1974/&gt;

==Foundation of Kataeb Party==
On his return to Lebanon later that year, Gemayel founded [[Kataeb Party|Al Kataeb Al Loubnaniyyah]] party (Phalangist Party a.k.a. Kataeb Party) with Georges Naqqache, Charles Helou, Chafic Nassif and Hamid Franjieh, who was later replaced with Emile Yared, modelling the party after the Spanish and Italian Fascist parties he had observed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/85.htm|title=Lebanon - Phalange Party |website= CountryStudies.us|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Michael |last= Johnson| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Zydtz0dDntQC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=lebanon+phalange+fascism | title=All honorable men: the social origins of war in Lebanon | publisher= I.

The foundation of [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party|the Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] by [[Antun Saadeh]] in 1932 was the trigger for the establishment of the Kateb Party, since the former actively tried to influence Lebanon towards the Syrian interests, leading to direct challenge for Lebanese nationalists.&lt;ref name= Entelis1974 /&gt; The founders of the Kataeb Party were young, French-educated and middle-class professionals who committed to independent and Western-oriented Lebanon.&lt;ref name= Entelis1974 /&gt; [[Charles Helou]], who later served as Lebanon's President from 1964 to 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=2aF6PSJLs_sC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=charles+helou+serves+as+a+president&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY6qSOxK_XAhXE1hoKHS6eDckQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20helou%20serves%20as%20a%20president&amp;f=false|title=Leaders et partisans au Liban|last=Mermier|first=Franck|last2=Mervin|first2=Sabrina|date=2012|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|isbn=9782811105952|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was one of the founders. By the time of his presidency, however, Helou was no longer a party member, and Gemayel unsuccessfully opposed him in the presidential election of 1964.

==Career==
In the years before and after Lebanon's independence, Gemayel's influence and that of the Kataeb Party was limited.  It survived a French attempt to forcibly dissolve it in 1937 and took part in an uprising against the French Mandate in 1943, but despite its membership of 35,000, it operated on the fringes of [[Politics of Lebanon|Lebanese politics]].  It was not until the [[Lebanon Crisis of 1958|Civil War of 1958]], that Gemayel emerged as a leader of the far right-wing separatist (mainly Christian) movement that opposed a [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] and [[Arab nationalism|Arab-nationalist]] inspired attempt to overthrow the government of president [[Camille Chamoun]] and supported the return of foreign troops to Lebanon. In the aftermath of the war, Gemayel was appointed a [[cabinet (politics)|cabinet minister]] in a four-member Unity government. Two years later, Gemayel was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]], from a Beirut constituency, a seat he held for the rest of his life. In 1958, Gemayel was appointed deputy to then prime minister [[Rashid Karami]].&lt;ref name=tdr14oct&gt;{{cite news|title=New cabinet in Lebanon civil strife|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q20rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mdkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3592,725050&amp;dq=pierre+gemayel&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Reporter|date=14 October 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1960s, the Kataeb Party held 9 seats in the National Assembly, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon's notoriously fractured and sectarian parliament. Although his bids for the [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|presidency]] in 1964 and 1970 were unsuccessful, Gemayel continued to hold cabinet posts intermittently throughout the remaining quarter-century of his life. For instance, he was minister of public works in 1970.&lt;ref name=tsr28mar&gt;{{cite news|title=Guerrillas, Arab militia in shootout|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=30VWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=a-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4757,3864353&amp;dq=pierre+gemayel&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=28 March 1970|agency=AP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:William Hawi, Chief of the Kataeb Security Council, and Pierre Gemayel.jpg|thumb|200px|Pierre Gemayel with [[William Hawi]], Chief of the [[Kataeb]] Security Council]]
Lebanon has long been a battleground in the [[Israeli-Arab conflict]], and Gemayel's position was always solid and consistent advocating a Lebanon separated from the other Arab states and linked to France and the West. He opposed the presence of the [[Palestinian refugee]]s. His supporters viewed this as a sign of strength and patriotism, while his detractors saw it as incoherent. Gemayel reluctantly signed the [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo Agreement]] of 1969 under enormous pressure from the international community, which allowed [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] guerrillas to set up bases on Lebanese soil, from which to carry out actions against [[Israel]]. He later defended his actions, saying that Lebanon really had no choice. In the 1970s, he came to oppose the armed Palestinian presence in Lebanon. The Kataeb created a military Security Council led by [[William Hawi]], which came to be commanded by Gemayel's son [[Bachir Gemayel|Bachir]] upon the assassination of Hawi.

Gemayel was also to reverse his position on The [[Syria]]n intervention in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975 to 1990. He initially welcomed [[Syria]]n intervention on the side of the Christians and against the [[Lebanese National Movement]], but he soon became convinced that Syria was occupying Lebanon for reasons of its own. In 1976, he joined other mainly Christian leaders, including former president [[Camille Chamoun]], the diplomat [[Charles Malik]], and the [[Guardians of the Cedars]] leader [[Étienne Saqr]], to oppose the Syrians. On 11 October 1978, Gemayel bitterly denounced the Syrian military presence, and the [[Lebanese Front]] joined the [[Military of Lebanon|Lebanese regular army]] in a successful "[[Hundred Days War]]" against the Syrian army.

==Later years and death==
Gemayel saw his younger son, [[Bachir Gemayel]], elected president of Lebanon on 23 August 1982, only [[Bachir Gemayel#Assassination|to be assassinated]] on 14 September, nine days before his scheduled inauguration.

== Biography ==
Raymond Mailhat was born on 28 March 1862 in [[Saurat]] ([[Ariège (department)|Ariège]]), the son of Jean Benjamin Mailhat,&lt;ref name=LdH&gt;[http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH135/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL1692016v001.htm Légion d’honneur file, Raymond Augustin Jean Baptiste Mailhat’ cote LH/1692/16.]&lt;/ref&gt; an illiterate shoemaker.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;[http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2016JAHHvol19/2016JAHH...19..106T.pdf William Tobin "Evolution of the Foucault-Secretan Reflecting Telescope.” ''Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage'', 19(2), 106–184 (2016).]&lt;/ref&gt; After studying under Paul Gautier (1842-1909),&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96422725/f649.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1900, n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond became the director of the Secrétan company’s optics workshop in Paris on 1 January 1889. In 1894, Mailhat bought part of those workshops and established his own business.&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt; The Maison Mailhat manufactured a wide variety of equipment for both scientists and amateurs:&lt;ref name=Bulletin1908&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96331256/f763.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1908, p. III]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fabra Observatory Refractor.jpg|thumb|Mailhat 38 cm refracting telescope at the [[Fabra Observatory]] (telescope built in 1904)]]
* [[Optical telescope|Astronomical]] and [[Camera lens|photographic]] lenses

The company furnished optical instruments to the [[Paris Observatory]], the Faculté des Sciences de Paris, the [[Bureau des Longitudes]], the [[Camille Flammarion Observatory]] in Juvisy, the [[Société Astronomique de France]], French government ministries, several observatories in France and in other countries, [[Meteorological Station|meteorological stations]], bridge and road engineers, railroads, and mines. It won a gold medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96422725/f649.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1900, n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9633648x/f511.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1903, n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulletin1908 /&gt;

Mailhat became a member of the [[Société astronomique de France]] in 1888 (only one year after it was established). At the time when he joined, he was a constructor-mechanic, residing at 5, passage Stanislas, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9628847g/f20.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1888, p. 14.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mailhat served on the society's management council in 1894 (and again in 1912)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96228325/f174.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1895, p. 158.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96263170/f168.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1916, p. 150.]&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements for his company's telescopes appeared regularly in the pages of the [[L'Astronomie (magazine)|society’s bulletin]].

The Maison Mailhat and its fellow Paris-based competitors the [[Secretan (company)|Secrétan]] and [[Denis Albert Bardou|Bardou]] companies were among the leading French precision optics manufacturers of the early twentieth century. Mailhat telescopes and optical products were widely exported to [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and even further afield.  

[[Ferdinand Quénisset]] used Mailhat lenses for early photographs of Mars in 1899 at the [[Camille Flammarion Observatory]] in Juvisy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9626564b/f194.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1899, p. 178.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1908, the company’s offices and workshops moved to 10, rue Emile-Dubois Paris, close to the Paris Observatory.&lt;ref name=Bulletin1908 /&gt; The following year, Mailhat sold his company to Francis Mouronval (1881-1954).&lt;ref name=Tobin /&gt; Mouronval continued to produce and sell telescopes under the Maison Mailhat name for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9626551q/f360.item Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France, 1911, p. 332.]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mouronval's mobilisation durign the [[World War II]], he publicly announced in 1916 that the Mailhat-Mouronval company was closed "for the duration of the war". This closure appears to have been definitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96263170/f500.item Bulletin de la Societe Astronomique de France, 1916, p. II.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, Mailhat served as ‘’Officier de l’administration de 3e classe territorial’’ in the [[Service Technique de l'Aéronautique|Service des fabrications de l'aviation]] (military aircraft manufacturing). For his contribution to the war effort, he received the [[Legion of Honor|Légion d’Honneur]] in 1918.&lt;ref name=LdH /&gt;

Mailhat died on 22 April 1923 at his home at 13, rue Boileau in [[Montrouge]] ([[Seine (department)|Seine]]).&lt;ref name=LdH /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Sara Benetowa''', later known as '''Sula Benet''' (1903–1982), was a [[Poland|Polish]] anthropologist of the 20th century who studied Polish and [[Judaic]] customs and traditions.

==Biography==
Born in Poland, Benet was fascinated with peasant culture of Poland since her early youth.  This interest eventually led her to enroll as a student of literature and philosophy in the Faculty of Humanities in the [[University of Warsaw]], graduating with a degree in [[anthropology]]. Upon receiving her degree in 1935, she attended graduate school at [[Columbia University]], where she received her [[doctorate]] in 1944. Also at this time (1936) she first made known at a seminar in Warsaw her theory that "calamus" in the Bible is hemp.&lt;ref&gt;Sula Benetova 1936 Le chanvre dans les croyances et les coutumes populaires. Comtes Rendus de Séances de la Société des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie XXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cannabis research==
Benet discovered that the Biblical plants or spices "kaneh" ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ez.]] 27:19; [[Book of Isaiah|Is.]] 43:24; [[Song of Songs|Ct.]] 4:14), "kaneh ha-tob" ([[Book of Jeremiah|Je.]] 6:20), and "kaneh-bosem" ([[Book of Exodus|Ex.]] 30:23), which are usually translated as "sweet [[Acorus calamus|calamus]]" or "sweet [[Arundo donax|cane]]", were actually [[hemp]]. "Kaneh-bosem" was an ingredient of the holy [[anointing]] oil:

{{Quote|text=30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus (Hebrew '''kaneh-bosem''') two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.|title=[[Book of Exodus|Ex.]] 30:22-25 | source=[[King James Version]]}}

This ingredient is, however, not mentioned amongst those prescribed in Ex. 30:34, from which the incense ([[ketoret]]) for the Temple was to be prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller]] | title=The Mineralogy and Botany of the Bible | series=The Biblical Cabinet | volume=27 | publisher=Clark | year=1840 | page=190 | url=https://archive.org/details/mineralogybotany27rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s documentary hypothesis, Ex. 30:23 belongs to a priestly (P) source, composed sometime between the 8th and the mid-6th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=[[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]] | entry=קָנֶה | title=Hebrew and English Lexicon | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1906 | page=889b | url=https://archive.org/details/hebrewenglishlex00browuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Richard Elliott Friedman | author2=Shawna Dolansky Overton | author3=Louis Isaac Rabinowitz | entry=PENTATEUCH | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=15 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=730–753 | isbn=0-02-865943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on similar words in cognate languages ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] śana, [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] qunnabu, [[Persian language|Persian]] kenab, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] kanab) Benet concluded that "kaneh" and "kaneh-bosem" refer to hemp. In many ancient languages, including Hebrew, the root "kan" had a double meaning, both hemp and reed. The error originated from the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, [[Septuagint]], in the third century B.C., where the terms "kaneh" and "kaneh-bosem" had been (mis)translated as "sweet kalamos". In the many Bible translations that followed, including [[Martin Luther]]'s, the same error was repeated. Benet further claimed that the [[Scythians]], who were described by [[Herodotus]] as ritual hemp users in the fifth century B.C., were at least one millennium older than has been previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Vera Rubin | editor2=Lambros Comitas | title=Cannabis and Culture | author=Sula Benet | contribution=Early Diffusions and Folk Uses of Hemp | publisher=Moutan | year=1975 | pages=39–49 | url=https://www.xn--4dbcyzi5a.com/wp-content/PDF/EARLY-DIFFUSION-AND-FOLK-USES-OF-HEMP-SULA-BENET.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulah Benet's claim has found increased support in the academic community among lexicographers and botanists. The standard reference lexicons of Biblical Hebrew, and reference works on Hebrew Bible plants by scholars such as University of Jerusalem botanist [[Michael Zohary]] mention Benet's suggestion, while others argue the word refers to an either different species of hemp or a different plant entirely. [[Olof Celsius|Celsius]] (Hierobotanicon) has suggested [[sweet flag]] ([[Acorus calamus]]), which grows in Egypt, Judaea, and Syria, containing in its stalk a soft white pith with an agreeable aromatic smell, and forming an ingredient of the richest perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=[[John McClintock (theologian)|John McClintock]] | editor2=[[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] | entry=Calamus | title=[[Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature]] | volume=2 | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | year=1891 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Forbes Royle|Royle]] identified the "sweet cane" ([[King James Version|A.V.]]) of Scripture (Is. 43:24; Je. 6:20) with the [[Andropogon calamus]], a plant extensively cultivated in India, from which an oil, deemed to be the famous [[spikenard]] of antiquity, is extracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=[[John McClintock (theologian)|John McClintock]] | editor2=[[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]] | entry=Cane | title=[[Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature]] | volume=2 | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | year=1891 | pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pierre Edmond Boissier|Boissier]] (Flora Orientalis), "kaneh" was the common marsh reed, [[Arundo donax]] [[Linnaeus|L]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=[[Isidore Singer]] et al. | author1=[[Emil G. Hirsch]] | title=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] | entry=REED | volume=10 | year=1906 | page=346b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biblical scholars and botanists believe that the qaneh is probably [[sugarcane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Ernest L. Abel | title=Marihuana, the first twelve thousand years | year=1980 | publisher=Springer | page=27 | url=http://files.meetup.com/18500005/Abel.%20marihuana%20the%20first%20twelve%20thousand%20years.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310021048/http://files.meetup.com/18500005/Abel.%20marihuana%20the%20first%20twelve%20thousand%20years.pdf | archivedate=2016-03-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hebrew, "kanebas", "kanebiys", "kanebos" ({{hebrew|קַנְבָּס, קַנְבִּיס, קַנְבּוֹס}}), derived from Greek "kannabis", first appear in the [[Mishnah]] ([[Kil'ayim (tractate)|Kilayim]] 2:5; 5:8; 9:1, 5, 7). The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Kilayim 9:5, 32d) notes that while in mishnaic times hemp was an important commodity because of the difficulty of cultivating linen, in the days of the [[Amoraim]] linen replaced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Marcus Jastrow]] | entry=קַנְבָּס, קַנְבִּיס, קַנְבּוֹס | title=A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature | publisher=Luzac | year=1903 | volume=2 | page=1388b | url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryoftarg02jastuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Jehuda Feliks | entry=HEMP | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=5 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | page=805 | isbn=0-02-865933-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Yeeling Evans-Wentz''' (February 2, 1878 &amp;ndash; July 17, 1965) was an American anthropologist and writer who was a pioneer in the study of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and in transmission of Tibetan Buddhism to the Western world, most known for publishing an early English translation of ''[[Bardo Thodol|The Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' in 1927. Today, Evans-Wentz is best known for four texts translated from the Tibetan: ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' (1927), ''Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa'' (1928), ''Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines'' (1935), and ''The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation'' (1954).

==Early life and background==
Walter was born as '''Walter Yeeling Wentz''' in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in 1878. His father Christopher Wentz (1836 - February 4, 1921) - born in Weissengen, Baden, Germany - had emigrated to America with his parents in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;https://lamesahistory.com/wp-content/uploads/LO_222_2001.pdf - "Wentz-Park House Landmarked, A Designated Historic Site" in ''Lookout Avenue'', Volume 22, Number 2 (Autumn 2001), p. 6 (La Mesa Historical Society)&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century (1900) Christopher was a real estate developer in Pablo Beach, Florida. Walter's mother (and Christopher's 1st wife) - Mary Evans Cook (died 1898) - was of Irish heritage. Christopher and Mary were married on August 11, 1862 in Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey. Christopher's 2nd wife (they were married on June 4, 1900 in Duval County, Florida) was Olivia F. Bradford (1863-1949). Walter had two brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web| title = The Hermit Who Owned His Mountain: A Profile of W.Y.

At age 24 Evans-Wentz went to [[Stanford University]], where he studied religion, philosophy, and history and was deeply influenced by visitors [[William James]] and [[W. B. Yeats]].&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow135"/&gt; He went on to receive B.A. and M.A degrees.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; He then studied [[Celtic mythology]] and folklore at [[Jesus College, Oxford]]&lt;ref name="sutin262"&gt;Sutin 2006, pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; (1907). He performed ethnographic fieldwork collecting [[fairy]] folklore in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. In 1911 Evans-Wentz published his degree thesis as a book, ''The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries''.&lt;ref name=david/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Evans-Wentz, W. Y. (Walter Yeeling), 1878-1965:Biographical History|publisher=University of Virginia|url =http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=evans-wentz-w-y-walter-yeeling-1878-1965-cr.xml| accessdate = 2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Oxford, he added his mother's Welsh surname [[Evans (surname)|Evans]] to his name, being known henceforth as Evans-Wentz.&lt;ref name="Lopez52"&gt;[[#Lo|Lopez, p. 52]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At Oxford, Evans-Wentz met archaeologist and British Army officer [[T.E. Lawrence]], who advised him to travel to the [[Orient]].&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow135"/&gt;

Thereafter, funded by his rental properties in Florida,&lt;ref name="Lopez52"/&gt; he started travelling extensively, spending time in [[Mexico]], [[Europe]], and the Far East. He spent the years of the [[First World War]] in [[Egypt]]. He boarded a ship from [[Port Said]], Egypt for [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] (then Ceylon).&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow136"/&gt; Here he started studying the history, customs and religious traditions of the country,&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow136"/&gt; and also collected a large number of important [[Pali]] manuscripts, which were later donated to Stanford University. Next in 1918, he travelled across [[India]], covering important religious sites, "seeking wise men of the east". He met spiritual figures like [[Yogananda]], [[J. Krishnamurti]], [[Paul Brunton]], [[Ramana Maharishi]], [[Sri Krishna Prem]] and [[Alfred Sorensen|Shunyata]]. He also visited the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]], where he met [[Annie Besant]] and Swami Shyamananda Giri (1911-1971).&lt;ref&gt;Swami Shyamananda Giri (May 4, 1911 - August 28, 1971) - AKA Yogacharya Binay Narayan. His name at birth was Binayendra Narayan Dubey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez52"/&gt;

Finally he reached [[Darjeeling]] in 1919;&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow136"&gt;[[#Ol|Oldmeadow, p. 136]]&lt;/ref&gt; there he encountered Tibetan religious texts firsthand, when he acquired a Tibetan manuscript of [[Karma Lingpa]]'s ''Liberation through Hearing during the Intermediate State'' (or ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'') from Major Campbell, a British officer who had just returned from Tibet. He next met [[Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup]] (1868&amp;ndash;1922), an English teacher and headmaster at Maharaja's Boys School,  in [[Gangtok]], [[Sikkim]]. Samdup had been with [[13th Dalai Lama]] during the latter's exile years in India in 1910; more importantly for Evans-Wentz, he had already worked as a translator with [[Alexandra David-Néel]], the Belgian-French explorer, travel writer, and Buddhist convert, and Sir [[John Woodroffe]], noted British Orientalist.&lt;ref name="Lopez52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow136"/&gt;

For the next two months, Evans-Wentz spent morning hours before the opening of the school with Samdup working on the text. During this period, they worked out the origins of what was to become ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Evans-Wentz soon left for the Swami Satyananda's [[ashram]], where he was practicing yoga. Samdup meanwhile was appointed as a lecturer at the [[University of Calcutta]], in the same year, and died in Calcutta three years later, long before the book could be finally published.&lt;ref name="Lopez53"&gt;[[#Lo|Lopez, p. 53]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]]. Evans-Wentz chose the title "Book of the Dead" because it reminded him of the [[Book of the Dead|Egyptian ''Book of the Dead'']]. For Westerners, the book would become a principal reference on Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow135"/&gt; Evans-Wentz credited himself only as the compiler and editor of these volumes; the actual translation was performed by Tibetan Buddhists, primarily Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup. Evans-Wentz's interpretations and organization of this Tibetan material is [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] controversial, being influenced by preconceptions he brought to the subject from Theosophy and other metaphysical schools.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez, Jr. ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography,'' Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This book was followed by ''Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa'' (1928),  also based on Samdup's translations. Evans-Wentz was a practitioner of the religions he studied.  He became Dawa-Samdup's "disciple" (E-W's term), wore robes, and ate a simple [[vegetarian]] diet.&lt;ref name="sutin263"&gt;Sutin 2006, pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1935, he met [[Ramana Maharshi]] and went to Darjeeling, where he employed three translators, Sikkimese of Tibetan descent, to translate another text which was published as ''Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Lopez54"/&gt;

Evans-Wentz intended to settle permanently in India, but was compelled by [[World War II]] to return to the U.S. There he would publish ''The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation'' in 1954. A final work, ''[[Cuchama]] and Sacred Mountains'' (1989), was published posthumously.

In 1946, he wrote the preface to Yogananda's well known ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', that introduced both Yogananda and himself to wider audiences in a book  which has been in print for over sixty-five years and translated into at least thirty-four languages.  Evans-Wentz remains best known his lasting legacy to [[Tibetology]].&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow135"&gt;[[#Ol|Oldmeadow, p. 135]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Walter Evans-Wentz' in: Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2013). ''The Illustrated Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. B00BCRLONM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
Evans-Wentz remained a [[Theosophist]] for the rest of his life, writing articles for Theosophical publications and provided financial support to the [[Maha Bodhi Society]], [[Self-Realization Fellowship]], and the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref name="Lopez54"&gt;[[#Lo|Lopez, p. 54]]&lt;/ref&gt; He lived for 23 years at the Keystone Hotel in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Lopez54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oldmeadow137"&gt;[[#Ol|Oldmeadow, p. 137]]&lt;/ref&gt; Evans-Wentz spent his last months at Yogananda's [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] in [[Encinitas, California]]&lt;ref name="Lopez54"/&gt; and died in July 1965. His ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' was read at his funeral.&lt;ref name="sutin 267"&gt;Sutin 2006, pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Department of Religious Studies at [[Stanford University]] has hosted "The Evans-Wentz Lectureship in Asian Philosophy, Religion, and Ethics" since 1969, funded by a bequest from Evans-Wentz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scbs.stanford.edu/ARC/archives/evans-wentz.html|title=Stanford Evans-Wentz Lectureship|author=|date=|website=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2018}}
