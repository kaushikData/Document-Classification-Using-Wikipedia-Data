'''''Abithana Chintamani''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] on [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature written by [[A. Singaravelu Mudaliar|A.Singaravelu Mudaliar]] (1855 - 1931). This is the first encyclopedia on Tamil literature.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The first edition, which contains a recommendation dated 1899 by [[V. Kanakasabai Pillai]], appeared in 1910 and contained 1050 pages. The second edition, containing 1634 pages, appeared [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1934, with a preface by the author's son, and is available as reprints.

==History==
The [[Madurai Tamil Sangam|Fourth Tamil Sangam]] was formed in [[Madurai]] on the 14 September 1901. It was founded by [[Pandithurai Thevar]] of the royal family of [[Sethupathis]] of [[Ramanathapuram]]. Thevar was planning to publish an encyclopedia on Tamil literature if some author agreed to do the job. Meanwhile, Singaravelu  Mudaliyar, a Tamil [[Pandit]] working at [[Pachaiyappa's College]], [[Chennai]] was preparing such a work, and had completed it. However he could not find a publisher for the work. Pandithorai Thevar heard about the work and supported the publication of the work financially.

In the preface Singaravelu Mudaliyar says
{{quote|After the completion of this work, as my income as a Tamil Pandit was not sufficient to publish this elaborate work, I showed the manuscript copies of the work to many wealthy and educated gentlemen in [[Madras]], who simply stated, without offering any help, that the publication would cost much. Then I thought of publishing it in monthly parts and to that effect published [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]] with specimen pages of my book. As very few joined as subscribers and as I feared that my attempt would be a failure, I gave up the idea.

While I was dejected and disheartened, one of my leaflets reached the hands of Sriman Pandithoraisamy Thevar, the [[President]]-[[Organizational founder|Founder]] of Madura Tamil Sangam and [[Zamindar]] of Palavanatham, [[Ramnad]]. He came to Madras, looked into some portions of the book and kindly consented to publish this work.

I shall not expatiate on the various troubles and difficulties that I have undergone in writing and publishing this work. The merit of this work is left to the judgement of those who may consult it as a book of reference whenever difficulties present themselves to them. My thanks are due to those gentlemen who have rendered me invaluable help with informations and with books and especially to Sriman Pandithoraisamy Thevar who has rendered me timely help in undertaking to publish this elaborate work. I wish him prosperity and success.&lt;ref&gt;More Details From Agathiyar Yahoo Groups: Written by Dr.S.Jayabarathi(JayBee), Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== IATA airline designator ==
'''IATA airline designators''', sometimes called '''IATA reservation codes''', are two-character codes assigned by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) to the world's [[airline]]s.  The standard is described in IATA's ''[[Standard Schedules Information Manual]]'' and the codes themselves are described in IATA's ''Airline Coding Directory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/publications/store/Pages/airline-coding-directory.aspx|title=IATA - Airline Coding Directory|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Both are published twice-annually.) 

The IATA codes originally based on the ICAO designators which were issued in 1947 as two-letter airline identification codes (see the section below). IATA expanded the 2-letter-system with codes consisting of a letter and a digit (or vice versa) after ICAO had introduced its current 3-letter-system in 1982. Until then only combinations of letters were used. 

Airline designator codes follow the format '''xx(a)''', i.e., two alphanumeric characters (letters or digits) followed by an optional letter. Although the IATA standard provides for three-character airline designators, IATA has not used the optional third character in any assigned code. This is because some legacy computer systems, especially the "central reservations systems", have failed to comply with the standard, notwithstanding the fact that it has been in place for 20 years.  The codes issued to date comply with IATA Resolution 762, which provides for only two characters.  These codes thus comply with the current airline designator standard, but use only a limited subset of its possible range.

There are three types of designator: unique, numeric/alpha and controlled duplicate.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

IATA airline designators are used to identify an airline for commercial purposes in reservations, [[Airline timetable|timetables]], [[Airline ticket|tickets]], [[tariff]]s, [[air waybill]]s and in [[Airline teletype|telecommunications]].

A '''flight designator''' is the concatenation of the airline designator, '''xx(a)''', and the numeric [[flight number]], '''n(n)(n)(n)''', plus an optional one-letter "operational suffix" '''(a)'''. Therefore, the full format of a flight designator is '''xx(a)n(n)(n)(n)(a)'''.

After an airline is delisted, IATA can make the code available for reuse after six months and can issue "controlled duplicates". Controlled duplicates are issued to regional airlines whose destinations are not likely to overlap, so that the same code is shared by two airlines. The controlled duplicate is denoted here, and in IATA literature, with an asterisk ('''*'''). An example of this is the code "7Y", which refers to both [[Mid Airlines]], a charter airline in [[Sudan]], and [[Med Airways]], a charter airline in [[Lebanon]].

IATA also issues an accounting or prefix code.  This number is used on tickets as the first three characters of the ticket number.

== ICAO airline designator ==
[[File:IATA Flight coupon Stock no.jpg|thumb|right|ek220px|[[IATA]] [[Flight coupon]] stock control number]]
The '''ICAO airline designator''' is a code assigned by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) to aircraft operating agencies, aeronautical authorities, and services related to international aviation, each of whom is allocated both a ''three-letter designator'' and a ''telephony designator''. These codes are unique by airline, unlike the IATA airline designator codes (see section above). The designators are listed in ICAO Document 8585: ''Designators for Aircraft Operating Agencies, Aeronautical Authorities and Services''. 

ICAO codes have been issued since 1947. The ICAO codes were originally based on a two-letter-system and were identical to the airline codes used by IATA. After an airline joined IATA its existing ICAO-two-letter-code was taken over as IATA code. Because both organizations used the same code system, the current terms ICAO code and IATA code did not exist until the 1980s. They were commonly called two-letter-airline-designators. At this time it was impossible to find out whether an airline was an IATA member or not just by looking at its code. In the 1970s the abbreviation ''BA'' was the ICAO code and the IATA code of [[British Airways]] while non-IATA-members like [[Court Line]] used their 2-letter-abbreviation as ICAO code only. In 1982 ICAO introduced the current three-letter-system due to the increasing number of airlines. After a transitional period of five years it became the official new ICAO standard system in November 1987 while IATA kept the older 2-letter-system that was introduced by ICAO in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;jp aircraft markings, jp airlines-fleets international, Edition 1966 - Edition 1988/89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|pktCs24EgF0C&amp;pg|Yearbook of the United Nations 41.1987, Chapter X|page=1259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain combinations of letters, for example [[SOS]], are not allocated to avoid confusion with other systems. Other designators, particularly those starting with Y and Z, are reserved for government organizations.
The designator '''YYY''' is used for operators that do not have a code allocated.

An example is:
* Operator: [[American Airlines]]
* Three-letter designator: '''AAL''' (the original ICAO-two-letter-designator '''AA''' was officially used until 1987 and is also the IATA code of the airline)
* Telephony designator: '''AMERICAN'''

== Call signs (flight identification or flight ID)==
Most airlines employ a [[call sign]] that is normally spoken during [[airband]] radio transmissions. As by ICAO Annex 10 chapter 5.2.1.7.2.1 a call sign shall be one of the following types:

* '''Type A:''' the characters corresponding to the [[Aircraft registration|registration marking]] of the aircraft.
* '''Type B:''' the telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency, followed by the last four characters of the registration marking of the aircraft.
* '''Type C:''' the telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency, followed by the flight identification.

The one most widely used within commercial aviation is type C. The flight identification is very often the same as the flight number, though this is not always the case. In case of call sign confusion a different flight identification can be chosen, but the flight number will remain the same. Call sign confusion happens when two or more flights with similar flight numbers fly close to each other, e.g., KLM 645 and KLM 649 or Speedbird 446 and Speedbird 664.

The flight number is published in an airline's public timetable and appears on the arrivals and departure screens in the airport terminals. In cases of emergency, the airline name and flight number, rather than the call sign, are normally mentioned by the main news media.

Some call signs are less obviously associated with a particular airline than others. This might be for historic reasons ([[South African Airways]] uses the callsign "Springbok", hearkening back to the airline's old livery which featured a [[springbok]]), or possibly to avoid confusion with a call sign used by an established airline. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Companies' assigned names may change as a result of mergers, acquisitions, or change in company name or status; [[British Airways]] uses [[BOAC]]'s old callsign ("[[Speedbird]]"), as British Airways was formed by a merger of BOAC and [[British European Airways]]. Country names can also change over time and new call signs may be agreed in substitution for traditional ones. The country shown alongside an airline's call sign is that wherein most of its aircraft are believed to be registered, which may not always be the same as the country in which the firm is officially incorporated or registered. There are many other airlines in business whose [[radio]] call signs are more obviously derived from the trading name.

The callsign should ideally resemble the operator's name or function and not be confused with callsigns used by other operators. The callsign should be easily and phonetically pronounceable in at least English, the international language of aviation. For example, [[Air France]]'s callsign is "Airfrans"; 'frans' is the phonetic spelling of 'France'.

== Accounting number or prefix code ==
The airline accounting code, or prefix code, is a 3-digit number, referenced by IATA and unique among all the airlines, used to identify the airline in various accounting activities such as ticketing. For instance, [[Lufthansa]] (LH/DLH) has been assigned 220 as accounting code, and all the flight tickets issued by that airline start with "220-".
The IATA code search page&lt;ref name="iata-code"&gt;{{cite-web|title=IATA code search|url=https://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; references the accounting code for every airline having one.

The '''Akhbari'''s ({{lang-ar|اخباري}}) are [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]]s who reject the use of reasoning in deriving verdicts, and believe Quran and Hadith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akhbari.com|title=Akhbari|website=www.akhbari.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Akhbari (from ''khabara'', news or report) is usually used in contrast to [[Usuli]] (from ''Uṣūl al-fiqh'', principles of Islamic jurisprudence).  Unlike Usulis, Akhbaris do not follow or do [[Taqleed]] of a Mujtahid the ''[[Marja'|marja‘]]''s (models for imitation) who practice modern form of [[ijtihad]] (independent legal reasoning) consequently they do not accept [[Usul al-fiqh]]. Akhbaris perform Taqleed of '''Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]''' the Twelfth Imam of Shias who is in [[the Occultation]]. They say Taqleed is permissible when it is performed of an infallible [[Hujja]], whereas they consider Taqleed to be forbidden when it is performed of a Non Infallible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akhbari.org/English/aau.htm|title=Welcome to Akhbari.com|website=www.akhbari.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Usulis, Akhbaris believe in the perpetuity of [[Sharia]] from only the infalibles, so on, the right to interpretate the Quran is only to 14 inflalibles who have complete in-depth gnostic knowledge (Rasekhuna fil ilm,) whereas the former believes in the development of jurisprudence with time 'Uṣūl al-fiqh',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/message-thaqalayn/vol-12-no-4-winter-2012/stages-development-shia-jurisprudence-sayyid-mahmud|title=The Stages of Development of Shi&amp;amp;#039;a Jurisprudence|website=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to this reason Akhbaris seek religious rulings or Islamic jurisprudence [[Fiqh e Jafaria]] from a dead or living [[Muhaddith]], who has narrated or narrates the rulings [[hadith]] of [[The Fourteen Infallibles]] without interpreting it. 
Further Akhbaris say that [[The Fourteen Infallibles]] or Shia [[Imamah (Shia Twelver doctrine)|Imāms]] never permitted [[Ijtehad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/guided/24.html |title=Our Misfortune Regarding Ijtihad Against the Texts &amp;#124; Then I was Guided &amp;#124; Books on Islam and Muslims |publisher=Al-Islam.org |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KUM/20/16|title=History of Khalifa Umar bin al-Khattab - Testament and Assessment of Umar  - Section 16 - Islamic History - Alim|website=www.alim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Usulis and Akhbaris use the same Hadiths, they difer in many aspects as the later one only use the sacred scriptures as sole sources. Akhbaris believe the most important aspect of the religion is to gain spiritual knowledge about the mystical light and divinity of Muhammad and Ali (Ma'rifat Nooraniya), while Usulis believe it is just a verbal meaning, as well as Akhbaris believe salvation is only through deep love and affection for Imam Ali and through gaining knowledge of his divinity and not by external practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akhbari.org/English/aau.htm|title=Welcome to Akhbari.com|website=www.akhbari.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Akhbaris believe no one can give religious rules until the return of the Mahdi as the saviour of humanity.

Akhbari nowadays form a minority within Shia Islam, with [[Usuli]]s making up the majority. Akhbarism "crystalized" as a distinct movement with the writings of [[Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi]] (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and early post-Safavid era.  However, shortly thereafter [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (d. 1792), along with other Usuli [[mujtahid]]s, crushed the Akhbari movement.&lt;ref name="momen222"&gt;{{Citation

==Background==
Akhbaris consider themselves to be bounded by the [[Hadith of the two weighty things]], where the Prophet [[Muhammad]] instructed his followers to follow the [[Quran]] and [[Ahl al-Bayt]]. Therefore, even for new events occurring during the [[Major Occultation]], Akhbaris continue to follow traditions of Ahlul Bayt, as per the saying of Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] where he said "As for the new events, which will occur (during my occultation) turn to the narrators of our traditions, because they are my proof to you, while I am the proof of Allah to them"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bahar al-Anwar]] Vol.53, P.181&lt;/ref&gt; Akhbari reject [[fatwa|fatāwa]] based on ''[[ijtihad]]'', they also reject the permissibility of writing [[exegesis]] of the Qur'an without quoting the narrations of the infallible [[Ahl al-Bayt|''Ahlu l-Bayt'']]. Akhbari quote the ''Hadith ath-Thaqalayn'' and several authentic traditions of the Twelve Imāms to prohibit the practice of exegesis. Akhbaris do not believe in generalization of [[Hadith]], they say [[Hadith]] is either right or wrong;&lt;ref name="AḴBĀRĪYA"&gt;{{cite web|last= Kohlberg|first=E|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/akbariya|title=AḴBĀRĪYA|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; further they believe that [[Hadith]]s compiled in [[The Four Books]] of [[Shia]]s are reliable.
It is reported that Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]] acknowledged [[Kitab al-Kafi]] (which is among [[The Four Books]] of [[Shia]]s) and said "'''al-Kafi is sufficient for our Shia (followers)'''".&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter8/2.html |title=Belief of Shi'a in the Completeness of Qur'an &amp;#124; A Shi'ite Encyclopedia &amp;#124; Books on Islam and Muslims |publisher=Al-Islam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where Usulis doubt the credibility of this saying as author of [[Kitab al-Kafi]] never quoted the same.&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"/&gt;
In short, the gist of Akhbārī ideology is that nothing but the aḥadīth of the Infallible can serve as authoritative evidence in Islam. Akhbārīs also differ from Usūlīs in their rejection of the ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]]'', arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics,  clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam.

Usūlism evolved on the basis of [[Usul al-fiqh]] (the hypothetical concepts and perceptions of some scholars) centuries after the major occultation. Among the earliest Shī‘a ''ulamā''' such as [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]] and Ibn Babawaiyya, the most important activity was transmission of a ḥadīth.&lt;ref name="momen185"&gt;{{Citation

At this time, the Shī‘a distinguished themselves from the [[Sunni]] in the category of law, which employed such methods as [[qiyas]] "analogical reasoning" and exegesis". However, the Shī‘a developed law directly from the traditions of the Imāms.&lt;ref name="momen185"/&gt;

Initially during the [[Buyid]] period, the Twelver ulamā' considered that since the Imām had gone into [[The Occultation|Occultation]] and his ''Nā'ib al-Khass'' was no longer present, all the functions invested in the Imām had lapsed. The principal functions of the Imām had been:
#Leading the Holy War (jihad)
#Division of the booty (qismat al-fay)
#Leading the Friday Prayer ([[List of Islamic and Muslim related topics|salat al-juma]])
#Putting judicial decisions into effect (tanfidh al-ahkam)
#Imposing legal penalties (iqamat al-hudud)
#Receiving the religious taxes of [[zakat|zakāt]] and [[khums]].&lt;ref name="momen189"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it soon became apparent that the situation caused by the lapse of functions of the Hidden Imām was extremely impractical and left the Twelver Shī‘a community at a great disadvantage, with no leadership, no organization and no financial structure.&lt;ref name="momen189" /&gt;

==History==
Akhbaris contend that, over the course of the history of Twelver Shi'ism since the Occultation, Usuli ulama have progressively usurped more and more of the functions of the Hidden Imam. They distinguish five stages in this usurpation.

===First transgression===
As early as the 5th century A.H. / 11th century CE, more than 150 years after the Occultation of the 12th Imām, Shaykhu t-Ta'ifa reinterpreted the doctrine to allow delegation of the Imām's judicial authority to those who had studied ''fiqh''. Although he implies in his writings that this function should only be undertaken by the ulama if there is no one else to do it.

Shaykhu t-Taifa considered the ulamā' the best agents of the donor to distribute religious taxes since they knew to whom it should be distributed. Nevertheless, individuals were free to do this themselves if they wished. He allowed ''fuqahā''' to organize Friday prayers in absence of the Imām or his special representative.

The prominent Shī‘a scholars who rejected this thesis were:
#`Alam al-Huda
#Ibn Idris
#[[Allama Hilli|Allamah al-Hilli]]&lt;ref name="momen189"/&gt;

It is to be noted that `Alam al-Huda was from among the Shaykhu t-Taifa's group.

===Second transgression===
By the 13th century, Muhaqqiq al-Hilli was able to advance these concepts very considerably. He extended the judicial role of the ulama to ''iqamat al-hudud'' the imposition of penalties by ulama themselves. In his writings it is possible to see the evolution in his thinking whereby the [[fuqaha|fuqahā']] develop from the deputies of the donor for the distribution of religious taxes in his early writings to being the deputies of the Hidden Imām for collection and distribution of the taxes in his later works.&lt;ref name="momen190"&gt;Pg. 190, An introduction to Shi'i Islam, [[Moojan Momen]].&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, transgressing the limits set by Shaykhu t-Taifa (two centuries earlier) in his first transgression.

===Third transgression===
Muhaqqiq al-Karkhi (About 300 years after the second transgression) was the first to suggest, arguing from the hadith of ‘Umar ibn Hanzala, that the ulama were the ''Nā'ib al-'Amm'' (general representative) of the Hidden Imām. But he restricted his application of this argument to the assumption of the duty of leading Friday prayers.&lt;ref name="momen190" /&gt;

===Fourth transgression===
It was Shahīd ath-Thānī who took the concept of Nā'ib al-'Amm to its logical conclusion in the religious sphere and applied it to all of the religious functions and prerogatives of the Hidden Imām. Thus the judicial authority of the ulamā' now became a direct reflection of the authority of the Imām himself. It was now obligatory to pay the religious taxes directly to the ulamā' as the trustees of the Imām for distribution and the donor who distributed these himself was considered to obtain no reward. This is in direct contradiction to limits set by prior transgressions.

Furthermore, Shahīd ath-Thānī extended the range of those eligible to receive money from ''zakāt'' to include religious students and the ulamā' themselves, who thus became the recipients of the money as trustees of students. Even in the field of defensive ''jihād'', Shahīd ath-Thānī identified a role for the ulamā'. Only in the field of offensive jihād did he allow that the role of Hidden Imām had lapsed pending his return.&lt;ref name="momen190" /&gt;

Although the aforementioned scholars were not ''mujtahids'' in their full capacity, they introduced innovative concepts into Shī‘a theology which later formed the basis of the exegetical school. Their innovations were sharply criticized by prominent Shī‘a scholars of their time and thus, remained mostly theoretical.

The traditional Shī‘a doctrine was, by its nature, fatal to leadership of any regime except that of Imām al-Mahdi since they believed that an Islamic state can be established only under the leadership of an infallible Imām. Thus, the Shī‘a had little role to play in supporting the decisions of the state, in contrast with the Sunni tendency of offering their full support to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

This caused a great deal of paranoia to the states where the Shī‘a were in majority. By the end of [[Safavid]] era the situation had become intense due to the rise of imperialism on a global scale. It was necessary to develop an alternate ideology for the survival of [[Iran]]ian state. This is when a group of ulamā' were encouraged to squeeze out the possibility of extending the state's control over the shia majority; by whatever means necessary.

The revival of Akhbārism, or "neo-Akhbārism" as it became known, was under the dean of Karbala scholarship, [[Yusuf Al Bahrani]] (1695–1772), who led an intellectual assault on Usuli thought in the mid-18th century. An Akhbārī critique of Usulism had emerged in Bahrain at the beginning of the 18th century, partly spurred by the weaknesses of the Usuli sponsoring Safavid empire.&lt;ref name="cole 58"&gt;

He rejected the Usuli principles of consensus (ijma`) and independent reasoning (`aql, ijtihad). Indeed, he questioned rationalist approaches to religion in general, quoting with approval a condemnation of reading philosophy and theosophy. But Shaykh Yusuf accepted the validity of Friday prayers in the Occultation and did not completely reject Usuli positions on other issues. His Bahrani neo-Akhbarism sought to be an intermediate path between extremist Usulism and extremist Akhbarism.&lt;ref name="cole53"&gt;{{Citation

===Bihbahani===
Under al-Bahrani, Usuli scholarship was considered impure but Bahrani was not politically influential, although his student, the famous Sheikh [[Al-Hurr al-Aamili]] in his book ''Amal al-amil'' writes "He was a mountain and ocean of knowledge, No one from among the previous scholars preceded his knowledge or reached his status". {Edit: This seems completely incorrect. The Al-Bahrani referred to in this quote is referring to Sayyid Hashim Al-Bahrani. However this article is relating it to another scholar; the previously mentioned Yusuf Bahraini, who died nearly a century after Sheikh Al-Hurr Aamili} It was [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani|Muhammad Baqir ibn Muhammad Akmal al-Wahid Bihbahani]] who challenged and defeated the Akhbaris and eventually became the most politically influential cleric in Karbala in 1772. Bihbahani's theology was not welcomed by the Akhbaris. Although this controversy had begun as a minor disagreement on a few points, it eventually grew into a bitter, vituperative dispute culminating in Bihbahani's declaration that the Akhbārīs were [[Apostasy in Islam|infidels]](Kuffar).&lt;ref name="momen127"/&gt; However, the dispute remained purely intellectual.

At first there was a large population of Akhbārī activists at the shrine cities of Iraq but it was Bihbahani who, at the end of the 18th century, reversed this and completely routed the Akhbārīs at [[Karbala]] and [[Najaf]]. South [[Iraq]], Bahrain and a few cities in Iran such as [[Kirman]] remained Akhbārī strongholds for a few more decades but eventually the Usuli triumph was complete and only a handful of Shī‘a ulamā' remained Akhbārī to the present day.&lt;ref name="momen127" /&gt;

After the theological coup brought about by al-Wahid Bihbahani by military methods, the Usuli school became instrumental to the Iranian regime.

===Fifth transgression===
During the first [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], [[Fath Ali Shah]]'s son and heir, [[Abbas Mirza]], who was conducting the campaign, turned to the new ulama and obtained from Shaykh [[Ja'far Kashif al-Ghita']] and other eminent clerics in Najaf and [[Isfahan]] a declaration of jihad against the Russians, thus implicitly recognizing their authority to issue such a declaration – one of the functions of the Hidden Imām. Kashif al-Ghita used the opportunity to extract from the state acknowledgment of the ulama's right to collect the religious taxes of [[Khums]]."&lt;ref name="momen191"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This followed the pattern of other transgressions by overthrowing the limits of its prior (fourth) transgression.

===Iranian Revolution===
Following the [[Iranian Revolution]], the Usūlī school has gained popularity among previously Akhbārī communities.&lt;ref name="Nasr" /&gt; Usuli clerical power reached its natural conclusion with control and domination of the state as promulgated through ''Vilayat al-Faqih'' under the authority of the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]].

== Rejection of the Mujtahids ==
Akhbārīs reject and even curse mujtahids. They practice this based on the last letter Imām Mahdi wrote to ‘Alī ibn Muhammad, fourth trusted follower of the Lesser Occultation. In the letter, Imām Zaman said:{{Quote|If someone claims himself as deputy of Imam during occultation he is a liar, ousted from Allah’s religion, calumniating Allah; he himself has gone astray and is leading others into error too. He will always be in loss. Be Curse unto him of mine, of Allah, of Allah’s Rasool (SW) and of his Progeny (AS) for every moment, and in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Bihar al-Anwar, Allamah Majlisi&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Akhbārīs claim that only the Imāms may be described as ''āyat Allah''s ([[Ayatollahs]], "signs of God") based on the ''Hadith-e-Tariq'',&lt;ref&gt;https://hubeali.com/khutbat/Hadith-e-Tariq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and that no one else has the right to ascribe this divine title to themselves. For example, the ''Hadith-i Tariq'' says: {{Quote|O Tariq, Imam (as) is the Kalama-t-Allāh [Word of God], Waj'ha-t-Allah [Face of God], Hijaba-t-Allah [Veil of God], Nūru-Allah [Light of God], Āya-t-Allah [Sign of God]}}
Historically it was only in the early 19th century that ordinary ''mujtahids'' began to describe themselves as 'Ayatollahs.'

==Debate==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}

===Pro-Akhbari===
#It can be noticed that the Usuli ulama have usurped one by one all the functions of the Hidden Imam, virtually ascribing themselves with his Imamate.
#Since the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|1953 Iranian coup]], the Usuli ulama have made countless transgressions from [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|Wilayat al-Faqih]] to unity among Muslims (or what might be called Islamic [[ecumenism]] at the cost of Shia beliefs). The convergence of these trends can be seen heading towards the [[caliphate]] of [[mujtahid]]een, although with a different naming scheme.
#The Usuli allegation that Akhbārism is a movement that started four centuries ago and was intellectually defeated is false.
#It is established that generalization that causes a fallible man's decision to gain the status of divine law is against the gist of Shia Islam. The Usuli appeal to "reason" ([['Aql]]) is similar to the Sunni [[qiyas]], though all early Shī‘a authorities are unanimous in rejecting ''qiyas'' (analogy).

===Anti-Akhbari===
Akhbārīs claim to follow Hadith directly, without the need for generalisation, or of finding the reason for the decision.  This, according to Usulis, is a logical impossibility. Hadith takes the form of case law, that is to say the narration of decisions taken in a concrete situation. To "follow" such a decision one must know which features of the situation are or are not relevant to the decision, as exactly the same set of facts will never occur twice. Therefore, some degree of generalisation is unavoidable, even on the most literal view: the choice is simply between mechanical generalisation and intelligent generalisation.

Regarding Islamic laws, there are various issues faced by Muslims in their daily lives. e.g. doubts in ''[[salat|namāz]]'' and their corrections, conditions which invalidate a fast and the relevant compensations, rulings vis à vis correctness or incorrectness of various social and business practices e.g. Investing in Mutual Funds, Use of alcohol based perfumes and medicines, etc. Yet, Akhbaris say that the Imams mentioned general-rules that we may use to know the ruling of modern issues.

The '''''Annales Posonienses''''' or '''Annals of Pressburg''' ({{lang-hu|Pozsonyi Évkönyv}}) are the only extant early medieval [[annals]] written in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].{{sfn|Kristó|1999|p=354}} However, they are rather a collection of notes which, as the historian [[Carlile Aylmer Macartney]] emphasizes, "hardly" deserves "the name of annals".{{sfn|Macartney|1953|p=84}} The annals contain short records of events occurring between 997 and 1203.{{sfn|Kristó|1999|p=354}} They are named after Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) where the ''[[Pray Codex]]''{{spaced ndash}}the manuscript preserving its text{{spaced ndash}}was held at [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Bratislava|St. Martin's Cathedral]] until 1813 by the [[collegiate chapter]].{{sfn|Kristó|1999|p=354}}

'''''Dell'Arcano del Mare''''' by [[Robert Dudley, styled Earl of Warwick|Sir Robert Dudley]] is a 17th-century maritime encyclopaedia, the sixth part of which comprises a maritime [[atlas]] of the entire world, which is the first such in print, the first made by an Englishman, and the first to use the [[Mercator projection]]. The work was first published in Italian at [[Florence]] in 1645 and 1646 in three [[Book size|folio]] volumes.

Among other things, it is remarkable for its inclusion of a proposal for the construction of a navy in five rates (sizes) which Dudley designed and described. It was reprinted in Florence in a two volume folio edition in 1661 without the charts of the first edition.

==Scope==
[[File:Arcano del Mare northern Portugal Anton Francesco Lucini Robert Dudley (1646).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Dell'Arcano del Mare'': chart of Portugal (Florence, 1646)]]

The six-part work covered [[navigation]], [[shipbuilding]] and [[astronomy]], with 130 [[map]]s in two volumes (nos. 2 and 6) . Unlike the vast majority of his contemporaries, Dudley's maps are all his own and were not copied from other mapmakers. They have an instantly recognisable style, closer to the pre-17th-century manuscript [[portolan chart]]s than the richly decorated maps of [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]], [[Hondius]] and [[Willem Blaeu|Blaeu]].

==Style==
The distinctive [[Baroque]] style of Dudley's charts is in part attributable to the elegant engraving of [[Antonio Francesco Lucini]].

Later map-makers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it remains unique in the annals of cartography. The engraving by [[Antonio Francesco Lucini]], who stated that he spent 12 years and used 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates, is of exceptional quality, as is the calligraphy.

==Individual maps==

===Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza===
"Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza" is a very large sea chart of southwest Africa from [[Cape Fria]] to [[Cape of Good Hope]], including [[Tristan da Cunha]].

===Carta Quarta Generale di Europa===
"Carta Quarta Generale di Europa", 1646 is one of the larger scale, generalised (Carta Generale) maps and shows the West coast of France, southward from [[La Rochelle]], and the Northern coast of Spain. This is the least ornate of the styles adopted by Dudley with no adornment other than the cartouche and a compass rose and fairly plain [[calligraphy]].

===Smaller scale maps===
Four additional maps represent the majority of the smaller scale, more specific (''Carta Particolare'') maps and include sailing ships, notes on prevailing winds and [[Ocean current|current]]s and more stylised calligraphy.

===Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia===
"Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia", 1646. According to Tooley, this map is the first separately printed map of Australia and is consequently of great value. It shows, in addition to the west side of the [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] peninsula, much of the island of [[New Guinea]]. By labelling the [[Torres Strait]] "Golfo Incognito" Dudley leaves open the question of whether New Guinea is connected to the Southern continent.

===Carta Particolare della Rio d' Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan===
"Carta Particolare della Rio d' Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan" of 1646 shows the mouth of the [[Amazon River]].

===Carta particolare che comincia con l' Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome....Clara e finisce con Il c. d' Aldeas===
"Carta particolare che comincia con l' Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome....Clara e finisce con Il c. d' Aldeas". This map of the shoreline of the African [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] includes an elegant cartouche, and islands off the coastline.

===Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco===
"Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco" reveals a strip of the southern [[Brazil]] coastline and includes [[São Paulo]] and the area later to become [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Noted for some of the most peculiar representations of mountains near the coastline found on any Dudley map.

[[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]] and a small portion of Brazil.

===Untitled, (N-E South America)===
The seventh map is one of only two in the atlas which have no title but instead dedications to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and, in this case, the Grand Duchess, Dudley's patrons. This is another double page map and probably comes from the 1646 edition. These two maps are probably different because they are the only ones where Dudley was able to use his own observations as they cover the North East coast of South America, the area he visited in 1594. This map shows the coasts of French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil. Considerably more elaborate than the others, this map includes soundings and numerous illustrations, namely: two ships, a [[canoe]], two magnificent [[sea monster]]s, a (?) [[cougar]] and two natives. It also has a legend stating that Monoa – more often known as [[El Dorado]] is only 12 days journey up-river from the coast.

'''''Ex parte Quayle''''', 25 [[United States Patents Quarterly|USPQ]] 74, 1935 C.D. 11; 453 O.G. 213 (Comm'r Pat. 1935) is a [[United States patent law]] decision. When a [[patent application]] is in condition for allowance, [[patent prosecution|prosecution]] on the merits is closed.  At this time, further amendments of the patent application are allowed only to correct formal objections, which typically include minor and obvious mistakes.  The presence of such formal objections precludes the full closing of prosecution; therefore, in these situations, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) issues an '''''Ex parte Quayle'' Office action''' requesting the applicant to correct the formal objections.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manual of Patent Examining Procedure]] § [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0700_714_14.htm#sect714.14 714.14].&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''Ex parte Quayle'' action has a shortened statutory period for reply that expires two months from the mailing date of the action.  This period can be extended by four additional months for up to a total period for reply of six months (with proper extensions and fees).

The on-line and free dictionary '''FREELANG'''  is a bilingual [[dictionary]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Founded in 1997 by Beaumont.

'''FREELANG''' is free{{Clarify|reason=NOT OPENSOURCE|date=April 2011}} but is under copyright of the authors, and it is collaborative.

== History ==
FREELANG Dictionary has it roots in the Dutch Dictionary Project, started in 1996 by [[Frits van Zanten]] and his friend [[Tom van der Meijden]]. The project initially consisted of electronic wordlists from Dutch to other languages, but with a team of volunteers around the world, they started to build web sites to distribute the program and some word lists based on their language expertise. In August 1997, the French version was hosted under the name of FREELANG, headed by the French Dutch Dictionary Project lead, Beaumont.

From 1998 to 2000, Frits and Tom progressively stepped out of the project. By the summer of 1998, the Dutch Dictionary Project team consisted of six members—Dario (Italy), Peter (Sweden), Vladimir (Russia), Tom (Norway), Gustaf (Denmark) and Beaumont (France)—who decided to continue with the venture. Vladimir, the Russian Dutch Dictionary Project lead, wrote new scripts to simplify the creation of new dictionaries. The Translation Help Service was created, offering free translations courtesy of a growing team of volunteer translators. In October 2001, both the English and Dutch versions of the Dutch Dictionary Project were brought under FREELANG. The current FREELANG site is managed by Beaumont, based in [[Bangkok|Bangkok, Thailand]] since October 2002. In April 2003, the Spanish version was brought under FREELANG. In a major website restructuring in May 2009, English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and Thai welcome pages were added, providing a portal to access the English, French and Spanish FREELANG sites.

== Language platform ==
The FREELANG operates four separate language websites: [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

Its fellow Dutch Dictionary Project versions include sites in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Esperanto]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. At the height of the Dutch Dictionary Project, sites in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] also existed.

== Services ==

=== Dictionary ===
Various language modules make up the core of the FREELANG dictionary. Language modules may be accessed through either the on-line interface page or off-line FREELANG dictionary program. While the on-line interface page accommodates all platforms, the off-line dictionary program to access the modules is currently available only for Microsoft Windows. The software is available in English (en), French (fr), Dutch (nl) or Spanish (es).

=== Translations ===
FREELANG Translation Help Service provides some translation services for free, as long at is not too long and not for a commercial purpose. The service is accessed through a request form and a volunteer translator replies via e-mail.

The '''Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''GISTBoK''') is a reference document produced by the [[University Consortium for Geographic Information Science]] (UCGIS) as the first product of its Model Curricula project, started in 1997 by [[Duane Marble]] and a select task force, and completed in 2006 by [[David DiBiase]] and a team of editors.

The ''GISTBoK'' is the most successful effort to date to create a comprehensive outline of the concepts and skills unique to the geospatial realm, including [[geographic information systems]], [[geographic information science]], [[remote sensing]], [[satellite navigation systems]], and [[cartography]].  However, it is missing some topics, such as [[geocoding]], and has significant granularity issues: large, mature subfields such as [[surveying]], [[GPS]], and [[remote sensing]] are covered in small sections, while the relatively immature field of [[geocomputation]] is granted an entire knowledge area.  There is also opposition to the document as a whole, especially from the [[critical GIS]] community, on the grounds that the discipline is too diverse and too subjective to be so easily encapsulated.  The editors have acknowledged these shortcomings, and have expressed hope that wider input on future editions will solve some of these issues.

The ''GISTBoK'' is intended to be used in a variety of applications, including curriculum design, educational assessment, educational program accreditation, professional certification, hiring practices, and project RFP's.  All of these activities are elements of the current trend toward regulation and standardization of the geospatial professions, and much of the opposition to the ''Body of Knowledge'' comes from those opposed to this trend, especially in academia, who feel that GIS&amp;T is too diverse, interdisciplinary, and subjective to be regulated.  One counterargument to this opposition is that the body of knowledge approach enables a flexible form of regulation that accommodates a diversity of skills and viewpoints.

The ''GISTBoK'' is patterned after the [[Computing Curricula]] project of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; and other model curriculum projects.  It is essentially a hierarchical outline, composed of Knowledge Areas, broken down into Units, further divided into Topics.  Each topic includes a list of 5–10 educational objectives that exemplify a person with varying levels of knowledge and skill. It does ''not'' include an encyclopaedic description of each topic.

The first edition was co-sponsored by UCGIS and several major vendors ([[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[Intergraph]], and GE [[Smallworld]]), and was published in August 2006 by the [[Association of American Geographers]].

The '''Government House''' is the [[List of official residences of Australia|vice-regal residence]] of the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Australia]], located on Conservatorium Road in the [[Sydney central business district]] adjacent to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]], overlooking [[Sydney Harbour]], just south of the [[Sydney Opera House]]. Constructed between 1837 and 1843, the property has been the vice-regal residence of the Governor since [[George Gipps|Sir George Gipps]], except for two brief periods; the first between 1901 and 1914, when the property was leased to the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] as the residence of the [[Governor-General of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Houses Trust|url=http://www.hht.net.au/museums/government_house/2|work=Government House Guide|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second from 1996 to 2011.

The property was returned as the Governor's residence in October 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/governor-marie-bashir-makes-a-grand-return-home-to-government-house/story-e6freuzi-1226160666275 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 October 2011 |title=Governor Marie Bashir makes a grand return home to Government House}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was managed by the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]] from March 1996 to December 2013.&lt;ref name="Government House"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governor.nsw.gov.au/government-house/ |work=Government House, Sydney |publisher=Governor of New South Wales |title=Government House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed in 1847 and constructed in the [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Free Gothic|Gothic revival style]], the building is listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

==History==
===1845–1901===
In 1835 the British Government agreed that a new Government House in Sydney had become a necessity, and the royal architect, [[Edward Blore]], was instructed to draw up plans. Construction commenced in 1837 and was supervised by colonial architect [[Mortimer Lewis]] and Colonel Barney of the Royal Engineers.&lt;ref name="pnsw-gh"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Governor of NSW: Government House  |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/ResourcesSystemTheGovernorofNewSouthWales#Section4  |work=Parliament of New South Wales  |publisher=NSW Government  |accessdate=10 December 2010  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128084410/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/resourcesSystemTheGovernorofNewSouthWales  |archivedate=28 January 2010  |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone, cedar, and marble for the construction were obtained from various areas of [[New South Wales]]. A ball in honour of the birthday of [[Queen Victoria]] was held in the new building in 1843, although construction was not complete. The first resident, Governor George Gipps, did not move in until 1845.&lt;ref name=pnsw-gh /&gt;

Government House, with its setting on Sydney Harbour, has a garden area of {{convert|5|ha|acre|spell=on}} and is located south of the Sydney Opera House, overlooking [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]]. It was designed in a romantic Gothic revival style{{spaced endash}}[[castellated]], [[crenellated]], [[turret]]ed and is decorated with oil portraits and the coats of arms of its successive occupants. Additions have included a front [[portico]] in 1873, an eastern [[verandah]] in 1879 and extensions to the ballroom and governor's study in 1900–01. From 1845 until 1901, the building served as the Governor's residence, office and official reception space.

===1901–1914===
Between 1901 and 1914, the building was used to house the new role of Governor-General, created by the [[Federation of Australia]]. During this period, three Governors of New South Wales occupied ''[[Cranbrook, Bellevue Hill|Cranbrook]]'', namely [[Harry Rawson]], [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford]] and [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14413987 |title=SOCIAL. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 October 1901 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14430503 |title=THE NEW GOVERNOR. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=4 February 1902 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the decision was taken to establish a residence for the Governor-General at [[Admiralty House, Kirribilli|Admiralty House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of Admiralty House, Sydney|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/official-residences/admiralty-house|publisher=[[Governor-General of Australia]]|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914–1996===
[[File:Sir Dudley de Chair, 1864 - 1958 (2733891381).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Governor [[Dudley de Chair|Sir Dudley de Chair]] (1924–1930) outside Government House, 17 March 1925.]]
From 1914 to 1996, the building again served as the residence, office and official reception space for the Governor of New South Wales.

===1996–2011===

However, in 1996, at the direction of the then [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Bob Carr]], the property ceased to be used as a residence, and the Governor's day office was relocated to the historic [[Chief Secretary's building]] nearby, at 121 [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]].&lt;ref name="pnsw-tgo"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Governor of NSW: The Governor's Office |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/ResourcesSystemTheGovernorofNewSouthWales#Section5 |work=Parliament of New South Wales |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=12 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128084410/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/resourcesSystemTheGovernorofNewSouthWales |archivedate=28 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1996 Carr announced that the next Governor, [[Gordon Samuels]], would not live or work at Government House. On these changes, Carr said ''"The Office of the Governor should be less associated with pomp and ceremony, less encumbered by anachronistic protocol, more in tune with the character of the people"''.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news |title= Editorial – A Governor on the side|newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 17 January 1996 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr later quipped that his decision had been "for [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Parliament of New South Wales| title=Hansard| location=Constitution Amendment (Office of Governor) Bill| publisher=Queen-in-Right-of-New-South-Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the Premier of a former state Labor Government that was dismissed by a Governor, [[Philip Game]], in 1932 during a constitutional crisis.

The state's longest-serving Governor, [[Roden Cutler|Sir Roden Cutler]], was also reported as saying:&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; 
{{blockquote|''"It's a political push to make way in New South Wales to lead the push for a republic. If they decide not to have a Governor and the public agrees with that, and Parliament agrees, and the Queen agrees to it, that is a different matter, but while there is a Governor you have got to give him some respectability and credibility, because he is the host for the whole of New South Wales. For the life of me I cannot understand the logic of having a Governor who is part-time and doesn't live at Government House. It is such a degrading of the office and of the Governor."''|[[Roden Cutler|Sir Roden Cutler]], 1996.}}

This move generated further controversy, as the proclaimed cost savings of over $2&amp;nbsp;million never materialised. The Auditor-General found it cost $600,000 more to maintain the building without a resident Governor; and public attendance decreased (resident Governors had maintained public access during their tenures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Humphries| first = David|title= Blow-out in costs for "empty" residence|newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 13 November 1997 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the group [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] to organise a protest, resulting in one of the largest marches in Sydney history: a crowd of 15,000 protested outside [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliament House]], blocking Macquarie Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Richards |first= George|title= Era ends as door closes on Governor's home|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 March 1996|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before Gordon Samuels' swearing-in, a petition bearing 55,000 signatures was handed in, calling on the Premier to reconsider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lunn |first=Stephen |title=Monarchists decry Carr's "republic by stealth" |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=1 March 1996|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hiatus of resident governor, Government House was consistently used for vice-regal purposes and remained the official reception space of the state, including as a key meeting venue of [[APEC Australia 2007]] in September 2007, at which time the political leaders of the 21 member states of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] met.

===2011–present===
In October 2011, the then Premier [[Barry O'Farrell]] announced that the then Governor, [[Marie Bashir]], had agreed with O'Farrell's offer to move back into Government House: ''"A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House. That's what it was built for ... [A]t some stage a rural or regional governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas"''. However, because Government House has not been a residence for fifteen years, O'Farrell also announced that the Governor will initially move into a smaller adjacent building, called the chalet, while refurbishments of the main wing occur, with a proposed move into the main house "before Christmas".&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/governor-marie-bashir-makes-a-grand-return-home-to-government-house/story-e6freuzi-1226160666275 |title=Governor Marie Bashir makes a grand return home to Government House |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2013, management of Government House was returned to the Office of the Governor from the managers since 1996, the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Government House"/&gt;

== Description ==
===Grounds===
Much of the 19th century character of the grounds remains. The grounds include private gardens as well as formal open areas.  Near the house (on its south-east side) is a giant Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), planted soon after the house's construction was completed. This tree is the surviving one of a former pair which stood either side of the terrace.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1&gt;Beattie, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The formal grounds of sweeping annual displays, manicured lawns, exotic trees and shurbs as well as the carriageways, paths and terraces provide a strong link with Sydney's colonial &amp; Victorian heritage.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AHC, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden maintains a distinctly 19th century character, drawing on Regency and Italianate styles, and featuring a collection of native and exotic species. Most changes to the garden were at the initiative of past governors and their wives, including Denison's five acre vegetable garden and Lady Game's much-loved project, the "Spring Walk". Some areas of the garden are true to their 19th century design, while others are more modern. Thoutsands of visitors enjoy the garden every year, both as public visitors and guests at functions ranging from garden parties for Royal visits, open days, award ceremonies and charity events. The garden is a crucial part of Government House - chef Christine Ware regularly sources honey (the current governor keeps bees), herbs and flowers for food servced at functions. Florist Marjan Medhat has also been known to use flowers and natural ephemera from the grounds in her floral displays, alongside potted plants grown in the greenhouse.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt;

The first private garden - the Western Terrace - sits around a rocky outcrop and knoll and features an extensive [[sandstone]] wall and plantings of olive trees.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

;Western terrace, 1836-1845
Lies inside the entrance gates to the left of the drive. This is the oldest part of the garden, established when the house was being built (1836-45)&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt;to provide screening and privacy for the house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-14&gt;Stuart Read, pers.comm., 26/5/2017&lt;/ref&gt; The evergreen trees planted here - many of them native species - were chosen to block out "disagreeable scenery", but the large two-level terrace also functioned as a pleasure garden.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt; The original sandstone walls, some of the gravel paths and plantings of olive trees and hedges survive. An evergreen or southern magnolia or bull [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] (M. grandiflora) dating from the 1859s is at the northern end of the terrace. The terrace was restored in 2000 by [[Sydney Living Museums]] (fmr. Historic Houses Trust of NSW).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

;Eastern terrace, 1869
The eastern terrace's design was laid out in 1869 and remains the main feature of the garden. From the house's [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] ([[colonnade]]) you can view across bisecting pathways lined with flowerbeds to a view of Sydney Harbour. Through Cook's pines (Araucaria columnaris) and other trees you can see Fort Denison, Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Garden Island and beyond.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt; Originally the view was wider to the east including towards the heads of the harbour).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-15&gt;Stuart Read, pers.comm, 26/5/2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Terrace has a central sandstone pond with its original stone [[fountain]]. Various garden schemes have been installed in the eastern terrace's formal garden borders flanking the central path.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-16&gt;Stuart Read, pers.comm., 27/8/2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt;

;Palm Grove, 1870s
North of the Eastern Terrace is the palm grove, established in the 1870s for the Countess of Belmore, wife of the 13th governor. Here native and exotic palms including the Lord Howe Island's Kentia (Howea fosteriana) and curly (H.belmoreana)(named for the governor) can be found.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-17&gt;Beattie, 2017, names and attribution: Stuart Read, 26/5/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt;

;Spring Walk, 1930s
Governor and Lady Game were both keen gardeners and Lady Game "set out to produce an outstanding array of trees, shrubs and planters". She established the Spring Walk on the southern end of the Eastern Terrace, where she supplemented surviving 19th century Camellia japonica cv's with new plantings of modern varieties. Surviving very old camellias include C.j.'Cleopatra Rosea' (pink) and "Wellbankiana" (white), some of which are over 100 years old. Wife of Governor Game's private secretary, writer Ethel Anderson, had this to say about Lady Game's garden:
'under the grey green olives, late daffodils still star the grass. Watsonias, double cheeries, magnolias, spieas, purple eupatoriums and primulas, set in a spring border among standard white wisterias form, like a sea... Lady Game's border - so lovely with pomegranites, bougainvilleas, cistus and Madonna lilies - keeps its date with beauty.'&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt; The entrance stones to the Spring Walk are said to be convict-made blocks from the first Government House built for Arthur Philip, now the site of the Museum of Sydney.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt; Like many houses of the time, Government House was self sufficient with kitchen gardens, orchards and farm animals.  The kitchen garden is now part of the Royal Botanic Gardens.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

;Official plantings
To the west of the [[driveway]] is a large paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendra)  and peppermint (Eucalyptus nicholli) planted by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1954 during the first visit of a reigning monarch to Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt; Many of the garden's trees are ceremonial plnatings. Among the roses on the Eastern Terrace the "Dame Marie Bashir Rose" can be found (bred in that Governor's honour), as well as the "Governor Macquarie" rose Dame Dr Bashir planted in 2009 as patron of the Rose Society of New South Wales. Dame Marie Bashir was just one of the many governors past and present wiht a passion for plants and their pollinators.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

;The Lodge {{circa|1846}}
One of two Gothic style buildings to have survived around Government House. It is a copy of a gurad house at Windsor Castle.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

;Gatehouse {{circa|1937}}
Brick gatehouse replacing an earlier timber one.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

;The Chalet {{circa|1890}}
Designed  by Colonial Architect W. L. Vernon, the chalet breaks with the Gothic  style of Government House. However, it has Tudor Gothic elements such as half timbered [[gables]] and broad brick [[chimneys]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

===House===
Government House is a Gothic Revival two storey building with crenellated battlements, [[Turret|turrets]], detailed interiors, extensive cellars and a porte cochere at the entrance. An open cloister on the east elevation forms a [[Veranda|verandah]] room which is supported by Gothic arches and forms an open [[balcony]] above.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt; The ground floor contains twelve rooms and the first floor contains thirteen bedrooms. It is built of stone with a slate roof, timber floors, unpainted cedar joinery and a stone flagged verandah. There are extensive staff offices and quarters.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

====Moveable Collection====
A collection of moveable heritage noted in theHistoric Houses Collection inventory as being of high and exceptional significance are also included in the State Heritage Listing. Item of exceptional significnace are those deemed to be rare  or oustanding and of major cultural or historic significance to NSW and Australia. Such items have a documented provenance to NSW Governors, their families and entourages from 1845 to the early 20th Century or with the first five Governors-General of Australia between 1901 and 1915. Items of high significance are objects considered to be rare or unusual and to have a cultural or historic significance to NSW. These objects date from 1845 through to the present and may contribute to the understanding of the house occupant s and use or through their connection to artists, architects, craftsmen or suppliers associated with the construction and decoration of Government House.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

=== Condition ===

== Heritage listing ==
As at 28 March 2013, Government House built in the early 1840s as the home of the monarch's representative and as the seat of power, symbolised British authority in the colony. Like the Governors themselves, the house is a powerful symbol of state.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

From the time of its completion, the house and its occupants were seen as the "pinnacle" of society, and the Governor and family as social exemplars, ideas that continued well into the twentieth century. Home to twenty four governors of New South Wales and their families, and the first five Governors-General, all chosen for their various pre-eminent positions, it reflects the many changes that have taken place in public and private life. Guests and visitors ranged from citizens paying their respects or receiving awards, to the reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, other members of the Royal family and other heads of states.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

The finest example of a castellated Gothic house in Australia, the house with its landscaped gardens reflected its English ties and was the model that inspired others. It is a grand ensemble of buildings, gardens and contents whose history and use are richly documented. Developments to the place over 150 years demonstrate changing tastes and social attitudes, and showcase the talents of leading architects, artists and craftsmen.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

Located in Governor Phillip's domain, it provides a tangible link with the earliest years of the colony, and is associated with the development of significant public places such as the Conservatorium (formerly its stables), Royal Botanic Gardens (formerly its grounds), and the Opera House.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

Government House in Sydney is significant as one of the two original official residences selected for the Governor-General following the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. Rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria led the Commonwealth Government to designate Government House in Sydney and Melbourne Government House as official residences of equal status for the Governor-General. The Sydney Government House served as the governor-general's Sydney Residence until 1912 when the NSW government sparked a major controversy by effectively evicting the governor-general.  The place is significant for its association with the first five occupants of the high office of Governor-General from the time of federation until 1912.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

A rare example of a great harbourside landscape estate virtually intact.  A typical 19th century 3-part estate landscape of park, parterre and pleasure grounds.  The formal grounds of sweeping annual displays, manicured lawns, exotic trees and shrubs as well as the carriageways, paths and terraces provide a strong link with Sydney's colonial and Victorian heritage&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

It is perhaps the last of the great harbourside estates to have survived relatively intact and to still be carrying on its original function; a combination of private residence, office complex and official function venue.  The garden is one of the oldest continually maintained gardens in Australia.  Whilst it has been altered to some extent over the years, it nevertheless provides an appropriately grand setting for the house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

The heritage significance of Government House at a State level is enhanced by the extraordinarily rich and diverse collection of moveable heritage ranging from furniture, paintings, ceramics, glassware textiles and sculpture to garden ornaments and kitchenalia dating back to the 1820s. It is a rare and intact collection of items with a ongoing and continuous association with the vice regal function and clearly demonstrates 150 years of changing style and taste. The collection is inherently linked to the house (and specific locations in the house). The comprehensive collection of portraits of NSW governors contains one of the earliest official portraits to be commissioned in NSW and Australia, that of Governor Thomas Brisbane by Augustus Earle. The collection of colonial furniture is significant and contains the most extensive collection of furniture by noted craftsman Andrew Lenham between 1845 and 1860 as well as furniture and other objects associated with colonial and international exhibitions and demonstrate excellence in local design, manufacturing and materials.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

Government House, Sydney was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 13 December 2011 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

This site replaced the original government house in 1845 as the seat of power and the symbol of the Crown and British authority in the colonial period. It was the seat of executive power under the constitution of New South Wales from 1856-1901 and 1915-1996. It can demonstrate its changing role as the seat of executive power, the residence of the Governors of New South Wales, and as an important place of State ceremony.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-20&gt;McGregor &amp; Associates 1997: 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

The site has close associations with the many Governors and Governors General who have resided there as well as the many international heads of state who have visited and stayed there. As the seat of British authority in NSW and Australia, Government House is significant for its important association with the British royalty, especially those who have been accommodated at the house including Prince Albert (who after being shot was treated and nursed back to health in the Drawing Room of Government House), the Queen Mother, the Prince of Wales, Charles and his late wife Diana, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips and most importantly, the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions. The historic significance of Government House is also enhanced through its association with those involved in its design and construction: Edward Blore, an eminent British architect who completed the original design of the house; Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis who adapted these plans to suit Australian conditions; James Barney who designed and supervised significant repairs and alterations to the house; and [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] who was also responsible for significant additions and repairs.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The quality of Edward Blore's design and detailing, and the degree to which his intent was realised in the finished house, resulted in a unique building for the colony. It remains the finest example of a castellated Gothic House in Australia. The Gothic style of the house and the character of its landscaped gardens were perceived to be quintessentially English and calculated to maintain the emotional ties between a distant colony and the motherland. It served as an inspiration for other Gothic buildings in Sydney including harbourside villas, and was also a model for the unrealisd Government House in [[Hobart]]. Furthermore, it was an impetus for the Gothic revival in Australia. The construction of such a large and sophisticated building was a major technical acievement for the time. It had a seminal influence in raising the standards of building and craftsmanship in the colony. The additions to the house by James Barnet and Walter. L.Vernon between 1870 and 1902, were notable examples of the later Victorian Gothic revival style. The Chalet is a fine example of an Arts and Crafts inspired style of domestic architecture and a forerunner of the Australian Federation style of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-21&gt;McGregor &amp; Associates 1997:258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The house was seen as a pinnacle of society and the roll of Governor as social "exemplar", ideas that continued well into the 20th century. The place can demonstrate the changing emphasis in the selection of Governor; from military, to career administrators, to aristocrats. By the end of the 19th century the role was perceived to be more social than political, and post-war Australian Governors were installed into this esteemed position. At each stage in its history, Government House was a place of work for personnel involved in the business of the Governor, in domestic service, in securing the site, or in the keeping of the grounds, most being resident on the site. The role of domestic servants, and later domestic staff, continued until the mid 1990s, well after such service had become anachronistic in most other great houses in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-22&gt;McGregor &amp; Associates 1997:257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Government House demonstrates at a high level the design, layout, construction techniques and finishes of a colonial grand house in the Gothic style as well as that of an early colonial harbour-side estate charged with the carriage of viceregal functions including symbolic functions of authority in polity and society. The ensemble of House, outbuildings and gardens can demonstrate the development of the site and its functions from the colonial period to today. The Government house interiors as they have evolved from the 1840s reflect the development of taste and style over 170 years. The Government House garden has the archaeological potential to provide information on early roads and drives and terrace arrangements. The important interiors (such as the Lyon and Cottier wall Drawing Room ceilings and hand painted cloth panels) and the extensive moveable heritage collection (including the collection of Colonial Australian furniture, portraits of Governors, and some of the more recent furnishings and fittings) demonstrate 150 years of changing style and taste.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

It is a rare surviving example where the original and early planning remains relatively intact and demonstrates the prevailing social order and domestic arrangements of the "place".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872-1872-23&gt;McGregor &amp; Associates 1997: 258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1872/&gt;

==Early life==
Louganis was born in [[El Cajon, California]], and is of [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] descent. His teenage biological parents placed him for adoption when he was eight months old and he was raised in California by his [[adoption|adoptive parents]], Frances and Peter Louganis. His adoptive father was of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-09-18/features/8802230686_1_edge-athlete-body/3|title=GREG LOUGANIS AFTER THE GOLD|first=PAT|last=JORDAN|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started taking dance, acrobatics and gymnastics classes at 18 months, after witnessing his sister's classes and attempting to join in. By the age of three, he was practicing daily and was competing and giving public performances.&lt;ref name="ESPNTheBody"/&gt; For the next few years, he regularly competed, and performed at various places including nursing homes and the local naval base. As a child, he was diagnosed with asthma and allergies, so to help with the conditions, he was encouraged to continue the dance and gymnastics classes. He also took up trampolining, and at the age of nine began diving lessons after the family got a swimming pool.&lt;ref name="guardianolysrs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/28/greg-louganis-50-stunning-olympic-moments |title=50 stunning Olympic moments No20: Greg Louganis's perfect dive 1988 |date=March 28, 2012 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |author=Simon Burnton}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Santa Ana High School]] in [[Santa Ana, California]], [[Valhalla High School (El Cajon, California)|Valhalla High School]] in El Cajon, California, as well as [[Mission Viejo High School]], in Mission Viejo.

==Diving career==
As a Junior Olympic competitor, Louganis caught the eye of [[Sammy Lee (diver)|Sammy Lee]], two-time Olympic champion, who began coaching him. At sixteen Louganis took part in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]], where he placed second in the tower event, behind [[Italy|Italian]] sport legend [[Klaus Dibiasi]]. Two years later, with Dibiasi retired, Louganis won his first world title in the same event with the help of coach [[Ron O'Brien (coach)|Ron O'Brien]].

Louganis was a favorite for two golds in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, but an [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American boycott of the games]] prevented him from participating. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medal]] years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caroccioli|first1=Tom|last2=Caroccioli|first2=Jerry|title=Boycott: Stolen Dreams of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=Highland Park, IL|isbn=978-0942257403|pages=243–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louganis won two titles at the world championships in 1982, where he became the first diver in a major international meeting to get a perfect score of 10 from all seven judges.&lt;ref name="guardianolysrs"/&gt; At the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympics]], with record scores and leads over his opponents, Louganis won gold medals in both the springboard and tower diving events.

He won two more world championship titles in 1986.

At the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympics]], his head struck the springboard during the preliminary rounds, leading to a [[concussion]].&lt;ref name="ESPNTheBody"/&gt; He completed the preliminaries despite his injury. He then earned the highest single score of the qualifying round for his next dive and repeated the dive during the finals, earning the gold medal by a margin of 25 points.&lt;ref name="guardianolysrs"/&gt; In the [[Diving at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's 10 metre platform|10m finals]], he won the gold medal, performing a 3.4 difficulty dive in his last attempt, earning 86.70 points for a total of 638.61, surpassing silver medalist [[Xiong Ni]] by only 1.14 points.&lt;ref name="guardianolysrs"/&gt; His comeback earned him the title of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' "Athlete of the Year" for 1988.

==Acting==
Louganis had been a theatre major in college, and in the late 1980s and 1990s, Louganis acted in several movies, including ''Touch Me'' in 1997.

In 1993, he played the role of Darius in an Off-Broadway production of the play ''Jeffrey''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/vault/1993/09/27/129389/greg-louganis Greg Louganis]. Steve Wulf.

Retrieved February 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he starred for six weeks in the Off-Broadway production of [[Dan Butler]]'s one man-show about gay life, ''The Only Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me'', taking over from Butler himself. In the play he portrayed 14 different characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greg Louganis, from platform to boards |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/08/22/Greg-Louganis-from-platform-to-boards/6801809064000/ |publisher=UPI |first=Frederick M. |last=Winship |date=August 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he appeared in the film ''[[Watercolors (film)|Watercolors]],'' in the role of Coach Brown, a swimming instructor in a high school.

In 2012, he appeared in the penultimate episode of the second season of IFC's comedy ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'', playing himself.

==Dog agility competitions==
After retiring from diving, Louganis began to compete in [[dog agility]] competitions; he has said that being around the dogs gave him "a sense of security, company and unconditional love".&lt;ref name="candid new film" /&gt; His dogs have included Dr. Schivago; Captain Woof Blitzer; Nipper and son, Dobby, both champion [[Jack Russell terrier]]s; Gryff (Gryffindor), a [[border collie]]; and Hedwig, a [[Hungarian Puli]]. Nipper was named for the [[Nipper|RCA dog]], while Gryff, Dobby and Hedwig were named for [[Harry Potter]] characters, as Louganis is a self-described "huge Harry Potter fan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?id=5221853 Greg Louganis back in the pool to help others] Sandra Hewitt.

==Coaching==
Since November 2010, Louganis has been coaching divers of a wide range of ages and abilities in the SoCal Divers Club in [[Fullerton, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crouse |first=Karen |title=Louganis is Back on Board | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=Feb 20, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/sports/21louganis.html?hp}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a mentor to the US diving team at the London 2012 Olympics and the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics.&lt;ref name="ESPNTheBody"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ain|first1=Morty|title='I didn't think I'd see 30,' says Greg Louganis|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/page/bodygreglouganis/olympic-diver-greg-louganis-living-hiv-staying-fit-56-body-issue-2016|accessdate=August 14, 2016|work=ESPN The Magazine|issue=Body Issue 2016.|publisher=ESPN|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Attitude (magazine)]] interview, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
From 1983 to 1989, Louganis was in a romantic relationship with his manager, R. James "Jim" Babbitt. Louganis has described the relationship as abusive, saying that at one point in 1983, Babbitt raped him at knifepoint.&lt;ref name="public glory"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Glory, Secret Agony |url=http://www.newsweek.com/public-glory-secret-agony-180724 |publisher=Newsweek |date=March 5, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louganis also accused Babbitt of taking 80% of Louganis's earnings.&lt;ref name="ex-agent"&gt;{{cite web |title=Louganis, Ex-Agent in Dispute : Olympic Diver Says in Court Papers He Feared for His Life |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-29/sports/sp-617_1_diver-greg-louganis |date=March 29, 1989 |first=Grahame L. |last=Jones |publisher=''Los Angeles Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months before the 1988 Olympics, Louganis was diagnosed with [[HIV]]; he had contracted the disease from Babbitt.&lt;ref name="public glory" /&gt; His doctor placed him on the [[antiretroviral]] drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]], which he took every four hours round-the-clock.&lt;ref name="public glory" /&gt;

In 1989, Louganis obtained a [[restraining order]] against Babbitt.&lt;ref name="ex-agent" /&gt; Babbitt died of [[AIDS]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="public glory" /&gt;

For his 33rd birthday in 1993, Louganis held a "final birthday party" for family and friends, as a way to say goodbye; he was in failing health and thought he would die of AIDS soon.&lt;ref name="far from falling" /&gt;

Louganis publicly came out as gay in a pre-taped announcement shown at the opening ceremony of the 1994 [[Gay Games]], having been persuaded to do so by Gay Games organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gay Games: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mm18AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT227 |first=Caroline |last=Symons |publisher=Routledge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before then, he led what has been described as "an openly gay life".&lt;ref name="public glory" /&gt;

In 1995 he announced that he was [[HIV]]-positive, around the time of the release of his memoir, ''[[Breaking the Surface]]''.&lt;ref name="ESPNTheBody"/&gt; In a 1995 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], Louganis spoke publicly for the first time about being gay and HIV-positive.

Louganis announced his engagement to his partner, paralegal Johnny Chaillot, in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20709815,00.html|title=Greg Louganis Engaged to Johnny Chaillot|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were married on October 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20745079,00.html|title=Greg Louganis Marries Johnny Chaillot|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV status and head injury controversy===
After his announcement, people in and out of the international diving community began to question Louganis's decision not to disclose his HIV status at the time of his head injury during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, given that he bled into a pool that others then dove into. Louganis has stated that, during the ordeal, he was "paralyzed with fear" that he would infect another competitor, or the doctor who treated him. Ultimately, no one was infected.&lt;ref name="public glory" /&gt;

Experts maintain that the incident posed no risk to others.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/risk-poolthe-dangers-are-field-180768 "The Risk Pool: The Dangers Are Off The Field", authored by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', 5 March 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; The blood was diluted by thousands of gallons of water, and "chlorine kills HIV", said John Ward, chief of HIV-AIDS surveillance at the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; Also, skin is a very effective barrier to HIV. Only a diver with an open wound would face any risk.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; "If the virus just touches the skin, it is unheard of for it to cause infection: the skin has no receptors to bind HIV," explained [[Anthony Fauci]].&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt;

In the October/November 2010 issue of ''ABILITY'' Magazine, Louganis stated that the "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" policy was "absurd," "unconstitutional," and a "witch-hunt." He added that "gay men and women have been serving this country for years … [it's] basically encouraging people who are serving our country to lie to each other."&lt;ref name=mackin&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper |first=Chet |title=Don't Ask(We Asked), Don't Tell(We Told) | magazine=[[ABILITY Magazine]] |date=October–November 2010 |url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Greg-Louganis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louganis recounted his story in 1996 in a best-selling autobiography, ''[[Breaking the Surface]]'', co-written with [[Eric Marcus]].

Louganis got few endorsement deals after his 1984 and 1988 Olympic victories, his one major deal being [[Speedo]], a partnership which lasted until 2007. Some of his fellow athletes blamed [[homophobia]] for his lack of deals, since he had been rumored to be gay even before he came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Many Endorsement Deals Aren't Coming Out -- Many Gay Athletes Have Learned They Must Stay In The Closet In Order To Land Lucrative Contracts |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940814&amp;slug=1925243 |first=Karen |last=Crouse |date=August 14, 1994 |publisher=''The Seattle Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louganis has stated that he suspects that his sexuality played a part, although he feels that in part he was simply overshadowed in the public imagination by other American Olympians, most notably [[Mary Lou Retton]].&lt;ref name="the wheaties box"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Wheaties Box and the Why of Celebrity Endorsements |url=https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-wheaties-box-and-the-why-of-celebrity-endorsements |first=Alison |last=Beard |date=April 5, 2016 |publisher=''Harvard Business Review''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Louganis was pictured on boxes of [[Wheaties]] cereal, where prominent American athletes are famously featured, as part of a special "Legends" series that also included 1980s Olympians [[Janet Evans]] and [[Edwin Moses]].&lt;ref name="the wheaties box" /&gt; This occurred approximately a year after a [[change.org]] petition was launched that requested that he be featured, although [[General Mills]] denied any influence from the petition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/05/473107455/better-late-than-never-olympic-champion-greg-louganis-gets-his-wheaties-box Better Late Than Never: Olympic Champion Greg Louganis Gets His Wheaties Box] (NPR)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14127">The '''Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative''' is a five-year program, supported by Swiss bank [[UBS]] in which the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] identifies and works with artists, curators and educators from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] to expand its reach in the international art world. For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invites one curator from the chosen region to the [[Solomon R Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]] for a two-year curatorial residency, where he or she works with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organize international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities.&lt;ref name=vogel3&gt;Vogel, Carol.

'''HM Bark ''Endeavour'' Replica''' is one of two&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/work-begins-to-move-the-endeavour-replica-to-whitby-1-9078846&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/date-revealed-for-the-endeavour-s-arrival-in-whitby-1-9159790&lt;/ref&gt; [[ship replica|replicas]] of {{HMS|Endeavour}}, the [[barque|bark]] commanded by Lieutenant [[James Cook]] when he [[First voyage of James Cook|charted New Zealand and discovered the eastern coast of Australia]]. The initial idea of recreating ''Endeavour'' for use as a [[museum ship]] was generated during the establishment of the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in the 1980s; the vessel would be funded by the [[Bond Corporation]], and gifted to the nation on completion. A specialist shipyard, complete with viewing platform and guided tours for the public, was set up, and construction of the vessel commenced in 1988. Two years later, work stopped because the Bond Corporation hit financial trouble; a Japanese company, the [[Yoshiya Corporation]], stepped in, but was also forced to withdraw support because of financial problems.

Volunteers maintained the incomplete vessel until the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation was established as a charitable trust in 1991. The ''Endeavour'' replica was launched at the end of 1993, and completed in 1994. After [[sea trials]], the replica sailed from Fremantle to Sydney, where she arrived at the end of 1994. During 1995, the ship recreated Cook's voyage along eastern Australia, then visited New Zealand at the end of the year. In late 1996, the ''Endeavour'' replica set out on a circumnavigation of the world, visiting ports in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and North America, before returning to New Zealand in late 1999. The vessel returned to Sydney in mid-2000. In 2001, the replica was used for filming of the BBC documentary ''[[The Ship (TV series)|The Ship]]'', then sailed to England in 2002. She spent the next two years visiting ports in the United Kingdom and Europe, before sailing back to Sydney in 2005, completing a second round-the-world voyage. On arrival in Australia, the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation transferred ownership of the vessel to the Australian National Maritime Museum.

During 2011 and 2012, the replica circumnavigated Australia.

==Construction==
The idea of building a replica of ''Endeavour'' was first mooted by the [[trustee]]s of the under-construction [[Australian National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=Coombes36&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel would serve as the centrepiece of the [[museum ship]] fleet.&lt;ref name=Coombes37&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for construction was provided by the [[Bond Corporation]], with the completed replica to be presented as the company's gift to Australia for the [[Australian Bicentenary|nation's bicentenary]].&lt;ref name=Coombes37/&gt; Construction was organised through a subsidiary company, Endeavour Replica Pty Ltd.&lt;ref name=Coombes37/&gt; A specialist shipyard was established at [[Fremantle Fishing Boat Harbour]]; a viewing gallery allowed visitors to observe the replica's construction, and volunteer guides ran tours through the shipyard.&lt;ref name=Coombes37/&gt; Recreation of the vessel was not problematic, as the original ''Endeavour'' had been surveyed multiple times by the Royal Navy, particularly during her conversion from a cargo [[collier (ship type)|collier]] to a ship of exploration, and these records had been retained by the British [[National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawood/&gt;

Construction of the vessel started in January 1988, with the keel laid in October.&lt;ref name=Coombes37/&gt; In 1990, Bond Corporation was forced to stop work on the project because of financial difficulties.&lt;ref name=Coombes37/&gt; The Japanese [[Yoshiya Corporation]] joined the project, but withdrew six months later, again, because of financial problems.&lt;ref name=Cawood&gt;Cawood, ''Building history''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; The volunteer complement were able to keep the shipyard ticking over for another eight months.&lt;ref name=Coombes38&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In order to complete and operate the vessel, the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation was set up as a charitable trust in August 1991, with the Bond and Yoshiya Corporations donating their [[Equity (finance)|equity]] in the project.&lt;ref name=Coombes38/&gt; A combination of funding from the Australian government, loans, and donations allowed work on the ship to continue.&lt;ref name=Courtney&gt;Courtney ''Endeavour not all plain sailing''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Endeavour'' replica was launched on 9 December 1993, and completed on 16 April 1994.&lt;ref name=Coombes38/&gt;

The ''Endeavour'' replica was assembled using traditional shipbuilding methods and materials where possible, although some changes were made to meet modern safety standards and enhance the longevity of the replica.&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff6&gt;Staff Contributors, ''Endeavour sails home'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NelsonMail/&gt; The vessel's hull is built from [[jarrah]], with [[Douglas-fir|Oregon pine]] also used above the waterline: although [[oak]] and [[elm]] were used in the original ship, the decision was made not to use these as they were more susceptible to rotting.&lt;ref name=Coombes38/&gt;&lt;ref name=NelsonMail&gt;''The Endeavour'', in ''The Nelson Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the wood was fresh-cut, much of it was salvaged from demolished buildings and bridges, or taken from trees felled during construction work or storms.&lt;ref name=Cawood/&gt; The ''Endeavour'' replica is [[square-rigged]] with 25 sails made from [[duradon]], giving a sail area of between {{convert|1461|and|1511|sqm}}, including {{convert|531|sqm}} of [[studding sail]]s.&lt;ref name=Coombes38/&gt;&lt;ref name=NelsonMail/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schauffelen8&gt;Schäuffelen, ''Chapman Great Sailing Ships Of The World'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The ship is {{convert|43.6|m}} long from bowsprit to stern, has a beam of {{convert|9.28|m}}, a draught of {{convert|3.4|m}}, and a mainmast height of {{convert|28|m}}.&lt;ref name=Schauffelen8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Auxiliary propulsion is provided by two Caterpillar 3046 B diesel engines, which provide {{convert|404|hp}}.&lt;ref name=Schauffelen8/&gt; Most of the "20th century" equipment, including the diesel engines, a powered galley, and navigational equipment, is sited in what was the hold on the original ''Endeavour'', keeping the upper decks in their 18th century condition.&lt;ref name=Courtney/&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:HM Bark Endeavour Replica.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The ''Endeavour'' replica at [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] 2013]]
{{Expand section|Ship's activities between 2005 and 2011|date=July 2011}}
The ''Endeavour'' replica spent six months undergoing [[sea trials]] and operating around Fremantle before sailing around southern Australia to Sydney.&lt;ref name=Coombes39&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Departing in October, the ship made numerous port visits along the southern and eastern coasts before arriving in December.&lt;ref name=Coombes39/&gt; She was placed on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum.&lt;ref name=Coombes39/&gt;

From April until September 1995, the replica recreated the original ''Endeavour''{{'}}s voyage up the east coast of Australia, then made a three-month visit to New Zealand from November 1995 to January 1996.&lt;ref name=Coombes39 /&gt; After this, the ship returned to Fremantle via ports in Victoria and South Australia.&lt;ref name=Coombes39/&gt; In October 1996, the replica sailed for England via South Africa, arriving in March 1997.&lt;ref name=Coombes39/&gt; After spending the rest of the year visiting British ports, the ship arrived in Florida in March 1998, and visited 31 ports along both the east and west coasts of North America during 1998 and 1999.&lt;ref name=Coombes40&gt;Coombes, ''Tall Ships'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Endeavour'' replica sailed from Vancouver to New Zealand via Hawaii, and reached Wellington in late December 1999, having circumnavigated the globe.&lt;ref name=Coombes40/&gt; The ship spent five months in New Zealand waters before sailing to Sydney in May 2000.&lt;ref name=Coombes40/&gt;

[[File:HMBEndeavour0878.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Endeavour'' replica on display at Chatham Dockyard in September 2003]]
During 2001, ''Endeavour'' embarked a [[BBC]] film crew and recreated Cook's voyage between Cairns and Jakarta for filming of the documentary series ''[[The Ship (TV series)|The Ship]]''.&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7&gt;Staff Contributors, ''Endeavour sails home'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; After a major refit in Fremantle during late 2001 and early 2002, the replica sailed in February for a second round-the-world voyage.&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7/&gt; The ship sailed to [[Whitby]] via Cape Horn; wave footage shot while rounding the cape was later used for digitally composited scenes in the 2003 film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''.&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macgregor &amp; O'Brian, ''The Making of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She spent most of the next two years on display, either in Whitby, or during visits to ports in the United Kingdom and Europe.&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7/&gt;

The replica left England in 2004, and returned to Australia via the Caribbean, Panama Canal, Galapagos, Tahiti, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7/&gt; She reached Sydney at sunset on 17 April 2005, after having run aground a few hours earlier in [[Botany Bay]].&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7/&gt; On arrival, ownership of the vessel was transferred from the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation to the Australian National Maritime Museum.&lt;ref name=Coombes40/&gt;&lt;ref name=SignalsStaff7/&gt;

In mid-April 2011, ''Endeavour'' sailed from Sydney on her first circumnavigation of Australia.&lt;ref name=ABCBris&gt;ABC/AAP ''Endeavour docks in Brisbane''&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-clockwise voyage around the continent ended in May 2012,  with fifteen ports visited and {{convert|13,300|nmi}} sailed.&lt;ref name=ABCBris/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Maritime Museum, ''Endeavour Voyages – Port Visits''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlass, ''Unsteady as she goes, in Cook's shipboard footsteps''&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 ''Endeavour'' participated in the [[List of ships present at International Fleet Review 2013|International Fleet Review 2013]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

The '''''Historia abbatiae Condomensis, nunc episcopatus''''' (History of the Abbey of Condom, now a Bishopric) is a chronicle of the history of [[Saint-Pierre de Condom]], an abbey from the ninth century, rebuilt in 1040 and converted into the seat of the [[Diocese of Condom]] in 1317. It was written early in the fourteenth century by an anonymous monk of the abbey, drawing extensively on the abbey's [[cartulary]] and [[necrology]]. Its account of the abbey's origins is unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Molinier, [http://www.persee.fr/doc/shf_0000-0000_1902_num_2_1_891_t1_0120_0000_10 "1533.

'''Inspec''' is a major indexing database of scientific and technical literature, published by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET), and formerly by the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE), one of the IET's forerunners.

Inspec coverage is extensive in the fields of physics, computing, control, and engineering. Its subject coverage includes astronomy, electronics, communications, computers and computing, computer science, control engineering, electrical engineering, information technology, physics, manufacturing, production and mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name=UB-Lib/&gt; Now, due to emerging concept of technology for business, Inspec also includes information technology for business in its portfolio. Inspec indexed few journals publishing high quality research by integrating technology into management, economics and social sciences domains.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.theiet.org/resources/inspec/about/coverage/index.cfm &lt;/ref&gt; The sample journals include Annual Review of Financial Economics, Aslib Journal of Information Management, Australian Journal of Management and, International Journal of Management, Economics and Social Sciences.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.theiet.org/resources/inspec/support/docs/index.cfm? &lt;/ref&gt;

Inspec was started in 1967 as an outgrowth of the ''Science Abstracts'' service. The electronic records were distributed on [[magnetic tape]]. In the 1980s, it was available in the U.S. through the [[Dialog (online database)|Knowledge Index]], a low-priced dial-up version of the [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] service for individual users, which made it popular. For nearly 50 years, the IET has employed scientists to manually review items to be included in Inspec, hand-indexing the literature using their own expertise of the subject area and make a judgement call about which terms and classification codes should be applied. Thanks to this work, a significant thesaurus has been developed which enables content to be indexed far more accurately and in context, which in turn helps end-users discover relevant literature that may otherwise have remained hidden from typical search queries, making Inspec an essential tool for prior art, patentability searches and patent drafting. 
 
Access to Inspec is currently by the [[Internet]] through ''Inspec Direct'' and various resellers.

===''Physics Abstracts''===
'''Physics Abstracts''' ({{ISSN|0036-8091}} {{LCCN|76646597}} Frequency: 24 per year) is an [[index (publishing)|abstracting and indexing]] service first published by the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]]. It was first circulated as ''Science Abstracts'', volume 1 through volume 5 from 1898 to 1902. From 1903 to 1971 the database had different titles. These closely related names were ''Science Abstracts. Section A, Physics'' and ''Science Abstracts. Section A, Physics Abstracts'' from volume 6 to volume 74.

By 1972 other [[professional society|societies]] were associated as authors of this service such as the [[American Institute of Physics]]. In 1975 or 1976 the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] also became an author. By 1980 this database was also issued as INSPEC-Physics on various formats. It was also available as part of INSPEC database. Presently it is part of ''Inspec, Section A - Physics'' database. At the same time, the ''Physics Abstracts'' title was employed throughout the 1990s.&lt;ref name=UKmag&gt;

===Notable editor===
The science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]], with a [[B.S. degree]] ([[physics]] and [[mathematics]] honors) ([[King's College, London|King's college]]), was an assistant editor for ''Physics Abstracts'' from 1949–1951. This position allowed Clarke to access to "all of the world’s leading scientific journals."&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;

===''Science Abstracts''===
The first issue of ''Science Abstracts'' was published in January 1898. During that first year, a total of 1,423 abstracts were published at monthly intervals, and at the end of the year an author and subject index were added.&lt;ref name=W-Chester&gt;

  | quote =Supersedes: Science abstracts. Series A, Physics abstracts

* General [[Physics]]
* [[Light]]
* [[Heat]]
* [[Sound]]
* [[Electricity]]
* [[Electrochemistry]] and [[Chemical Physics]]
* General [[Electrical Engineering]]
* [[Electrical generator|Dynamos]], [[Electric motor|Electric Motors]] and [[Transformer]]s
* [[Power distribution|Power Distribution]], [[Traction (engineering)|Traction]] and [[Lighting]]
* [[Telegraphy]] and [[Telephony]]

''Science Abstracts'' was the result of a joint collaboration between the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE)]] and The [[Physical Society of London|Physical Society]] of London. The publication was (at that time) provided without charge to all members of both societies. The cost of the publication was mainly borne by the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] and The Physical Society. Financial contributions were also received from the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], [[The Royal Society]] and the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]

By 1902, the annual number of abstracts published had increased to 2,362. By May 1903 it was decided to split the publication into two parts: '''A''' ([[Physics]]) and '''B''' ([[Electrical Engineering]]). This decision allowed the subject's scope to widen, particularly in physics. As a result, this allowed a larger quantity of material to be covered.

Since 1967, electronic access to ''Science Abstracts'' has been provided by INSPEC.

'''Jetz International Ltd v Orams Marine Ltd''' [1999] DCR 831 is a cited case in New Zealand confirming that the consumer protections under the [[Consumer Guarantees Act (NZ)|Consumer Guarantees Act]] cover consumer goods owned even if they are owned by a limited liability company, as long as they are used for consumer purposes.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jetz was a holding company for the ownership of a launch, and rented a berth at a dry stack marina run by Orams Marine.

Problems arose when a former employee broke into the marina, used the gantry crane to retrieve the launch, and took it for a joyride, during which the launch suffered considerable damage.

Afterwards, Orams refused to reimburse Jetz for the damage, relying on liability exclusion clause in clause 21 of the rental agreement.

Jetz sued for the damage under the Consumer Guarantees Act, as if covered by the Act, such exclusion clauses are not valid.

==Held==
The Court ruled that the launch was consumer goods, for consumer purposes, meaning that the exclusion clause was not legally valid, and awarded damages of $18,000.

The '''''Linguistic Atlas of New England''''' (LANE), edited by [[Hans Kurath]] in collaboration with Miles L. Hanley, [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]], Guy S. Lowman, [[Marcus Lee Hansen|Marcus L. Hansen]] and [[Julia Bloch]], is a [[linguistic map]] describing the [[dialect]]s of [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=John|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4282-3145-0|page=196|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; LANE consists of 734 maps over three volumes, and is the first major study of the dialects in the northeastern United States. Seven New England states were studied: Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. In New York, only Long Island was covered. Some data from Southern New Brunswick, Canada, was also included. Pronunciations elicited from informants in each town were printed directly onto maps of the area. One map was included for each of the 734 items that were studied.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lap.uga.edu/Site/LANE.html|title=LAP Online - Linguistic Atlas of New England|website=www.lap.uga.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
LANE was the first component of the Linguistic Atlas of the United States (LAUS). LAUS was first proposed in 1928 by a committee of the [[Modern Language Association]], and collaborative meetings with the [[Linguistic Society of America]] (LSA) began in 1929 to discuss the feasibility of the proposed linguistic atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1930, the LSA Council requested a trial run in a limited area, so that a method could be established and budget estimates could be taken for further work in other regions. In 1931, the LSA Council granted approval for the study of New England speech.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of the linguistic geography of New England|last=Kurath|first=Hans|publisher=AMS Press|year=1973|isbn=0404100473|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=xi-xii|lccn=70-37508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years, preparations for LANE were made. The staff of the project was appointed, including Hans Kurath as director and Miles L. Haney as associate director. Additional staff members were hired with the help of fellowships from Brown University and the University of Vermont. Yale University provided headquarters for the project. Staff were trained over six weeks in the summer of 1931 before beginning fieldwork. Linguists who had experience mapping the dialects of Switzerland and Italy, Jakob Jud and Paul Schauermeier, assisted in the training process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first component of the research took into account the historical background of New England's settlement and population.This provided a basis for which communities would be selected for study in LANE. After this initial historical investigation by Marcus L. Hansen (University of Illinois), data collection commenced. This phase spanned 25 months, and finished in September 1933.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Informants ===
416 informants were interviewed across 213 New England communities. Though there were 431 towns and cities investigated altogether, neighboring towns were sometimes grouped together. Historical backgrounds for each town and details about each informant are given in the accompanying Handbook. Two informants of different social strata were selected from each county whenever possible. Kurath specified that one of the informants must be elderly, old-fashioned, and uneducated and the other must be middle-class and have some education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nina|first=Brown,|date=2001-01-01|title=Hans Kurath, Linguistic Atlas of the United States.|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/09v5z6fg#page-2|journal=eScholarship|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field workers characterized informants, based on education levels and age, into Type I (little formal education), Type II (moderate formal education), or Type III (high education level), and Type A (old-fashioned) or Type B (younger, more modern).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Notation ===
Field workers used modified [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic transcription. Some additional notations were used to indicate more information, such as ''c.'' indicating the target form was spoken in natural conversation, ''r.'' indicating repetition at the field worker's request, ''s.'' indicating that the informant agreed the form was natural after hearing it suggested by the field worker, and ''f.'' indicating that the response was forced due to the field worker's insistence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Supplementary Materials ===
Though most of the data were only transcribed, aluminum field recordings were made between 1933-1939 and some of the surviving records are digitized at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Handbook of the Linguistic Geography of New England (1939), by Hans Kurath and Miles L. Hanley was published in conjunction with LANE. This handbook discusses the dialect areas of New England, Kurath's methodology, the history of New England's settlement, the phonetic notation and worksheets used in data collection, and the communities and informants that were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia of American Literature|last=Perkins|first=George|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1991|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=615|chapter=Linguistic Atlas of the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Questionnaire ===
The questionnaire consisted of 734 items&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that each [[Informant (linguistics)|informant]] answered. These 734 items were split across LANE's three volumes, in the following distribution:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5024">[[Flood myth]]s are common across a wide range of cultures, extending back into [[Bronze Age]] and [[Neolithic]] prehistory.

Matsya (the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as a fish) forewarns Manu (a human) about an impending catastrophic flood and orders him to collect all the grains of the world in a boat; in some forms of the story, all living creatures are also to be preserved in the boat. When the flood destroys the world, Manu – in some versions accompanied by the seven great sages – survives by boarding the ark, which Matsya pulls to safety.
* [[Puluga]], the creator god in the religion of the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands]], sends a devastating flood to punish people who have forgotten his commands. Only four people survive this flood: two men and two women.

'''Mawdoo3''', (in {{lang-ar|'}}موضوع; literally "Subject"), is a comprehensive online [[Arabic language|Arabic]] content publisher, based in [[Jordan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=309669564 |title= Company Overview of Mawdoo3|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= BloombergBusiness|publisher= |access-date= November 15, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that uses the [[wiki]] system similar to [[Wikipedia]], and provides premium quality Arabic content. Mawdoo3 was initially established in 2010 by Mohammad Jaber and Rami Al Qawasmi, and officially launched in 2012. It won the first prize for the [[Queen Rania Center for Entrepreneurship|Queen Rania National Entrepreneurship Award]] for the category of universities and academics in 2011.&lt;ref name="wamda"&gt;{{cite news |author= Lucy Knight |title= Jordan’s Mawdoo3 gets $1.5M in Series A funding|url= http://www.wamda.com/2015/08/jordans-mawdoo3-1-5m-series-a-funding|newspaper= Wamda|location= |date= August 19, 2015|access-date= November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; And since that time, Mawdoo3 has evolved in many directions but consistently provided credible Arabic content to the Arab world culminating as the world's first Arabic website with more than 42 million unique visitors every month.&lt;ref name="AWS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mawdoo3 Case Study |url=https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/mawdoo3/ |website=Amazon Web Services |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawdoo3.com, which set to quickly expand the online Arabic content via its growing library of over 140k articles to date, dealing with all aspects of different types of human knowledge, by providing the information in a simplified manner to Arabic internet users worldwide.&lt;ref name= "AWS"/&gt;

Mawdoo3.com has also started its journey in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI), with a particular focus on Arabic NLP products capable of covering the Arabic dialects and build the components of Mawdoo3 Arabic speaking digital assistant, which they call it “Salma”, which they announced on March 2018 on Lynx 2018.&lt;ref name="END"&gt;{{cite web |title=Move Over Siri, in the Middle East Salma Has Your Number |url=https://endeavor.org/entrepreneurs/move-siri-middle-east-salma-number/ |website=endeavor |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
The Idea of Mawdoo3 began with Mohammed Jaber, who, when he was studying at the [[Hashemite University]] in [[Jordan]], said: "The idea of the project came in late 2009 from reading a book about [[e-marketing]] during my summer vacation, which prompted me to read further. I bought three specialized books and read them, which revealed to me the opportunity to build a project to develop a keyword analysis service in [[Arabic]]".&lt;ref name="khab"&gt;{{cite news |author= |title='Mawdoo3' won the first prize for the Queen Rania National Entrepreneurship Award in 2011|url= http://khaberni.com/more.php?newsid=61851&amp;catid=16|language= Arabic|newspaper= Khaberni |location= Jordan|date= September 19, 2011|access-date= November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Jaber and Rami al-Qawasmi founded Mawdoo3 with personal money and that of family and friends. The startup was the recipient of a first prize for the Queen Rania Business Plan Competition Award in 2011, while they were still students. It was launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="wamda" /&gt;

=== Investments and partnerships ===
In August 2015, Mawdoo3 announced that it had received $1.5 million in [[Series A]] funding from [[Dubai]] based investor “EquiTrust”, as a result of a witnessed remarkable increase in the traffic with more than 20 million visits per month, of which 12 million are unique with a majority of the traffic coming from [[Saudi Arabia]], followed by [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]].This funding was to be invested in supporting Arabic content and increasing the number of Arabic pages on the [[Internet]] as per the announcement.&lt;ref name="Vent"&gt;{{cite news |author= Jane Hosking |title= Online Encyclopedia Mawdoo3 Receives $1.5 Million in Funding|url= http://www.venturemagazine.me/2015/09/online-encyclopedia-mawdoo3-receives-1-5-million-in-funding/|newspaper= Venture Magazine|location= |date= September 7, 2015|access-date= November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wamda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ALEXA"/&gt;

In addition, Mawdoo3 entered into partnerships with a number of publishers and institutions to provide them with high quality content: [[Mutah University]], [[Queen Rania]] Center for Entrepreneurship, the [[Islamic World Academy of Sciences]], Medical Reference "[http://Altibbi.com Altibbi.com]", and the technical Arabic [[dictionary]] "[http://Arabterm.com Arabterm.com]".&lt;ref name="arabnet"&gt;{{cite news |author= Parwine Hamandi|title=World’s Largest Arabic Web Encyclopedia Gets $1.5M Investment|url= http://news.arabnet.me/world-arabic-encyclopedia-content-15m-investment/|language= |newspaper= ArabNet|location= |date= October 1, 2015|access-date= November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Mawdoo3 announced that it had received $13.5 million in their series B round of funding, led by U.K.-based Kingsway along with U.S.-based Endure Capital.&lt;ref name="ameinfo.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ameinfo.com/money/banking-finance/venture-capital-loves-success-want-proof/|title=Venture capital loves success.

In early 2016, with approximately 17 Million users, Mawdoo3 was announced as the world's first Arabic website.&lt;ref name="USNEWS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Website created by 2 young Jordanians in a coffee shop 6 years ago becomes most popular in Arabic |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-03-09/website-launched-by-jordan-duo-in-a-cafe-now-no-1-in-arabic |website=US News |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, Mawdoo3 AI was founded, A fine-tech division of Mawdoo3 with a mission of creating an Arabic speaking conversational agent that answers factoid questions.

In 2018, Mawdoo3 announced reaching 45M&lt;ref name="ameinfo.com"/&gt; unique users, achieving a growth rate of approximately 43% of what they have in 2016.&lt;ref name="AWS"/&gt;

== AI ==
In March 2018, Mawdoo3 launched its beta web services of the most comprehensive Arabic NLP toolkit for developers (ai.mawdoo3.com). The API-based developer library exceeds state of the art accuracy in most of the NLP tasks including but not limited to: Automatic diacritization, named entity recognition, coreference resolution, sentiment analysis and Arabic text to speech.

Mawdoo3 NLP toolkit was designed to serve as building components of Mawdoo3 Arabic speaking digital assistant, Salma, that answers factoid questions from Mawdoo3 platform. Salma is planned also to be provided as an Arabic voice interface service for enterprises in sectors like travel, automobile, telecom and electronics.&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

== The way it works ==
Mawdoo3 uses the [[wiki]] system, but unlike [[Wikipedia]], Mawdoo3.com adopts a more centralized operation model to create and upload content. The team is composed of 20 full-time employees, as well as hundreds of writers divided into paid experts and contributors, who write on specific topics according to special content strategy. It publishes original informational articles and rejects opinion, news, and promotional pieces. Prior to publishing, an in-house auditing team verifies the content of every article for [[plagiarism]], and checks for correct language use. Translated articles are also welcome.&lt;ref name="arabnet" /&gt;

== Statistics ==
=== Visitors ===
According to the [[Alexa website]] (July, 2018), the distribution of the Arab visitors is as follow:&lt;ref name="ALEXA"&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/mawdoo3.com Alexa: Mawdoo3].&lt;/ref&gt;

The volatile period of [[civil unrest]] in [[France]] during May 1968 was punctuated by demonstrations and massive [[general strike]]s as well as the [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] of universities and [[Occupation of factories|factories]] across France. At the height of its fervor, it brought the entire [[economy of France]] to a virtual halt.&lt;ref name="SitInt12"/&gt; The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared [[civil war]] or [[French Revolution (disambiguation)|revolution]]; the national government itself momentarily ceased to function after President [[Charles de Gaulle]] secretly fled France for a few hours. The protests spurred an artistic movement, with songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deljehier.levillage.org/mai_68.htm |title=Mai 68 - 40 ans déjà |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/arts-theatre-culture/western-art/museum-establishment-and-contemporary-art-politics-artistic-display-france-after-1968?format=PB|title=The Museum Establishment and Contemporary Art: The Politics of Artistic Display in France after 1968|last=DeRoo|first=Rebecca J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107656918|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"May 68" affected French society for decades afterward. It is considered to this day as a cultural, social and moral turning point in the history of the country. As Alain Geismar—one of the leaders of the time—later pointed out, the movement succeeded "as a social revolution, not as a political one".&lt;ref name="Erlanger 2008"/&gt;

The unrest began with a series of [[Student protest|student occupation protests]] against [[anticapitalism|capitalism]], [[consumerism]], [[American imperialism]] and traditional institutions, values and order.  It then spread to factories with [[Strike action|strikes]] involving 11 million workers, more than 22% of the total [[Demographics of France|population of France]] at the time, for two continuous weeks.&lt;ref name="SitInt12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/beginning.html |title=Situationist International Online |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was characterized by its spontaneous and [[Decentralization#Government decentralization|de-centralized]] [[wildcat strike action|wildcat]] disposition; this created contrast and sometimes even conflict between itself and the establishment, [[trade union]]s and workers' parties.&lt;ref name="SitInt12"/&gt; It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France, and the first nationwide wildcat general strike.&lt;ref name="SitInt12"/&gt;

The student occupations and wildcat general strikes initiated across France were met with forceful confrontation by university administrators and police.  The de Gaulle administration's attempts to quell those strikes by [[Riot control|police action]] only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris]], followed by the spread of general strikes and occupations throughout France.  De Gaulle fled to a French military base in Germany, and after returning dissolved the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], and called for [[French legislative election, 1968|new parliamentary elections]] for 23 June 1968.  Violence evaporated almost as quickly as it arose.  Workers went back to their jobs, and when the elections were finally held in June, the [[Gaullist party]] emerged even stronger than before.

==Events before May==
In February 1968, the [[French Communist Party|French Communists]] and [[French Socialist Party|French Socialists]] formed an electoral alliance. Communists had long supported Socialist candidates in elections, but in the "February Declaration" the two parties agreed to attempt to form a joint government to replace [[President of France|President]] Charles de Gaulle and his Gaullist Party.{{r|mendel196901}}

On 22 March far-left groups, a small number of prominent poets and musicians, and 150 students occupied an administration building at [[Paris X University Nanterre|Paris University at Nanterre]] and held a meeting in the university council room dealing with class discrimination in French society and the political bureaucracy that controlled the university's funding.  The university's administration called the police, who surrounded the university. After the publication of their wishes, the students left the building without any trouble.  After this first record some leaders of what was named the "[[Movement of 22 March]]" were called together by the disciplinary committee of the university.

==Events of May==

===Student strikes===
[[File:SorbonneParis041130.JPG|thumb|Public square of [[Sorbonne (building)|the Sorbonne]], in the Latin Quarter of Paris]]

Following months of conflicts between students and authorities at the Nanterre campus of the [[University of Paris]] (now [[Paris Nanterre University]]), the administration shut down the university on 2 May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, pp. 10&amp;ndash;11; Damamme, Gobille, Matonti &amp; Pudal, ed., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris (today [[Sorbonne University]]) in Paris met on 3 May to protest against the closure and the threatened expulsion of several students at Nanterre.&lt;ref&gt;Damamme, Gobille, Matonti &amp; Pudal, ed., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, 6 May, the national student union, the [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France]] (UNEF)—still the largest student union in France today—and the union of university teachers called a march to protest against the police invasion of Sorbonne. More than 20,000 students, teachers and supporters marched towards the Sorbonne, still sealed off by the police, who charged, wielding their batons, as soon as the marchers approached. While the crowd dispersed, some began to create barricades out of whatever was at hand, while others threw paving stones, forcing the police to retreat for a time. The police then responded with tear gas and charged the crowd again. Hundreds more students were arrested.

High school student unions spoke in support of the riots on 6 May. The next day, they joined the students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers who gathered at the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to demand that:
# All criminal charges against arrested students be dropped,
# the police leave the university, and
# the authorities reopen Nanterre and Sorbonne.

Negotiations broke down, and students returned to their campuses after a false report that the government had agreed to reopen them, only to discover the police still occupying the schools. This led to a near revolutionary fervor among the students.

On Friday, 10 May, another huge crowd congregated on the [[Rive Gauche]]. When the [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] again blocked them from crossing the river, the crowd again threw up barricades, which the police then attacked at 2:15 in the morning after negotiations once again floundered. The confrontation, which produced hundreds of arrests and injuries, lasted until dawn of the following day. The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. Allegations were made that the police had participated in the riots, through ''[[agents provocateurs]]'', by burning cars and throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3476,36-885493,0.html |title=Michel Rocard : |work=Le Monde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's heavy-handed reaction brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Many of the nation's more mainstream singers and poets joined after the police brutality came to light. American artists also began voicing support of the strikers. The major left union federations, the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (CGT) and the [[Force Ouvrière]] (CGT-FO), called a one-day general strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May.

Well over a million people marched through Paris on that day; the police stayed largely out of sight. Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]] personally announced the release of the prisoners and the reopening of the Sorbonne. However, the surge of strikes did not recede. Instead, the protesters became even more active.

When the Sorbonne reopened, students occupied it and declared it an autonomous "people's university". Public opinion at first supported the students, but quickly turned against them after their leaders, invited to appear on national television, "behaved like irresponsible utopianists who wanted to destroy the 'consumer society.'"{{r|dogan1984}} Nonetheless, in the weeks that followed, approximately 401 popular action committees were set up in Paris and elsewhere to take up grievances against the government and French society, including the [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne|Sorbonne Occupation Committee]].

===Workers join the students===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
In the following days, workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the [[Sud Aviation]] plant near the city of [[Nantes]] on 14 May, then another strike at a [[Renault]] parts plant near [[Rouen]], which spread to the Renault manufacturing complexes at Flins in the Seine Valley and the Paris suburb of [[Boulogne-Billancourt]]. Workers had occupied roughly fifty factories by 16 May, and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day and then ten million, or roughly two-thirds of the French workforce, on strike the following week.

[[File:French workers with placard during occupation of their factory 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Strikers in [[Southern France]] with a sign reading "Factory Occupied by the Workers." Behind them is a list of demands, June 1968.]]

These strikes were not led by the union movement; on the contrary, the CGT tried to contain this spontaneous outbreak of militancy by channeling it into a struggle for higher wages and other economic demands. Workers put forward a broader, more political and more radical agenda, demanding the ousting of the government and President de Gaulle and attempting, in some cases, to run their factories. When the trade union leadership negotiated a 35% increase in the minimum wage, a 7% wage increase for other workers, and half normal pay for the time on strike with the major employers' associations, the workers occupying their factories refused to return to work and jeered their union leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27424054|title=Enragés and situationists in the occupation movement, France, May '1968|last=1944-|first=Viénet, René,|date=1992|publisher=Autonomedia|year=|isbn=0936756799|location=New York|pages=91|oclc=27424054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=6IjRojUCS8gC&amp;pg=PA195|title=Prelude to Revolution: France in May 1968|last=Singer|first=Daniel|date=2002|publisher=South End Press|year=|isbn=9780896086821|location=|pages=184–185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in the May '68 movement there was a lot of "anti-unionist euphoria,"&lt;ref name="Derrida91MagLitEwald"&gt;[[Derrida|Derrida, Jacques]] (1991) ''"A 'Madness' Must Watch Over Thinking"'', interview with [[Francois Ewald]] for ''Le Magazine Litteraire'', March 1991, republished in ''[[Points...: Interviews, 1974-1994]]'' (1995).pp.347-9&lt;/ref&gt; against the mainstream unions, the CGT, FO and CFDT, that were more willing to compromise with the powers that be than enact the will of the base.&lt;ref name="SitInt12"/&gt;

On 24 May two people died at the hands of the out of control rioters, in Lyon Police Inspector Rene Lacroix died when he crushed by a driverless truck sent careering into police lines by rioters and in Paris Phillipe Metherion, 26, was stabbed to death during an argument among demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3rNVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6508%2C6329247&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May and 26 May, the [[Grenelle agreements]] were conducted at the [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|Ministry of Social Affairs]]. They provided for an increase of the minimum wage by 25% and of average salaries by 10%. These offers were rejected, and the strike went on. The working class and top intellectuals were joining in solidarity for a major change in workers' rights.

On 27 May, the meeting of the UNEF, the most outstanding of the events of May 1968, proceeded and gathered 30,000 to 50,000 people in the [[Stade Sebastien Charlety]]. The meeting was extremely militant with speakers demanding the government be overthrown and elections held.

The Socialists saw an opportunity to act as a compromise between de Gaulle and the Communists. On 28 May, [[François Mitterrand]] of the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] declared that "there is no more state" and stated that he was ready to form a new government. He had received a surprisingly high 45% of the vote in the [[French presidential election, 1965|1965 presidential election]]. On 29 May, [[Pierre Mendès France]] also stated that he was ready to form a new government; unlike Mitterrand he was willing to include the Communists. Although the Socialists did not have the Communists' ability to form large street demonstrations, they had more than 20% of the country's support.{{r|dogan1984}}{{r|mendel196901}}

===De Gaulle flees===

On the morning of 29 May, de Gaulle postponed the meeting of the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] scheduled for that day and secretly removed his personal papers from [[Élysée Palace]]. He told his son-in-law [[Alain de Boissieu]], "I do not want to give them a chance to attack the Élysée. It would be regrettable if blood were shed in my personal defense. I have decided to leave: nobody attacks an empty palace." De Gaulle refused Pompidou's request that he dissolve the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] as he believed that their party, the Gaullists, would lose the resulting election. At 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., he told Pompidou, "I am the past; you are the future; I embrace you."&lt;ref name="dogan1984"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dogan |first=Mattei |title=How Civil War Was Avoided in France |journal=International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique |year=1984 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=245–277 |jstor=1600894|doi=10.1177/019251218400500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government announced that de Gaulle was going to his country home in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]] before returning the next day, and rumors spread that he would prepare his resignation speech there. The presidential helicopter did not arrive in Colombey, however, and de Gaulle had told no one in the government where he was going. For more than six hours the world did not know where the French president was.&lt;ref name="singer2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Prelude to Revolution: France in May 1968 |publisher=South End Press |last=Singer |first=Daniel |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6IjRojUCS8gC&amp;pg=PA195 |isbn=978-0-89608-682-1 |pages=195, 198–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canceling of the ministerial meeting, and the president's mysterious disappearance, stunned the French,{{r|dogan1984}} including Pompidou, who shouted, "He has fled the country!"&lt;ref name="dogan2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Mistrust and the Discrediting of Politicians |publisher=Brill |author=Dogan, Mattéi |year=2005 |pages=218 |isbn=9004145303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national government had effectively ceased to function. [[Édouard Balladur]] later wrote that as prime minister, Pompidou "by himself was the whole government" as most officials were "an incoherent group of confabulators" who believed that revolution would soon occur. A friend of the prime minister offered him a weapon, saying, "You will need it"; Pompidou advised him to go home. One official reportedly began burning documents, while another asked an aide how far they could flee by automobile should revolutionaries seize fuel supplies. Withdrawing money from banks became difficult, gasoline for private automobiles was unavailable, and some people tried to obtain private planes or fake [[National identity card (France)|national identity card]]s.{{r|dogan1984}}

Pompidou unsuccessfully requested that military radar be used to follow de Gaulle's two helicopters, but soon learned that he had gone to the headquarters of the French military in Germany, in [[Baden-Baden]], to meet General [[Jacques Massu]]. Massu persuaded the discouraged de Gaulle to return to France; now knowing that he had the military's support, de Gaulle rescheduled the meeting of the Council of Ministers for the next day, 30 May,{{r|dogan1984}} and returned to Colombey by 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.{{r|singer2002}} [[Yvonne de Gaulle|His wife Yvonne]] gave the family jewels to [[Philippe de Gaulle|their son and daughter-in-law]]—who stayed in Baden for a few more days—for safekeeping, however, indicating that the de Gaulles still considered Germany a possible refuge. Massu kept as a [[Classified information|state secret]] de Gaulle's loss of confidence until others disclosed it in 1982; until then most observers believed that his disappearance was intended to remind the French people of what they might lose. Although the disappearance was real and not intended as motivation, it indeed had such an effect on France.{{r|dogan1984}}

[[File:Pierre Messmer01.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Pierre Messmer]]]]

On 30 May, 400,000 to 500,000 protesters (many more than the 50,000 the police were expecting) led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting: "''Adieu, de Gaulle!''" ("Farewell, de Gaulle!"). [[Maurice Grimaud]], head of the [[Prefecture of Police|Paris police]], played a key role in avoiding revolution by both speaking to and spying on the revolutionaries, and by carefully avoiding the use of force. While Communist leaders later denied that they had planned an armed uprising, and extreme militants only comprised 2% of the populace, they had overestimated de Gaulle's strength as shown by his escape to Germany.{{r|dogan1984}} (One scholar, otherwise skeptical of the French Communists' willingness to maintain democracy after forming a government, has claimed that the "moderate, nonviolent and essentially antirevolutionary" Communists opposed revolution because they sincerely believed that the party must come to power through legal elections, not armed conflict that might provoke harsh repression from political opponents.)&lt;ref name="mendel196901"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1406452 |title=Why the French Communists Stopped the Revolution |last=Mendel |first=Arthur P. |journal=The Review of Politics |date=January 1969 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=3–27 |doi=10.1017/s0034670500008913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was largely centered around the [[Paris metropolitan area]], and not elsewhere. Had the rebellion occupied key public buildings in Paris, the government would have had to use force to retake them. The resulting casualties could have incited a revolution, with the military moving from the provinces to retake Paris [[Paris Commune|as in 1871]]. [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of Defence]] Pierre Messmer and [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] Michel Fourquet prepared for such an action, and Pompidou had ordered tanks to [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]].{{r|dogan1984}} While the military was free of revolutionary sentiment, using an army mostly of conscripts the same age as the revolutionaries would have been very dangerous for the government.{{r|mendel196901}}{{r|singer2002}} A survey taken immediately after the crisis found that 20% of Frenchmen would have supported a revolution, 23% would have opposed it, and 57% would have avoided physical participation in the conflict. 33% would have fought a military intervention, while only 5% would have supported it and a majority of the country would have avoided any action.{{r|dogan1984}}

At 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded de Gaulle to dissolve the National Assembly and call a new election by threatening to resign. At 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., de Gaulle broadcast his own refusal to resign. He announced an election, scheduled for 23 June, and ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a [[state of emergency]] if they did not. The government had leaked to the media that the army was outside Paris. Immediately after the speech, about 800,000 supporters marched through the Champs-Élysées waving the [[Flag of France|national flag]]; the Gaullists had planned the rally for several days, which attracted a crowd of diverse ages, occupations, and politics. The Communists agreed to the election, and the threat of revolution was over.{{r|dogan1984}}{{r|singer2002}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://membres.lycos.fr/mai68/degaulle/degaulle30mai1968.htm |title=Lycos |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422060607/http://membres.lycos.fr/mai68/degaulle/degaulle30mai1968.htm |archivedate=22 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of June and July==

From that point, the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of leftist organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. Contrary to de Gaulle's fears, his party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history in the [[French legislative election, 1968|legislative election held in June]], taking 353 of 486 seats versus the Communists' 34 and the Socialists' 57.{{r|dogan1984}} The February Declaration and its promise to include Communists in government likely hurt the Socialists in the election. Their opponents cited the example of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak National Front]] government of 1945, which led to a [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Communist takeover of the country]] in 1948. Socialist voters were divided; in a February 1968 survey a majority had favored allying with the Communists, but 44% believed that Communists would attempt to seize power once in government. (30% of Communist voters agreed.){{r|mendel196901}}

On [[Bastille Day]], there were resurgent street demonstrations in the Latin Quarter, led by socialist students, leftists and communists wearing red arm-bands and anarchists wearing black arm-bands. The Paris police and the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité harshly responded starting around 10 pm and continuing through the night, on the streets, in police vans, at police stations, and in hospitals where many wounded were taken. There was, as a result, much bloodshed among students and tourists there for the evening's festivities. No charges were filed against police or demonstrators, but the governments of Britain and [[West Germany]] filed formal protests, including for the indecent assault of two English schoolgirls by police in a police station.

Despite the size of de Gaulle's triumph, it was not a personal one. The post-crisis survey showed that a majority of the country saw de Gaulle as too old, too self-centered, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]]. As the [[French constitutional referendum, 1969|April 1969 referendum]] would show, the country was ready for "Gaullism without de Gaulle".{{r|dogan1984}}

==Legacy==
{{Libertarian socialism|Events}}
May 1968 is an important reference point in French politics, representing for some the possibility of liberation and for others the dangers of anarchy.&lt;ref name="Erlanger 2008"&gt;{{cite news |last=Erlanger |first=Steven |title=May 1968 - a watershed in French life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/world/europe/29iht-france.4.12440504.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=31 August 2012 |newspaper=New York Times |date=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called [[new social movements]].&lt;ref&gt;Staricco, Juan Ignacio (2012) https://www.scribd.com/doc/112409042/The-French-May-and-the-Roots-of-Postmodern-Politics&lt;/ref&gt; 

Someone who took part in or supported this period of unrest is referred to as [[Wiktionary:soixante-huitard|soixante-huitard]] - a term, derived from the French for "68", which has also entered the English language.

== In popular culture ==

===Cinema===
* The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Baisers volés]]'' (1968) (in English: "Stolen Kisses"), takes place in Paris during the time of the riots and while not an overtly political film, there are passing references to and images of the demonstrations. The film captures the revolutionary feel of the time and makes perfectly understandable why Truffaut and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] would call for the cancellation of the Cannes Film Festival of 1968. Nothing could go on as it had in the past after May '68, and "Stolen Kisses" itself was a statement of that refusal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* The [[André Cayatte]] film ''[[:fr:Mourir d'aimer (film, 1971)|Mourir d'aimer]]'' (1971) (in English: "To die of love") is strongly based on the true story of [[:fr:Gabrielle Russier|Gabrielle Russier]] (1937-1969), a classics teacher (played by [[Annie Girardot]]) who committed suicide after being sentenced for having had an affair with one of her students during the events of May 68.
* The [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Tout Va Bien]]'' (1972) examines the continuing [[class struggle]] within French society in the aftermath of May '68.
* [[Jean Eustache]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Mother and the Whore]]'', winner of the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes Grand Prix]], references the events of May 1968 and explores the aftermath of the social movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2014/2014-melbourne-international-film-festival-dossier/the-mother-and-the-whore/ |title=The Mother and the Whore |last=Pierquin |first=Martine |date=July 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2017 |work=[[Senses of Cinema]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Claude Chabrol]] film ''[[Nada (1974 film)|Nada]]'' 1974 is based symbolically on the events of May 1968.

* The [[Louis Malle]] film ''[[May Fools]]'' (1990) is a satiric depiction of the effect of French revolutionary fervor of May 1968 on small-town bourgeoisie.
* The [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] film ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'' (2003), based on the novel ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]'' by [[Gilbert Adair]], tells the story of an American university student in Paris during the protests.
* The [[Philippe Garrel]] film ''[[Regular Lovers]]'' (2005) is about a group of young people participating in the Latin Quarter of Paris barricades and how they continue their life one year after.
* In the spy-spoof, ''[[OSS 117: Lost in Rio]]'', the lead character Hubert ironically chides the hippie students, saying, 'It's 1968. There will be no revolution. Get a haircut.' 
* The [[Olivier Assayas|Oliver Assayas]] film ''[[Something in the Air (2012 film)|Something in the Air]]'' (2012) tells the story of a young painter and his friends who bring the revolution to their local school and have to deal with the legal and existential consequences.
* ''[[Redoubtable (film)|Le Redoutable]]'', 2017 - bio-pic of Jean-Luc Godard, covering the 1968 riots/Cannes festival etc.

===Music===
* Many writings of French [[anarchist]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Léo Ferré]] were inspired by those events. Songs directly related to May 1968 are: "L'Été 68", "Comme une fille" (1969), "[[Amour Anarchie|Paris je ne t'aime plus]]" (1970), "[[La Violence et l'Ennui]]" (1971), "[[Il n'y a plus rien]]" (1973), "La Nostalgie" (1979). Many others Ferré's songs share the libertarian feel of that time.
* [[Claude Nougaro]]'s song "Paris Mai" (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|issn=0362-4331|last=Riding|first=Alan|title=Claude Nougaro, French Singer, Is Dead at 74|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2015-11-23|date=2004-03-22|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/22/arts/claude-nougaro-french-singer-is-dead-at-74.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The imaginary Italian clerk described by [[Fabrizio de André]] in his album ''Storia di un impiegato'', is inspired to build a bomb set to explode in front of the Italian parliament by listening to reports of the May events in France, drawn by the perceived dullness and repetitivity of his life compared to the revolutionary developments unfolding in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giannini|first1=Stefano|title=Storia di un impiegato di Fabrizio De André|work=La Riflessione|date=2005|pages=11–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Refused]] song entitled "Protest Song '68" is about the May 1968 protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-4276-9|last1=Kristiansen|first1=Lars J.|last2=Blaney|first2=Joseph R.|last3= Chidester|first3=Philip J.|last4=Simonds|first4=Brent K.|title=Screaming for Change: Articulating a Unifying Philosophy of Punk Rock| date = 2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Stone Roses]]'s song "Bye Bye Badman", from their [[The Stone Roses (album)|eponymous album]], is about the riots. The album's cover has the ''tricolore'' and lemons on the front (which were used to nullify the effects of tear gas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.john-squire.com/art/gallery_byebyebadman.html |title=Bye Bye Badman |publisher=John Squire |author=John Squire |accessdate=3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The music video for the [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] song "I Heard Wonders" is based entirely on the May 1968 protests and alludes to the influence of the [[Situationist International]] on the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cole| first = Brendan|title=David Holmes Interview|work=RTE.ie|format=Articles|accessdate=2015-11-23|date=2008-08-25|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/features/2008/0825/414398-davidholmes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Rolling Stones]] wrote the lyrics to the song "[[Street Fighting Man]]" (set to music of an unreleased song they had already written which had different lyrics) in reference to the May 1968 protests from their perspective, living in a "sleepy London town". The melody of the song was inspired by French police car sirens.&lt;ref&gt;"I wanted the [sings] to sound like a French police siren. That was the year that all that stuff was going on in Paris and in London. There were all these riots that the generation that I belonged to, for better or worse, was starting to get antsy. You could count on somebody in America to find something offensive about something — you still can. Bless their hearts. I love America for that very reason." {{Cite web|last=N.P.R.Staff|title=Keith Richards: 'These Riffs Were Built To Last A Lifetime'|work=NPR.org|accessdate=2015-11-23|url= https://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/165033885/keith-richards-these-riffs-were-built-to-last-a-lifetime}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Vangelis]] released an album in France and Greece entitled ''[[Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit]]'' ("May you make your dreams longer than the night"), which was about the Paris student riots in 1968.  The album contains sounds from the demonstrations, songs, and a news report.  Vangelis would later become famous for film scores for such films as Chariots of Fire and Bladerunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=978-1-4476-2728-9|last=Griffin|first=Mark J. T.|title=Vangelis: The Unknown Man|date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ismael Serrano]]'s song "Papá cuéntame otra vez" ("Papa, tell me again") references the May 1968 events: "Papa, tell me once again that beautiful story, of gendarmes and fascists and long-haired students; and sweet urban war in flared trousers, and songs of the Rolling stones, and girls in miniskirts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mucientes|first=Esther|title=MAYO DEL 68: La música de la revolución|work=elmundo.es|accessdate=2015-11-23|url= http://www.elmundo.es/especiales/2008/04/internacional/mayo_68/canciones/cancion02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Caetano Veloso]]'s song "É Proibido Proibir" takes its title from the May 1968 graffiti of the same name and was a protest song against the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]] that assumed power in Brazil in April 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brutality Garden: Tropicalia and the Emergence of a Brazilian Counterculture|last=Christopher|first=Dunn|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">'''Powder of sympathy''' was a form of sympathetic medicine, current in the 17th century in Europe, whereby a remedy was applied to the weapon that had caused a wound in the hope of healing the injury it had made.

==History==
The method was first proposed by [[Rudolf Goclenius, Jr.]] and was later expanded upon by [[Sir Kenelm Digby]]. In 1658, Digby held a discourse on the sympathetic powder before the [[University of Montpellier]].

The powder is said to have consisted of [[green vitriol]], first dissolved in water and afterward recrystallized or calcined in the sun. The [[Duke of Buckingham]] testified that Digby had healed his secretary of a gangrenous wound by simply soaking the bloody bandage in a solution of the powder (possibly due to the [[oligodynamic effect]]). Digby claimed to have got the secret remedy from a Carmelite monk in Florence, and attributed its potency to the fact that the sun's rays extracted the spirits of the blood and the vitriol, while, at the same time, the heat of the wound caused the healing principle thus produced to be attracted to it by means of a current of air — a sort of wireless therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Fielding H. Garrison]] | title=History of Medicine | edition=3rd | publisher=W. B. Saunders | year=1921 | page=288-289 | url=https://archive.org/details/3edintroductiont00garruoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powder was also applied to solve the [[longitude]] problem in the suggestion of an anonymous pamphlet of 1687 entitled "Curious Enquiries." The pamphlet theorised that a wounded dog could be put aboard a ship, with the animal's discarded bandage left in the trust of a timekeeper on shore, who would then dip the bandage into the powder at a predetermined time and cause the creature to yelp, thus giving the captain of the ship an accurate knowledge of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatra.de/repertorium/ed000184.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''weapon-salve''' (Latin unguentum armarium, Greek hoplocrisma) was a salve which was supposed to cure the wound, being applied to the weapon that made it. The salve consisted of the patient's blood and human fat, the wound itself being wrapped in wet lint. This doctrine was supported by [[Wilhelm Fabry]], [[Robert Fludd]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], who attributed the cure to [[animal magnetism]]. The clergy held that the weapon cure was wrought by magic and the devil, and their view was set forth by [[William Foster (divine)|William Foster]] in ''Hoplocrisma Spongus, or a Sponge to Wipe away the Weapon-Salve'' (1631).

'''Pseudodictionary''' is an [[online]] [[dictionary]] for [[neologism]]s and [[protologism]]s. It was founded in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.pseudodictionary.com] Alexa traffic stats for Pseudodictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Site visitors submit an original word or phrase for inclusion, giving a description and an example. Unlike most collaborative dictionary websites, such as [[Urban Dictionary]] and [[Wiktionary]], Pseudodictionary does not require the word already to have any current or common usage. The site accepts words that have been made up on the spot, including words defined with a humorous intent. Pseudodictionary has some content guidelines: no [[profanity]], no [[toilet humour]], and no [[racist]], [[sexist]], or offensive language. Submittals are reviewed and edited before being posted.

The site was mentioned by [[William Safire]] in  columns he wrote for the ''[[New York Times]]'' on neologisms, in particular the etymology of [[muffin-top]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/magazine/28ONLANGUAGE.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/opinion/28iht-edsafire.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Content from the site has been used in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' newspaper feature on new words.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/News/article/349786]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45965">'''Racial segregation in the [[United States Armed Forces]]''', which has included separation of white and people of color troops, quotas, restriction of  people of color troops to support roles, and  outright bans on blacks and other people of color serving in the military, has been a part of the military history of the United States since the [[American Revolution]].   Each branch of the Armed Forces has historically had different policies regarding racial segregation.  Although  [[Executive Order 9981]] officially ended segregation in the Armed Forces in 1948, following [[World War II]], some forms of racial segregation continued until after the [[Korean War]].

== The American Revolution and the Continental Army==

[[File:Soldiers Bunker Hill.jpg|thumb|Peter Salem shoots Major Pitcairn at Bunker Hill.]]

Before the [[American Revolution]], some blacks had already served in local militias in the [[French and Indian Wars]], and a black man, [[Crispus Attucks]], was one of the first felled at the outset of the American Revolution. Both [[Free negro|free]] and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] black men  fought at the battle of [[Lexington and Concord]] and the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]].  However,  at  the beginning of the Revolutionary War, many whites in power were reluctant to allow blacks to carry arms, because of fears of an armed slave  insurrection.  One of [[George Washington|George Washington's]] first acts as commander in chief was to sign an order forbidding the recruitment of all blacks. The British took advantage of this and  recruited thousands of  black men to the [[Loyalist]] side.  Because of a shortage in manpower George Washington  quickly relented and allowed black soldiers to serve in the [[Continental Army]]. One state, [[Rhode Island]],  had an all black unit, and  enslaved black soldiers in the unit  were freed at the end of the war. In the rest of the military units, blacks  served side by side with whites.  One historian commented that the military during this time was more integrated than it would be until the Korean War.  Many of these black soldiers, however, fought as slaves and continued as slaves after the war.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.army.mil/article/97705/Black_Soldiers_in_the_Revolutionary_War&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William W. Burrows.jpg|thumb|Marine Commandant [[William Ward Burrows I|William Ward Burrows]] enforced a policy against enlisting "Blacks and Mulattoes".&lt;ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/&gt;]]

==United States Army==

After the creation  of the [[Militia Acts of 1792|Federal Militia Acts of 1792]], the Army excluded black men, and, with very few exceptions,  the prohibition remained in effect until the second year of the Civil War.&lt;ref name="navyandmarine.org"&gt;http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862blackinblue.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===

Because of exclusion from the U.S. Army,  most blacks either served in the U.S. Navy or defected to the British Navy to gain their freedom.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wned/war-of-1812/essays/black-soldier-and-sailors-war/&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of African Americans in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] is marked by 186,097 (7,122 officers, 178,975 enlisted) African-American men, comprising 163 units, who served in the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Aptheker, "Negro Casualties in the Civil War", ''The Journal of Negro History,'' Vol. 32, No. 1. (Jan., 1947), pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional African Americans served in the [[Union Navy]]. Both free African Americans and fugitive slaves joined the fight. On the Confederate side, blacks, both free and slave, were used for labor, but the issue of whether to arm them, and under what terms, became a major source of debate among Southerners. At the start of the war, a Louisiana Confederate [[militia]] unit composed of free blacks from the extensive [[New Orleans]] Creoles of color was raised, but never accepted into Confederate service.  On March 13, 1865 the Confederate Congress enacted a statute to allow the enlistment of African Americans but fewer than fifty were recruited.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Asian Americans|Asian]], [[Pacific Islander]]  and [[Hispanic]] troops also served with African-Americans in the [[United States Colored Troops]], and a few served with white troops.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Y. Okihiro, ''American History Unbound: Asians and Pacific Islanders'', Univ. of California Press, Aug 25, 2015, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native Americans in the Civil War|Native Americans,]] such as General [[Stand Watie]]'s Confederate [[Cherokee]] Battalion, fought in their own tribal regiments or battalions on both sides of the Civil War.

[[File:King, Stoddard WW1 draft card.jpg|thumb|WWI draft card.  Lower left corner to be removed by men of African background to help keep military segregated]]
The American military was entirely [[racial segregation|segregated]] for African Americans during World War I. Although the military training of black Americans was  opposed by [[white supremacist]] politicians such as Sen. [[James K. Vardaman]] (D-Mississippi) and Sen. [[Benjamin Tillman]] (D-South Carolina), the decision was  made to include [[African-Americans]] in the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|1917 draft]].&lt;ref name=Williams53&gt;Chad L. Williams, ''Torchbearers of Democracy: African American Soldiers in the World War I Era''. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2010; pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 290,527 black Americans were ultimately registered for the draft.

Draft board officials were instructed to tear off the lower left corner of the Selective Service forms filled out by black registrants to mark these for segregated units.&lt;ref name=Williams53 /&gt; The August 1917 [[Houston Riot (1917)|Houston Riot]] of armed African-American soldiers spurred by racist behavior by some Houston police officials additionally shaped the War Department's decision-making, and the great majority of black soldiers were assigned jobs like the building of roads, unloading of shipping, and other forms of common labor.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Torchbearers of Democracy'', pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two combat units of African-Americans were  established — the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd]] and [[93rd Infantry Division (United States)|93rd Infantry Divisions]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Torchbearers of Democracy'', pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Including volunteers,  350,000 African-Americans served in the American Expeditionary Force on the western front. One combat unit,  the 369th Infantry "[[Harlem Hell Fighters|Hell Fighters from Harlem]]" were awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] by the French allies for their bravery and competence in combat.

====Hispanic-Americans====

The 65th Infantry Regiment, created during World War I,  was the U.S. Military's last segregated unit composed primarily of [[Hispanic]] soldiers, mostly of Puerto Rican descent, as well as immigrants from Latin America and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.army.mil/hispanics/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asian-Americans====

Asian-Americans fought in integrated units during  World War I, and non-citizens were offered citizenship after the war as a result of their service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/diversity.html "The Army and Diversity", U.S. Army Center of Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the [[United States Army]] established several new segregated units, and maintained several historic segregated units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nisei Linguists: Japanese Americans in the Military Intelligence Service During World War II |last=McNaughton |first=James C. |year=2006 |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-072957-2 |page=87 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/nisei_linguists/CMH_70-99-1.pdf |accessdate=26 May 2011 |quote=The War Department already had several long-serving segregated units for African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Filipinos and established several more during 1942.

====African-Americans====

[[File:African-americans-wwii-002.jpg|thumb|A [[Military Police]]man on a motorcycle in front of the "colored" MP entrance, Columbus, Georgia, in 1942.]]

When the U.S. entered World War II,  [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow segregation]] had permeated every aspect of American society. When black men volunteered for duty or were drafted, they were assigned to segregated divisions and often given combat support roles, such as cook, quartermaster and grave-digging duty.  According to British personnel in the BEF, meals in the US Army were served with the white servicemen being served in one line and the black servicemen and officers in another.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}  Because of black protests against the Army's treatment  of its black soldiers, military leadership began to attempt to address the issue beginning in 1943, but segregation in the armed forces remained official policy until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-was-black-americas-double-war/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of 18 female African-American nurses who had served in World War I, the [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army Nurse Corps]], established in 1901, remained white until 1941, when pressure from the [[National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], caused the  Army to admit black nurses.  A [[Racial quota|quota]] of 48 nurses was set, and the women were segregated from white nurses and white soldiers for much of the war. Eventually more black nurses enlisted.  They were  assigned to care for black soldiers, and  served in the China-Burma-India theater, Australia, New Guinea, Liberia, England and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-05-28/news/0105280153_1_black-nurses-ww-ii-phd&lt;/ref&gt; African American women were in all fields of service for WW2.

====Japanese-Americans====

After the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], men of Japanese birth and descent were classified as enemy aliens and excluded from the United States draft. In addition, on the US mainland, the federal government forced most ethnic Japanese Americans to relocate from Pacific coastal areas to [[internment camps]] located inland of the Pacific and controlled by armed guards. It was not until 1944 that a fighting unit of Japanese-American Nisei (American-born) men were recruited and trained for military service. Japanese Americans were allowed to join only the Army, not the Navy, Marines or Air Corps.&lt;ref name=NCPD/&gt; The [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Infantry Regiment]], consisting primarily of Japanese Americans, fought in Europe.

Japanese Americans already in training at the start of the war had been removed from active duty shortly after [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the Army stopped accepting new ''[[Nisei]]'' recruits in early 1942.&lt;ref name=Niiya&gt;{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Brian |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Milton%20Eisenhower/ |title=Milton Eisenhower |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Japanese American leaders like [[Mike Masaoka]] and [[U.S. Department of War|War Department]] officials like [[John J. McCloy]] soon began to push the Roosevelt administration to allow ''Nisei'' to serve in combat. A military board was convened in June 1942 to address the issue, but their final report opposed forming a ''Nisei'' unit, citing "the universal distrust in which they [Japanese Americans] are held."&lt;ref&gt;Duus, Masayo. ''Unlikely Liberators: The Men of the 100th and the 442nd'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1987), p 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite resistance from military and [[War Relocation Authority]] leaders, the President eventually sided with the War Department, and on February 1, 1943, Roosevelt announced the creation of a segregated battalion composed of ''Nisei'' soldiers and commanded by white officers.

====Chinese Americans====

Unlike the Japanese Americans, 75% of Chinese American soldiers served in non-segregated units.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rudi (3 June 2005). "DoD's Personnel Chief Gives Asian-Pacific American History Lesson". American Forces Press Service. U.S. Department of Defense. Retrieved 26 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  An estimated 13,000 Chinese-Americans served in World War II, with two units consisting of only Chinese-Americans, the 407th Air Service Squadron, and the 987th Signal  Company, based in the China,  Burma and India Theater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/WWII-all-Chinese-American-unit-reminisces-3215751.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Air Force==

When the  [[United States Army Air Service]], the precursor to the Air Force, was formed in 1918, only whites were allowed.

===Tuskegee Airmen===
{{main|Tuskegee Airmen}}

[[File:Tuskegee Squadron 001 MRR 3rdfromLeft.jpg|left|thumb]]

The [[Tuskegee]] Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States armed forces. During World War II, African Americans in southern states were still subject to the [[Jim Crow laws]].{{#tag:ref|US state and local laws enacted between 1876 and 1965 that mandated ''de jure'' racial segregation in all public activities were collectively known as the "Jim Crow laws"; the name derivation from a contemporary pejorative for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and McFeely 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The American military was [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]], as was much of the federal government. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to racial discrimination, both within and outside the army. Despite these adversities, they trained and flew with distinction. All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Tuskegee, including five [[Haitian people|Haitians]].

Although the 477th Bombardment Group "worked up" on [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bombers, they never served in combat. The Tuskegee [[332nd Fighter Group]] was the only operational unit, first sent overseas as part of [[Operation Torch]], then seeing action in Sicily and Italy. They were deployed as [[escort fighter|bomber escorts]] in Europe, where they were very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Homan and Reilly (2001), pp. 81–83, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===

At the beginning of the war, official U.S. policy  forbade the recruitment of black sailors.  However, a  shortage of manpower forced the Navy to accept any able-bodied man. Modern estimates place the number of black sailors serving in the War of 1812 at 15-20 % of naval manpower.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Brodine, Michael J. Crawford and Christine F. Hughes, editors, Ironsides! ''The Ship, the Men and the Wars of the USS Constitution'' (Fireship Press, 2007), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  On some [[privateers]], non-military ships which harassed British merchant vessels,  more than half of the crew was black. Life in the cramped quarters of the ships created a more egalitarian camaraderie, as well as mutual respect based on performance. However, many enslaved American blacks defected to the [[British Navy]] after the British promised them freedom in return for their service.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;  In a letter to Commodore Perry, who had complained about being given black crew members,  Commodore Chauncy wrote that he had fifty black sailors on his ship, called them "excellent seamen" and said,  "I have yet to learn that the color of skin, or the cut and trimmings of the coat, can affect a man's qualifications and usefulness."&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; Just before the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] Commodore [[Joshua Barney]], on being asked by President [[James Madison]] "...if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British?" replied: “No Sir…they don't know how to run; they will die by their guns first." &lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Dowling Taylor ''A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madison’s'' Palgrave (McMillen: New York 2012), p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commodore was correct, the men did not run, one such man was young sailor Harry Jones a free black. Jones was wounded in the final action at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] when Commodore Barney's Naval and Marine contingent were overrun. He remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington DC for nearly two months.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of Patients at Naval Hospital Washington DC 1814 With the Names of American Wounded from the Battle of Bladensburg'' Transcribed with Introduction and Notes by John G.

[[Michael Shiner]], 1805 -1880 a black man who worked in the [[Washington DC Navy Yard|Washington DC Navy yard]] in the early to mid 19th century,  chronicled the War of 1812 as well as the racial tension of the era in his diary.&lt;ref&gt;''The Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813-1869'' editor John G.

===Civil War===

Unlike the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy was integrated during the Civil War. During the 1840s, federal regulations limited black sailors to 5 percent of the enlisted force, but during the [[American Civil War]] black participation grew to  20 per cent of the Union navy's total enlisted force, nearly double the percentage that served in the Army.    Almost eighteen thousand men of African descent, and eleven women,  served in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War.  The ranking and status of black crew members depended on whether they had come on board as free or formerly enslaved, with the latter classified as "Boys" and given lower pay and rating.&lt;ref name="navyandmarine.org"/&gt;

===World War I===

On Navy ships,  black sailors frequently worked as mess attendants, firemen, or coal passers,  who hauled massive quantities of coal to fuel the ships. They were also promoted to petty officers. Navy ships continued to be integrated.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/negro-navy-by-miller.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.steelnavy.org/history/exhibits/show/steelnavy/hardlife/coal&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

====African-Americans====

In June 1940 the Navy had 4,007 African-American personnel, representing 2.3 percent of its total strength of nearly 170,000.  All of these African Americans were enlisted men, and with the exception of six regular-rated seamen, all were steward's mates. They were characterized by the black press as "seagoing bellhops."  Within a month after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the number of African Americans in the Navy had increased to 5,026; however, they were still restricted to working as steward's mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=INTEGRATION OF THE ARMED FORCES 1940-1965 |first=Morris J. |last=MacGregor, Jr. |publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army |location=Washington, D.C. |year=1985 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/integration/IAF-03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destroyer-escort [[USS Mason (DE-529)|USS Mason]] was the only Navy vessel in World War II with an entirely black crew who were not cooks or waiters.   In 1995, 11 surviving crew members were all given belated recognition and letters of commendation from Navy Secretary John Dalton for having braved harsh weather and quickly welding the cracks in their ship so they could continue escorting support ships to England.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/us/black-crew-of-world-war-ii-navy-ship-recognized-for-heroism.html Black Crew of World War II Navy Ship Recognized for Heroism"], ''New York Times,''  Published: February 19, 1995, Retrieved October 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy did not allow women of color until January 25, 1945. The first African-American woman sworn into the Navy was Phyllis Mae Dailey, a nurse and Columbia University student from New York. She was the first of only four African American women to serve in the navy during WW2.&lt;ref&gt;Roussel, Meg. "Phyllis Mae Dailey: First Black Navy Nurse - The National WWII Museum Blog."

Publicity surrounding the [[Port Chicago disaster]] on July 17, 1944 and the ensuing mutiny convictions of 50 black sailors spotlighted racism in the Navy and was a major impetus for Circular Order 48-46,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacGregor |first1=Morris J. |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-1965 |date=1981 |publisher=Government Printing Office |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIsbUaQf-DkC |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; published on February 27, 1946, which desegregated the Navy.

In 1776 and 1777, a dozen [[African American|Black American]] Marines served in the [[American Revolutionary War]], but from 1798 to 1942, the USMC followed a racially discriminatory policy of denying African Americans the opportunity to serve as Marines. For more than 140 years, the Marines recruited primarily [[European American]]s and [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white Hispanics]], along with a few [[Asian American]]s.

The USMC opened its doors to blacks in June 1942, with the acceptance of African Americans as recruits in segregated all-black units. Other races were accepted somewhat more easily, joining white Marine units. For the next few decades, the incorporation of black troops was not widely accepted within the Corps, nor was desegregation smoothly or quickly achieved. Spurred by [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]] in 1941 and 1948, the integration of non-white USMC personnel proceeded in stages from segregated battalions in 1942, to unified training in 1949, and finally full integration in 1960.&lt;ref name=Ebony1969/&gt;

===Background===

The first black American to fight in a Marine role was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig [[USS Reprisal (1776)|USS ''Reprisal'']]. Martin served with the Marine platoon on the ''Reprisal'' for a year and a half, involved in hard ship-to-ship fighting, but was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in October 1777.&lt;ref name=ShawDonnelly2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Blacks%20in%20the%20Marine%20Corps%20%20PCN%2019000306200_1.pdf|title=Blacks in the Marine Corps |last1=Shaw |first1=Henry I., Jr. |last2=Donnelly |first2=Ralph W. |publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters USMC |location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 12 other black men served with various American Marine units in 1776–1777; more may have been in service but not identified as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the Marine Corps was officially re-instituted, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[James McHenry]] specified in its rules: "No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted".&lt;ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/&gt; Marine Commandant [[William Ward Burrows I|William Ward Burrows]] instructed his recruiters regarding USMC racial policy, "You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you recruit, but you cannot enlist them."&lt;ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/&gt; This policy was in line with long-standing British naval practice which set a higher standard of unit cohesion for Marines so that they would remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies.&lt;ref name=ShawDonnelly2002/&gt;

The Marine Corps, being a combat arm of the Navy, did not recruit any black soldiers. Instead, the USMC was serviced by US Navy supply personnel including black laborers. Unlike the US Army which had separate regiments that a soldier could remain in for his entire military career, Marines were individually transferred to various ship's detachments and naval bases. After World War I, the number of blacks in both the Navy and the Army was reduced to about 1.5% of the total number of active servicemen, a proportion much lower than the number of blacks in the general population.&lt;ref name="MacGregor Ch.1"/&gt;

===Franklin Roosevelt administration===
[[File:FDRfiresidechat2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] prohibited racial discrimination in the military.]]

During the administration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], the growing political power of African Americans was increasingly felt in Washington, DC. Civil rights groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the [[National Urban League]], and the [[National Negro Congress]] called for greater equality between the races. In 1938, the [[Committee on Participation of Negroes in the National Defense Program]] was formed by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a newspaper with a large black readership. Further calls to increase the proportion of blacks in the military were published in 1939.&lt;ref name="MacGregor Ch.1"/&gt;

After wars broke out in the late 1930s in Africa, China and Europe, black community leaders determined to use the black workforce's loyalty as leverage to gain greater racial equality at home. In June 1940, the NAACP's magazine, ''[[The Crisis]]'', published a declaration that the fighting around the world was certainly bad, "but the hysterical cries of the preachers of democracy for Europe leave us cold. We want democracy in Alabama, Arkansas, in Mississippi and Michigan, in the District of Columbia, in the Senate of the United States."&lt;ref name="MacGregor Ch.1"/&gt; During the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]], both parties courted the black vote. Incumbent President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was re-elected, partly because substantial numbers of black voters crossed previous party lines and voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate.

In April 1941 the US Navy convened its General Board to discuss expansion of the USMC. Major General [[Thomas Holcomb]], Commandant of the Marines, who lived in Delaware and Washington, DC in his early years and attended private schools, said that African Americans had no right to serve as Marines. He said, "If it were a question of having a Marine Corps of 5,000 whites or 250,000 Negroes, I would rather have the whites."&lt;ref name=Integration&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIsbUaQf-DkC&amp;pg=PA100 |pages=100–102 |title=Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940–1965 |last=MacGregor |first=Morris J. |publisher=Government Printing Office |year=1981 |editor=Center of Military History, U.S. Army |isbn=0-16-001925-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, civil rights activists [[Bayard Rustin]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], and [[A. J. Muste]] pushed Roosevelt to order fair employment for blacks in the federal government. The activists threatened to march on Washington, DC, in July 1941, and Roosevelt intended to prevent such a public relations disaster for his presidency. On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]]; the elimination of racial discrimination from federal departments, agencies, the military, and from private defense contractors. The black activists cancelled their planned march.

Directed by Roosevelt and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|US Navy Secretary]] [[Frank Knox]] to accept black recruits, Holcomb proposed a separate battalion of African Americans, a seacoast [[Marine defense battalions|defense battalion]] armed with anti-aircraft and anti-shipping artillery. To make this battalion self-supporting, Holcomb determined that it would contain a rifle company, special weapons platoons, and a light tank platoon—all manned by black Marines.&lt;ref name=Integration/&gt;

===World War II===

In early 1942, [[Philip Johnston (code talker)|Philip Johnston]], a U.S. Army veteran of World War I, suggested to the USMC that they follow the example of the Army and recruit native speakers of the [[Navajo language]] to pass important tactical messages by radio, to serve as [[code talkers]] on the battlefield. On May 5, 1942, the first group of 29 Navajo recruits was accepted at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]].&lt;ref name=WW2Faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq61-2.htm |publisher=U.S. Naval Historical Center |title=Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942 to 1945, some 375 to 420 [[Navajo people|Navajo]] trained as code talkers, part of about 540 Marines who were native Navajo speakers during World War II.

On June 1, 1942, the initial group of black USMC recruits was admitted, but they were not immediately trained because separate, segregated facilities had not been completed. Black volunteers began their basic training in August at [[Camp Gilbert H. Johnson|Montford Point]] in North Carolina, a satellite base to Marine Barracks, New River, later called [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]]. The first black recruit to arrive in camp was Howard P. Perry on August 26, followed that day by 12 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8E27gNaezoC&amp;pg=PA5 |pages=5–6|last=DeClouet |first=Fred |title=First Black Marines: Vanguard of a Legacy |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2000|isbn=1-58820-120-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and subsequent recruits were organized into the 51st Composite Defense Battalion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/storyview.aspx?SID=2444 |title=Montford Point Marines pioneered Corps’ history |publisher=Marine Corps Base Quantico |first=Meloney R. |last=Moses |date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a static artillery unit intended to hold land against attack.

By October 29, only 647 of a planned 1,200 recruits had passed entrance examinations—to avoid forming segregated training units to teach typing, truck driving and other specialist skills necessary to run the battalion, Holcomb required more than half of the recruits to demonstrate proficiency in these skills prior to acceptance.&lt;ref name=Integration/&gt; This requirement was dropped in view of the delay it caused in bringing the battalion up to strength. Recruits were taught specialist skills by white USMC instructors brought into Montford Point, or they were sent to nearby Army classes.&lt;ref name=Integration/&gt;

The black recruits were not allowed in Camp Lejeune unless accompanied by a white Marine, and their service papers were stamped "Colored".&lt;ref name=AARegistry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/marine-corps-integrates |title=Marine Corps Integrates!|publisher=African American Registry |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the U.S. was by this time fully engaged in war, the recruits were assigned to inactive duty in the Marine Corps Reserve. Their units were segregated—all the enlisted servicemen were black, with white officers and [[drill instructor]]s. The commander of the black Marines at Montford Point was [[Samuel A. Woods Jr]] who worked to enforce segregation, protecting his troops from being detained by local authorities while they were visiting town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805130439/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/usmc/pcn-190-003132-00/sec3.htm|archivedate=August 5, 2012 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/usmc/pcn-190-003132-00/sec3.htm|last=Nalty |first=Bernard C. |title=The Right to Fight: African-American Marines in World War II |work=Marines in World War II Commemorative Series |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1943, the white drill instructors were leaving for war and were being replaced by black sergeants and corporals.&lt;ref name=AARegistry/&gt;

After accepting more black recruits, the USMC formed the 52nd Defense Battalion. Both the 51st and 52nd shipped out to fight in the [[Pacific War]], but as defense units holding land far behind the front lines they did not see much action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arI0HSFXwLkC&amp;pg=PA477 |page=477 |title=African Americans at War: An Encyclopedia |last=Sutherland |first=Jonathan |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-57607-746-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 19,168 African Americans joined the Marines, about 4% of the USMC's strength; some 75% of them performed their duties overseas. About 8,000 black USMC stevedores and ammunition handlers served under enemy fire during offensive operations in the Pacific. Following the June 1944 [[Battle of Saipan]], USMC General [[Alexander Vandegrift]] said of the steadfast performance of the all-black 3d Marine Ammunition Company: "The Negro Marines are no longer on trial.

===1946 to 1960===

[[File:US Soldiers Korean War.jpg|thumb|U.S. soldiers in the Korean War]]

After World War II, the USMC reduced in size; the number of African-American Marines dropped to 2,000 men, which was one-tenth of wartime levels.&lt;ref name=Ebony1969/&gt; In 1947, the Marine Corps forced African-American men to choose between leaving the service or becoming a steward (a food service position).&lt;ref name=Ebony1969/&gt; A few non-white Marines advanced in grade, such as [[Kurt Chew-Een Lee]], a Chinese-American soldier who was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1946. Lee earned the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] under fire in Korea in September 1950, serving in the [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]]; at the time this was a primarily Euro-American unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/military//korea/factsheets/asian.html |title=Asian-Americans in the United States Military during the Korean War |publisher=New Jersey Korean War Memorial |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey |work=Factsheet|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] issued [[Executive Order 9981]] establishing equality of treatment and opportunity in the U.S. military regardless of race. He appointed the [[President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services]], two of whose five members were African American. In January 1949, the Fahy Committee (nicknamed after its chairman) met to hear concerns by armed forces' leaders about the new executive order, and both the Army and the Marine Corps leadership defended their practices of segregation. The Navy and the newly formed [[United States Air Force]] announced their intentions to follow the order. The USMC said that it had only one black officer among 8,200 white ones.&lt;ref name=TrumanChronology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/desegregation/large/index.php?action=chronology|title=Desegregation of the Armed Forces: Chronology |publisher=Harry S. Truman Library |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1949, all-black USMC units persisted, but the Marines had black and white recruits beginning to train together. The few black USMC officers were assigned exclusively to black units; they were not asked to lead white Marines into combat. In 1952 after two years of the [[Korean War]], the Marines cautiously integrated blacks into combat units.&lt;ref name=Ebony1969/&gt; In the late 1950s, black Marines were not rewarded with preferred or high-visibility assignments, such as embassy guard duty and guard duty in the nation's capital.&lt;ref name=Ebony1969/&gt; By 1960, full integration of the races had been completed by the USMC, but racial tensions flared up through the next decade, a period of [[civil rights]] [[activism]] in the larger society.&lt;ref name=Ebony1969/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21630">'''The Ranally city rating system''' is a tool developed by [[Rand McNally]] &amp; Co. to classify U.S. cities based on their economic function.  The system is designed to reflect an underlying hierarchy whereby consumers and businesses go to a city of a certain size for a certain function; some functions are widely available and others are only available in the largest cities.

The system was developed for Rand McNally by geographer [[Richard L. Forstall]] and released in 1964.  The city rankings are updated periodically in the ''Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide'', an annual two-volume set, which is available in many libraries.  Among the criteria for categorization are retail sales, newspaper circulation, and the presence of universities and hospitals and corporate headquarters.  The size of the city's tributary area is critical to determining whether it will be rated a 2, 3, or 4.  As of 2006, there are 1492 cities rated.

The system consists of a number and a letter.  The number reflects a city's importance in the national hierarchy. Nationally important business centers are ranked 1.  Regional business centers are ranked 2.  Significant local business centers are ranked 3 and business centers whose importance is purely local are ranked 4.  the letter reflects its importance in its own area.  Doubled letters serve to distinguish centers within a class. The most important center in a market (trading area) is given some kind of A.  Other business centers in the same market area will be given B or C depending on their importance.   For example, Dallas is rated 1-AA (a nationally important business center) and Fort Worth is rated 2-BB.  B cities constitute basic trading centers, while C cities do not.

Rand McNally divides the country into [[Basic Trading Area|basic trading areas]] (487 as of 2008), each of which has exactly one A-rated city.  The basic trading areas are aggregated into major trading areas, of which there are 51.  The [[Federal Communications Commission]] uses these areas for determining wireless territory boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/data/maps/mta.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City]] has always been given the unique rating '''1-AAAA''' due to its preeminent status in the national hierarchy.  [[Chicago]] was originally the only other city rated '''1-AAA''' as having influence over a large area of the country.  In 1988, [[Los Angeles]] was similarly given a 1-AAA rating.  Thirteen cities are given the rating '''1-AA''' as major national business centers:  [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], [[Cleveland]], [[Dallas]], [[Detroit]], [[Houston]], [[Miami]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].

Notes: The B and C cities are secondary because they are in the same market area as a city rated A.

While those are only abstract examples of the ratings, consider how the system works in practice with the example of Ohio.  Rand McNally conceives of Ohio as consisting of nineteen markets (trading areas) with some peripheral counties being contained in trading areas of other states.  The table below shows the nineteen trading areas in order of hierarchy.  Each has an A-rated city.  Some also have other rated cities and suburbs.

The system is applied by businesses seeking to serve a network of customers with the greatest efficiency.  For example, a company that services elevators or a wholesaler of paper bags would want to locate its field representatives primarily in A rated cities.  The Rural Health Research Center at the [[University of Minnesota]] has recently published a report on access to physicians in rural areas which uses the system to evaluate access to physicians in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Moscovice, et al., "Options for Increasing the Supply of Primary Care Physicians in Rural Minnesota," Rural Health Research Center, Division of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, January 2008, {{cite web |url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/5699/1/Increase_PC_Phy_Supply_in_Rural_MN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091922/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/5699/1/Increase_PC_Phy_Supply_in_Rural_MN.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine Ruth Savord''' (2 November 1894 – 25 February 1966) was a librarian and the author of several books and articles on library work. She served as the first Chief Librarian of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]]. 

==Education==

Savord graduated from Sandusky High School and the school of Library Science at [[Case Western University]] in Cleveland. She was also enrolled at the [[University of Illinois]], where she held a position in the Catalog Department of the university library.

==Career==

Savord began her career in approximately 1910, when she became an apprentice at the Sandusky Library. After her graduation from Case Western University, she worked in the Catalog Department of the [[Cleveland Public Library]]. During [[World War I]], she relocated to New York City and worked for the Western Union Telegraph Company; after the war, she was employed by the [[Newark Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Sandusky Register'' (1932). March 27, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savord assisted [[Helen Clay Frick]] in organizing the Frick Art Reference Library, an institution dedicated to serving the art and art history research community that Miss Frick had founded in 1920 as a memorial to her father, the collector [[Henry Clay Frick]]. Savord had been recommended by a close friend, and Miss Frick was impressed by Savord's "excellent mind," work ethic, and sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Katharine McCook (1979). ''The Story of the Frick Art Reference Library: The Early Years''. New York: The Library, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first entry in the library's diary, dated Monday, 8 November 1920, a note in longhand records that "Ruth Savord began work as a librarian ... She and Miss Frick began cutting up a few things on hand and working out forms, etc." — a reference to the Library's early collection of study images, many of which were removed from pamphlets and catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (1990). "Frick Art Reference Library is Obliged to Seek Funds." December 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1921, Savord accompanied Miss Frick on a six-week research trip to [[London]] where they studied the famous photograph collection of the British art historian [[Sir Robert Witt]] in his library at 32 [[Portman Square]]. On their return, Savord developed a cataloging system for the Frick Art Reference Library's growing collection of study images, which involved the adaption of principles ordinarily applied to books, and launched two initiatives: the development of a book collection and a program to photograph works of art in private collections, objects that were little known to the scholarly community.&lt;ref&gt; Knox (1979), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Savord also assisted in developing the staff of the Library and acquiring rare sales catalogs, a collection that has become one of the largest of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brill News (2012). "Brill Will Digitize Art Sales Catalogues from the Frick Art Reference Library in New York." March 20. [http://www.brill.com/news/brill-will-digitize-art-sales-catalogues-frick-art-reference-library-new-york/ News]. Retrieved 10 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savord left her position at the Frick Art Reference Library in 1924 to assist in the reorganization of the library of the [[General Education Board]]. After holding positions with the International Education Board as well as the advertising firm [[BBDO|Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn]], Savord extended her field into international relations and actively contributed to the organization of the library of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York City. She served as the institution's Librarian from 1932 to about 1962. Her work for the Council led to the compilation of a directory on international affairs, her first major publication.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sandusky Register'' (1966). February 28, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; She also served as the President of the [[Special Libraries Association]] from 1934 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Special Libraries Association: Past Presidents (2015). [http://www.sla.org/past-presidents/ List of Past Presidents]. Retrieved 10 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to her field, she noted that special librarianship "offers an outlet ... for the one whose primary interest is in people, in new and interesting contacts, and in books as tools; for the one with the sleuthing instinct for the obscure or the not-yet-in-print information which is demanded today by our highly competitive world. It is not for the one seeking a quiet atmosphere of repose; nor for the one who is interested primarily in increasing the desire to read and in fostering the cultural side of life."&lt;ref&gt;Savord, Ruth. ''Special Librarianship as a Career.'' New London: Institute of Women’s Professional Relations, 1942, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions are most commonly used in the field of emergency medicine by first responders during the secondary assessment. It is used for alert people, but often much of this information can also be obtained from the family or friend of an unresponsive person. In the case of severe trauma, this portion of the assessment is less important. A derivative of SAMPLE history is AMPLE history which places a greater emphasis on a person's medical history.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition|last=Marx|first=J|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-05472-0|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
The parts of the mnemonic are:

*S – Signs/Symptoms (Symptoms are important but they are subjective.) 
*A – Allergies
*M – Medications
*P – Past Illnesses
*L – Last Oral Intake (Sometimes also Last Menstrual Cycle.)

It is a registered Scottish charity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oscr.org.uk/search-charity-register/charity-extract/?charitynumber=sc032276&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the Society is open to all persons and institutions interested in its work. There is a governing council which manages the affairs of the society. George MacKenzie, former Keeper of the Records of Scotland and Registrar General, is President. The Chairman is Tristram Clarke. The Honorary Treasurer is Tessa Spencer. The Honorary Secretary is Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown.

During its first decade the Society concentrated on transcribing and publishing detailed indices of testaments (wills) proved in Scottish Commissariot Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/scottishrecsociety.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807140322/http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/scottishrecsociety.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soviet Union stamp catalogue''' (or '''CPA catalogue''') is a national [[stamp catalog|catalogue]] of the [[RSFSR]] and [[USSR]] [[postage stamp]]s and [[miniature sheet]]s, which was being published in the USSR by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Soyuzpechat|WD=Q4261829|lt=“Soyuzpechat” Central Philatelic Agency}} (CPA) and some other publishers related to the [[Ministry of Communications (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Communications]]. The catalogue usually republished in corpore around once in a 10–15 years. In between republications, additional issues came out every year. These issues contains descriptions of stamps and miniature sheets issued in USSR last year.

== History ==
=== Early issues ===
The first Soviet catalogue appeared in 1923 under the editorship of {{Interlanguage link multi|Feodor Chuchin|WD=Q4518389}}. In what follows, several more catalogues were published under his editorship in 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Significance of {{nobr|F. G. Chuchin's}} role in compiling and publishing of the 1920s catalogs is contested in [http://www.bonistikaweb.ru/bibluogr.htm web-publication (ru)] of {{nobr|E. Gribanov}} and {{nobr|V. Rakhilin}} on the [http://www.bonistikaweb.ru/index.html “Бонистика” (ru)] site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth edition of the [[Soviet Philatelic Association]] catalogue published in 1933 under the editorship of {{nobr|V. Modestov}} also included a listing of the USSR {{Interlanguage link multi|Postage advertising stamp|WD=Q4375386|lt=postage advertising stamps}} as well.

=== Postwar issues ===
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:1958 USSR Stamps catalogue page.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;small&gt;First page from the 1958 Catalogue of USSR postage stamps&lt;/small&gt;]] --&gt;
In 1948 and 1951, two more catalogues of the USSR postage stamps were published by the Philatelic Bureau under the Book-selling Association of State Publishers (KOGIZ).

This first [[Great Patriotic War|postwar]] catalogue included all the RSFSR and USSR postage [[Issue (legal)|issues]], which appeared from 1921 to 1948, and stamps of the previous issues (circulated in 1918–1921) as well as special purpose stamps.

In 1955, in Moscow the next edition of the Soviet Union stamp catalogue was published. It was compiled by a team of authors including {{nobr|M. T. Mil'kin}}, {{nobr|A. A. Shirokov}}, {{nobr|A. S. Chumakov}}, and {{nobr|A. Ya. Zezin}}. It was printed by the Chief Philatelic Bureau of the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Culture of the RSFSR.

In 1970, a new edition, ''The Catalogue of Postage Stamps of the USSR, 1918–1969'', was published in Moscow. It was supplemented yearly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Владинец, Н. И.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">The '''sunrise period''' of domain registration is a special period during which trademark holders may preregister names that are the same or similar to their trademarks in order to avoid [[cybersquatting]]. This occurs prior to the general launch of the [[top-level domain]] (TLD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindsandmachines.com/services/sunrise-period/ Minds + Machines Sunrise Period]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to register, the group or individual must be able to prove their prior right to the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurid.eu/en/about/facts-figures/sunrise .eu Sunrise Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; The sunrise period serves as a test period, and is followed by the [[landrush period]] and/or General Availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindsandmachines.com/services/landrush-period/ Minds + Machines Landrush Period]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunrise rules for the New gTLD Program==
In October 2013, the [[Trademark Clearinghouse]] announced new rules for Sunrise periods for new [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs) that were rolling out as part of the [[Generic top-level domain#New top-level domains|New gTLD Program]]. There are now two types of Sunrise Periods:

===End Date Sunrise===
In this type of Sunrise, the Registry can announce the Sunrise as late as the day the Sunrise starts, but must run the Sunrise for 60 days or more. Trademark owners will have the duration of the Sunrise period to submit a claim for a domain. At the end of the period, all the claims are registered by the Registry and auctions are conducted if there is more than one claim for the same domain. This type of Sunrise has significant benefits for rights holders.

===Start Date Sunrise===
In this type of Sunrise, the Registry must give 30-days notice before commencing the Sunrise. Once the Sunrise starts, it must run for at least 30 days or more. Claims by trademark owners are processed on a first-come-first-served basis, so there is no need for auctions and domains are registered as claims are made during the Sunrise period. This type of Sunrise has so far been very rare among New gTLD strings, and has benefits for Registries while causing concerns for rights holders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domainincite.com/14627-first-come-first-served-sunrise-periods-on-the-cards First Come First Served Sunrise Periods On the Cards, DomainIncite] Retrieved 24 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunrise Domain Name Registration==
Trademark Holders have first right to register their trademarked terms. Every new gTLD is required to organize a Sunrise Period of at least 30 days before domain names are offered to the general public. If a company/business or an individual is interested in protecting their brand in the New gTLD era, they should register as trademark holder or trademark agent with Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademark-clearinghouse.com/ The Trademark Clearinghouse TMCH]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon a successful registration, they will be able to submit their trademark records and be eligible for trademark claims notification and/or sunrise services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenic.com/new-domain-extensions/sunrise Sunrise Domain Name Registration]&lt;/ref&gt; A brand owner should aware about launch of new TLD's to educate himself on the different tactics i.e. defensive registrations, monitoring, blocking or creating a new strategy; registering a mark in the TMCH (Trademark Clearinghouse) is the first step.

==Trademark Claims services==
The Trademark Claims service follows the Sunrise. It is a notification service{{snd}} mandated by [[ICANN]] for all new gTLDs{{snd}} to warn both domain name registrants as well as trademark holders of possible infringements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademark-clearinghouse.com/content/trademark-claims-services Trademark Claims services]&lt;/ref&gt; If multiple trademark-holders place a request for the same domain name, the registry may put the domain name to an auction, where the highest bidder will be allowed to register the name. A Sunrise registration request is essential to take part in the auction.

==Sunrise Auction==
When two trademark owners both have legitimate claim to a given domain, these domains then go to auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domainincite.com/xxx-sunrise-auctions-delayed-after-80k-applications/ XXX Sunrise Auctions Delayed After 80k Applications, DomainIncite.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emporer Frederic I death.jpg|thumb|The death of [[Frederick Barbarossa]] as depicted in the Gotha manuscript of the ''Sächsische Weltchronik'']]
The '''''Sächsische Weltchronik''''' ("Saxon World Chronicle") is a [[universal history]] written in vernacular [[German language|German]] prose between 1229 and 1277. The twenty-four surviving manuscripts are a mix of [[Middle Low German|Low German]] (ten), [[Middle High German|High German]] (nine) and [[Central German]] (five). The 98-line verse prologue is always in High German. The ''Weltchronik'' is the oldest historical work in German prose.{{sfn|Kries|1987|p=448–49|ps=. The ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' is earlier, but in verse. The ''Weltchronik'' of [[Rudolf von Ems]] is contemporary, but also verse.}} Ludwig Weiland, who made a critical edition for the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] in 1877, gave it the conventional title by which it is most commonly known.&lt;ref&gt;MGH ''Deutsche Chroniken'' '''2''' (Hanover: Hahn, 1877).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Editio princeps|first edition]] was prepared by [[Hans Ferdinand Massmann]] in 1857, but was based on only one manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Massmann titled his work ''Das Zeitbuch des Eike von Repkow'' (Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts are classified into three [[recensions]]—A, B and C—and the oldest group (A) is entirely High German.{{sfn|Kries|1987|pp=449–50}} Michael Menzel classifies a fifteenth-century manuscript from [[Wolfenbüttel]] as the ''[[Leittext]]''.{{sfn|Kries|1987|pp=449–50}}

It was once thought that the ''Weltchronik'' might be the work of [[Eike of Repgow]], the author of the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'' (a Low German work on law), but this hypothesis—which depended in part on the assumption that the original work was Low German—has been abandoned.{{sfn|Kries|1987|pp=449–50}} The author employed at least thirty-six different [[Middle Latin|Latin]] chronicles in his research. The most important were the ''Chronicle'' of [[Frutolf of Michelsberg]], the continuation of the same by [[Ekkehard of Aura]] and the ''[[Annales Palidenses]]''.{{sfn|Kries|1987|pp=449–50}}

'''''Bordertown''''' is a series of [[urban fantasy]] novels and stories created for teenage readers by [[Terri Windling]]. The series is set in Bordertown, a [[dystopia]]n [[metropolis]] that lies along the border between "the Elflands" and "The World". The series consists of five anthologies and three novels to date. The series has spawned fan groups, gaming groups, costumed events (such as the [http://www.borderzone.com/ Borderzone] parties in Los Angeles), and was discussed in ''The Fence and the River: Culture and Politics at the US-Mexico Border'' by Claire F. Fox.

Bordertown is the name of the [[shared universe]] created by [[Terri Windling]], and a [[fictional place]] within that universe. The premise of the ''Borderland'' books is, at some point in the near future, the "Elflands" - the realm of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] populated by post-[[Tolkien]] [[elf|elves]]{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} -  will "return" to "The World", and its place in juxtaposition with "The World".

The region of this juxtaposition (which seems at times to be [[New York City]] and at other times to be geographically underspecified) is called the "Borderland" or "Borderlands". The dystopian metropolis that lies along the Border, which combines [[urban fantasy]] of various forms with a vaguely [[post-apocalyptic]] atmosphere, is "Bordertown" or "B-Town". In the [[Liminality|liminal]] environment of Bordertown and its environs, neither magic nor [[technology]] functions "normally", and unpredictable combinations of the two may emerge.

The ''Borderlands'' series, created for teenage readers, focuses primarily but not exclusively on the disenfranchised youth culture of Bordertown, as manifest in [[gang]] violence, [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] relations, and [[miscegenation]], impromptu forms of social organization, [[class conflict]], [[generation gap]]s, and [[literary criticism]]. The music of the 1980s is a significant influence.

In 2011 Terri Windling and Endicott Studio released a new Bordertown anthology titled ''Welcome to Bordertown''.

[[File:The English Art of Cookery Richard Briggs 1788 Title Page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''The English Art of Cookery''. First edition, 1788]]

'''''The English Art of Cookery''''' is a [[cookery book]] of [[English cuisine]] by the [[tavern]] cook Richard Briggs, first published in 1788.

It includes recipes for [[toad in the hole|toad in a hole]], [[mushroom ketchup]] and [[puff pastry]], and examples of [[Anglo-Indian cuisine|Anglo-Indian]] influence.

==Context==

The title page describes Richard Briggs as being "many Years Cook at the Globe Tavern, [[Fleet-street]], the White-Hart Tavern, [[Holborn]], [and] now at the [[Temple, London|Temple]] [[Coffeehouse|Coffee-house]]."

==Book==
Briggs gave the book the title ''The English Art of Cookery according to the present practice; being a complete guide to all housekeepers on a plan entirely new''. In his preface, dated Oct. 1, 1788, he explains that his intended audience is (commanded) servants rather than aristocrats: "I presume to offer the following Sheets to the Public, in hopes that they will find the Directions and Receipts more intelligible than in most Books of the Kind. I have bestowed every Pains to render them easily practicable, and adapted to the Capacities of those who may be ordered to use them." The historian Gilly Lehmann comments that in this preface, Briggs was stressing "his simple style in terms reminiscent of [[Hannah Glasse]]". The book was expensive, its price of 7 [[shilling]]s placing it at "the upper end of the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lehmann, Gilly |date=2003 |title=The British Housewife |location=Totnes |publisher=Prospect Books |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains a high proportion of French recipes for its period, [[Elizabeth Raffald]]'s ''[[The Experienced English Housekeeper]]'' in comparison having far fewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lehmann, Gilly |date=2003 |title=The British Housewife |location=Totnes |publisher=Prospect Books |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; French or partly French titles include "Poulet a la Braize", "Soup a la Reine" and "Rump of Beef a la Doube&lt;!--Daube--&gt;". Despite these elegant foreign dishes, Briggs felt able to include homely English foods such as [[toad in the hole|toad in a hole]], though it did include "beaten ginger, and a little grated nutmeg", and used a "veiney piece of beef" rather than sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lehmann, Gilly |date=2003 |title=The British Housewife |location=Totnes |publisher=Prospect Books |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, page 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains several examples of [[Anglo-Indian cuisine|Anglo-Indian]] influence. In the Pickling chapter, there are "Mock Ginger", "Melon Mangoes", and "Elder Shoots in Imitation of Bamboo".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pages 588–589.&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs gives recipes for curries of veal and of chicken, calling for the use of "curric powder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lehmann, Gilly |date=2003 |title=The British Housewife |location=Totnes |publisher=Prospect Books |page=256}}&lt;!--she says Briggs 1788 pp 197, 245, maybe another edition?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach===
[[File:Oyster Sauce in English Art of Cookery, Briggs 1788.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Recipe for "Oyster Sauce for Fish"]]

The book is strictly organised into 38 chapters with clearly distinct themes.
Many of the chapters have an introductory paragraph stating "Proper rules to be observed in" its theme.

The recipes are given as names of dishes, such as "Oyster Sauce for Fish", with a paragraph of instructions. There are no lists of ingredients. Quantities are given where needed, in whatever measure is convenient, as "a pint of large oysters", "half a pound of butter", "a quarter of a lemon", or "a spoonful of anchovy liquor". Cooking instructions rely on the observation of the cook, as "boil it up gently till the butter is melted, and the sauce thick and smooth".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pages 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill of Fare for June from The English Art of Cookery Richard Briggs 1788.jpg|thumb|"Bill of Fare for June", including [[turbot]], [[venison]], [[sweetbreads]] au [[bechamel]], [[jelly (dessert)|jellies]] and [[syllabub]]s, and [[Ruff (bird)|ruffs and reeves]]]]

The book was illustrated with 12 copper-plate engravings of Bills of Fare for the 12 months of the year, each one being a table layout of oval or octagonal dishes. These plates preceded the first chapter.

===Recipes===

Many species of bird were eaten in eighteenth century England; Briggs describes how to roast "[[Ruff (bird)|Ruffs and Reeves]]" from [[Lincolnshire]] and the [[Isle of Ely]]; [[Ortolan bunting]]s; [[skylark|larks]]; [[plover]]s; [[wheatear]]s from the South Downs, as well as wild ducks, [[woodcock]]s and [[snipe (bird)|snipes]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pages 168–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains recipes for [[ketchup]]s [[mushroom ketchup|made with mushrooms]] or walnuts.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pages 595–596.&lt;/ref&gt; It also describes how to make [[puff pastry]], which Briggs used in both savoury and sweet dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, page 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editions===
The book appeared in the following editions.&lt;ref name=WorldCat&gt;{{cite web|last1=Briggs|first1=Richard|title=The English Art of Cookery|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=briggs+english+art+of+cookery|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''The Monthly Review'' of 1789 "confessed that there may be, and actually are, subjects, both above and below our reach; and we now acknowledge that cookery is one of them." It agreed with the [[proverb]] that the proof of the pudding was in the eating, but "none of the corps [of reviewers] will venture to say how the pudding should ''be made''&lt;!--original italics--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Monthly Review |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeJKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA462 |year=1789 |publisher=R. Griffiths |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Critical Review, or Annals of Literature'' of 1790 more boldly asserted that the book "appears to be a work of great merit", but, stating that cooks were "a numerous body, and we are not sufficient adepts to decide on their different pretensions", confined itself to quoting Briggs's credentials from the title page, and confirming that he "is now at the Temple Coffee-house, where we have tasted, with pleasure, several excellent dishes of his composition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The critical review, or annals of literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w45KAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |year=1790 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
First published in 1999 by Cleis Press, ''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book'' was written to "offer information and encouragement for all women who desire women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-whole-lesbian-sex-book-felice-newman/1103671272|title=The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us {{!}} Barnes and Noble|last=|first=|date=|work=Cleis Press|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended audience includes lesbians, bisexuals, butch, femme, androgynous, and transgenders. The second edition was published October 5th, 2004 with an additional chapter, new research, an expanded resource guide, and extra illustrations.

== Topics ==
Topics include the importance of communication in any sexual relationship, how to communicate about lesbian sex, exploring personal desires and fantasies, how masturbation improves sex, how to achieve the preferred orgasm, where to find sex partners, expert advice on various lesbian sex techniques, and a guide to picking sex toys.

== Controversy ==
Two teenage brothers from [[Bentonville, Arkansas]], found the book in a [[public library]] and told their father, Earl Adams. The father complained to the library's director, Bentonville's [[mayor]], and to a local [[newspaper]]. He threatened to sue the library if the book was not removed. The [[Fox News Channel]] picked up the story in April 2007, which gave it and the book national attention.&lt;ref name=Ficera&gt;{{cite news

'''Theresa Caplan''' (1913–2010) was an [[United States|American]] twentieth-century scholar of [[Developmental psychology|early childhood development]] and a collector of worldwide [[toy]]s.  Working with her husband [[Frank Caplan|Frank]], she wrote multiple acclaimed books and built a massive collection of toys that is now part of a significant museum.

Born on 6 June 1913, Caplan collaborated with her husband in authoring multiple books that studied the ways in which children played, whether alone or individually, and at different ages;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://obituaries.expressionstributes.com/?o=c9dc139756 Theresa Caplan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330234614/http://obituaries.expressionstributes.com/?o=c9dc139756 |date=2012-03-30 }}, [http://www.matherhodge.com Mather Hodge Funeral Home], 2010.  Accessed 2011-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, one of their books, ''The First Twelve Months of Life'', concentrated on infants but included observations of children two years old and comparisons with adult [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref name=brennan&gt;Brennan, Hope.  "The Toy King".  ''Columbia Magazine'', 1987-10.&lt;!-- working from a clipping; the page numbers and volume number have been cut off.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], while living in northern [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], the Caplans founded a workshop on [[95th Street (Manhattan)|95th Street]] to manufacture and sell wooden toys for children.  From its earliest years, Theresa was involved with her husband's company: when it was a single small store, she worked with customers while Frank completed their orders.  War shortages increased their profits: wooden toys were rare during the war, so the high quality of toys that the couple manufactured was popularized by word of mouth, and their business grew significantly.&lt;ref name=brennan /&gt;  In 1949, they named the business "[[Creative Playthings]]", which operated until its sale in 1966.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/30/obituaries/frank-caplan-77-toy-developer.html Frank Caplan, 77, Toy Developer]." ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1988-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  As it expanded, the couple travelled around the world to find models for their crafts; by the 1980s, they had accumulated more than fifty thousand individual toys as models, and they gradually began to see themselves as collectors.  Because their work and their collection were both international, they were able by themselves to produce a display that was featured at the [[United Nations Headquarters]] as part of the [[International Year of the Child]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=brennan /&gt;

In 1984, while living in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the Caplans chose to donate their collection to [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]; the collection was so massive that the museum needed nine months to unpack the thirty-two crates used to transport it.&lt;ref name=brennan /&gt;  After the donation was complete, Frank died in 1988 at the age of seventy-seven.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;  After Frank's death, Theresa remembered herself as having been more active in collecting than her husband for a time, but noted that their collection truly began to grow in 1966, as the sale of the business permitted Frank to pay less attention to financial matters.&lt;ref name=ffp /&gt;{{rp|21}}  Described as enthusiastic and extroverted,&lt;ref name=ffp /&gt;{{rp|17}} Caplan was a detailed record-keeper.  She was careful to assign every object in the collection a [[unique identifier]] as well as recording the country of origin for every object, and she ensured that all boxes were separately identified.&lt;ref name=ffp&gt;''Folk, Fantasy and Play: Selections from the Caplan Collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis''.  [[Indianapolis]]: [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|Children's Museum]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}  Written on twenty thousand [[index card]]s, her records filled twenty-eight shoe boxes by the time that the collection was donated to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=ffp /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Theresa died in Princeton on 13 April 2010 at the age of 96.  She was survived by her son Richard, her daughter [[Judith Inglese]], nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

'''The World Wide Web Virtual Library''' was the first index of content on the [[World Wide Web]] and still operates as a directory of [[e-text]]s and information sources on the web. It was started by [[Tim Berners-Lee]]&lt;ref name="searchenginehistory.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchenginehistory.com/|title=History of Search Engines: From 1945 to Google Today|accessdate=2017-05-16|publisher=Search Engine History|author=Aaron Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator of [[HTML]] and the [[World Wide Web]] itself, in 1991 at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]]. Unlike commercial index sites, it is run by a loose confederation of volunteers, who compile pages of key links for particular areas in which they are expert. It is sometimes informally referred to as the "WWWVL", the "Virtual Library" or just "the VL".

The individual indexes, or ''virtual libraries'' live on hundreds of different servers around the world. A set of index pages linking these individual libraries is maintained at [http://vlib.org/ http://vlib.org/], in [[Geneva]] only a few kilometres from where the VL began life.  A mirror of this index is kept at [http://vlib.org.uk East Anglia] (UK). A VL specific search engine has operated for some years and is now (VLsearch) located on its own server at [http://vlsearch.org/ vlsearch.org].

The central affairs of the Virtual Library are co-ordinated by an elected Council. A central index (the 'Catalog') is maintained and joint services provided by the Council on behalf of the association.

The World Wide Web Virtual Library participated in the [[Stop Online Piracy Act#Protest_actions|SOPA protests]] on January 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The WWW Virtual Library|url=http://vlib.org.uk|accessdate=18 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://vlib.org.uk/&amp;date=2012-01-18|archivedate=2012-01-18|date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Virtual Library was first conceived and run by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], and later expanded, organised and managed for several years by Arthur Secret, before it became a formally established [[Voluntary association|association]] with Gerard Manning as its Council's first chairman. The late Bertrand Ibrahim was a key contributor to the pre-association phase of the Virtual Library's development, and then served as its Secretary until his untimely death in 2001 at the age of 46.

A brief history, with links to archived pages and screenshots, is maintained on the [http://vlib.org/admin/history Vlib site].

The Virtual Library has grown over the years, so that there are now around 300 sub-libraries within the main library. (For example, there is the [http://vlib.iue.it/history/ WWW-VL: History Central Catalogue], which was launched on 21 September 1993 by Lynn H. Nelson at Kansas University. From April 2004, it was relocated at the [[European University Institute]], [[Florence]], Italy where the [http://vlib.iue.it/history/about/about.html history of the History catalogue] is also available.)

The Virtual Library was incorporated as an ''association sans but lucratif'' (not for profit association) in the Republic and [[Canton of Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Major decisions, including a set of bylaws are decided by the membership at large.

The main Virtual Library website was redesigned in 2005 and many old or dead individual Virtual Libraries were removed from the index.

It was originally edited by [[Lü Shuxiang]] and Ding Shengshu as a reference work on modern Standard Chinese. Compilation started in 1958 and trial editions were issued in 1960 and 1965, with a number of copies printed in 1973 for internal circulation and comments, but due to the [[Cultural Revolution]] the final draft was not completed until the end of 1977, and the first formal edition was not published until December 1978. It was the first [[People's Republic of China]] dictionary to be arranged according to [[Hanyu Pinyin]], the phonetic standard for [[Standard Chinese]], with explanatory notes in [[simplified Chinese]]. The subsequent second through seventh editions were respectively published in 1983 (Reorganized Edition- now seen as the '2nd edition'), 1996 (Revised Edition- now seen as the '3rd edition'), 2002 (2002 Supplemental Edition- now seen as the '4th edition'), 2005 (5th edition), 2012 (6th edition) and 2016 (7th edition).

== Controversies ==
''Xiandai Hanyu Cidian'' had given discriminatory explanations to certain words and phrases. An example was the word "''[[homosexuality]]''" ({{zh|s={{linktext|同性恋}}|t={{linktext|同性戀}}|p=tóngxìngliàn}}).

In the sixth edition, even though it contains a large number of new vocabulary, the word 同志 ''Tóngzhì'' ("comrade") which is an informal term for "a homosexual person", was not included in the dictionary. This could be because the term is often construed as a sarcastic reference to the [[Communist Party of China]], according to Sociology Professor [[:zh:丁学良|Ding Xueliang]] of the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/simp/chinese_news/2012/07/120718_china_new_dictionary.shtml ''Xiandai Hanyu Cidian'' sparked debates for not including the word ''tongzhi''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901105030/http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/simp/chinese_news/2012/07/120718_china_new_dictionary.shtml |date=September 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original term is a common form of political address in China, e.g. ''Comrade [[Hu Jintao]]'', ''Comrade [[Wen Jiabao]]''.

Some detractors complained that "''Entries starting with the Western alphabet''" section in the 6th edition allegedly violated the regulation - "Chinese language publications shall comply with the norms and standards of the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese language" in laws such as the ''[[:zh:中华人民共和国国家通用语言文字法|Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language]]'' and ''Publication Control Regulations'' of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (State Council Act No. 594). The act of using [[English language|English]] vocabulary in the main body of a Chinese dictionary, and using English to substitute for [[Chinese characters]], according to these detractors, will cause the greatest damage to the Chinese characters since the [[romanization of Chinese]], and will have a long-term negative impact on the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bgt/2012-08/28/c_112874197.htm Hundreds of researchers reported new edition of ''Xiandai Hanyu Cidian'' for violating the law]&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher, the Commercial Press, replied that the section is meant just for easy references when looking up the dictionary. The Commercial Press says that according to a rule stated in a 2010 document by the State Council Office Secretariat, alphabetical entries recorded in Chinese dictionaries written by state authorities did not have corresponding Chinese translations. Hence, it is absolutely fine to include them in dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Entries like 'NBA' included in ''Xiandai Hanyu Cidian'' allegedly broke the law - Reply: Baseless Accusations |url = http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/detail_2012_08/29/17190703_0.shtml |accessdate=2012-08-30 |website = ifeng.com |date = 29 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Zhengzitong''''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|正字通}}|p=''Zhèngzìtōng''| w=''Cheng-tzu-t'ung''|l=Correct Character Mastery}}) was a 17th-century [[Chinese dictionary]]. The [[Ming dynasty]] scholar Zhang Zilie (張自烈; Chang Tzu-lieh) originally published it in 1627 as a supplement to the 1615 ''[[Zihui]]'' dictionary of [[Chinese characters]], and called it the ''Zihui bian'' (字彙辯; "''Zihui'' Disputations"). The [[Qing dynasty]] author Liao Wenying (廖文英; Liao Wen-ying) bought Zhang's manuscript, renamed it ''Zhengzitong'', and published it under his own name in 1671.

The received edition ''Zhengzitong'' has over 33,000 headwords in 12 fascicles ([[Wikt:巻|巻]]). Following the format of the ''Zihui'', the character headwords give alternate graphs, ''[[fanqie]]'' spellings, definitions, explanations, and citations from [[Chinese classic texts]]. Zhang Zilie was a native of [[Jiangxi Province]], and his ''Zhengzitong'' contains many linguistically valuable dialectal terms from Southeastern China. The famous 1716 ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]'' relied heavily upon the ''Zhengzitong''.
