The '''1975 Algiers Agreement''' (commonly known as the '''Algiers Accord''', sometimes as the '''Algiers Declaration''') was an [[treaty|agreement]] between [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] and [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] to settle their border disputes and conflicts (such as the [[Shatt al-Arab]], known as [[Arvand Rud]] in Iran), and it served as basis for the bilateral [[treaty|treaties]] signed on 13 June and 26 December 1975. The agreement was meant to end the disputes between Iraq and Iran on their borders in [[Shatt al-Arab]] and [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], but the main reason for Iraq was to end the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War|Kurdish rebellion]]. Less than six years after signing the treaty, on 17 September 1980, Iraq abolished the treaty but under international law, one nation cannot unilaterally reject a previously ratified treaty, and the treaty had no clause providing for abrogation by one nation only.

Friction remains along the border despite the currently binding treaty and its detailed [[boundary delimitation]]&lt;ref&gt;UN Treaty Series Vol. 1017, 1985, [http://untreaty.un.org/English/treaty.asp full text of the treaty and delimitation description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918032828/http://untreaty.un.org/English/treaty.asp |date=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining in force since it was signed in 1975 and ratified in 1976 by both nations.

==Background==

===Kurdish conflict===
{{Main|Iraqi–Kurdish conflict}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:11 March 1970 manifesto.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Mustafa al-Barzani]] on 11 March 1970]] --&gt;
In 1963, after the [[Ramadan Revolution]], the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] led government being headed by [[Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr]], launched a campaign against the Kurdish rebellion, that was looking for independence from Iraq. The Ba'ath led government fell after the [[November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état|November 1963 coup]] led by [[Abdul Salam Arif]]. The relations between the government and Kurds didn't reach any final decisions. In 1968, the Ba'ath Party started another revolution, the [[17 July Revolution]]. The relations between the Iraqis and Kurds became tense, with the [[Iraqi Armed Forces]] suppressing the Kurdish movement. The Kurdish rebels caused massive economical damage to the Iraqi government. On 11 March 1970, a treaty was signed between the Vice-Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)]], [[Saddam Hussein]], called the "March Manifesto" and the leader of the Kurdish rebellion, [[Mustafa al-Barzani]], in [[Tikrit]], to end the conflict.&lt;ref name="The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=George S.|title=Ethnic Conflict and the Kurds|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1 January 1977|volume=433|issue=1|pages=112–124|doi=10.1177/000271627743300111|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/433/1/112|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty states that the Kurdish militias get merged with the [[Iraqi Army]], cut the ties between [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] and the Kurds and put an end to the rebellion. In return, the Iraqi government promised the Kurds autonomy, with Kurdish persons included in the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name="Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krash|first1=Ephriam|last2=Rautsi|first2=Inari|title=Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography|date=1991|pages=67–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government encouraged the "Arabization" of the oil-rich Kurdish regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/ANFALINT.htm The introduction] in Genocide in Iraq: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds ([[Human Rights Watch]] Report, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, there were lots of problems between the government and the Kurds about the oil of Iraq. The Kurdish ministers left the government, the Kurdish employees left their jobs and Kurdish police and soldiers left the army. The Iraqi government demanded the Kurds to implement the treaty, but they refused. On 11 March 1974, the manifesto became a law in the Iraqi constitution.&lt;ref name="Iraq Kurd Revolt 1974-1975"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Kurd Revolt 1974–1975|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/kilo/kurdiraq1974.htm|website=Wars of the World|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the fight between the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces continued, with [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] supporting the Kurds.&lt;ref name="Iraq and Iran: The Years of Crisis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdulghani|first1=J. M.|title=Iraq and Iran: The Years of Crisis|date=1984|location=London|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran–Iraq border dispute===
After the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]] rose to power, in 1968, the Iraqi government demanded full control over [[Shatt al-Arab]].&lt;ref name="Rookdsmn, Wagner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rookdsmn|first1=Anthony|last2=Wagner|first2=Abraham|title=Iraq-Iran War|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 1969, [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] abolished the 1937 agreement, which was signed between [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] and Iran to sort the border problems, with a weak excuse, that Iraq provoked Iranian boats sailing in Shatt al-Arab.&lt;ref name="The Kurds of Iraq: Building A State Within A State"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bengio|first1=Ofra|title=The Kurds of Iraq: Building A State Within A State|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1969, both armies were deployed on the banks of the [[Persian Gulf]]. After [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] took control of four islands in the Persian Gulf, [[Baghdad]] had lots of diplomatic problems with [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="Rookdsmn, Wagner" /&gt; [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] called the [[Khuzestani Arabs|Arabs of Khuzestan]] to start an uprising against the [[Shah of Iran]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]. Iraq also kicked all the Iranians out of Iraq.&lt;ref name="The Kurds of Iraq: Building A State Within A State" /&gt; Iran supported the Kurds in the [[First Iraqi–Kurdish War|Iraqi–Kurdish War]] with military equipment and funded them with money. [[Mustafa al-Barzani]] met with representatives from the American government to support the Kurds secretly, so, the Iraqi position wasn't good, especially after the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]]. Iraq wanted to build a new diplomatic structure with Iran, fearing that Iran will attack them from the east, while most of the [[Iraqi Armed Forces]] are fighting on the [[Syrian Front (Yom Kippur War)|Syrian Front]].&lt;ref name="A Border Adrift: Origins of the Iraq-Iran War"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pipes|first1=Daniel|title=A Border Adrift: Origins of the Iraq-Iran War|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/164|website=New Weapons|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiation==
[[File:Saddam &amp; Shah (1975).png|thumb|Saddam with the Shah]]
In 1973, [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] started negotiating with [[Empire of Iran|Iran]], hoping that it would stop its support to the Kurdish rebels. In late April, a meeting was held in [[Geneva]] between the countries' foreign ministers. Iraqi representatives insisted on reactivating the 1937 treaty, which gives most of [[Shatt al-Arab]] to Iraq, but Iranian representatives refused.&lt;ref&gt;Report of United States embassy in Baghdad to the State Department, 16 May 1973&lt;/ref&gt; After the discussions failed, meetings were held between the two countries. [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]] decided to show no flexibility, and was determined to take control over exactly half of Shatt al-Arab. After the Shatt al-Arab discussions were made, Iraq started discussing ending the Iranian support to the Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;Report of United States embassy in Tehran to the State Department, 9 June 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1974, Iraq and Iran started a committee to mark the Shatt al-Arab boundary between them. In the [[1974 Arab League summit]], representatives from Iran's government attended to talk with Iraqi representatives with the mediation of [[King of Jordan]] [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]].&lt;ref name="Le Mouvement national Kurde"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kutchera|first1=Chris|title=Le Mouvement national Kurde|date=1979|location=Paris|pages=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks continued between the two countries sporadically, because Iraq was reluctant to give up his territorial demands. Iran started increasing its support of the Kurds, which led the [[Iraqi Army]] to fold. [[Saddam Hussein]] and Mohammed Reza Pahlavi attended the [[OPEC]] summit on 6 March 1975 in [[Algiers]], where they agreed on an agreement and signed it with the mediation of [[Houari Boumédiène]].

The agreement was important to Iraq in order to end the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War|Kurdish War]] and to end the violence near Shatt al-Arab with Iran. It was also in Iran's interest because the [[Iraqi Army]] had taken control of many Kurdish areas, in summer 1974, and the Kurdish rebels had failed to get them back. Also Mohammed Reza Pahlavi did not want the [[Iranian Army]] to get too involved in conflict, avoiding a full-scale war with Iraq.

==Agreement==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:1975 Algiers Agreement.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], [[Houari Boumédiène]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]]]
The Algiers Agreement determined that the border between [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] in [[Shatt al-Arab]] will be the centerline (thalweg) of it. The border will be determined accordingly to the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1913)]] to relinquish its relations to Arab areas in Western Iran. Areas of Iraq are intended to provide some strategic depth was missing from an Iranian attack. In addition, the two countries will "commit themselves to maintain close and effective supervision over their common boundary to end insidious nature intrusions from every possible source." In other words, Iran is undertaking the possibility of stopping their support to the Kurds. The both countries agreed to return to being two good neighboring countries. A violation of one part of the agreement "contradicts the spirit of Algiers Agreement."

On 15 March 1975, the Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers met with the Algerian representatives to establish a joint committee to mark the new borders. On 17 March, the protocol between the two countries was signed by the two foreign ministers. The protocol states that the two countries undertakes re-mark the border.

On 13 June 1975, another treaty was signed in [[Baghdad]] by Iraq's and Iran's foreign ministers. It involved many parts about conflicts between them and the placement of the borders and its changes. The treaty is called "Iraq-Iran international borders and good neighborly relations".

==Results==
[[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] formed a joint commission to mark the boundary between the two countries. They set up headquarters in all over the border. The commission ended marking the border on 26 December 1975 with the signing of a joint declaration of intents.&lt;ref name="International Boundary Study"&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Boundary Study|journal=Office of Geographer Bureau of Intelligence and Research|date=13 July 1978|issue=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran pulled back all of its soldiers from Iraq and sealed the borders, after stopping the support of the Kurds, suddenly, without any declaration. Iran also requested the [[CIA]] and the [[Mossad]] to end the military support of the Kurdish rebels. Most of the people thought that after the end of international support, the Iraqi government would negotiate with the Kurds, but the Vice-Chairman of [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Revolutionary Command Council]], [[Saddam Hussein]], launched an aggressive campaign against the rebels to end them forever. [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]] interfered and succeeded in establishing a cease fire, but on 1 April, the government relaunched the campaign. After many battles, the [[Iraqi Armed Forces]] finally defeated the rebels and ended the rebellion. More than 100,000 Kurdish refugees fled to [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] and [[Turkey]] with their leader, [[Mustafa al-Barzani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F. Gregory Gause, III|title=The International Relations of the Persian Gulf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c0LAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=2009-11-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107469167|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to come back with another much more violent rebellion in 1978.&lt;ref name=Sluglett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sluglett|first1=M.

==Aftermath==
In 1979, the [[Islamic Revolution]] in [[Empire of Iran|Iran]] made [[Khomeini]] the country's leader. Khomeini wanted to "spread the revolution to the Islamic world", including [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] to free its people from the "dictatorship." Iraq abolished the Algiers Agreement on 17 September 1980, which led to the longest war in the region in the 20th century, the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The war lasted 8 years until the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 619]] ended the war and returned both parties to the Algiers Agreement of 1975.

'''Adam Heinrich Müller''' (30 June 1779 – 17 January 1829; after 1827 '''Ritter von Nitterdorf''') was a German publicist, literary critic, political economist, theorist of the state and forerunner of economic romanticism.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Müller was born in Berlin. It was intended that he should study Protestant theology, but from 1798 he devoted himself in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] to the study of law, philosophy, and natural science. He was a student of [[Gustav Hugo]]. Returning to Berlin, he was persuaded by his friend [[Friedrich von Gentz]] to take up [[political science]]. He had early formed a close intimacy with Gentz, his elder by 15 years; and this connection exercised an important influence both on his material circumstances and his mental development in after life. The two men differed widely in character and in their fundamental principles, but agreed, at least in their later period, in their practical political aims, and the friendship was only terminated by death.

Müller worked for some time as referendary in the ''Kurmärkische Kammer'' in Berlin. Müller's relations with the [[Junker]] party and his co-operation with them in their opposition to [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]]'s reforms made any public employment in [[Prussia]] impossible for him. He travelled in Sweden and Denmark, spent about two years in Poland, and then went to [[Vienna]], where he was [[religious conversion|converted]] to the Catholic faith on 30 April 1805.&lt;ref name="SchPR"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=tr. Guy Oakes|title=Political Romanticism|year=2011|publisher=Transaction|isbn=9781412814720|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Gentz he became acquainted with [[Metternich]], to whom he was useful in the preparation of state papers.

===Career===
From 1806 to 1809, he lived at [[Dresden]] occupied in the political education of [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792–1862)|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and lecturer on [[German literature]], dramatic art, and political science. In 1808 he edited with [[Heinrich von Kleist]] the periodical ''Phoebus''.&lt;ref name="SchPR"/&gt; In 1809, he returned to Berlin, and in 1811 to Vienna, where he lived in the house of [[Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este]] and became the friend of [[Clemens Maria Hofbauer]].

In 1813, he entered the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] service, and was appointed imperial commissioner and major of the rifle corps in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. He took part in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|wars for liberty]], and later on, as counsellor of the government, in the reorganization of the country. In 1815 he was called to Vienna, and went to Paris with the imperial staff.

On the conclusion of peace, he became Austrian consul-general for [[Saxony]] at [[Leipzig]], and agent for [[Anhalt]] and [[County of Schwarzburg|Schwarzburg]]. He edited here the periodicals ''Deutscher Staatsanzeiger'' (1816–1818) and ''Unparteiischer Literatur- und Kirchenkorrespondent''. He attended the ministerial conferences at [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] and Vienna (1819–1820), where, being one of the principal literary instruments of the [[reactionary|reaction]], he took part in framing the [[Carlsbad Decrees|Carlsbad resolutions]]. In 1826, at the instance of [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince von Metternich]], he was ennobled as '''Ritter von Nittersdorf''', was recalled to Vienna (1827), appointed imperial counsellor, and employed in the service of the [[chancellor of Austria|chancellery]]. He died in Vienna in 1829, aged 49.

==Positions and theories==
[[Image:Adam Heinrich Müller.jpg|thumb|left|Adam Heinrich Müller c. 1810]]
Müller was distinguished as a writer not only on politics and economics, but on literature and aesthetics. His chief work is the ''{{lang|de|Elemente der Staatskunst}}'' (''Elements of Statecraft''), originating in lectures delivered before [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792–1862)|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]] and an assembly of politicians and diplomats at Dresden in the winter, 1808-09. It treats in six books of the state, of right, of the spirit of legislation in antiquity and in the [[Middle Ages]], of money and national wealth, of the economical factors of the state and trade, of the relation between the state and religion. Müller endeavoured to comprehend the connexion between political and social science, and, while using the [[historical method]], to base them upon philosophy and religion. (Cf. the preface to the first volume of the ''Elemente'', where he treats exhaustively the differences between his work and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''{{lang|fr|De l'esprit des lois}}''; cf. also the sixth book of this work, and the above-mentioned work of 1820.) With [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich von Gentz]], [[Joseph de Maistre]], and [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]], he must be reckoned among the chief opponents of revolutionary ideas in politics.

In his work, ''{{lang|de|Von der Notwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundlage der gesamten Staatswissenschaften}}'' (''On the necessity of a comprehensive theological foundation for political science'', 1820), Müller rejects, like Haller (''{{lang|de|Restauration der Staatswissenschaften}}'', 1816), the distinction between [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[civil law (common law)]], which rests entirely on the idea of the state's omnipotence. His ideal is [[medieval]] [[feudalism]], on which the reorganization of modern political institutions should be modelled.

===Romanticist===
In the field of literature and [[aesthetics]], Müller belongs to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] school. He is a Romanticist even in his specialty, politics and political economy. As [[Joseph von Eichendorff|Eichendorff]] says in his ''Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands'' (new ed., by W. Kosch, Kempten, 1906, p.&amp;nbsp;352), Müller "mapped out a domain of his own, the application of [[Romanticism]] to the social and political conditions of life." [[Carl Schmitt]] presented the view that "it is impossible to judge Müller's theory of the state as anything but a matter of aesthetics and style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=tr. Guy Oakes|title=Political Romanticism|year=2011|publisher=Transaction|isbn=9781412814720|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Müller himself declares: "The reconciliation of science and art and of their noblest ideas with serious political life was the purpose of my larger works" (''Vermischte Schriften'', I, p. iii).

===Economics===
His position in [[political economy]] is defined by his strong opposition to [[Adam Smith]]'s system of materialistic-[[liberalism|liberal]] (so-called classical) political economy, or the so-called [[industry system]]. He censures Smith as presenting a one-sidedly material and individualistic conception of society, and as being too exclusively English in his views. Müller is thus also an adversary of [[free trade]]. In contrast with the economical individualism of Adam Smith, he emphasizes the ethical element in national economy, the duty of the state toward the individual, and the religious basis which is also necessary in this field. Müller's importance in the history of political economy is acknowledged even by the opponents of his religious and political point of view. His reaction against Adam Smith, says [[Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher|Roscher]] (''Geschichte der National-Ökonomik'', p.&amp;nbsp;763), "is not blind or hostile, but is important, and often truly helpful." Some of his ideas, freed from much of their alloy, are reproduced in the writings of the [[Historical school of economics|historical school of German economists]].

The [[reactionary]] and [[feudalism|feudalistic]] thought in Müller's writings, which agreed so little with the spirit of the times, prevented his political ideas from exerting a more notable and lasting influence on his age, while their religious character prevented them from being justly appreciated. However, Müller's teachings had long-term effects in that they were taken up again by 20th century theorists of [[corporatism]] and the [[corporate state]], for example [[Othmar Spann]] (''Der wahre Staat. Vorlesungen über Abbruch und Neubau der Gesellschaft'', Vienna, 1921).

==Writings==
Müller was a man of great and versatile talents, an excellent orator, and a suggestive writer. Several of his works were based upon his own lectures; the most important (besides the above-mentioned periodicals) are:

*''Die Lehre vom Gegensatz'' (Berlin, 1804)
*''Vorlesungen über die deutsche Wissenschaft und Literatur'' (Dresden, 1806, 2nd ed., 1807)
*''Von der Idee der Schönheit'' (lectures; Berlin, 1809)
*''Die Elemente der Staatskunst'' (lectures; 3 parts, Berlin, 1809)
*''Über [[Frederick II of Prussia|König Friedrich II.]] und die Natur, Würde und Bestimmung der preußischen Monarchie'' (lectures; Berlin, 1810)
*''Die Theorie der Staatshaushaltung und ihre Forschritte in Deutschland und England seit [[Adam Smith]]'' (2 vols., Vienna, 1812)
*''Vermischte Schriften über Staat, Philosophie und Kunst'' (2 vols., Vienna, 1812; 2nd ed., 1817)
*''Versuch einer neuen Theorie des Geldes, mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Großbritannien'' (Leipzig, 1816)
*''Zwölf Reden über die Beredsamkeit und deren Verfall in Deutschland'' (Leipzig, 1817)
*''Die Fortschritte der nationalökonomischen Wissenschaft in England'' (Leipzig, 1817)
*''Von der Notwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundlage der gesamten Staatswissenschaften und der Staatswirtschaft insbesondere'' (Leipzig, 1820; new ed., Vienna, 1898)
*''Die Gewerbe-Polizei in Beziehung auf den Landbau'' (Leipzig, 1824)
*''Vorschlag zu einem historischen Ferien-Cursus'' (Vienna, 1829)

A critical pamphlet, which was written in 1817 on the occasion of the Protestant jubilee of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and entitled, ''Etwas, das [[Goethe]] gesagt hat. Beleuchtet von Adam Müller. Leipzig, den 31 Oktober 1817'', was printed but not published (reprinted in Vienna, 1910). Nevertheless, [[Traugott Krug]]'s reply, entitled ''Etwas, das Herr Adam Müller gesagt hat über etwas, das Goethe gesagt hat, und noch etwas, das [[Martin Luther|Luther]] gesagt hat'' (Leipzig, 1817), appeared in two editions.

'''''Addington v. Texas''''', 441 U.S. 418 (1979), was a [[landmark case|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that set the standard for [[involuntary commitment]] for treatment by raising  the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] required to commit persons for psychiatric treatment from the usual civil [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] of "[[preponderance of the evidence]]" to "[[clear and convincing evidence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Background ==
Before Frank Addington was arrested on the [[misdemeanor]] charge of "assault threat" against his mother, Addington's mother filed a petition with the  court, in accordance with Texas law, requesting that Addington be indefinitely [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] to a state [[psychiatric hospital]]. Addington had a long history of [[mental disorder|mental and emotional problems]] and past psychiatric hospitalizations.&lt;ref name=casebased&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Robert G. |author-link= |last2=Weaver |first2=Christopher M. |author2-link= |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_zU4PCsY774C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=addington+v+texas |title=Law and Mental Health: A Case-Based Approach |publisher=Guilford Press |page=135 |isbn=978-1-59385-221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state trial court issued [[jury instructions]] that the decision be based on "[[clear and convincing evidence|clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence]]" that Addington was mentally ill and that hospitalization was required for his own welfare and the welfare of others. The jury found that Addington was mentally ill and required hospitalization. Thereupon the trial court ordered his indefinite commitment. He was indefinitely committed to [[Austin State Hospital]].&lt;ref name=casebased/&gt;

However, Addington appealed to the [[Texas Court of Appeals]], based on the argument the court should have used the "beyond a reasonable doubt" [[Legal burden of proof|standard of proof]]. The appeals court  reversed, agreeing with Addington. The [[Texas Supreme Court]] then reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, reinstating the trial court's orders. It concluded that the standard of proof of the [[preponderance of the evidence]] satisfied [[due process]] in a [[civil commitment]] proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-22
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Addington then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on a [[writ]] of [[certiorari]].

== Opinion of the Court ==
The appeal was dismissed and certiorari granted; the lower court's decision was vacated and remanded. The court said the issue of an individual's interest in liberty is of such weight and gravity that a higher standard of proof is required than is normal in civil cases brought under state law.  Because of the uncertainties of psychiatric diagnosis, the burden of proof does not need to be as high as "[[beyond a reasonable doubt]]" in criminal cases, but should be a "[[Clear and convincing evidence|clear and convincing]]" standard of proof as required by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in such a civil proceeding to commit an individual involuntarily for an indefinite period to a state psychiatric hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the opinion touched on the issue of an involuntary commitment as primarily medical in nature and needing the expertise of mental health experts.
{{quote|Whether the individual is mentally ill and dangerous to either himself or others and is in need of confined therapy turns on the meaning of the facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiatrists and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Subsequent developments ==
The court raised the bar for committing someone against their will in a civil commitment proceeding. When the stakes are exceptionally high in civil matters, the burden of proof must be "[[clear and convincing evidence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The case raised important issues regarding civil commitment by placing the burden of proof on the petitioner, that is the party seeking the involuntary commitment of a person.&lt;ref name=casebased/&gt;

The opinion also suggested that it was not necessarily for the trier of facts to draw the necessary conclusions without the expertise of psychiatrists and psychologists.&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book

The Supreme Court also cited the ''Addington'' case in ''[[Santosky v. Kramer]]'', which set a clear and convincing evidence standard in [[termination of parental rights]] cases.

Onassis was born in [[Smyrna]] and fled the city with his family to Greece in 1922 in the wake of the [[Greco-Turkish_War_(1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. He moved to Argentina in 1923 and established himself as a tobacco trader and later a shipping owner during the Second World War. Moving to [[Monaco]], Onassis rivaled Prince [[Rainer III]] for economic control of the country through his ownership of [[Société des bains de mer de Monaco|SBM]] and in the mid 1950s sought to secure an oil shipping arrangement with Saudi Arabia and engaged in whaling expeditions. In the 1960s Onassis attempted to establish a large investment contract, Project Omega, with the Greek military junta, and sold [[Olympic Airways]] which he had founded in 1957. Onassis was greatly affected by the death of his 24-year-old son, [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]], in a plane crash in 1973, and died two years later.

== Early life ==

===Anatolia===
Onassis was born in [[Karataş, Izmir|Karataş]], a suburb of the port city of [[Smyrna]] (now [[İzmir]], Turkey) in [[Anatolia]] to Socrates Onassis and Penelope Dologou. Onassis had one full-sister, Artemis, and two half-sisters, Kalliroi and Merope, by his father's second marriage following Penelope's death. Onassis became a successful shipping entrepreneur and was able to send his children to prestigious schools. When Onassis graduated from the local [[Evangelical School of Smyrna|Evangelical Greek School]] at the age of 16, he spoke four languages: Greek (his native language), Turkish, Spanish, and English.&lt;ref name="CAFARAKIS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cafarakis |first= Christian |title= Ari: O Fabuloso Onassis |publisher= Editora Expressão e Cultura |year= 1972  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald A. Carroll. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=rRyZTNeVCsPQ4gbbrZVo&amp;ct=result&amp;id=5iJ1dFfxjdQC&amp;dq=onassis%2Bevangelical&amp;q=%22Onassis+graduated+from+the+evangelical%22#search_anchor Project Seek: Onassis, Kennedy, and the Gemstone thesis].

[[File:Onassis-1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Onassis, 1932]]
Smyrna was briefly administered by [[Greece]] (1919–1922) in the aftermath of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory in [[World War I]], but then Smyrna was re-taken by Turkey during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)]]. The Onassis family's substantial property holdings were lost, causing them to become [[Greek refugees|refugees]] fleeing to Greece after the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Hussein, Waris, ''Onassis, the richest man in the world'' (1988), movie for television.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Onassis lost three uncles, an aunt, and her husband Chrysostomos Konialidis and their daughter, who were burned to death in a church in [[Thyatira]] where 500 Christians were seeking shelter from the Great Fire of Smyrna.

=== Argentina ===
At age 17 in 1923, Onassis arrived in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, by [[Nansen passport]], and got his first job as a telephone operator, with the British United River Plate Telephone Company,&lt;ref name="headliners"&gt;New York Times, March 16, 1975, "Headliners, Aristotle Onassis is Dead" by Gary Hoenig&lt;/ref&gt; while following studies in commerce and port-duty administration at ''Aduanas Argentinas''. He later became an entrepreneur, creating an Argentine import-export company, going into business for himself and making a fortune importing English-Turkish tobacco to Argentina.&lt;ref name="Diva" /&gt;  He obtained Argentine citizenship in 1929.&lt;ref name="historiaybiografias.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laterminalrosario.wordpress.com"/&gt; Eventually he established his first shipping trading company in Buenos Aires, [[Astilleros Onassis]]. After gaining his first fortune in Argentina, he expanded his shipping business worldwide and relocated to [[New York City]], USA, where he built up his shipping businesses empire while keeping offices in [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="Diva"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/05/reviews/001105.05smitht.html The Diva and the Tycoon"], by Sally Bedell Smith, New York Times, November 5, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; His legacy in Buenos Aires was the creation of a shipping empire and a Hellenic Culture Fund providing youth scholarships &amp; a students/academic international exchange program between [[Argentina]], [[Greece]], [[Monaco]] and the [[United States]]; the programs are funded and administered by the [[Onassis Foundation]] and eventually were under the managing direction of his daughter [[Christina Onassis]].

== Business ==

===Shipping===
Onassis built up a fleet of freighters and tankers that eventually exceeded seventy vessels.  The fleet operated under a [[flag of convenience]], thereby bypassing laws and regulations of the owners’ country that would protect safety standards and the wages and working conditions of mariners. Onassis' fleet had mostly Panamanian and Liberian flags and sailed tax-free while operating at low cost. Because of this, Onassis could turn a profit in every transaction, even though he charged one of the lowest prices in the merchant navy market. Onassis made large profits when the [[Big Oil]] companies like [[Mobil]], [[Socony]], and [[Texaco]] signed long-term contracts at fixed prices with him for the use of his fleet, while having trouble managing their own fleets, which operated under US flags and thus at high cost.  

The high profitability of the Onassis fleet has been attributed in large part to his disregard for standards that normally govern international shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Mostert, Noel. Supership. Alfred A Knopf Inc. 1974 &lt;/ref&gt; For example, after his Liberian registered tanker [[SS Arrow]] ran aground and spilled oil into Chedabucto Bay in 1970, still the most significant oil spill off Canada’s East Coast &lt;ref&gt;Transport Canada (20 October 2014). "Tanker Safety and Spill Prevention". Transport Canada. http://www.tc.gc.ca/en/services/marine/marine-pollution-environmental-response/vessel-safety-spill-prevention-response.html  Retrieved 20 October, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; (about 25% of the amount spilled by the [[Exxon Valdez]] in Alaska in 1989), there was a [[Commission of Inquiry]]. Led by Dr [[Patrick McTaggart-Cowan]], executive director of the [[Science Council of Canada]], the Commission found that the Arrow had been operating with almost none of its navigation equipment serviceable:&lt;ref&gt;Mostert, Noel. Ibid. Chapter 3, pp 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[radar]] had ceased to function an hour before the ship struck; the [[echo sounder]] had not been in working condition for two months; and the [[gyrocompass]]... had a permanent error of three degrees west. The officer on watch at the time of the accident, the ship's third officer, had no license" and none of the crew had any navigational skill except the master, "and there are even doubts about his ability."

===Monaco===
Onassis arrived in the Mediterranean principality of [[Monaco]] in 1953 and began to purchase the shares of Monaco's [[Société des bains de mer de Monaco]] (SBM) via the use of [[Front company|front companies]] in the [[tax haven]] of Panama, and took control of the organisation in the summer of that year. Onassis moved his headquarters into the Old Sporting Club on Monaco's Avenue d'Ostende shortly after taking control of the SBM. The SBM was a significant owner of property in Monaco, its assets included the [[Monte Carlo Casino]], the [[Yacht Club de Monaco|Monaco Yacht Club]], the [[Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo|Hôtel de Paris]] and a third of the country's acreage.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=113}} Onassis' takeover of the SBM was initially welcomed by Monaco's ruler, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] as the country required investment,{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=114}} but Onassis and Rainier's relationship had deteriorated by 1962 in the wake of the boycott of Monaco by the French President, [[Charles de Gaulle]].{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=199}}

Onassis and Rainier had differing visions for Monaco. Onassis wished the country to remain a resort for an exclusive clientele, but Rainier wished to build hotels and attract a greater number of tourists.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary: Prince Rainier III of Monaco.", ''The Times'', London, 7 April 2005, pg. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Monaco had become less attractive as a tax haven in the wake of France's actions, and Rainier urged Onassis to invest in the construction of hotels.&lt;ref&gt;Nuzum, Thomas. "Monte Carlo Has a Good Feud, but Glamor Is Gone", ''The Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, December 5, 1965, Section 1B, pg. 1|link=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/12/05/page/33/article/monte-carlo-has-a-good-feud-but-glamor-is-gone&lt;/ref&gt; Onassis was reluctant to invest in hotels without a guarantee from Rainier that no other competing hotel development would be permitted, but promised to build two hotels and an apartment block. Unwilling to give Onassis his guarantee, Rainier used his veto to cancel the entire hotel project, and publicly attacked SBM for their 'bad faith' on television, implicitly criticising Onassis. Rainier and Onassis remained at odds over the direction of the company for several years and in June 1966 Rainier approved a plan to create 600,000 new shares in SBM to be permanently held by the state,&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Onassis In Monaco Law Battle.", ''The Times'', London, 22 August 1966, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; which reduced Onassis's stake from 52% to under a third.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=204}} In the Supreme Court of Monaco the share creation was challenged by Onassis who claimed that it was unconstitutional, but the court found against him in March 1967. Following the ruling Onassis sold his holdings in SBM to the state of Monaco for [[United States dollar|$]]9.5 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|9500000|1900|2015}}}} as of 2015),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and left the country.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=206}} According to Frank Brady in ''Onassis: An Extravagant Life'', Onassis' words about the issue were: "We were gypped."

=== Saudi Arabia ===
During the oil boom of the 1950s Onassis was in final discussions with the King of Saudi Arabia for securing a tanker transport deal. Since the Arabian-American Oil Co. (Currently, [[ARAMCO]]) had a monopoly on Saudi oil by a concession agreement, the US government was alarmed by the tanker deal. By 1954, a specific U.S. policy for Saudi Arabia, in addition to strengthening the US "special position," was to take "all appropriate measures to bring about the cancellation" of an agreement between the Saudi government and Onassis to transport Saudi oil on his tankers and "in any case, to make the agreement ineffective".  [Doc. 128] The arrangement would have ended monopoly control of Saudi Arabia's oil by American oil companies, but was forestalled by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Objectives and Policies with respect to the Near East|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB78/propaganda%20127.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2014|author=National Security Council|archiveurl=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB78/essay2.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2002 |location=The National Security Archive|page=6|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For this reason he became a target of the US government and in 1954, the [[FBI]] investigated Onassis for fraud against the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]. He was charged with violating the citizenship provision of the shipping laws which require that [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|all ships displaying the U.S. flag be owned by U.S. citizens]]. Onassis entered a guilty plea and paid $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI Vaults File: Aristotle Onassis Part 2 of 11|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Aristotle%20Onassis/Aristotle%20Onassis%20Part%202%20of%2011|accessdate=6 March 2015|author=The Federal Bureau of Investigations|page=5|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whaling ===
Between 1950 and 1956, Onassis had success whaling off the Peruvian coast. His first expedition made a net profit of US$4.5 million. That business ended when ''The Norwegian Whaling Gazette'' made accusations based on sailors' testimonials, such as one given by Bruno Schalaghecke who worked on the factory ship ''Olympic Challenger'': "Pieces of fresh meat from the 124 whales we killed yesterday still remains on the deck. Among them all, just one could be considered adult. All animals that pass within the range of the harpoon are killed in cold blood." The venture came to an end after the business was sold to Kyokuyo Hogei Kaisha Whaling Company, one of the biggest [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]] companies, for $8.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorsey |first=Kurkpatrick |date=2013 |title=Whaling and Nations: Environmental Diplomacy on the High Seas |page=151 |access-date=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian authorities suspected the involvement of [[Hjalmar Schacht]] in Onassis' whaling enterprises. Schacht had previously been connected with Onassis' Saudi Arabian deals.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=140}}

=== Olympic Airways ===
[[File:Boeing_707-384B_SX-DBF_Olympic_ATH_22.04.73_edited-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Olympic Airways Boeing 707, 1973]]
In 1956, Greek airlines in general faced economic difficulties, whereby companies like [[TAE Greek National Airlines|TAE]] were affected by strikes and cash shortage. The Greek government decided to give this and other companies to the private sector, and, on July 30, 1956, Onassis signed a contract granting him the operational rights to the Greek air transport industry. When Onassis heard during the negotiations that he would not be able to use the five Olympic rings in his logo due to copyright issues, he simply decided to add a sixth ring.
 
Operation effectively started in 1957, with one DC-4, two DC-6s and 13 DC-3s. The following year saw 244,000 passengers transported. The agreement lasted until December 10, 1974, when a number of factors (namely, a series of strikes, shortage of passengers, fuel price increase, and a law from the new Greek government forbidding Olympic Airways to fire employees) led Onassis to terminate his contract.

Following this event, Paul Ionnidis, a high-ranking director from Olympic Airways, said the following of Onassis: "Deep down, [he] did not want to relinquish Olympic Airways. He found it flattering to own an airline. It was something in which he took deep pride. It was his accomplishment. He was married to the sea, but Olympic was his mistress. We used to say that he would spend all the money he made at sea with his mistress in the sky."

Onassis' time at the head of Olympic Airways is known as a golden era, due to investments he made in training and the acquisition of cutting-edge technology. For example, in 1959, he signed a deal with [[De Havilland]] to buy four [[De Havilland Comet|Comet 4B jets]]. Onassis was also renowned for his attention to service quality, which led him to buy gold-plated utensils and candles for the dining service of the first-class section.

During 1974, the last year of Onassis' involvement with the company, Olympic Airways transported 2.5 million passengers and had a work force of 7,356 persons. At the time, his ownership of Olympic Airways distinguished Onassis as one of only two men in the world to own a private airline, the other being [[Howard Hughes]] of [[TWA]].&lt;ref&gt;''Destiny Prevails: My life with Aristotle, Alexander, Christina Onassis and her daughter, Athina'', Paul J. Ioannidis, Livani Publishing, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investments ===

Onassis was involved in the privatization of the Greek national airline and founded the privatized Olympic Airways (today [[Olympic Air]]) in 1957.
Stocks accounted for one-third of his capital, held in oil companies in the USA, the Middle East, and Venezuela. He also owned additional shares that secured his control of 95 multinational businesses in five continents. He owned gold-processing plants in Argentina and Uruguay and a large share in an airline in Latin America and $4 million worth of investments in Brazil. Also, he owned companies like Olympic Maritime and Olympic Tourist; a chemical company in Persia; apartments in Paris, London, Monte Carlo, Athens, and Acapulco; a castle in South France; the [[Olympic Tower]] (a 52-storey high-rise in Manhattan); another building in Sutton Place; Olympic Airways and Air Navigation; the island of [[Skorpios]]; the {{convert|325|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} luxury yacht ''[[Christina O]]'' and, finally, deposit accounts and accounts in treasuries in 217 banks in the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onasis.gr/|title=Onasis.gr - Everything about Aristotelis Onasis|website=www.onasis.gr|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Omega===
[[File:Aristotle Onassis.jpg|thumb|Onassis in 1970]]
In October 1968, amidst the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek military junta]] and shortly after his marriage to [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], Onassis announced the launch of Project Omega, a $400 million investment program that aimed to build considerable industrial infrastructure in Greece including an oil refinery and aluminum smelter. Onassis had cultivated the [[Prime Minister of Greece]], Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos]], for his assistance with the scheme, loaning Papadopoulos the use of his villa and buying dresses for his wife.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=231}} The project was financially supported by the American bank First National City, and Onassis' American financial supporters eventually tired of the unfavourable terms demanded by him. The project was heavily criticized by people such as [[Helen Vlachos]], a journalist from Athens. Another Greek Colonel, [[Nikolaos Makarezos]], preferred a deal offered by Onassis' rival, [[Stavros Niarchos]], and the project was eventually split between them. The failure was due partly to opposition from influential people within the military junta, such as Ioannis-Orlandos Rodinos, [[Deputy Minister]] of Economic Coordination, who opposed Onassis's offers in preference to Niarchos.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=237}}

== Relationships and family ==

=== Athina Livanos ===
Onassis married [[Tina Onassis Niarchos|Athina Mary "Tina" Livanos]], daughter of shipping magnate [[Stavros G. Livanos]] and Arietta Zafrikakis, on 28 December 1946. Livanos was 17 at the time of their marriage; Onassis was 40. Onassis and Livanos had two children, both born in New York City: a son, [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]] (1948–1973), and a daughter [[Christina Onassis|Christina]] (1950–1988). Onassis named his legendary super-yacht after his daughter. To Onassis his marriage to Athina was more than the fulfillment of his ambitions. He also felt that the marriage dealt a blow to his father-in-law and the old-money Greek traditionalists who held Onassis in very low esteem.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=102}} The couple had become largely separated by the mid-1950s, with the end of the marriage coming after Livanos found Onassis in bed with a friend of hers at their home in [[Cap d'Antibes]], the [[Château de la Croë]]. The house was then acquired by Onassis' brother-in-law and business rival [[Stavros Niarchos]], who bought it for his wife, [[Eugenia Livanos]], Athina's sister.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=154}} Onassis and Livanos divorced in June 1960 during Onassis' well publicised affair with Maria Callas.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=190}}

=== Maria Callas ===
Onassis and opera [[prima donna]] [[Maria Callas]] carried on an affair despite the fact that they were both married. They met in 1957 during a party in [[Venice]] promoted by [[Elsa Maxwell]]. After this first encounter, Onassis commented to [[Spyros Skouras]]: "There [was] just a natural curiosity; after all, we were the most famous Greeks alive in the world."{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=173}} Callas and Onassis both divorced their spouses but did not marry each other although their relationship continued for many years.&lt;ref name="Diva" /&gt;

=== Jacqueline Kennedy ===
Onassis ended his relationship with Callas to marry [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], widow of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]. They married on 20 October 1968 on Onassis' privately owned Greek island, [[Skorpios]].

According to biographer Peter Evans, Onassis offered Mrs. Kennedy US$3 million to replace her Kennedy trust fund, which she would lose because she was remarrying.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} After Onassis' death, she would receive a settlement of  US$26 million; US$150,000 each year for the rest of her life. The whole marital contract was discussed with [[Ted Kennedy]] and later reviewed by [[André Meyer]], her financial consultant.

Onassis' daughter Christina made it clear that she disliked Jacqueline Kennedy, and after Alexander's death, she convinced Aristotle that Jacqueline had some kind of curse due to John and [[Robert Kennedy]]'s [[assassination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/ |title=Video Biography of Aristotles Onassis |publisher=Thebiographychannel.co.uk |date=11 August 2008 |accessdate=26 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325182652/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/ |archivedate=25 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his marriage to Jackie, the couple inhabited six residences: her 15-room Fifth Ave. apartment in New York City, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Ave. Foch apartment in Paris, his house in Athens, on [[Skorpios]], his private island in Greece, and his yacht ''Christina O''.

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Olympic Tower NY by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|Onassis financed the construction of the [[Olympic Tower]] in New York.]]
Onassis died at age 69 on 15 March 1975 at the [[American Hospital of Paris]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France, of respiratory failure, a complication of the [[myasthenia gravis]] from which he had been suffering during the last years of his life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Onassis was buried on his island of [[Skorpios]] in Greece, alongside his son, Alexander. Onassis' will established a charitable foundation in memory of his son, named the [[Alexander S. Onassis Foundation|Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation]], based in the [[tax haven]] of [[Vaduz]] in [[Liechtenstein]], and headquartered in Athens. The foundation received 45% of Onassis' estate, which would have been left to his son, with the 55% remainder left to his daughter, Christina. The foundation consists of two parts; a business foundation which runs various businesses including shipping, and a public benefit foundation which is the sole recipient of the business foundation.&lt;ref name="TimesDec01"&gt;Michael Knipe. "The legacy of Onassis." ''The Times,'' London, 18 December 2001, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The public benefit foundation funds the worldwide promotion of [[Greek culture]], funds the Onassis International Prizes for achievement in various fields, and the funding of scholarships for Greek university students.&lt;ref name="TimesDec01"/&gt;

[[Jacqueline Onassis]] also received her share of the estate, settling for a reported $10 million ($26 million according to other sources), which was negotiated by her brother-in-law [[Ted Kennedy]]. This amount would reportedly grow to several hundred million under the financial stewardship of her companion [[Maurice Tempelsman]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadden, Robert D.

Accessed: 6 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Christina's share has since passed to her only child [[Athina Onassis|Athina]], at the time making Athina one of the wealthiest women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Olga and de Quetteville, Harry.

}}
A '''barrister''' (also known as '''barrister-at-law''' or '''bar-at-law''') is a type of [[lawyer]] in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]]. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom [[advocacy]] and [[litigation]]. Their tasks include taking cases in superior [[court]]s and [[tribunal]]s, drafting legal [[pleading]]s, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as ''[[jurist|legal scholars]]''.

Barristers are distinguished from [[solicitor]]s, who have more direct access to clients, and may do transactional-type legal work. It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges, and they are rarely hired by clients directly. In some legal systems, including those of [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Anglo-Dutch law|South Africa]], [[Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law#Scandinavian Law|Scandinavia]], [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of India|India]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], and the British Crown dependencies of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]], [[Guernsey#Politics|Guernsey]] and the [[Manx Law|Isle of Man]], the word barrister is also regarded as an [[honorific]] title.

In a few jurisdictions, barristers are usually forbidden from "conducting" litigation, and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor, who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court, and [[legal writing|drafting]] court documents. In England and Wales, barristers may seek authorisation from the [[Bar Standards Board]] to conduct litigation. This allows a barrister to practise in a 'dual capacity', fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shensmithbarristers.co.uk/|title=Video: Introduction to ShenSmith Barristers by barristers, Sunil Rupasinha, and Dirk van Heck|publisher=ShenSmith barristers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries with common law legal systems, such as [[New Zealand]] and some regions of [[Australia]], [[lawyer]]s are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors, but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister.

==Differences between barristers and other lawyers==

===Differences===
[[File:Scottish Court wigs (2013).JPG|thumb|left|190px|A barrister's wigs, Parliament Hall, Edinburgh]]
A barrister, who can be considered as a jurist, is a lawyer who represents a litigant as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact with the client as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside.

There are other essential differences. A barrister will usually have [[rights of audience]] in the higher courts, whereas other legal professionals will often have more limited access, or will need to acquire additional qualifications to have such access. As in common law countries in which there is a split between the roles of barrister and solicitor, the barrister in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions is responsible for appearing in trials or pleading cases before the courts.

Barristers usually have particular knowledge of case law, precedent, and the skills to "build" a case. When a solicitor in general practice is confronted with an unusual point of law, they may seek the "opinion of counsel" on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;In [[insurance]] contracts there is often the requirement to seek the expert opinion of counsel where the policy contains what is known as "a [[QC clause]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, barristers operate as sole practitioners, and are prohibited from forming partnerships or from working as a barrister as part of a corporation. (In 2009, the Clementi Report recommended the abolition of this restriction in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/content/report/index.htm |title=Clementi report |publisher=Legal-services-review.org.uk |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, barristers normally band together into "[[Chambers (law)|chambers]]" to share clerks (administrators) and operating expenses. Some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated, and have a distinctly corporate feel. In some jurisdictions, they may be employed by firms of solicitors, banks, or corporations as in-house legal advisers.

In contrast, solicitors and attorneys work directly with the clients and are responsible for engaging a barrister with the appropriate expertise for the case. Barristers generally have little or no direct contact with their 'lay clients', particularly without the presence or involvement of the solicitor. All correspondence, inquiries, invoices, and so on, will be addressed to the solicitor, who is primarily responsible for the barrister's fees.

In court, barristers are often visibly distinguished from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England, and Wales, a barrister usually wears a horsehair wig, stiff collar, [[Bands (neckwear)|bands]], and a gown. Since January 2008, [[solicitor advocate]]s have also been entitled to wear wigs, but wear different gowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Practice%20Directions/prac_dir_court_dress.pdf |title=Practice Direction |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328124913/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Practice%20Directions/prac_dir_court_dress.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed a monopoly on appearances before the higher courts, but in [[Great Britain]] this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, are not prepared to provide general advice to members of the public.

Historically, barristers have had a major role in trial preparation, including drafting [[pleading]]s and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In other areas, it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding. Part of the reason for this is cost. A barrister is entitled to a 'brief fee' when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of her/his fee in relation to any trial. They are then usually entitled to a 'refresher' for each day of the trial after the first. But if a case is settled before the trial, the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted. Some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain the case will go to trial.

===Justification for a split profession===
Some benefits of maintaining the split include:
* Having an independent barrister reviewing a course of action gives the client a fresh and independent opinion from an expert in the field distinct from solicitors who may maintain ongoing and long-term relationships with the client.&lt;ref&gt;This view was expressed by Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice of Australia, [http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/about/what_is/dixon.php on his swearing in as Chief Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329141439/http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/about/what_is/dixon.php |date=March 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In many jurisdictions, judges are appointed from the bar. Since barristers do not have long-term client relationships, and are further removed from clients than solicitors, judicial appointees are more independent. 
* Having recourse to all of the specialist barristers at the bar can enable smaller firms, who could not maintain large specialist departments, to compete with larger firms.
* A barrister acts as a check on the solicitor conducting the trial; if it becomes apparent that the claim or defence has not been properly conducted by the solicitor prior to trial, the barrister can (and usually has a duty to) advise the client of a separate possible claim against the solicitor.
* Expertise in conducting trials, owing to the fact that barristers are specialist advocates. 
* In many jurisdictions, barristers must follow the [[cab-rank rule]], which obliges them to accept a brief if it is in their area of expertise and if they are available, facilitating access to justice for the unpopular.

Some disadvantages of the split include:
* A multiplicity of legal advisers can lead to less efficiency and higher costs, a concern to Sir [[David Clementi]] in his review of the English legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.it/old/pdf/doc-57-871.pdf ''Review of the Regulatory Framework for Legal Services in England and Wales'', Sir Davuid Clementi, December 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140522/http://www.aiga.it/old/pdf/doc-57-871.pdf |date=April 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because they are further removed from the client, barristers can be less familiar with the client's needs.

A detailed examination of the justifications for a split legal profession and of the arguments in favour of a fused profession can be found in English solicitor Peter Reeve’s 1986 book, ''Are Two Legal Professions Necessary?''&lt;ref&gt;London: Waterlow Publishers Limited, 1986 (foreword by Sir David Napley)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
[[Image:Gray's inn zzz.JPG|thumb|[[Gray's Inn]], [[London]]]]
Barristers are regulated by the [[Bar association|Bar]] for the jurisdiction where they practise, and in some countries, by the [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]] to which they belong. In some countries, there is external regulation.

Inns of Court, where they exist, regulate admission to the profession. Inns of Court are independent societies that are titularly responsible for the training, admission (calling), and discipline of barristers. Where they exist, a person may only be called to the Bar by an Inn, of which they must first be a member. In fact, historically, call to and success at the Bar, to a large degree, depended upon social connections made early in life.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Duman, ''The English and Colonial Bars in the 19th Century'' (Routledge: London, 1983) {{ISBN|0-85664-468-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85664-468-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bar collectively describes all members of the profession of barrister within a given jurisdiction. While as a minimum the Bar is an association embracing all its members, it is usually the case, either ''de facto'' or ''de jure'', that the Bar is invested with regulatory powers over the manner in which barristers practise.

==Barristers around the world==
In the common law tradition, the respective roles of a lawyer – that is as legal adviser and advocate – were formally split into two separate, regulated sub-professions, the other being the office of solicitor. Historically, the distinction was absolute, but in the modern legal age, some countries that had a split legal profession now have a [[fused profession]] – anyone entitled to practise as a barrister may also practise as a solicitor, and vice versa. In practice, the distinction may be non-existent, minor, or marked, depending on the jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, such Australia, Scotland and Ireland, there is little overlap.

===Australia===
[[File:M Battye.jpg|[[Margaret Battye]], 1930s Australian court dress|thumb]]
In the Australian states of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], there is a split profession. Nevertheless, subject to conditions, barristers can accept direct access work from clients. Each state Bar Association regulates the profession and essentially has the functions of the English Inns of Court. In the states of [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], as well as the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, but an independent bar nonetheless exists, regulated by the Legal Practice Board of the state or territory. In [[Tasmania]] and the [[Northern Territory]], the profession is fused, although a very small number of practitioners operate as an independent bar.

Generally counsel dress in the traditional English manner (wig, gown, and [[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]) before superior courts, although this is not usually done for interlocutory applications. Wigs and robes are still worn in the Supreme Court and the District Court in civil matters and is dependent on the judicial officer's attire. Robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/professional/attire_state.php |title=NSWbar.asn.au |publisher=NSWbar.asn.au |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316140122/http://www.nswbar.asn.au/docs/professional/attire_state.php |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Australia, wigs are no longer worn in any court.

Each year, the Bar Association appoints certain barristers of seniority and eminence to the rank of "Senior Counsel" (in most States and Territories) or "Queen's Counsel" (in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Victoria). Such barristers carry the title "SC" or "QC" after their name. The appointments are made after a process of consultation with members of the profession and the judiciary. Senior Counsel appear in particularly complex or difficult cases. They make up about 14 per cent of the bar in New South Wales.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the law relating to the Barristers is the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 (President Order No.46) as amended which is administered and enforced by the Bangladesh Bar Council. Bangladesh Bar Council is the supreme statutory body to regulate the legal professions in Bangladesh and ensure educational standard and regulatory compliance by the Advocates on roll of the Bar Council. The Bar Council, with the help of government, prescribes rules to regulate the profession. All law graduates educating from home or abroad have to write and pass the Bar Council Examination to be enrolled and admitted as professional Advocates to practice law both as Barristers &amp; Solicitors. The newly enrolled advocates are permitted to start practice in the lower (District) courts after admitting as members of the local (District) Bar Associations. After two years of Practice in lower court the Advocates are eligible to be enrolled in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. By passing the Bar Council Examination, the advocates are issued with certificates of enrollment and permission in prescribed form to practise in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court also. Only those advocates who became Barristers in U.K. maintain their honorific title of barristers. In Bangladesh there is an association called Barristers' Association of Bangladesh that represents the such U.K. bases barristers.[10]

===Canada===
In Canada (except [[Quebec]]), the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, and many lawyers refer to themselves with both names, even if they do not practise in both areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Waddams, ''Introduction to the Study of Law'', 7th ed (Toronto: Carswell, 2010) at 128.&lt;/ref&gt; In colloquial parlance within the Canadian legal profession, lawyers often term themselves as "litigators" (or "barristers"), or as "solicitors", depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practise as both litigators and solicitors. However, "litigators" would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors; in contrast, those terming themselves "solicitors" would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts (not even in a preparatory manner as performed by solicitors in England), though some might practise before chambers judges. As is the practice in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, Canadian litigators are "gowned", but without a wig, when appearing before courts of "superior jurisdiction". All law graduates from Canadian Law schools, and NCA certificates of Qualification (Internationally trained lawyers) from the Federation of Law Society of Canada after having completed more than a year article-ship in law firms write the Bar and Solicitor examinations as prescribed by their professional regulating body, the Law Societies (e.g. Law Society of Upper Canada). The passed candidates are called to the degree of Barrister-at-law and issued with Certificate of Barristers and Solicitors and admit to practice in Her Majesty's Bar within the control of the Society.  

The situation is somewhat different in Quebec as a result of its [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition. The profession of solicitor, or ''avoué'', never took hold in colonial Quebec, so attorneys&lt;ref&gt;Here the term ''attorney'' may be preferable as an ''avocat'' is very much like an American attorney in that he/she may be both a trial and case lawyer.&lt;/ref&gt; (''avocats'') have traditionally been a fused profession, arguing and preparing cases in contentious matters, whereas Quebec's other type of lawyer, [[civil law notary|civil-law notaries]] (''notaires''), handle out-of-court non-contentious matters. However, a number of areas of non-contentious [[private law]] are not monopolized by notaries so that attorneys often specialise in handling either trials, cases, advising, or non-trial matters. The only disadvantage is that attorneys cannot draw up [[public instrument]]s that have the same force of law as [[act (document)|notarial acts]]. Most large law firms in Quebec offer the full range of legal services of law firms in common-law provinces. Intending Quebec attorneys must earn a bachelor's degree in civil law, pass the provincial bar examination, and successfully complete a legal internship to be admitted to practice. Attorneys are regulated by the Quebec Law Society (''Barreau du Québec'').

===France===
In France, ''avocats'', or attorneys, were, until the 20th century, the equivalent of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: ''avocat-stagiaire'' (trainee, who was already qualified but needed to complete two years (or more, depending on the period) of training alongside seasoned lawyers), ''avocat'', and ''avocat honoraire'' (senior barrister). Since the 14th century and during the course of the 19th and 20th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the ''conseil juridique'' (legal advisor, transactional solicitor) and ''avoué'' (procedural solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner, with the notable exception of ''notaires'' (notaries), who are ministry appointed lawyers (with a separate qualification) and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the ''avocat'' was fused with the ''avoué'' and the ''conseil juridique'', making the ''avocat'' (or, if female, ''avocate'') an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction, analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys usually do not (although it they are entitled to) act both as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as ''avocat plaidant'' and ''avocat-conseil''. This distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll. All intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the ''Centre régional de formation à la profession d'avocat (CRFPA)'' (Regional centre for the training of lawyers). The ''CRFPA'' course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships. Its culmination is the ''stage final'' (final training), where the intending attorney spends 6 months in a law firm (generally in his/her favoured field of practice and in a firm in which he/she hopes to be recruited afterwards). The intending attorney then needs to pass the ''Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat (CAPA)'', which is the last professional examination allowing him/her to join a court's bar (''barreau''). It is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the CAPA and is dreaded by most law students. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council (''Ordre du barreau'').

===Germany===
In Germany, no distinction is made and lawyers may plead at all courts with the exception of the civil branch of the Federal Court of Justice (''Bundesgerichtshof'') to which fewer than fifty lawyers are admitted &lt;ref&gt;§ 78 of the ''Zivilprozessordnung''.&lt;/ref&gt; as of 10 August 2018. See the  [http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/DE/DasGericht/ExterneVerfahrensbeteiligte/ZugelasseneRechtsanwaelte/zugelasseneRechtsanwaelte_node.html ''list of lawyers admitted to the Bundesgerichtshof'']. Those lawyers may not plead at other courts, almost only deal with litigation, and are usually instructed by a lawyer who represented the client in the lower courts. However, these restrictions do not apply to criminal cases, nor to pleadings at courts of the other court systems (labour, administrative, taxation, and social courts, as well as the EU court system).

===Hong Kong===
{{main article|Hong Kong Bar Association}}
The legal profession in Hong Kong is also divided into two branches: barristers and solicitors.

In the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] and the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], as a general rule, only barristers and [[solicitor-advocate]]s are allowed to speak on behalf of any party in open court. This means that solicitors are restricted from doing so. In these two courts, barristers dress in the traditional English manner, as do the judges and other lawyers.

In Hong Kong, the rank of Queen's Counsel was granted prior to the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1997. After the handover, the rank has been replaced by [[Senior Counsel]] [[post-nominal letters]]: SC. Senior Counsel may still, however, style themselves as silks, like their British counterparts.

===India===
In [[Law of India|India]], the law relating to the Barrister is the Advocates Act, 1961 introduced and thought up by [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]], the then law minister of India, which is a law passed by the Parliament and is administered and enforced by the [[Bar Council of India]]. Under the act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India is authorized to pass regulations and make orders in individual cases and also generally.

Each State has a Bar Council of its own whose function is to enroll the Barristers willing to practise predominately within the territorial confines of that State and to perform the functions of the Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practise in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Barrister from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.
The advantage with having the State Bar Councils is that the work load of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any 
The process for being entitled to practise in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in India (or from one of the four recognised Universities in the United Kingdom) and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practising in India are met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practise before courts of India.
Enrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as a Barrister and is required to maintain a standards of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes "Rules of Conduct" to be observed by the Barristers in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], admission to the Bar by the Chief Justice of Ireland is restricted to those on whom a Barrister-at-Law degree (B.L.) has first been conferred. [[King's Inns|The Honorable Society of King's Inns]]&lt;!-- without a "u" --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the historical spelling variant ''Honorable'', not the contemporary Honourable&lt;/ref&gt; is the only educational establishment which runs vocational courses for barristers in the Republic and degrees of Barrister-at-Law can only be conferred by King's Inns. King's Inns are also the only body with the capacity to call individuals to the bar and to disbar them.

Most Irish barristers choose to be governed thereafter by the [[Bar Council of Ireland]], a quasi-private entity. Senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar, when they may describe themselves as Senior Counsel ("S.C."). Admission to the Inner Bar is made by declaration before the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], [[patent of precedence|patents of precedence]] having been granted by the [[Government of Ireland|Government]]. Irish barristers are sole practitioners and may not form chambers or partnerships if they wish to remain members of the Bar Council's Law Library.

To practise under the Bar Council of Ireland's rules, a newly qualified barrister is apprenticed to an experienced barrister of at least seven years' experience. This apprenticeship is known as [[pupillage]] or [[devilling]]. Devilling is compulsory for those barristers who wish to be members of the Law Library and lasts for one legal year. It is common to devil for a second year in a less formal arrangement but this is not compulsory.

===Israel===
In Israel there is no distinction between barristers and solicitors, even though the judicial system is based mostly on English common law, as a continuation of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate in Palestine]].

===Japan===
Japan adopts a unified system. However, there are certain classes of qualified professionals who are allowed to practise in certain limited areas of law, such as scriveners (''"shiho shoshi"'', qualified to handle title registration, deposit, and certain petite court proceedings with additional certification), tax accountants (''"zeirishi"'', qualified to prepare tax returns, provide advice on tax computation and represent a client in administrative tax appeals) and patent agents (''"benrishi"'', qualified to practise patent registration and represent a client in administrative patent appeals). Only the lawyers (''"bengoshi"'') can appear before court and are qualified to practise in any areas of law, including, but not limited to, areas that those qualified law-related professionals above are allowed to practise. Most attorneys still focus primarily on court practice and still a very small number of attorneys give sophisticated and expertised legal advice on a day-to-day basis to large corporations.

===Netherlands===
The [[Netherlands]] used to have a semi-separated legal profession comprising the lawyer and the ''procureur'', the latter resembling, to some extent, the profession of barrister. Under that system, lawyers were entitled to represent their clients in law, but were only able to file cases before the court at which they were registered. Cases falling under the jurisdiction of another court had to be filed by a ''procureur'' registered at that court, in practice often another lawyer exercising both functions. Questions were raised on the necessity of the separation, given the fact that its main purpose – the preservation of the quality of the legal profession and observance of local court rules and customs – had become obsolete. For that reason, the ''procureur'' as a separate profession was abolished and its functions merged with the legal profession in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocatenorde.nl/2118/consumenten/Nieuws/afschaffing-procuraat-per-1-september-2008-definitief.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091455/http://www.advocatenorde.nl/2118/consumenten/Nieuws/afschaffing-procuraat-per-1-september-2008-definitief.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 April 2012 |title=Afschaffing procuraat per 1 September 2008 definitief |publisher=Nederlandse Orde van Advocaten |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, lawyers can file cases before any court, regardless of where they are registered. The only notable exception concerns cases brought before the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]], which have to be handled by lawyers registered in the district of [[South Holland]], mainly for qualitative reasons.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the professions are not formally fused but practitioners are enrolled in the High Court as "Barristers and Solicitors". They may choose, however, to practise as barristers sole. About 15% practise solely as barristers, mainly in the larger cities and usually in "chambers" (following the British terminology). They receive "instructions" from other practitioners, at least nominally. They usually conduct the proceedings in their entirety.

Any lawyer may apply to become a [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC) to recognize long standing contribution to the legal profession but this status is only conferred on those practising as solicitors in exceptional circumstances. This step, referred to as "being called to the inner bar" or "taking silk", is considered highly prestigious and has been a step in the career of many New Zealand judges.

Unlike other jurisdictions, the term "junior barrister" is popularly used to refer to a lawyer who holds a practising certificate as a barrister, but is employed by another, more senior barrister. Generally, junior barristers are within their first five years of practise and are not yet qualified to practise as barristers sole. Barristers sole (i.e. barristers who are not employed by another barrister) who are not Queen's Counsel are never referred to as junior barristers.

===Nigeria===
In [[Nigeria]], there is no formal distinction between barristers and solicitors. All students who pass the bar examinations – offered exclusively by the [[Nigerian Law School]] – are called to the Nigerian bar, by the Body of Benchers. Lawyers may argue in any Federal trial or appellate court as well as any of the courts in Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The Legal Practitioner's Act, refers to Nigerian lawyers as Legal Practitioners, and following their [[call to the Bar]], Nigerian lawyers enter their names in the register or Roll of Legal Practitioners kept at the Supreme Court. Perhaps for this reason, a Nigerian lawyer is also often referred to as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and many Nigerian lawyers term themselves Barrister-at-Law complete with the postnominal initials "B.L.".

The vast majority of Nigerian lawyers combine contentious and non-contentious work, although there is a growing tendency for practitioners in the bigger practices to specialise in one or the other. In colloquial parlance within the Nigerian legal profession, lawyers may for this reason be referred to as "litigators" or as "solicitors".

Consistent with the practice in England and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar by conferment of the rank of [[Senior Advocate of Nigeria]] (SAN).

===Pakistan===
In [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]] to practice as a Barrister, law graduates have to complete three steps. They have to pass the Bar Practice and Training Course (BPTC), be Called to the Bar by an Inn of Court from England and Wales and attain a licence to practice as an advocate in the Courts of Pakistan from the relevant Bar Council, provincial or federal.

===Poland===
In [[Poland]], there are two main types of legal professions: [[advocate]] and legal counsel. Both are regulated and these professions are restricted only for people who graduated five-year law studies, have at least three years of experience and passed five difficult national exams (civil law, criminal law, company law, administrative law and ethic) or have a doctor of law degree. Before 2015, the only difference was that advocates have a right to represent clients before the court in all cases and the legal advisors could not represent clients before the court in criminal cases. Presently, the legal advisors can also represent clients in criminal cases so currently, the differences between this professions are only historical significance.

===South Africa===
{{main article|Advocate#Advocates in South Africa}}
In [[South Africa]] the employment and practise of advocates (as barristers are known in South Africa) is consistent with the rest of the Commonwealth. Advocates carry the rank of Junior or Senior Counsel (SC), and are mostly briefed and paid by solicitors (known as [[Attorneys in South Africa|attorneys]]). They are usually employed in the higher courts, particularly in the Appeal Courts where they often appear as specialist counsel. South African solicitors (attorneys) follow a practice of referring cases to Counsel for an opinion before proceeding with a case, when Counsel in question practises as a specialist in the case law at stake. Aspiring advocates currently spend one year in pupillage (formerly only six months) before being admitted to the bar in their respective provincial or judicial jurisdictions. The term 'Advocate' is sometimes used in South Africa as a title, e. g. 'Advocate John Doe, SC' ('Advokaat' in Afrikaans) in the same fashion as 'Dr. John Doe' for a medical doctor.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, there is no distinction between the judiciary and lawyers. Previously, a person who has passed the national bar exam after two years of national education is able to become a judge, prosecutor, or "lawyer" in accordance to their grades upon graduation. As a result of changes from implementing an accommodated law school system, there are two standard means of becoming a lawyer. Under the current legal system, to be a judge or a prosecutor, lawyers need to practise their legal knowledge. A "lawyer" does not have any limitation of practice.

===Spain===
Spain has a division but it does not correspond to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. ''Procuradores'' represent the litigant procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while ''abogados'' represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy. ''Abogados'' perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings, and they have full right of audience in front of the court. The court proceeding is carried out with ''abogados'', not with procuradores. In a nutshell, procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an ''abogado''. Their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
{{main article|Barristers in England and Wales}}
[[File:Photograph of Helena Normanton c. 1930 (22770439042).jpg|thumb|[[Helena Normanton]], first female British barrister.]]
Although with somewhat different laws, [[England]] and [[Wales]] are considered within the United Kingdom [[England and Wales|a single united and unified legal jurisdiction]] for the purposes of both civil and criminal law, alongside Scotland and Northern Ireland, the other two legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. England and Wales are covered by a common bar (an organisation of barristers) and a single law society (an organisation of solicitors).

The profession of barrister in England and Wales is a separate profession from that of solicitor. It is, however, possible to hold the qualification of both barrister and solicitor at the same time. It is not necessary to leave the bar to qualify as a solicitor.

Barristers are regulated by the [[Bar Standards Board]], a division of the [[General Council of the Bar]]. A barrister must be a member of one of the [[Inns of Court]], which traditionally educated and regulated barristers. There are four Inns of Court: [[Lincoln's Inn|The Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn]], [[Gray's Inn|The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn]], [[Middle Temple|The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple]], and [[Inner Temple|The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple]]. All are situated in central London, near the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. They perform scholastic and social roles, and in all cases, provide financial aid to student barristers (subject to merit) through scholarships. It is the Inns that actually "call" the student to the Bar at a ceremony similar to a graduation. Social functions include dining with other members and guests and hosting other events.

Law graduates wishing to work and be known as barristers must take the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC – previously Bar Vocational Course or BVC) at one of the institutions authorised by the Bar Council to offer the BPTC.&lt;ref&gt;Qualification details of English Bar, [http://thepupillagepages.com/ thepupillagepages.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On successful completion of the BPTC student barristers are "called" to the bar by their respective inns and are elevated to the degree of "Barrister". However, before they can practise independently they must first undertake 12 months of [[pupillage]]. The first six months of this period is spent shadowing more senior practitioners, after which pupil barristers may begin to undertake some court work of their own. Following successful completion of this stage, most barristers then join a set of Chambers, a group of counsel who share the costs of premises and support staff whilst remaining individually self-employed.

In December 2014 there were just over 15,500 barristers in independent practice, of whom about ten percent are [[Queen's Counsel]] and the remainder are [[junior barrister]]s. Many barristers (about 2,800) are employed in companies as 'in-house' counsel, or by local or national government or in academic institutions.

Certain barristers in England and Wales are now instructed directly by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/find-a-barrister/public-access-directory/ Public Access Directory of The Bar Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229171106/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/about/find-a-barrister/public-access-directory/ |date=December 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly within the framework of the [[Public Access Scheme]]; a solicitor is not involved at any stage. Barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in almost all areas of law (see the Public Access Information on the Bar Council website)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/guidance/publicaccessinformationforlayclients/ Barcouncil.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322204941/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/guidance/publicaccessinformationforlayclients/ |date=March 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister (rather than the solicitor) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation.

Before a barrister can undertake Public Access work, they must have completed a special course. At present, about one in 20 barristers has so qualified. There is also a separate scheme called 'Licensed Access', available to certain nominated classes of professional client; it is not open to the general public. Public access work is experiencing a huge surge at the bar, with barristers taking advantage of the new opportunity for the bar to make profit in the face of legal aid cuts elsewhere in the profession.

The ability of barristers to accept such instructions is a recent development; it results from a change in the rules set down by the General Council of the Bar in July 2004. The Public Access Scheme has been introduced as part of the drive to open up the legal system to the public and to make it easier and cheaper to obtain access to legal advice. It further reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains however because there are certain aspects of a solicitor's role that a barrister is not able to undertake.

Some honorific suffixes to signify notable barristers may be ''[[Esquire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Esquire (definition)|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/esquire|website=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the term ''barrister-at-law'' is sometimes seen, and was once very common, it has never been formally correct in England and Wales. Barrister is the only correct nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;This was confirmed by the Professional Conduct Committee of the Bar Council when it changed its rules on the usage of the description by individuals in 1970, Annual Statement of the Bar Council, 1969/70.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
In April 2003 there were 554 barristers in independent practice in [[Northern Ireland]]. 66 were [[Queen's Counsel]] (QCs), barristers who have earned a high reputation and are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor as senior advocates and advisers.

Those barristers who are not QCs are called Junior Counsel and are styled "BL" or "Barrister-at-Law". The term ''junior'' is often misleading since many members of the Junior Bar are experienced barristers with considerable expertise.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[Bencher]]s are, and have been for centuries, the governing bodies of the four [[Inns of Court]] in London and [[King's Inns]], Dublin. The Benchers of the [[Inn of Court of Northern Ireland]] governed the Inn until the enactment of the Constitution of the Inn in 1983, which provides that the government of the Inn is shared between the Benchers, the Executive Council of the Inn and members of the Inn assembled in General Meeting.

The Executive Council (through its Education Committee) is responsible for considering Memorials submitted by applicants for admission as students of the Inn and by Bar students of the Inn for admission to the degree of Barrister-at-Law and making recommendations to the Benchers. The final decisions on these Memorials are taken by the Benchers. The Benchers also have the exclusive power of expelling or suspending a Bar student and of disbarring a barrister or suspending a barrister from practice.

The Executive Council is also involved with: education; fees of students; calling counsel to the Bar, although call to the Bar is performed by the [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]] on the invitation of the Benchers; administration of the Bar Library (to which all practising members of the Bar belong); and liaising with corresponding bodies in other countries.

The Bar Council is responsible for the maintenance of the standards, honour and independence of the Bar and, through its Professional Conduct Committee, receives and investigates complaints against members of the Bar in their professional capacity.

====Scotland====
{{main article|Advocate}}

In Scotland, an [[advocate]] is, in all respects except name, a barrister, but there are significant differences in professional practice.

In Scotland, admission to and the conduct of the profession is regulated by the [[Faculty of Advocates]] (as opposed to an Inn).

==== Crown dependencies and UK Overseas Territories====

=====Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey=====
In the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], there are solicitors (called ''ecrivains'') and advocates (French ''avocat''). In the Bailiwicks of Jersey and [[Guernsey]] and on the [[Isle of Man]], Advocates perform the combined functions of both solicitors and barristers.

=====Gibraltar=====
[[Gibraltar]] is a British Overseas Territory boasting a legal profession based on the common law. The legal profession includes both barristers and solicitors with most barristers also acting as solicitors. Admission and Disciplinary matters in Gibraltar are dealt with by the Bar Council of Gibraltar and the Supreme Court of Gibraltar. In order for barristers or solicitors to be admitted as practising lawyers in Gibraltar they must comply with the Supreme Court Act 1930 as amended by the Supreme Court Amendment Act 2015 which requires, amongst other things, for all newly admitted lawyers as of the 1 July 2015 to undertake a year's course in Gibraltar law at the University of Gibraltar. Solicitors also have right of audience in Gibraltar's courts.

===United States===
The United States does not draw a distinction between lawyers as pleaders (barristers) and lawyers as agents (or solicitors). All lawyers who have passed a [[bar examination]] and have been admitted to practice may prosecute or defend in the courts of the state where they are admitted. Historically, a distinction was made, and a separate label for barristers (called "counselors", hence the expression "attorney ''and'' counselor at law") existed in certain states, though both professions have long since been fused into the all-purpose attorney.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Marylin J. "A Comparative Study of British Barristers and American Legal Practice and Education". (Northwestern Journal of International Business and Law: 1983). Retrieved 04-07-2018. https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1152&amp;context=njilb&lt;/ref&gt; Attorneys specializing in court procedure, combining advocacy and case preparation, are called ''trial attorneys'' or ''litigators''.

Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys to obtain a separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as a matter of course to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located. Some federal courts will grant admission to any attorney licensed in any U.S. jurisdiction.

{{cite CommonLII|litigants='''Campbell v Hall'''|link=|reporter=ER|fullstops=|year=1774|num=5|volume=98|firstpage=1045|pinpoint=|parallelcite=1 Cowp 204|date=|courtname=|juris=}} was a case decided in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in 1774. On its face it was a private action for recovery of sums paid to a tax agent, but the decision laid down the principles of the King's constitutional authority in a British colony, deciding amongst other things that such authority is absolute until a representative assembly is granted, at which point the authority of the Crown is limited.

The matter was first heard in the [[Mayor's and City of London Court]], which court found a [[special verdict]] and remitted it to the [[Court of King's Bench]], which then heard the claim on a matter of law.

The decision turned on the validity of a tax imposed in [[Grenada]]. This was the trigger for an examination of the constitutional position of Grenada and for a review of the position in all British territories.

The political situation at the time of the judgment was interesting too; this was the time of the [[No taxation without representation|tax rebellion]] in the American colonies (including the West Indies) and was indeed two years before the [[American Declaration of Independence]].  The judgment therefore had the potential to cause political trouble.

[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]]'s judgment looked beyond the narrow facts of the case. He reviewed the law applicable to British colonies in general and laid down a series of important points of [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional law]] applicable to British possessions.

==Facts==
[[Grenada]] was conquered from the French and formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1763. The King issued a proclamation dated 7 October 1763 that all governors of the newly acquired colonies were instructed "as soon as the state and circumstances of the said colonies will admit" to call a general assembly.  On 9 April 1764, the King ([[George III of Great Britain|George III]]) appointed a [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|Governor]], [[Robert Melvill|General Melville]].

Finally, on 24 July 1764 (before Melville had set sail for Grenada) [[letters patent]] were issued to impose a four and a half per cent duty upon all goods and sugars exported from the island of Grenada, to equalise the duty across the [[Leeward Islands]]. Melville arrived in Grenada on 14 December 1764. In 1765 he summoned an assembly.

James Campbell bought a plantation on Grenada. William Hall was a collector of the four and a half per cent duty.  Campbell brought a claim to recover from Hall the money he had paid as duty.  Campbell claimed that 4½% duty had not been imposed by lawful or sufficient authority.

Campbell succeeded, the decision turning on important constitutional principles.

==Judgment==
[[Lord Mansfield CJ]] held that
:* A country conquered by the British arms becomes part of the possessions and dominions of the King in right of the Crown of the United Kingdom; and, therefore, necessarily subject to the jurisdiction of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]].
:* The conquered inhabitants once received the King's protection, become the King's subjects in all respects.
:* The law of a colony equally affects all persons and all property there: ''"Englishmen"'' have no privilege in the colony distinct from the conquered inhabitants of the colony.
:* The King has power to make laws for the conquered country without the concurrence of Parliament (except that this legislation is subordinate to his own authority in Parliament so that he cannot make any new change contrary to fundamental principles such as exempting an individual from the power of Parliament).
:* Once the King has irrevocably granted a territory a representative assembly to concur in law making, he can no longer legislate by decree or impose taxation without them.

Lord Mansfield's judgment reaffirmed the authority of the king to make law and impose taxation upon a colony by his own authority. In addition to past judicial pronouncements (of which few were found) he examined historical sources.  In particular he found that the sovereign ruled freely by charter and decree in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] until its own [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament]] was founded, [[Wales]] until its annexation, [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] until the days of [[James I of England|James I]] and in [[Pale of Calais|Calais]] until its loss, and that power remained unchallenged in other extant British colonies.

However, in contrast in [[Jamaica]], which had a representative assembly, it had been previously decided that a governor could not override a troublesome assembly.  Just as in Great Britain the King was restrained by Parliament, the Governor had no power to force laws or taxes on a colony without the consent of its assembly.  Only an Act of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] could do that.

Lord Mansfield recognised that the 4½% duty was fair and equitable, even desirable to avoid distorting trade between the Windward Islands. Nevertheless, he ruled it unlawful. Notwithstanding the crown's wide authority, where a colony has a representative assembly, taxation cannot be imposed without its consent or by Act of Parliament.

In this case the letters patent of 24 July 1764 predated by some months the existence of the assembly.  Nevertheless, Lord Mansfield held that the requirement to call the assembly was in the King's proclamation of 9 April 1764.  Therefore, the King's absolute authority ended on that date, notwithstanding that the assembly had not been called and indeed the governor who was to call it had not even left Britain.

{{Quotation|
Through the inattention of the king's servants in inverting the order in which the instruments should have passed and been notoriously published, the last act is contradictory to and a violation of the first, and is, therefore, void.}}

==Significance==
''Campbell v. Hall'' has been cited or referred to in several later cases in the [[British Empire]].  Most pointedly it was cited with approval in ''West Rand Central Gold Mining Company, Limited v. The King'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/19052KB391.html ''West Rand Central Gold Mining Company, Limited v. The King''], [1905] 2 K.B. 391&lt;/ref&gt; a case which concerned the conquest of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and the consequential extinction of the vanquished state's obligations. Its principles were also discussed and distinguished with respect to colonies acquired otherwise than by conquest, by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in its 1938 ruling in ''Sammut v. Strickland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Edgar Sammut and another v Stickland|link=|court=UKPC|year=1938|num=43|parallelcite=|date=30 June 1938|courtname=[[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|P.C.]]|juris=Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also argued in 2008 in ''[[R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]]'' (also known as the Chagos Islanders case), where [[Lord Hoffmann]], in introducing his opinion, stated:

{{Quotation|Authority for these propositions will be found in Lord Mansfield’s judgment in ''Campbell v Hall'' (1774) 1 Cowp 204 (“no question was ever started before, but that the King has a right to a legislative authority over a conquered country.”) This appeal requires your Lordships to determine the limits of that power.&lt;ref&gt;''R (On The Application of Bancoult) V Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', [2008] UKHL 61, {{cite BAILII|litigants=R (On The Application of Bancoult) V Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|link=|court=UKHL|year=2008|num=61|para=32|parallelcite=|date=22 October 2008|courtname=[[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]|juris=England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He resumed later:

{{Cquote|Although the passage from the judgment of Lord Mansfield has regularly been cited for the proposition that the King cannot legislate contrary to fundamental principles of that kind, I suspect that this is to read too much into his remark. The passage may be more readily understood if the punctuation is modernised in this way:

The 6th and last proposition is that, if the King (and when I say the King, I always mean the King without the concurrence of Parliament) has a power to alter the old and to introduce new laws in a conquered country, this legislation being subordinate, that is, subordinate to his own authority in Parliament, he cannot make any new change contrary to fundamental principles: he cannot exempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion, as for instance, from the laws of trade, or from the power of Parliament, or give him privileges exclusive of his other subjects; and so in many other instances which might be put."&lt;ref&gt;''Bancoult'', para. 90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Campbell v Hall'' also called into question the ouster of [[Civil law (legal system)|French law]] in [[Quebec]] by proclamation in 1763. As a result, the ''[[Quebec Act]]'' was passed in 1774 to confirm that French law continued to govern civil matters, but was ousted in favour of English law in criminal matters.

Parliament subsequently passed the ''[[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]]'' to deal with conflicting jurisprudence that arose in the years following ''Campbell''.

The '''Communal Chambers''' were two parallel legislative bodies in [[Cyprus]]; one for the [[Greek Cypriot]] community and one for the [[Turkish Cypriot]] community. The Greek Chamber was abolished in 1965.

==History==
The Chambers were established under the [[Constitution of Cyprus|1960 constitution]],&lt;ref name=P&gt;[http://www.parliament.cy/easyconsole.cfm/id/142/lang/en/ Historical Review] Parliament of Cyprus&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Cypriot legislative election, 1960|first elections]] held on 7 August 1960. The [[Patriotic Front (Cyprus)|Patriotic Front]] won a large majority in the Greek chamber and the [[Cyprus Turkish National Union]] won all the seats in the Turkish chamber.&lt;ref name=YO&gt;Yitzhak Oron ''Middle East Record Volume 1, 1960'' The Moshe Dayan Centre, p225&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the withdrawal of the Turkish community from national politics in December 1963, in March 1965 the remaining Greek members of the [[House of Representatives (Cyprus)|House of Representatives]] passed a law abolishing the Greek Communal Chamber and transferring its responsibilities to the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=P/&gt; A new [[List of Ministers of Education and Culture of Cyprus|Ministry of Education and Culture]] was established to take responsibility for educational and cultural issues.&lt;ref name=P/&gt;

In 1967 members of the Turkish chamber joined with the 15 Turkish former members of the House of Representatives to establish a new [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)|Turkish Cypriot Legislative Assembly]]. The chamber was never officially dissolved, although its powers have not been exercised in the Republic of Cyprus since the 1974 division of the island.&lt;ref&gt;"Achilles C.

'''Consumer bankruptcy in Canada''' is governed by the ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'' ("BIA").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/index.html | accessdate = September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation is complemented by regulations, as well as directives from the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy|Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] that provide guidelines to trustees in [[bankruptcy]] on various aspects of the BIA.

==Consumer basic concepts ==

For the purposes of the BIA, it is important to be able to distinguish between legal definition of "[[Insolvency|insolvent]] person" and one of "bankrupt". Generally, an insolvent person is one who cannot pay his or her [[debt]]s and may subsequently become bankrupt, either by assigning himself into bankruptcy, being petitioned into bankruptcy by the [[creditor]]s, or being deemed to assign himself into bankruptcy by [[Default (finance)|defaulting]] on a Division I proposal.

The person who is unable to pay his obligation is considered to be an '''insolvent person''' under the BIA. Under s. 2 of the BIA, an "insolvent person" is a person who is not bankrupt and who resides, carries on business, or has property in Canada, whose liabilities to creditors provable as claims under this Act amount to $1,000, and

:(a) who is for any reason unable to meet his obligations as they generally become due,
:(b) the aggregate of whose property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient, or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all his obligations, due and accruing due.
&lt;br /&gt;
Insolvent consumers, according to the BIA, have three main options 
:# Declare bankruptcy; 
:# Submit a consumer proposal to creditors, Division II proposal; 
:# Submit a Division I proposal to creditors; 
The four main players involved in consumer insolvency are [http://www.ic.gc.ca/cgi-bin/sc_mrksv/bnkrptcy/trstSrch/qryTrst.cgi Licensed Insolvency Trustee], Debtor/insolvent person, Creditors, [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/home Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.]

Under s. 2 of the BIA, an "insolvent person" can become "'''bankrupt'''" for the purposes of the BIA in three ways:

*by a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 49(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-12.html | accessdate = March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*an application for a bankruptcy order &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 43(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-10.html | accessdate = March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*by defaulting on a Division I Proposal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 57 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-15.html | accessdate = March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy process==

The bankruptcy process may be divided into three stages:

===Initiation of the bankruptcy process===
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Initiation of Bankruptcy Process, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/go_bankrupt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Where debts of an individual, excluding debts secured by the individual's principal residence, are not more than $250,000, an insolvent debtor may file a Consumer Proposal with his creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alternatives to Bankruptcy. Consumer Proposal, Bankruptcy Lawyers Guide,http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca/consumer_proposal.html | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/consumer_proposal.html| accessdate = August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 66.12(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-38.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For debt greater than this amount, a Division I Proposal can be filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 50(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-24.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prior to filing a Proposal under Division I, the insolvent individual may file a notice of intention to stay the creditors so that a Division I proposal can be filed with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy prior to the expiration of 30 days of the filing of the Notice of Intention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 50.4(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-25.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Filing a Proposal under Division I is a serious decision, because an insolvent person will be placed into bankruptcy if the proposal is voted down by the creditors or not approved by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 42(1)(i) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-20.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/h_br01545.html#proposal Consumer Proposal] is not accepted by the creditors or the consumer proposal is not a viable option, an insolvent person may either voluntarily assign himself into bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 49(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-23.html#h-22 | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be involuntarily petitioned into bankruptcy by his creditors &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 43(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-20.html#h-20 | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The legal proceedings and creditor's attempts to enforce the debts are stayed, no person is allowed to initiate or to continue existing legal actions against the bankrupt nor to enforce existing court orders (other than secured creditors who are allowed to enforce their security) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 69(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-49.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between bankruptcy and discharge===

The bankrupt must:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bankrupts' Duties, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide, http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/bankruptcy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 158 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-84.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*deliver all his property, [[credit card]]s and records that are under his possession or control to the trustee
*attend before the official receiver (if requested to do so) for examination under oath with respect to his conduct, the causes of his bankruptcy and the disposition of his property
* prepare and submit to the trustee  a statement of the bankrupt's affairs in the prescribed form (also known as the Statement of Affairs)
* aid the trustee in making an inventory of his assets;
* disclose to the trustee all property disposed of within the previous year (including how, to whom and for how much) that was not in the normal course of business or for reasonable personal expenses
* disclose to the trustee all property given or settled without adequate valuable consideration within the previous five years
* attend the first meeting of his creditors, and, when required, attend other meetings of his creditors or of the inspectors, or attend on the trustee
* submit to such other examinations under oath with respect to his property or affairs as required
* aid to the utmost of his power in the realization of his property and the distribution of the proceeds among his creditors
* execute any documents that may be required
* examine the correctness of all proofs of claims filed, if required by the trustee
* in case any person has to his knowledge filed a false claim, disclose the fact immediately to the trustee
* inform the trustee of any material change in the bankrupt's financial situation
* generally do all such acts and things in relation to his property and the distribution of the proceeds among his creditors as may be reasonably required by the trustee, the bankruptcy rules, or by court order,and
* until his application for discharge has been disposed of and the administration of the estate completed, keep the trustee advised at all times of his place of residence or address.

A bankrupt must also remit to the trustee the amount of his income that is determined to be surplus to his needs, for the benefit of the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 68 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-48.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Determination of property in the bankruptcy estate ====

Contributions made to [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan]]s (RRSPs), [[Registered Retirement Income Fund]]s (RRIFs), and Deferred Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs) in the twelve months prior to the date of bankruptcy will be recovered for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 67(1)(b.3) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-47.html | accessdate = September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in provinces other than British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia (where they are exempt from seizure under applicable provincial legislation). The court can extend the one-year recovery period where it is considered appropriate.

===Period applicable until discharge===

The bankrupt may apply to court at any time for discharge from bankruptcy (provided he has fulfilled his duties), and the court may grant it, either fully or conditionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Absolute or Conditional Discharge, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide, http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/bankruptcy_discharge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 172 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-91.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of first-time or second-time bankrupts, discharge occurs automatically (provided they have attended counselling sessions arranged by the trustee)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 157.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-84.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ '''Automatically discharged (except where an opposition has been filed before it takes effect)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 168.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-88.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above does not apply to a bankrupt that has personal income tax debt of $200,000 or more, which represents 75% or more of total unsecured claims. In this case, a hearing for an application for discharge may not be held before the end of the applicable period below:

The following debts are not released on discharge:

* any fine, penalty, or restitution order imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail
* any award of damages by a court in civil proceedings in respect of
** bodily harm intentionally inflicted, or sexual assault, or
** wrongful death resulting therefrom
* alimony or alimentary pension
* support or maintenance payments
* any debt or liability arising out of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity (or, in the Province of Quebec, as a trustee or administrator of the property of others)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fraudulent Conveyances, Undue Preference, Badges of Fraud in Bankruptcy, http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/defence_of_fraudulent_conveyances.html, Bankruptcy Lawyers' Guide, http://www.lawyersbankruptcy.ca | url = http://lawyersbankruptcy.ca/defence_of_fraudulent_conveyances.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* any debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation (other than a debt or liability that arises from an equity claim)
* liability for the dividend that a creditor would have been entitled to receive on any provable claim not disclosed to the trustee (unless the creditor had notice or knowledge of the bankruptcy and failed to take reasonable action to prove his claim)
* student loans, where the date of bankruptcy occurred
** before the date on which the bankrupt ceased to be a full- or part-time student (as the case may be), or
** within seven years after the date on which the bankrupt ceased to be a full- or part-time student
* any accrued interest on any of the above&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 178(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-93.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of student loans, the seven-year period noted above, on application to the court, may be reduced to five years, if the court is satisfied:
* that the bankrupt has acted in good faith in the matter, and
* he is still experiencing financial difficulties, to the extent that he will be unable to pay the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 178(1.1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-93.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and objectives of the bankruptcy process==

The purpose of the bankruptcy process is to introduce a legislative mechanism that would provide a fair and peaceful resolution of financial conflict between debtors and creditors, creditors competing among themselves for recovery of their loans and balance public interest in protecting financial security of creditors on one hand and public interest in allowing an insolvent individual to make a fresh start. Generally, the objectives of the bankruptcy process can be summarized as follows:

*To permit an honest, but unfortunate debtor to obtain a discharge of his debts and to make "fresh start";
*Not only to permit an honest debtor to make a fresh start, but also to rehabilitate such a debtor by counseling the bankrupt on managing his  financial affairs after discharge in order to prevent subsequent insolvency of the bankrupt;
*To promote a sense of commercial responsibility of the bankrupt and to deter bankrupt from subsequent insolvencies by introducing stricter legislative and judicial treatment of second and ensuing bankruptcies;
*To permit an investigation of the financial affairs of the bankrupt by a mediator, a trustee in bankruptcy, who is given broad powers to facilitate settlement of the claims by way of consumer proposal, to require compliance with bankruptcy procedures, to set aside fraudulent transactions and preferences among creditors and to adjudicate various matters under the BIA;
*To protect the creditors from competing with each other and to secure the debtor from excessive pressure from the creditors attempting to collect their debts first by introducing a priority of distribution of bankrupt's property scheme under which all creditors are treated equally in accordance with the scheme.

==Consequences of bankruptcy==

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! scope="col" |  '''Positive consequences'''
! scope="col" |  '''Negative consequences'''
|- valign="top"
|
*Bankrupt is discharged from all or a significant part of the existing debts and is able to make a "fresh start"
*Creditors are not allowed to start new legal actions or to continue existing ones against the debtor or the third parties in possession of bankrupt's property
*Collection agencies are not allowed to enforce the debts, meaning the collection calls will stop
*Bankrupt is entitled to keep certain property exempted from distribution among the creditors
*Although the bankrupt gives up a part of his surplus income during the bankruptcy period, it is significantly less than the total payments required to his/her creditors prior to the bankruptcy
|
*Bankrupt gives up the legal title and control of non-exempt property
*Bankruptcy will be shown on bankrupt's credit rating for as long as seven years after discharge for a first bankruptcy and up to fourteen years on the second bankruptcy
*Bankrupt loses some professional and civil privileges, i.e. capacity to hold money in trust, capacity to be elected to certain civil positions
*Bankruptcy still carries negative stigma, i.e. negatively influence bankrupt's credibility in the credit granting community
*Bankrupt loses part of any surplus income and all property received before his discharge, and is transferred to trustee for distribution among creditors
*Debtor is deprived of a part of the income and the property and as a consequence may have to lower his and his family standards of living
*Debtor's contractors may suspend and cancel the services where there is a contractual ''ipso facto'' clause allowing contractors to cancel the contract on bankruptcy
*Bankrupt has limited contractual capacity, debtor's contracts are subject to a review by a trustee in bankruptcy
*Debts that are not dischargeable debts still have to be repaid even after a discharge order is made (i.e. fraud, child support)
*Bankrupt has duties to perform before the discharge, and, if the discharge is conditional, some duties to perform afterwards depending on the findings of the Court

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21380">'''Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents''' ('''DAPA'''), sometimes called '''Deferred Action for Parental Accountability''', was a planned [[United States|American]] [[immigration policy]] to grant [[deferred action]] status to certain [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] who have lived in the United States since 2010 and have children who are either [[citizenship in the United States|American citizens]] or [[permanent residence (United States)|lawful permanent residents]]. Deferred action is not full legal status but would come with a three-year, renewable work permit and exemption from [[deportation]]. DAPA was a presidential executive action, not a law passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/archive/2014-executive-actions-immigration|title = Executive Actions on Immigration|date = |accessdate = 2017-09-10 |website = |publisher = U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was announced in November 2014 by President [[Barack Obama]], along with a number of [[immigration reform]] steps including increased resources for border enforcement, new procedures for high-skilled immigrants, and an expansion of the existing [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program.&lt;ref name="San Jose Mercury"&gt;{{cite news |title= Obama immigration plan, the details: border security, deferred action, new programs |publisher=[[San Jose Mercury]] |date=2014-11-20 | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/census/ci_26979815/details-obamas-plan-border-security-deferred-action-and |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |title= Obama, Daring Congress, Acts to Overhaul Immigration |publisher= |date=2014-11-20 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/obama-immigration-speech.html |accessdate=2015-02-17|work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[U.S. state|states]] have filed lawsuits against the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]], arguing that DAPA violates the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] and federal statutes. A temporary [[injunction]] was issued in February 2015, blocking the program from going into effect while the lawsuit proceeds. A U.S. Supreme Court 4–4 split decision in June 2016 effectively left the block in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/supreme-court-dapa-ruling-blow-obama-administration-moves-immigration-back-political-realm|title = Supreme Court Dapa Ruling|accessdate = 2017-09-10 |website = |publisher = Migration Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2017, the [[Trump Administration]] announced that it was rescinding the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/kelly-revokes-obama-order-shielding-immigrant-parents-of-us-citizens/2017/06/15/d3b4db62-5244-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html|title=Kelly revokes Obama order shielding immigrant parents of U.S. citizens|date=2017-06-15|accessdate=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On June 27, 2013, the U.S. Senate’s [[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]] passed their [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|comprehensive immigration reform bill]] in the Senate.&lt;ref name=harv&gt;[http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/241-305-Blackman_Online.pdf Josh Blackman, ''The Supreme Court, 2015 Term – Comment: Gridlock''], 130 Harv. L. Rev. 241 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|113|S|744}}, 113th Cong. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  When pressed to take unilateral executive action to limit deportations on [[Univision]] in March 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] replied “until Congress passes a new law, then I am constrained in terms of what I am able to do.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shear|first1=Michael D.|last2=Preston|first2=Julia|title=Obama Pushed ‘Fullest Extent’ of His Powers on Immigration Plan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/29/us/white-house-tested-limits-of-powers-before-action-on-immigration.html?_r=1|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 November 2016|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2014, House Whip [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] announced that House Republicans had enough votes to pass the bill.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontline: Immigration Battle|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/immigration-battle/|publisher=PBS Television broadcast October 20, 2015|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the next day House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] lost his primary election, so on June 30, Speaker [[John Boehner]] announced that he would not bring the bill to a vote.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;  That same day, President Obama delivered remarks in the [[White House Rose Garden]] promising to “fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.”&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama delivers remarks on border security and immigration reform from the White House Rose Garden (June 30, 2014)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoCr1d1ITYk|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=The White House|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next eight months the Obama Administration went through sixty iterations of different possible executive actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/how-obama-got-here-113077 Anna Palmer, Seung Min Kim &amp; Carrie Budoff Brown, How Obama Got Here,] [[Politico]] (Nov. 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, on November 20, 2014, President Obama delivered a primetime televised address to the nation announcing DAPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/c.104.Cox-Rodriguez.225_rnfqiszo.pdf Adam B.

==Analysis and studies==
In February 2015, the [[Migration Policy Institute]] estimated that about 3.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States are potentially eligible for DAPA, around 766 000 in just five [[County (United States)|counties]]: [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] in California, [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] and [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]] in Texas, and [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPI Releases Detailed Data Profiles of Unauthorized Immigrants and Estimates of Deferred Action Populations for Top U.S. Counties|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/mpi-releases-detailed-county-profiles-unauthorized-immigrants-and-estimates-deferred-action|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President’s program, when combined with [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]], would have delayed deportation of slightly less than half of the 11 million illegal aliens in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYTJune23"/&gt;  More than 10 million people in the United States reside in a household with at least one adult who would have been eligible for DAPA, with two thirds of those adults having lived in the United States for 10 years or more.&lt;ref name=NYTJune23/&gt;  Over half the illegal aliens eligible for the President’s delayed deportation live in [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=NYTJune23/&gt;

The program was challenged in federal court by 26 states.  Of the 3.6 million illegal aliens eligible for DAPA, 2.2 million reside in states that did not join the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=NYTJune23/&gt;

A 2016 study of the impact of DACA on labor market outcomes for immigrants found that if the same effects apply to DAPA as DACA, then DAPA could potentially move over 250,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pope|first=Nolan G.|title=The effects of DACAmentation: The impact of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on unauthorized immigrants|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272716301268|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=143|pages=98|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.08.014|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[member states of the European Union]] are bound to decrease their [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. For example, the EU [[climate and energy]] package requires member states to improve their energy efficiency by 20%, increase -renewable energy production by 20% and reduce their emissions by 20%. With about 40% of CO2 emissions heating, cooling and hot water production in buildings is one of the largest greenhouse gas producers.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Norbert. Heating, cooling, lighting: Sustainable design methods for architects. John wiley &amp; sons, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the building sector has the largest potential for energy savings. In their effort to lead a change towards greater energy efficiency and a reduction of greenhouse gas, many companies, cities and municipalities are in the process of developing [[low carbon]] action plans.&lt;ref&gt;Baeumler, Axel, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, and Shomik Mehndiratta, eds. Sustainable low-carbon city development in China. World Bank Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broto, Vanesa Castán, and Harriet Bulkeley. "A survey of urban climate change experiments in 100 cities." Global Environmental Change 23.1 (2013): 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the costs for developing optimal action plans and their continuous monitoring and optimization are very high, thus, often hindered by the tense financial situation, especially of cities and municipalities. With significant economic and environmental downsides; the consequences are additional costs due to the non-compliance to the national and EU emission goals and untapped energy saving potential.

ECOCITIES is an energy optimization system for building portfolios combining and extending the benefits of [[Energy Management Software]] (EMS), [[Computer-aided facility management|Computer-aided Facility Management]] (CAFM) software and building portfolio management software. It integrates building administration and monitoring, energy accounting and building portfolio optimization. Thereby, it supports the definition of low carbon action plans in terms of environmental impact (e.g., [[carbon footprint]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]) and financial impact (e.g., investment costs, running, costs). The system considers the following options for each building and the resulting (inter-) dependencies:
* energy-efficient building configurations (e.g., the compatibility of building components and its contribution to the energy efficiency level), 
* energy used at the production and distribution of building components (i.e., gray energy),
* [[environmental impact]] (e.g., [[CO2 emissions]]),
* financial constraints, such as (governmental) funding and limited long term loans,
* legal constraints, e.g., [[building codes]], national and international standards,
* energy consumption for the operation of buildings, i.e., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) as well as the electricity demand,
* energy production, storage and load shifting between buildings in combination with [[renewable energy production]] ([[solar PV]] and thermal, [[Micro combined heat and power]]) and conversion.
* energy flows between a building’s on-site networks (Heating/Cooling and low voltage networks), the micro networks on neighborhood level and the city-wide energy networks ([[district heating]] and [[district cooling]] networks, mid-voltage distribution networks), 
* local typology (position of buildings, energy networks).

ECOCITIES calculates all energy- and cost-efficient development scenarios, visualizes them on the screen and allows decision makers to interactively explore the consequences of their actions (e.g., what are the citywide costs and the corresponding CO2 reductions of introducing a neighborhood-scale combined heat and power plant). ECOCITIES is an enabler for the realization of energy goals and provides synergies with existing endeavors of achieving national and European energy goals. On an operational level, ECOCITIES supports the following processes:
* Administration and integrated optimization of the entire building portfolio.
* Energy accounting and monitoring for all buildings.
* Identification, evaluation and definition of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Continuous monitoring, review and optimization of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Ensure the alignment of individual initiatives with the overall energy strategy of the company/city, e.g., planning the cost- and energy efficient integration of new or refurbished single buildings, groups of buildings or entire neighborhoods into a new or existing energy efficiency strategy.
* Continuous monitoring of the performance related to the contribution to national and European energy goals.

The DoD's electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.6 million average American homes. In electricity consumption, if it were a country, the DoD would rank 58th in the world, using slightly less than [[Denmark]] and slightly more than [[Syria]] (CIA World Factbook, 2006).&lt;ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007"/&gt; The Department of Defense uses {{convert|4600000000|USgal|L}} of fuel annually, an average of {{convert|12600000|USgal|L}} of fuel per day. A large Army division may use about {{convert|6000|USgal|L}} per day. According to the 2005 ''CIA World Factbook'', if it were a country, the DoD would rank 34th in the world in average daily oil use, coming in just behind Iraq and just ahead of Sweden.&lt;ref name="Colonel Gregory J 2007"/&gt;

==General==
{{See also|Climate change and national security}}
The military recognizes that renewable energy can provide improvements in force safety and budget stability as well as mitigate climate change so it has several programs working on deploying alternative energy at major facilities and in forward operating bases. Admiral [[Samuel J.

The '''European civil code''' (ECC) is a proposed harmonisation of private law across the [[European Union]]. 

The ultimate aim of a European [[civil code]] is, like a national [[civil code]], to deal comprehensively with the core areas of private law. Private law typically covered in a civil code includes the [[family law]], the law of [[inheritance]], [[property law]] and the [[Law of Obligations]]. The law of obligations includes the law of contracts, [[delicts]] (or [[tort]]s) and [[restitution]]. It was from work on European contract law that the push for a comprehensive European civil code arose. The development of a European civil code has primarily focused on creating a unified law of contracts. Thus, the term 'European civil code' is often used in specific reference to the harmonisation of contract law throughout the EU.

== History ==
=== The Lando Commission ===
The idea of a unified European civil code can be traced to the idea of a unified Europe and the creation of the European Union. The European Parliament requested the creation of a European civil code in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;''Official Journal of the European Communities'', 1989, N. C 158/400.&lt;/ref&gt; 1994 and 2000.  A pragmatic approach has seen the proponents of a European civil code develop uniform laws in discrete areas before working towards a comprehensive European civil code.

Development of a European code for contract law began in 1982 with the formation of the Commission on European Contract Law. This became known as the Lando Commission after its chairman [[Ole Lando]]. At the same time [[UNIDROIT]] began similar studies leading to their 1994 publication Principles for International Commercial Contracts. The Lando Commission focused on creating their ''[[Principles of European Contract Law]]'' (PECL). The first part of the PECL was published in 1995, followed by Part II in 1999 and the final Part III in 2003. These Principles of European Contract Law may eventually form one part of the European civil code.

=== ''Towards a European Civil Code'' ===
In 1997 the Dutch Government, as then Chair of the European Union, held a conference titled 'Towards a European Civil Code'. The conference considered the feasibility of such a code and led to the creation of a book titled ''Towards a European Civil Code''. The third edition was published in 2004 and although the primary focus is European contract law, it considers other areas of private law that may form part of a European civil code as well. The years following this conference have seen the development of many academic groups focusing on different areas of private law. These include: 

* The Study Group on a European Civil Code,&lt;ref name="Hondius14"&gt;Hondius et al. (2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1997 and chaired by Professor [[Christian von Bar]] at the [[University of Osnabrück]].
* The Acquis Group (official name: Research Group on EC Private Law) at the [[University of Münster]] focuses on existing European Community private law.&lt;ref name="Hondius15"&gt;Idem, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Commission on European Family Law]] based at [[Utrecht University]].
* The [[European Group on Tort Law]], also called the Spier/Koziol group, in association with the [[European Centre of Tort and Insurance Law]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name="Hondius14"/&gt;
* The Common Core of European Private Law project conducted by [[Mauro Bussani]] and [[Ugo Mattei]] at the [[University of Trento]].&lt;ref name="Hondius14"/&gt;
* The Académie des Privatistes Européens at the [[University of Pavia]], headed by Giuseppe Gandolfi. It published a Draft Code ('avant-projet') in 2002.&lt;ref name="Hondius14"/&gt;
* The Leuven Centre for a Common Law of Europe, founded in 2001 by professor [[Walter Van Gerven]], who wrote a number of European casebooks together with [[Basil Markesinis]].&lt;ref name="Hondius15"/&gt;
* The Joint Network on European Private Law  has also been created and includes several of the above groups.

=== ''Common Frame of Reference'' ===
On 11 July 2001, the European Commission issued a Communication in relation to possible developments in European contract law. Following the review of submissions on the Communication, the Commission released an Action Plan for a more coherent European contract law in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;von Bar et al. (2009), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Action Plan began the process of creating what is known as the ''[[Common Frame of Reference]]'' (CFR). This was followed in 2004 by the publication of “European Contract Law and revision of the acquis: the way forward”. The CFR is intended to provide a structure and guideline for the development of harmonised European private law but has a specific focus on contract law. It was hoped that the creation of a unified European contract law would be achieved by 2010.

The ''Draft Common Frame of Reference'' (DCFR), a joint project of the Study Group and Acquis Group (funded by the European Commission for €4.3 million), was published in December 2007. Although the European Commission downplayed the CFR's expected future importance in a July 2006 report, a March 2006 European Parliament resolution stated that "Even though the Commission denies that this is its objective, it is clear that many of the researchers and stakeholders working on the project believe that the ultimate long-term outcome will be a European code of obligations or even a full-blown European Civil Code."&lt;ref name="Beunderman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/24979 |title=Academic handbook could form basis for EU civil code |author=Mark Beunderman |work=[[EUobserver]] |date=22 October 2017 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Gerhard Wagner hailed "the drafting of a coherent set of rules" for all of Europe, such as the DCFR, as "an immense scientific achievement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wagner |first=Gerhard |date=2009 |title=The Common Frame of Reference: A View from Law &amp; Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oii7E0IVsAs |location=Munich |publisher=Sellier. European Law Publishers |page=204 |isbn=9783866531109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents of a European civil code ==
A comprehensive European civil code would cover the major areas of private law in much the same way as domestic civil codes. The major areas that have been suggested are contract law, torts, property, restitution and also company law.  

Although family law and inheritance law are normally covered by domestic civil codes there is doubt over whether it is possible to include them in a broad European code. Family and Inheritance law is often closely tied to a nation’s culture. For this reason it may not be possible or suitable to create a uniform code to cover the entire European Union. 
As previously stated, contract law is perhaps the most suited for harmonisation, followed by other areas of the law of obligations and the law of property.
The creation of individual codes for discrete areas of private law is considered the most feasible and realistic goal. For this reason efforts have concentrated on creating a unified European contract law before attempting a more comprehensive European civil code. 

An example of a modern comprehensive code is the Dutch ''[[Burgerlijk Wetboek]]'' which came into force in 1992. The ''Burgerlijk Wetboek'' covers civil, commercial law, consumer law and labour law and was almost 40 years in the making. This gives an indication of how long it may take to create a complete unified European civil code. The March 2006 European Parliament resolution recommended taking the new Dutch civil code as a model as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2006-0109+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title=European Parliament resolution on European contract law and the revision of the acquis: the way forward |author=European Parliament |work=europarl.europa.eu |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments for and against a European civil code ==
Many arguments have been raised both supporting and rejecting the idea of a European civil code. Included in this are claims that the creation of a civil code binding across the European Union will be impossible to achieve. As a much broader project, the creation of a European civil code is more easily dismissed than attempts at unifying discrete areas such as contract law.

=== For ===
Arguments supporting a unified European civil code relate to the emergence of the European Union and an increasingly globalised economy. Proponents also point out that Europe, including England, shares a long legal history in the form of the ''[[ius commune]]'' before the 18th and 19th century national codifications.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesselink"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2007/10/10/een-europees-burgerlijk-wetboek-is-juist-goed-idee-11408152-a522709 |title=Een Europees Burgerlijk Wetboek is juist goed idee |author=Martijn W. Hesselink |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=10 October 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, except for England and Ireland, all of Europe shares the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law tradition]] which began with the [[Napoleonic Code]] of 1804.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;

# The European Union represents a unification of Europe and a reduction in the significance of national borders. The creation of a European civil code can be seen as a further step in this process of unification.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lesaffer |first=Randall C.H. |date=2008 |title=Inleiding tot de Europese Rechtsgeschiedenis |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=aniyulpSVVoC&amp;pg=PA5 |location=Leuven |publisher=Leuven University Press |page=4–5 |isbn=9789058676795 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is no particular reason to assume the national level is the 'natural' level to regulate matters such as contract law on, because it was nearly the same across Europe for centuries up until the 19th century (when nation-states were formed), and if it would be somehow better regulated 'closer to the citizens', one might as well take it to the provincial or municipal level instead of the national level.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# Differences in national laws may create problems of efficacy in the ever more globalised economy. A uniform civil code will help overcome these problems and reduce barriers to increased trade within the European Union.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# European integration has rapidly increased the mobility of private persons, be they employees, students, migrants or tourists. Harmonisation of European civil law will facilitate citizens' mobility by increasing their legal security.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# The increasing use of standard form contracts is also said to indicate a desire for a European civil code or at least a harmonisation of European contract law.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# Anticipated obstacles, such as the alleged incompatibility between the continental civil law tradition and the English common law tradition, shouldn't be too much of a problem to overcome, since the underlying legal concepts and rules aren't really all that different.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;
# Some argue for an 'optional' European Civil Code, alongside the national civil codes, leaving the contracting parties the freedom to choose and thus opening up more possibilities.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;
# Contracting parties will no longer need to hire expensive experts from the countries involved to explain to judges how the respective countries' law is to be understood on numerous matters. A policy aimed at the development of a European civil code will easily pass the [[Proportionality_(law)#European_Union_law|proportionality test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} {{Cite book |last=Nieuwenhuis |first=Hans  |date=2015 |title=Een steeds hechter verbond: Europa op weg naar Europa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rj2yCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156 |location= |publisher=Uitgeverij Balans |page=156 |isbn=9789460030819 |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against ===
The feasibility of a European civil code has been questioned on both political and legal grounds. Cultural differences and the lack of a common European legal culture are often cited by opponents. The connection between law, language, culture and national history forms one small aspect of the arguments against replacing national [[civil code]]s with a European code. Arguments based upon cultural differences are, however, difficult to establish.

More substantive difficulties, which for some are reasons why it is neither feasible nor desirable to create a European civil code, include: 

# The process by which Community instruments are now produced leads almost inevitably to second-rate law. For example, within private international law, which is harmonised within the European Union, the Rome II Regulation is an unhappy political compromise between Parliament, Council and Commission.
# Once a Civil Code is in place any errors it contains will take years, if not decades, to correct as agreement from all participating parties will be required.
# Any Civil Code will be a piecemeal replacement of part of each member state's legal system. Laws within nations form a system: one part is shaped by and dependent upon another. Replacing part of each system's law, without altering the rest, will introduce incoherence.
# If the European Court of Justice is given jurisdiction over the interpretation of any code, even more disputes will be subject to the gross delays to which appeals to that court are already subject.
# The draft principles in existence are not, substantively, satisfactory. For example, the draft Principles of Liability for Non-Contractual Damage define "causation" in a way that is transparently circular: "A person causes legally relevant damage to another if the damage is to be regarded as a consequence of that person’s conduct or the source of danger for which that person is responsible." 
# It is impossible within a few brief code provisions to capture the many technical and minor points which are thrown up in private law disputes. Within member states these have long been settled, although not uniformly. A new Code will lead to immense litigation and disruption as these points are re-litigated anew.
# There is also the issue regarding the differences between common law and civil law and which principles to adopt, an issue which can be underrated. Opponents argue the two systems vary greatly at times and any successful civil code would have to take this into consideration due to the UK's status as compared to the rest of the EU. This makes introducing "harmonised" or "standardised" principles difficult in both theory and practice where some jurisdictions do not recognise certain practices (i.e. the right to specific performance, the inclusion of prior negotiations in contract interpretation etc.) or approach concepts in different ways (i.e. "good faith", "equity"). It would not be easy to reconcile such differences.&lt;ref name="Lesaffer"/&gt;

In April 2017, after [[Theresa May]] triggered [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|for the UK]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]] remarked that "it was naïve, maybe, to reconcile the legal system of Napoleon with the common law of the British Empire, and perhaps it was never meant to be. But our predecessors should never be blamed for having tried to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhpnVKxCfUw |title=Guy Verhofstadt 05 Apr 2017 plenary speech on BREXIT Negotiations with the UK |author=Guy Verhofstadt |work=ALDE Group |date=5 April 2017 |accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the European Union has the legal power to create a European civil code has also been an issue. Article 95 of the [[EC Treaty]] is considered the means through which a code would be created. However, many people{{who?|date=August 2017}} believe that the EU lacks the constitutional competence to enact a comprehensive code. Others argue that this does not defeat the idea of a European civil code and is merely a political issue. If a general consensus were to be reached in favour of a European civil code, it might be politically possible to expand the constitutional competence of the European Union or create an international treaty giving effect to the code. According to professor Christian von Bar "it fully depends on a political decision of the European Commission, the [EU] Council and the European Parliament if in the end, the ''Common Frame of Reference'' will be adopted as an EU instrument."&lt;ref name="Beunderman"/&gt;

== European contract law ==
As previously stated, the discussion of a European civil code has had a primary focus on the development of a unified European contract code. Proponents of a European code of contract law have largely been divided into two groups. One group favours the use of the [[acquis communautaire]] (the body of European Union law) as the basis of a unified European contract law. The other has preferred a foundation in the field of comparative law and analysis of the domestic contract law of member states of the EU. The latter view was the initially dominant opinion in the field, but more recently the Acquis position has come to the fore.

Both options were provided for in the Commission of European Communities 2001 Communication on European contract law. Although there were many submissions supporting both fields of thought, most favoured a review of the Acquis as a basis for developing European contract law. The subsequent Action Plan and its follow up Way Forward paper have progressed the development of a European code of contract law as well as a more comprehensive European civil code. The intended outcome of this new stage is the publication of the Common Frame of Reference. The CFR is hoped by some to form the central part of a future unified European contract law, although this is not its purpose. It is expected to be published in 2009/10.{{update after|2010|12|31}}

Hesselink (director of the Amsterdam Centre for the Study of European Contract Law at the [[University of Amsterdam]]) argued in October 2007 that the development of a European contract code, or more broadly, civil code, should happen transparently, and with the participation and consent of citizens, consumers and smaller companies, lest big businesses will be able to obtain too much power over the others.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9539">'''Evidence-based prosecution'''' (sometimes termed "victimless prosecution") refers to a collection of techniques utilized by prosecutors in domestic violence cases to convict abusers without the cooperation of an alleged victim.  It is widely practiced within the American legal system by specialized prosecutors and state's attorneys and relies on utilizing a variety of evidence to prove the guilt of an abuser with limited or adverse participation by the abuser's victim, or even no participation at all.

==Context within domestic violence prosecution==
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
Evidence-based Prosecution arose from the unique challenges facing prosecutors in domestic violence cases. While domestic abuse has been prevalent throughout history and its impacts severe, only in recent decades has prosecution been undertaken aggressively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 1970s, increased public awareness has led to tougher laws and an ever-expanding role for law enforcement and the criminal court system in what had previously been regarded as "a family matter".
While in the 1980s as little as 5% of domestic abuse cases with injuries would be routinely prosecuted, in 2010, the rate in some jurisdictions approached 80%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors managing these cases face a constant problem of victims who are unable or unwilling to cooperate with prosecution. In jurisdictions with aggressive enforcement of domestic violence laws, approximately 65-70% of victims do not cooperate with prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Brady Henderson &amp; Tyson Stanek, Esq., ''Domestic Violence: from the Crime Scene to the Courtroom'', Oklahoma Coalition Against Domestic Violence &amp; Sexual Assault, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs for a variety of reasons and includes seeking dismissal of charges, lying to prosecutors or police, recanting statements about the abuse, refusing to talk about the abuse, perjuring themselves in court to protect the abuser, or refusing to come to court altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See "Explaining Counterintuitive Behavior in Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Cases", ''The Voice'' Volume I, Issue 4, National Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence-based prosecution arose from the desire to prosecute individuals in domestic violence cases either without placing pressure on the victim to cooperate when she or he might face retaliation or other dangers from doing so, or when such pressure is applied but ineffective. It was first used in the 1980s, but did not become widespread until the 1990s. By 2004, it was actually preferred by some prosecutors, who reported higher conviction rates without victim cooperation than with it.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the work of [[Cindy Dyer]], a leading practitioner of evidence-based prosecution.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the use of evidence-based prosecution is strongly encouraged, if not mandated, for agencies receiving federal funding through the STOP [[Violence Against Women Act]].

In its infancy, evidence-based prosecution was often called "victimless prosecution," although this has since become a slang term only, neither factually accurate nor politically correct. As prosecutors and victim advocates frequently point out, evidence-based prosecution often does not deal with a [[victimless crime|"victimless" crime]], nor does it seek to remove the victim or her interests from the case, but rather seeks to focus on the crime and its impact without relying on the victim's participation.  Of course, all prosecutions are based on evidence, so the term "evidence-based" prosecution, while politically correct, is not at all descriptive.  In context, "evidence-based" prosecution is best understood as a prosecution without any testimony from most or all of the principal witnesses and instead making effective use of all remaining or alternative forms of evidence.

==Evidence used==
The most common pieces of evidence used in evidence-based prosecution are:
911 call recordings and transcripts,
Child witness statements,
Neighbor witness statements,
Medical records,
Paramedic log sheets,
Prior police reports,
Restraining orders,
Booking records,
Letters from the suspect,
Videotaped/Audio taped interviews with the victim, and
Defendant's statements.&lt;ref&gt;See Casey Guinn, [http://familyjusticecenter.org ''Prosecuting Domestic Violence Cases Without Victim Participation: Post-Crawford, Davis, and Hammon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic techniques in utilizing these and other pieces of evidence loosely resemble the use of circumstantial evidence in murder cases (in which, of course, the victim is never available to testify). For instance, a recording of a 911 call by the victim might be used to convey what happened to the judge or jury if the victim is not in court to testify, refuses to talk about what happened, or is not truthful about it. Likewise, statements from the Defendant in the case, such as to police officers or detectives, might be introduced to show inconsistencies or admissions about the abuse.

The evidence is often complemented by the use of [[expert witness]] testimony from a domestic violence expert, often an experienced victim advocate, researcher, or law enforcement officer.&lt;ref&gt;See "Explaining Counterintuitive Behavior in Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Cases," ''The Voice'' Volume I, Issue 4, National Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The expert witness helps explain to a judge or jury the reasons a victim may be absent or testifying on behalf of the alleged abuser, as well as educating them on the dynamics of domestic violence and victimization.

==Benefits and criticisms==
The Benefits of evidence-based prosecution are obvious from the prosecutor's point of view. It can result in more convictions of domestic abusers, particularly those who might otherwise go free as a result of their effectiveness in manipulating or threatening their victims to keep them from testifying. It also has the benefit of keeping both uncooperative and cooperative victims safer by placing less emphasis on their role in prosecution and more on that of the State, resulting, at least ideally, in less reason for the abuser to seek revenge against the victim.&lt;ref&gt;See Guinn, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents also look to the drop in domestic violence homicides over the past 20 years as a sign that evidence-based prosecution, in conjunction with other changes, is working to save lives.

Evidence-based prosecution also generates obvious criticisms, from both an ethical and practical prospective. Its use to override a victim's wishes is based upon a paternalistic concept of the State's role in fighting domestic abuse. While prosecutors and victim advocates often contend that an uncooperative victim's desire not to prosecute is based on manipulation and coercion, there are also contrary views.

Many victims of domestic violence constantly make rational choices concerning their own safety and may be in a better position than the prosecutor to judge whether prosecution helps or hurts. Domestic violence most often turns into domestic homicide when the victim is leaving the relationship, something that may be pushed if not forced by aggressive prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;See Neil Websdale, [http://www.vawnet.org "Lethality Assessment Tools: A Critical Analysis"], National Online Resource Center on Violence Against Women&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes following ''Crawford v. Washington''==
{{Main|Crawford v. Washington}}

In 2004, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of ''Crawford v. Washington'', in which they reversed the conviction of a defendant who had been found guilty of stabbing a man based partially on statements made by his wife to police, which were introduced at trial under a [[hearsay]] exception, despite her not being available to testify. The Court held admitting out of court statements under a hearsay exception, even if deemed reliable by the court, violates a defendant's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] [[Confrontation Clause]] right. This new standard replaced a long-standing doctrine set out in ''[[Ohio v. Roberts]]'', in which the Court had previously held that a trial court can admit out of court statements under tradition hearsay exceptions so long as the statements had certain indicators of reliability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0448_0056_ZS.html See ''Ohio v. Roberts'', available at]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's decision had a significant impact on evidence-based prosecution by limiting the use of many of the hearsay exceptions relied upon by prosecutors. Subsequent decisions such as ''[[Davis v. Washington]]'' have further limited the doctrine specifically regarding 911 call recordings.

These decisions have severely curtailed the number of the cases in which prosecutors can utilize evidence-based prosecution. In order to continue the practice, prosecutors have turned to improving law enforcement training at response and investigation in domestic violence cases so that police gather as much admissible evidence as possible.&lt;ref&gt;See Henderson &amp; Stanek, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''''Ex parte Stephens' Estate''''',&lt;ref&gt;1943 CPD 397&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], the deceased disposed of his [[estate (law)|estate]] in terms of fractions, but only provided for nine tenths of the estate. One tenth, therefore, was not provided for. It was argued that it should be divided among the named [[beneficiary|beneficiaries]] in the [[will and testament|will]].

The [[court of law|court]] held that the [[Roman law]] ''nemo pro parte'' rule did not apply in [[South African law|South Africa]]; therefore, the estate was to be divided partly testate and partly [[intestate]]. Had the court divided the remaining one tenth between the nine beneficiaries, it would effectively have been rectifying the will. It held, accordingly, that the remaining one tenth was to be [[devolution|devolved]] in terms of the law of intestate succession.

An '''exemplified copy''' (or '''exemplification''') is an official attested copy or transcript of a public instrument, made under the seal and original pen-in-hand signature{{R|"Georgia1"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131523300100/http://health.state.ga.us/programs/vitalrecords/faq.asp|archivedate=2013-12-23|accessdate=2015-01-01|deadurl=yes}} of a court or public functionary{{R|"Rapalje1"}} and in the name of the sovereign,{{R |"Martin1"}} for example, "The People of the State of New York". Exemplifications can only be attested and executed by either the authority holding the record or the issuing authority.  Exemplified copies are also usually an extract or transcript made directly from the original. They can be contrasted with [[certified copy|certified copies]] which are attested by a public authority who does not necessarily execute the copy; are signed and sealed by the certifier, not necessarily the issuing authority or recorder; and are a facsimile, made from the original or not, and vary as to faithfulness, for example, fair copy, imitative copy, and so forth.{{Citation needed |date = October 2012}}

Certified copies of birth and death records from [[Government of New York City|New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], Georgia, and in certain other locations in the US can, if requested, be accompanied by a letter of exemplification.  This is the first step in a process leading to [[authentication]] or an [[apostille]]. In [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] and certain other common-law jurisdictions, exemplifications may be made of any official document by a [[notary public]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

More specifically, the term refers to an attested copy of a [[legal]] [[pleading]] in its entirety. In this sense it is also known as a triple certificate or three-way certificate. Its authenticity is sworn to by the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the court where the judgment was rendered and counter-authenticated by the presiding judicial officer of that Court. The clerk then swears to the authenticity of the judge's signature, incumbency, and authority. The certificate page with the triple authentication is called the exemplification. A copy of this type is normally required by other [[U.S. state|states]] and [[countries]] when copies are being submitted for filing in their local court.

One of the most common forms of [[sexual violence]] around the world is that which is perpetrated by an intimate partner, leading to the conclusion that one of the most important risk factors for people in terms of their vulnerability to sexual assault is being married or cohabiting with a partner. Other factors influencing the risk of sexual violence include:
*being female&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=UN Women |title=Facts and figures: Ending violence against women |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures |website=UNWomen.org |publisher=UN Women |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;;
*being young;
*being a [[sex worker]];
*[[alcohol abuse]] or other [[substance abuse]];
*having previously been raped or sexually abused;
*becoming more educated and economically empowered, at least where sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner is concerned;
*poverty;
*being incarcerated / institutionalised;
*being mentally disabled

==Age==
Young women are usually found to be more at risk of rape than older women.&lt;ref&gt;Acierno R et al.

Washington, DC, World Bank, 1994 (Discussion Paper No. 255).&lt;/ref&gt; According to data from justice systems and rape crisis centres in Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru and the United States, between one-third and two-thirds of all victims of sexual assault are aged 15 years or less.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfeld LA.

Washington, DC, United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCJ 163392).&lt;/ref&gt; Certain forms of sexual violence, for instance, are very closely associated with a young age, in particular violence taking place in schools and colleges, and trafficking in women for sexual exploitation.

==Alcohol and drug consumption==
Increased vulnerability to sexual violence also stems from the use of alcohol and other drugs. Consuming alcohol or drugs makes it more difficult for people to protect themselves by interpreting and effectively acting on warning signs. Drinking alcohol may also place a person in settings where his or her chances of encountering a potential offender are greater.&lt;ref name="Crowell NA 1996"&gt;Crowell NA, Burgess AW, eds. Understanding violence against women. Washington, DC, National Academy Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Having previously been raped or sexually abused==
There is some evidence linking experiences of sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence with patterns of [[victimization]] during adulthood.&lt;ref name="Crowell NA 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acierno R et al. Risk factors for rape, physical assault, and post-traumatic stress disorder in
women: examination of differential multivariate relationships. Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 1999, 13:541–563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N. Full report of the prevalence, incidence and consequences of violence against women: findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Washington, DC, National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming J 1999"&gt;Fleming J et al. The long-term impact of childhood sexual abuse in Australian women. Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 1999, 23:145–159.&lt;/ref&gt; A national study of violence against women in the United States found that women who were raped before the age of 18 years were twice as likely to be raped as adults, compared with those who were not raped as children or adolescents (18.3% and 8.7%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Tjaden P, Thoennes N. Full report of the prevalence, incidence and consequences of violence against women: findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Washington, DC, National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, United States Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2000 (NCJ 183781).&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of early sexual abuse may also extend to other forms of victimization and problems in adulthood. For instance, a case control study in Australia on the long-term impact of abuse reported significant associations between child sexual abuse and
experiencing rape, sexual and mental health problems, domestic violence and other problems in intimate relationships even after accounting for various family background characteristics.&lt;ref name="Fleming J 1999"/&gt; Those who had experienced abuse involving intercourse had more negative outcomes than those suffering other types of coercion.

Women are at increased risk of sexual violence, as they are of physical violence by an intimate partner, when they become more educated and thus more empowered. Women with no education were found in a national survey in South Africa to be much less likely to experience sexual violence than those with higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview.

Withholding sex and forced sex: dimensions of violence against Zimbabwean women.

Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt; so that men may resort to violence in an attempt to regain control. The relationship between empowerment and physical violence is an n-shape with greater empowerment conferring greater risk up to a certain level, beyond which it starts to become protective.&lt;ref name="Crowell NA 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jewkes R. Intimate partner violence: causes and prevention. Lancet, 2002, 359:1423–1429.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known, though, whether this is also the case for sexual violence.

==Poverty==
Poor women and girls may be more at risk of rape in the course of their daily tasks than those who are better off, for example when they walk home on their own from work late at night, or work in the fields or collect firewood alone. Children of poor women may have less parental supervision when not in school, since their mothers may be at work and unable to afford child care. The children
themselves may, in fact, be working and thus vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Poverty forces many women and girls into
occupations that carry a relatively high risk of sexual violence,&lt;ref&gt;Omorodion FI, Olusanya O. The social context of reported rape in Benin City, Nigeria.

{{Criminal law}}
The term '''felony''', in some [[common law]] countries, is defined as a serious [[crime]]. The word originates from English common law (from the French medieval word "félonie"), where felonies were originally crimes involving confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods. Other crimes were called ''[[misdemeanor]]s''. Many common law countries have now abolished the felony/misdemeanor distinction and replaced it with other distinctions, such as between [[indictable offence]]s and [[summary offence]]s. A felony is generally considered a crime of high [[seriousness]], but a misdemeanor is not.

A person who has committed a felony is a '''felon'''. In addition, upon conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person is known as a '''convicted felon''' or a '''convict'''. In the [[United States]], where the felony/misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor. The actual prison sentence handed out has no effect on the classification, which is based on the ''maximum'' sentence possible under law.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|3559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual states may differ in that definition by using other categories, such as seriousness or context.

Similar to felonies in some [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries (such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]) are ''[[delict]]s'', but in others (such as [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Switzerland]]), ''crimes'' are more serious and ''delicts'' (or délits) are less serious. In still others (such as [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]]), ''crimes'' and ''delicts'' are synonymous (more serious) and are opposed to [[contravention]]s (less serious).

== Overview ==
=== Classification by subject matter ===
Felonies include but are not limited to the following:
* [[Murder]]
* Aggravated [[assault]] or [[Battery (crime)|battery]]
* [[Manslaughter]] (unintentional killing of another)
* [[Animal cruelty]]
* [[Vehicular homicide]]
* [[Larceny]]
* [[Arson]]
* [[Burglary]]
* [[Tax evasion]]
* Various forms of [[fraud]]
* [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|Computer Crime Fraud and Abuse]] (computer hacking)
* The [[Illegal drug trade|manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute]] of certain types or quantities of illegal drugs
* In some states, the simple possession (possession without intent to distribute, ''e.g.'', for [[Drug abuse|personal use]]) of certain types of illegal drugs, usually in more than a certain quantity but regardless of quantity for some drugs in some jurisdictions (such as [[Virginia]] for [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]])
* [[Grand larceny]] or [[grand theft]], ''i.e.'', [[larceny]] or [[theft]] above a certain statutorily established value or quantity of goods
* [[Vandalism]] on federal property.
* [[Treason]]
* [[Rape]]/[[sexual assault]]
* [[Kidnapping]]
* [[Obstruction of justice]]
* [[Perjury]]
* [[Check fraud]]
* [[Copyright infringement]]&lt;ref&gt;Legislative History – Copyright Felony Act. H.R. REP. NO. 997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Child pornography]]
* [[Mail and wire fraud]]
* [[Forgery]]
* [[Threatening the government officials of the United States|Threatening an official]] (police officer, judge)
* [[Extortion]]
* [[Blackmail]]

Broadly, felonies can be characterized as either violent or nonviolent:
* Violent offenses usually contain some element of force or a threat of force against a person. Some jurisdictions classify as violent certain property crimes involving a strong likelihood of [[psychological trauma]] to the property owner; for example, Virginia treats both common-law [[burglary]] (the [[breaking and entering]] of a dwelling house at night with the intent to commit larceny, assault and battery, or any felony therein) and statutory burglary (breaking and entering with [[Specific intent|further criminal intent]] but without the dwelling-house or time elements, such that the definition applies to break-ins at any time and of businesses as well as of dwelling houses) as felonies.

Some offenses, though similar in nature, may be felonies or misdemeanors depending on the circumstances. For example, the illegal manufacture, distribution or possession of controlled substances may be a felony, although possession of small amounts may be only a [[misdemeanor]]. Possession of a deadly weapon may be generally legal, but carrying the same weapon into a restricted area such as a school may be viewed as a serious offense, regardless of whether there is intent to use the weapon. Additionally, [[driving while intoxicated]] in some states may be a misdemeanor if a first offense, but a felony on subsequent offenses.

:"The [[common law]] divided participants in a felony into four basic categories: (1) first-degree principals, those who actually committed the crime in question; (2) second-degree principals, aiders and [[abettor]]s present at the scene of the crime; (3) [[Accessory (legal term)|accessories]] before the fact, aiders and abettors who helped the principal before the basic criminal event took place; and (4) accessories after the fact, persons who helped the principal after the basic criminal event took place. In the course of the 20th century, however, American jurisdictions eliminated the distinction among the first three categories." ''Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez'', {{ussc|source=j|549|183|2007|pin=}} (citations omitted).

=== Classification by seriousness ===
A felony may be punishable with imprisonment for two or more years or [[capital punishment|death]] in the case of the most serious felonies, such as [[murder]]. Indeed, at [[common law]] when the British and American legal systems divorced in 1776, felonies were crimes punishable by either [[capital punishment|death]] or [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of [[property]]. All felonies remain a [[High crime|serious crime]], but concerns of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] (i.e., that the punishment fit the crime) have in modern times prompted legislatures to require or permit the imposition of less serious punishments, ranging from lesser terms of [[imprisonment]] to the substitution of a [[jail]] sentence or even the [[Suspended sentence|suspension]] of all incarceration contingent upon a defendant's successful completion of [[probation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt; Standards for measurement of an offense's seriousness include attempts&lt;ref name=OSS&gt;''Offense Seriousness Scaling: An Alternative to Scenario Methods'', Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Volume 9, Number 3, 309–322, {{doi|10.1007/BF01064464}}
James P. Lynch and Mona J. E. Danner, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k82650582x366612/]&lt;/ref&gt; to quantitatively estimate and compare the effects of a crime upon its specific victims or upon society generally.

In some states, all or most felonies are placed into one of various classes according to their seriousness and their potential punishment upon conviction. The number of classifications and the corresponding crimes vary by state and are determined by the legislature. Usually, the legislature also determines the maximum punishment allowable for each felony class; doing so avoids the necessity of defining specific sentences for every possible crime. For example:
* Virginia classifies most felonies by number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/000/cod/18.2-10.HTM|title=§ 18.2-10. Punishment for conviction of felony; penalty.|website=Leg1.state.va.us|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from Class 6 (least severe: 1 to 5 years in prison or up to 12 months in jail) through Class 2 (20 years to life, ''e.g.'', first-degree murder and aggravated malicious [[wounding]]) up to Class 1 ([[life imprisonment]] or the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], reserved for certain types of murders). Some felonies remain outside the classification system.
* New York State classifies felonies by letter, with some classes divided into sub-classes by Roman numeral; classes range from Class E (encompassing the least severe felonies) through Classes D, C, B, and A–II up to Class A–I (encompassing the most severe).
* Massachusetts classifies felony as an offense that carries any prison time.
* Ohio classifies felonies by degree ranging from first, second, third, fourth, to fifth degree. First-degree felonies are the most serious category, while fifth-degree felonies are the least serious. This is broadly the approach taken by the [[Model Penal Code]], although the Code identifies only three degrees of felony.&lt;ref&gt;MPC § 6.01&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
===History===
[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] wrote that felony "comprises every species of crime, which occasioned at common law the forfeiture of lands or goods."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, W. (1765). ''[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-407.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England]'' (Book IV chapter 7) Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''felony'' was feudal in origin, denoting the value of a man's entire property: "...the consideration for which a man gives up his fief."&lt;ref name="Blackstone"&gt;Blackstone.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone refutes the misconception that felony simply means an offense punishable by death, by demonstrating that not every felony is capital, and not every [[Capital punishment|capital offense]] is a felony. However he concedes that "the idea of felony is indeed so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law do now conform."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, W. (1765). ''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/blackstone/william/comment/book4.7.html Commentaries on the Laws of England]'' (Book IV, Chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty for felony could be avoided by pleading [[benefit of clergy]], which gradually evolved to exempt everybody (whether clergy or not) from that punishment for a first offense, except for [[high treason]] and offenses expressly excluded by statute. During the 19th century criminal law reform incrementally reduced the number of capital offenses to five ''(see [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom]])'', and forfeiture for felony was abolished by the [[Forfeiture Act 1870]]. Consequently, the distinction between felony and misdemeanor became increasingly arbitrary. The surviving differences consisted of different rules of evidence and procedure, and the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] recommended that felonies be abolished altogether. This was done by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], which made all felonies (except treason) misdemeanours, and introduced a new system of classifying crimes as either "arrestable" and "non-arrestable" offenses (according to which a general power of arrest was available for crimes punishable by five years' imprisonment or more).

Arrestable offenses were abolished in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; and today crimes are classified as [[Indictable offence|indictable]] or [[Summary offence|summary]] offenses.

===Procedure===

The [[Trials for Felony Act 1836]] (6 &amp; 7 Will 4 c 114) allowed persons indicted for felonies to be represented by counsel or attorney.

===Terminology===

A person prosecuted for felony was called a [[Prisoner#English law|prisoner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. A First Book of English Law. Alex Grace then got questioned by the Police about a hit and run but was found not guilty.[[Sweet and Maxwell]]. Fourth Edition. 1960. Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]] the distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, such that the law previously applied to misdemeanours was extended to all offences.&lt;ref name="irlact1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/|title=Criminal Law Act, 1997|publisher=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=PDF |url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpCourtsActs.pdf#page=107 |title=CONSOLIDATION AND REFORM OF THE COURTS ACTS |publisher=Law Reform Commission |page=89, fn.298 |series=Law Reform Commission Consultation Papers |issue=46–2007 |year=2007 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister [[Joan Burton]], introducing the bill in the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]], said "The distinction has been eroded over many years and in today's conditions has no real relevance. Today, for example, serious offences such as [[Criminal conversion|fraudulent conversion]] and obtaining property by [[False pretenses|false pretences]] are classified as misdemeanours whereas a relatively trivial offence such as stealing a bar of chocolate is a felony."&lt;ref name="seanad1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/1997/02/26/00006.asp|title=Criminal Law Bill, 1996: Second Stage.|date=26 February 1997|work=Seanad Éireann debates|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 Act, modelled on the English [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], introduced the category of "arrestable offence" for those with penalties of five years' imprisonment or greater.&lt;ref name="irlact1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seanad1997"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 Constitution]] declares that the [[parliamentary privilege]], which protects [[Oireachtas]] members from arrest travelling to or from the legislature, does not apply to "[[Treason in the Republic of Ireland|treason]], felony, and [[breach of the peace]]".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Ireland, Article 15.13&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 Constitutional Review Group recommended replacing "felony" with "serious criminal offence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Oireachtas%201st-%20Progress%20Report%201997.pdf#page=38 |title=Report |author=Constitution Review Group |year=1996 |publisher=Stationery Office |nopp=Y |page=§4: felony or breach of the peace |accessdate=8 August 2013 |location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|''Felony Sentences in State Courts'', study by the [[United States Department of Justice]].]]

The reform of harsh felony laws that had originated in Great Britain was deemed "one of the first fruits of liberty" after the United States became independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Felony Law Reform in the Early Republic|author=Bradley Chapin|publisher=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|volume= 113|number=2|date=Apr 1989|pages=163–183|jstor=20092326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the United States, a felon can face [[Loss of rights due to conviction for criminal offense|long-term legal consequences persisting after the end of their imprisonment]].
The status and designation as a "felon" is considered permanent, and is not extinguished upon [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|sentence]] completion even if [[parole]], [[probation]] or [[Compassionate release|early release]] was given.&lt;ref name="New Jim Crow"&gt;''[[The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness]]'', by Michelle Alexander (The New Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The status can be cleared only by a successful [[appeal]] or [[Pardon|executive clemency]]. However, felons may qualify for restoration of some rights after a certain period of time has passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felon Voting Rights|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loss and Restoration of Civil Rights &amp; Firearms Rights|url=http://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/chart-1-loss-and-restoration-of-civil-rights-and-firearms-privileges/|website=Restoration of Rights Project|publisher=Collateral Consequences Resource Center|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequences felons face in most states include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Felony|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-felony|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Exclusion from obtaining certain [[license]]s, such as a visa, or professional licenses required to legally operate (making some vocations off-limits to felons)
* Exclusion from purchase and possession of [[firearm]]s, [[ammunition]], and [[body armor]]
* Ineligibility to serve on a [[jury]]
* Ineligibility for government assistance or [[welfare]], including being barred from federally funded housing
* [[Deportation|Removal (deportation)]] (if not a citizen)

Additionally, many [[job applications]] and rental applications ask about felony history (with the exception of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massachusetts Law about Criminal Records|url=http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/law-lib/laws-by-subj/about/cori.html|website=Massachusetts Judicial Branch|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and answering dishonestly on them can be grounds for rejecting the application, or termination if the lie is discovered after hire. Convicted felons may not be eligible for certain professional licenses or bonds,&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. federal government attempts to mitigate issues of bonding through the {{cite web|title=Federal Bonding Program|url=http://bonds4jobs.com/|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may raise the cost of an employer's insurance. 

It is broadly legal to [[Employment_discrimination_against_persons_with_criminal_records_in_the_United_States|discriminate against felons in hiring decisions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm|website=U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the decision to rent housing to a person, so felons can face barriers to finding both jobs and housing. Many landlords will not rent to felons, although a blanket ban on renting to felons may violate federal housing law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Domonoske|first1=Camila|title=Denying Housing Over Criminal Record May Be Discrimination, Feds Say|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/04/472878724/denying-housing-over-criminal-record-may-be-discrimination-feds-say|website=NPR|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common term of parole is to avoid associating with other felons. In some neighborhoods with high rates of felony conviction, this creates a situation where many felons live with a constant threat of being arrested for violating parole.&lt;ref name="New Jim Crow"/&gt; Banks may refuse to issue loans to felons, and a felony conviction may prevent employment in banking or finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Epstein|first1=Victor|title=FDIC quietly changes rule that cost thousands their jobs|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/25/fdic-quietly-changes-rule-that-cost-thousands-their-jobs/2588311/|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=USA Today|date=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, restoration of those rights depends on repayment of various fees associated with the felon's arrest, processing, and prison stay, such as restitution to victims, or outstanding fines.&lt;ref name="New Jim Crow"/&gt;

=== Restoration of Rights ===
{{main|Pardon|Expungement in the United States}}
The primary means of restoring civil rights that are lost as a result of a felony conviction are [[Pardon|executive clemency]] and [[Expungement in the United States]].

For state law convictions, expungement is determined by the law of the state. Many states do not allow expungement, regardless of the offense, though felons can seek pardons and clemency, potentially including restoration of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restoration of Rights Project|url=http://restoration.ccresourcecenter.org/|website=Collateral Consequences Resource Center|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal law does not have any provisions for persons convicted of federal felonies in a federal [[United States district court]] to apply to have their record expunged.&lt;ref name="CCRCFed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal  Restoration of Rights, Pardon, Expungement &amp; Sealing|url=http://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/federalrestoration-of-rights-pardon-expungement-sealing/|website=Restoration of Rights Project|publisher=Collateral Consequences Resource Center|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present the only relief that an individual convicted of a felony in federal court may receive is a presidential [[pardon]], which does not expunge the conviction, but rather grants relief from the [[Civil and political rights|civil disabilities]] that stem from it.&lt;ref name="CCRCFed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pardon Information and Instructions|url=https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions|website=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=7 September 2017}} ("While a presidential pardon will restore various rights lost as a result of the pardoned offense and should lessen to some extent the stigma arising from a conviction, it will not erase or expunge the record of your conviction.")&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germany ==
Felonies (''Verbrechen'') are defined as a crime that is punishable with a minimum of one year's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__12.html Section 12: Felonies and Misdemeanours], Bundesministerium der Justiz. "Verbrechen sind rechtswidrige Taten, die im Mindestmaß mit Freiheitsstrafe von einem Jahr oder darüber bedroht sind."&lt;/ref&gt; Misdemeanours (''Vergehen'') are all other crimes punishable by imprisonment with a minimum of less than one year or by fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__12.html Section 12: Felonies and Misdemeanours], Bundesministerium der Justiz. "Vergehen sind rechtswidrige Taten, die im Mindestmaß mit einer geringeren Freiheitsstrafe oder die mit Geldstrafe bedroht sind."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some cases a severe version misdemeanor may be punished with imprisonment of more than one year, yet the crime itself remains considered a misdemeanor. Same applies for a milder version of a felony that is punishable with imprisonment less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__12.html Section 12: Felonies and Misdemeanors], Bundesministerium der Justiz. "Schärfungen oder Milderungen, die nach den Vorschriften des Allgemeinen Teils oder für besonders schwere oder minder schwere Fälle vorgesehen sind, bleiben für die Einteilung außer Betracht."&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to commit a felony is always punishable, whilst an attempt to commit a misdemeanor is solely punishable if particularly prescribed by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__23.html Section 23: Criminality of the Attempt], Bundesministerium der Justiz. "Der Versuch eines Verbrechens ist stets strafbar, der Versuch eines Vergehens nur dann, wenn das Gesetz es ausdrücklich bestimmt."&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[plea bargain]] ([[:de:Verständigung im Strafverfahren|Verständigung im Strafverfahren]], popularly known as a ''Deal'') is not applicable for felony crimes at all.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Freedom of Information laws''' ('''FOI laws''') allow access by the general public to data held by national governments. The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy development and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/other/media/MLWS%2520Commentary/FOI%2520Commentary/460.htm?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=commentary|title=FOI Commentary|website=austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They establish a "right-to-know" legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. Also variously referred to as '''open records''', or '''sunshine laws''' (in the [[United States]]), governments are typically bound by a duty to publish and promote openness. In many countries there are constitutional guarantees for the right of access to information, but these are usually unused if specific support legislation does not exist.

==Introduction==
{{Main|Access to public information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information}}

Over 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of [[freedom of information]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216|title=Statement by European RTI Community on the world’s First Official Access to Information Day!|author=|date=|website=access-info.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://right2info.org/access-to-information-laws/access-to-information-laws-overview-and-statutory#_ftnref7 |title=Access to Information Laws: Overview and Statutory Goals |publisher=Right2info.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Sweden|Sweden]]'s [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|Freedom of the Press Act]] of 1766 is the oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf |title=The World's First Freedom of Information Act |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305004359/http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staples, William R.|title=Encyclopedia of privacy|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mE9fo1rw1SkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Encyclopedia+intitle:of+intitle:Privacy&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O2muT7i8HIWi0QW1kr2WCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intitle%3AEncyclopedia%20intitle%3Aof%20intitle%3APrivacy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most freedom of information laws exclude the private sector from their jurisdiction thus information held by the private sector cannot be accessed as a legal right. This limitation has serious implications because the private sector performs many functions which were previously the domain of the public sector. As a result, information that was previously public is now within the private sector, and the private contractors cannot be forced to disclose information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=211–226|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries are working towards introducing such laws, and many regions of countries with national legislation have local laws. For example, all U.S. states have laws governing access to public documents belonging to the state and local taxing entities. Additionally, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act governs record management of documents in the possession of the federal government.

A related concept is '''open meetings''' legislation, which allows access to government meetings, not just to the records of them. In many countries, [[privacy]] or [[data protection]] laws may be part of the freedom of information legislation; the concepts are often closely tied together in political discourse.

A basic principle behind most freedom of information legislation is that the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] falls on the body ''asked'' for information, not the person ''asking'' for it. The person making the request does not usually have to give an explanation for their actions, but if the information is not disclosed a valid reason has to be given.

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as “International Day for the Universal Access to Information” or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as “Right to Know Day” since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

{{Main|Access to public information in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was the first country in the Balkan region to adopt a Freedom of Information Act. '''Freedom of Access to Information Act''' or FOIA - was adopted by the Parliament Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 17 November 2000. Both federal entities - the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - passed freedom of information laws in 2001, the '''Freedom of Access to Information Act for the Republika Srpska''' and '''Freedom of Access to Information Act for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' respectively.

The FOIA Act changed on the BiH state level two times. The first alteration was passed in 2006, enabling stronger legal protection within the framework of administrative law of BiH. The second alteration was passed in December 2009, which enforced legal penalties for prescribed violations.

===Brazil===
{{See also|habeas data}}
In [[Brazil]], the Article 5, XXXIII, of the Constitution sets that "everyone shall have the right to receive information of his own interest or of public interest from public entities, which shall be given within the time prescribed by law". Also, article 22 of the Federal law nº 8.159/1991 grants the right to "full access to public documents".
A statute passed in 2011 and that will enter into force in 2012 (Federal Law 12.527/2011, promulgated on 28 November 2011) regulates the manner and the timetable for the information to be given by the State.

===Bulgaria===
{{main|Access to public information in Bulgaria}}

{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}
In [[Bulgaria]], the '''Access to Public Information Act''' was passed in 2000, following a 1996 recommendation from the Constitutional Court to implement such a law.

===Canada===
{{Main|Freedom of information in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the '''[[Access to Information Act]]''' allows citizens to demand records from federal bodies. The act came into force in 1983, under the [[Pierre Trudeau]] government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/#|title=The Dark Country|accessdate=18 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103105048/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/|archivedate=3 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by the [[Information Commissioner of Canada]].

There is also a complementary '''''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]''''' that was introduced in 1983. The purpose of the ''Privacy Act'' is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the [[privacy]] of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a [[Crown copyright]]. Complaints for possible violations of the Act may be reported to the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]].

Canadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain [[personal information]] about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]'' but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the ''[[Access to Information Act]]''.
Each province and territory in Canada has its own access to information legislation. In many cases, this is also the provincial public sector privacy legislation. For example:
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Alberta]])
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Manitoba]])
* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Nova Scotia)]]
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Ontario]])
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Saskatchewan]])
* Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information ([[Quebec]])

From 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the [[Coordination of Access to Information Requests System]].

A 393-page report released in September 2008, sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups, compares Canada's Access to Information Act to the FOI laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/index100/foi |title=Fallen Behind: Canada’s Access to Information Act in the World Context |publisher=.telus.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[The Walrus (magazine)]] published a detailed history of FOI in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917055940/http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country|date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cayman Islands===
{{Update|section|date=February 2010}}
The Freedom of Information Law was passed in 2007 and was brought into force in January 2009.

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], article 8 of the [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]] provides for the freedom of information. A law titled Law on Access to Public Information (''Ley de Acceso a la Información Pública'') took effect on April 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcn.cl/leyes/pdf/actualizado/276363.pdf |title=Law 20,285 |format=PDF |publisher=Bcn.cl |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
In April 2007, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of the]] [[People's Republic of China]] promulgated the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Open Government Information" (中华人民共和国政府信息公开条例), which came into effect on May 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2007-04/24/content_592937.htm|title=Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Open Government Information (中华人民共和国政府信息公开条例)|publisher=Gov.cn|language=Chinese|date=24 April 2007|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
The [[Colombia]]n constitution grants the right of access to public information through ''Law 57 of 1985'' which thereby mandates the publishing of acts and official documents. This is implemented and applies to documents that belong to official facilities (offices or the like). Additionally there is the anti [[corruption]] statement of ''Law 190 of 1955'' also known as ''anti corruption act'' which in its 51st article mandates public offices to list in visible area all the contracts and purchases made by month. The latter taking place slowly. A more modern law, the "Ley de transparencia y del derecho de acceso a la información pública nacional" its at its final stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congresovisible.org/proyectos-de-ley/por-medio-de-la-cual/6501/|language=Spanish|title=Congreso Visible|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 23 of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|constitution]] states that "Every person has the right to present petitions to the authorities for the general or private interest and to secure their prompt resolution. The legislative body may regulate the presentation of petitions to private organisations in order to guarantee fundamental rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/colombia_const2.pdf|title = Text of the Constitution of Colombia (1991)|date = |accessdate = 7 October 2015|website = http://confinder.richmond.edu/|publisher = Richmond University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article justifies the existence of a jurisdictional mechanism known a petition action. This action is regulated by the law 1755 of 2015 and is considered by the Colombian Judicial Doctrine as a fundamental human right. According to the law all petitions should be fully addressed in 15 business days. If not addressed the official in charge of resolving the petition may be charged with misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Consulta de la Norma:|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=62152|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cook Islands===
Access to official information is governed by the [[Official Information Act 2008]]. The law is based heavily on the [[Official Information Act 1982|New Zealand legislation]].

===Croatia===
{{Main|Access to public information in Croatia}}
In [[Croatia]], the '''Zakon o pravu na pristup informacijama''' (''Act on the Right of Access to Information'') of 2003 extends to all public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/307079.html|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o pravu na pristup informacijama|author=[[Croatian Parliament]]|publisher=[[Narodne novine]]|work=NN 172/2003|date=2003-10-21|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
{{Main|Access to public information in Cyprus}}

The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on freedom of expression. The No. 184(I)/2017 law on access to information in the southern part of the Republic of Cyprus of the country has been published on 22 December 2017. A law that falls below Council of Europe standards in the Northern occupied part of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is de facto divided.

As to 2011, a research by the Open Cyprus Project showed that there was a level of 75% of administrative silence island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus.

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information was being discussed in the Parliament of the Republic of Cyprus.

On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017 [http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html Law on the Right of Access to Information of the Public Sector]).

Access to information is limited by “the obligation to maintain secrecy.”&lt;ref name="Folketing"&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,”.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.4, S.14}} Considerations of State security, defence, foreign policy, external economic interests as well as public financial interests can limit the granting of access to the information.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.3, S.13}}
Registers and records processed electronically are excluded from the administrative documents that can be given access to.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.2, S.5.2}} Section 10 outlines other areas excluded from access, such as records of meetings of the [[Council of State (Denmark)|Council of State]], minutes, as well as documents prepared for such meetings; correspondence between ministries concerning legislation and material used for scientific research or public statistics.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.3, S.10}}

====Appeals====
Decision to grant or not to grant access can be appealed.&lt;ref name="CLD"&gt;“Global Right to Information Rating: Denmark,” Centre for Law and Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.4, S.15.2}} Decisions can also be appealed externally to Folketingets Ombudsman.&lt;ref name="CLD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banisar"&gt;David Banisar, “Freedom of Information and Access to Government Record Laws around the World,” The freedominfo.org Global Survey, May 2004, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ombudsman can also deliver opinions and review decisions; however, these are not binding even though generally followed.&lt;ref name="Banisar"/&gt; Ombudsman receives 200-300 complaints annually; approximately 15 percent of complaints are ruled in favour of appellants.&lt;ref name="Banisar"/&gt;

====Revisions====
The exemption regarding EU documents was taken out of the Act in 1991.&lt;ref name="Banisar2"&gt;Banisar, “Freedom of Information and Access to Government Record Laws around the World,” 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments were also made in 2000; they concerned data on the employees of the Government.&lt;ref name="Banisar2"/&gt; In January 2014 new Public Records Act was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Helle Krunke, “Freedom of Information and Open Government in Denmark: Progress or Deterioration?”&lt;/ref&gt; The new act was highly debated since it was considered to limit transparency in the Government and legislative proceedings; Denmark received one point less in the category of Political Environment when compared with the Freedom of the Press report of 2015.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"&gt;Freedom House, “Country Report: Denmark.” Freedom of the Press 2016, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; The new legislation caused demonstrations and protests.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; It can be regarded as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; After the Public Records Act of 2013 came into effect, public access to information regarding the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service|Intelligence Services]] instead of falling under the Public Records Act is now managed by the Act on the Security and Intelligence Service as well as the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; In addition, the access to legislative process was further restricted. According to the new Act documents in the drafting stage are not to be accessed as well as “other corresponding political activities,” so restriction is not concerning only Bills.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; In the future, it will not be possible to find the calendars of ministers being published.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Act was created while keeping in mind the strengthening the project of the Open Government; the list of institutions covered by the Act was extended as well as list of public-private institutions and companies.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt;

Rough drafts and projects that are not part of an administrative procedure are not included.

===Ecuador===
In [[Ecuador]], the '''Transparency and Access to Information Law''' of 2004 declares that the right of access to information is guaranteed by the state.

===El Salvador===
In [[El Salvador]], the '''Law on Access to Public Information''' was given assent by The Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on 3 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedominfo.org/2011/03/el-salvador-joins-the-list-of-foi-countries/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment, the [[Aarhus convention]] grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice in governmental [[decision-making]] processes. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.

====Council of Europe====
The recognition of the right to access to public information under [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] (including "freedom (..) to receive (..) information") of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was one of subjects in ''Guerra v. Italy'' case before the European Court of Human Rights in 1998. The majority considered Article 10 was not applicable to the complaint. However, the court found that in the specific case, which included living near a high-risk factory, not providing information was in violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] (respect to private and family life). Besides, two judges expressed a dissent on applicability of Article 10, and further six judges reserved a possibility, that in other circumstances, right to access to information could be protected by Article 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=696012&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Grand Chamber judgment on application no. 14967/89] See para. 50-60, as well as concurring opinion of Mrs Palm, joined by Mr Bernhardt, Mr Russo, Mr Macdonald, Mr Makarczyk and Mr van Dijk, partly dissenting opinion of Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, concurring opinion of Mr Jambrek&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has considered in 1996, that "public access to clear and full information on this subject [Chernobyl disaster]—and many others for that matter—must be viewed as a basic human right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta96/ERES1087.htm|title=PACE resolution no. 1087 (1996) on the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster|publisher=Assembly.coe.int|date=1996-04-26|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717004711/http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta96%2FERES1087.htm|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, CoE Convention on Access to Official Documents was opened for signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=205&amp;CM=2&amp;DF=23/11/2010&amp;CL=ENG |title=Convention on Access to Official Documents |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====

=====Right of access to documents of the Union=====
'''Article 42 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|CFR]]''' and '''Article 15 [[TFEU]]''' give ″[a]ny citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, [...] a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, whatever their medium." It follows from Article 15 TFEU that this right is "subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined" in legislation.

'''Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:145:0043:0048:EN:PDF |title=Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; further defines this right of access to documents of the three institutions; for most other EU bodies and agencies, there is a provision in the legal act establishing them which makes Regulation No 1049/2001 applicable to them as well.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:173:0005:0005:EN:PDF Joint declaration relating to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001]; for the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]], see Article 11 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:201:0030:0040:EN:PDF Council Decision 2010/427/EU]&lt;/ref&gt; In some other cases, specific rules apply (e.g. to the [[European Economic and Social Committee|EESC]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:205:0019:0023:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee of the Regions|CoR]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:160:0096:0099:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2013:038:0002:0004:EN:PDF |title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Auditors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:067:0001:0004:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004D0003:20110618:EN:PDF |title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Document" is defined broadly and it is assumed that all documents, even if classified, may be subject to right of access unless it falls under one of the exceptions. If access is refused, the applicant is allowed a confirmatory request. A complaint against a refusal can be made with the European Ombudsman and/or an appeal can be brought before the European [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]].

=====Re-use of public sector information=====
In addition, '''Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:345:0090:0096:EN:PDF |title=Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out the rules and practices for accessing public sector information resources for further exploitation. This directive has been reviewed in 2013 by '''Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:175:0001:0008:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information|last=|first=|date=2013-06-26|website=|publisher=EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Register of lobbyists=====
Since 2008, the [[European Commission]] operates the Register of Interest representatives, a voluntary register of lobbyists at the European union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090520212359/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/ |archivedate=2009-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Access to Environmental Information=====
[[Freedom of access to information Directive|Directive 2003/4/EC]] of the European Parliament and Council provides for citizens of each country to have freedom of access to information on the environment, in line with the requirements of the [[Aarhus Convention]]. Governments are required to transcribe the directive into national legislation (for example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]).

=====Personal data=====
Directive 95/46/EC, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]], provides a variety of rights in relation to personal data, including a right of access. This has been transcribed into national legislation through, for example, the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] (United Kingdom) and the Data Protection 2003 (Ireland).

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], the '''Laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta 9.2.1951/83''' (''Act on the Openness of Public Documents'' of 1951) established the openness of all records and documents in the possession of officials of the state, municipalities, and registered religious communities. Exceptions to the basic principle could only be made by law, or by an executive order for specific enumerated reasons such as national security. The openness of unsigned draft documents was not mandated, but up to the consideration of the public official. This weakness of the law was removed when the law was revised in the 1990s. The revised law, the '''Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta 21.5.1999/621''' (''Act on the Openness of Government Activities'' of 1999), called in short "Publicity Act" ({{lang-fi|Julkisuuslaki}}) also extended the principle of openness to corporations that perform legally mandated public duties, such as pension funds and public utilities, and to computer documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.om.fi/23963.htm|title=Act on the Openness of Government Activities, Finnish Ministry of Justice|publisher=Om.fi|date=2007-05-31|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Publicity Act establishes a process by which any person may access any record in possession of an authority. The person may ask the authority for the document in person or in writing. When making the request, the requester needs to specify the document so that it can be identified. However, the authority is liable to assist the person with its document registers and indices in this task. After receiving the request, the authority has two weeks to give the document. If the decision is negative, and document is withheld, the requester may appeal to the administrative court. The document may be given orally, for reading and copying in the authority's premises or as an electronic or paper copy, as requested by the person. However, the copying may be declined if it would be unfeasible because of the large number of documents or otherwise technically difficult. There are also a number of limitations on the release of electronic documents designed for the protection of the individual privacy.&lt;ref name=julkisuuslaki&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990621 Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta] (621/1999). Retrieved on 2015-11-17. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§13, 14, 15}}

The reasons for withholding a document are listed in the article 24 of the Act. They may be grouped to three categories: automatic non-openness, conditional non openness or conditional openness. The documents where automatic non-openness is prescribed remain withheld in all cases. In the case of conditional non-openness, the reasonability of the non-openness is reviewed case-by-case by the authority and, if appeals are made, by the court. In the third category, openness is a rule, and the reason for non-openness needs to be established by the authority.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24}}

The absolute reasons for non-openness are (subpoint of Article 24 in captions)&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24}}
*Documents of the foreign policy committee of the [[Government of Finland|Council of State]], foreign policy memos of the foreign ministry on political status, negotiations with foreign governments or organisations and diplomatic cryptograms, unless released by the ministry (1)
*registers held by law enforcement for investigation and prevention of crimes, as well as passport or ID card photos and biometric information on them (4)
*statistics and other documents on economic policy that might affect financial markets, until they are released to public (13)
*documents handed over to a statistical authority for the compilation of statistics and documents handed over voluntarily to an authority for purposes of research and statistics (16)

*documents relating to the care of students, as well as any student evaluations containing verbal information on the personal qualities of the student (30)
*documents containing a secret phone number, or the location of a mobile communications device (31)
*documents identifying an anonymous witness (31a)
*documents containing information on individual's political opinions, hobbies, personal habits, membership and activities in associations, family life or opinions uttered within private life. However, information on having held positions of responsibility held or having been a candidate for them is public, as well as being aa founding member of a political party or electoral association. (32)

Conditional non-openness is mandated for the following categories of documents, unless it is "obviously clear" that the protected interest is not endangered&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24.1}}
* documents concerning international relations of Finland, Finnish institutions or Finnish persons, unless it is obviously clear that no harm will befall on Finnish foreign relations now or in the future (2)
* documents concerning criminal investigations or pending prosecutions until the investigation is over or the prosecution has pleaded, unless it is obviously clear that the investigation or the prosecution is not harmed and no private person will suffer material harm nor suffering (3)
* documents on security of buildings, facilities, communications or information systems, unless it is obviously clear that the security is not endangered (7)
* all documents of [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]] and other documents concerning state security, unless it is obviously clear that state security is not endangered (9)
* documents concerning national defence or military intelligence, unless it is obviously clear that national defence is in no way harmed or endangered (10)
* documents, records and data used as a basis for or concerning an academic thesis, scientific or scholarly research or product development, unless it is obviously clear that the research, development or study, their proper evaluation, the student or the researcher or the funder of the work are not harmed (21)
*documents concerning a refugee or an applicant for a visa, residence permit or an asylum, unless it is obviously clear that the person or his loved ones are not harmed (24)
*information contained in the [[criminal register]] and in other registers held by authorities overseeing the execution of punishments, as well as documents of authorities if they contain personal information on persons who have lost their personal freedom or who participate in witness protection programme, unless it is obviously clear that the security, future employment and social reintegration of the person will not be endangered and there is a valid reason for releasing the specific information in question (28)

Conditional openness is prescribed for the following categories of information:&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24.1}}
*technical and tactical methods of police, [[Finnish Border Guard]] and prison authorities, if their release would make the work of such authorities more difficult (5)
*administrative complaints during their handling, if their release would harm investigation or be likely to cause suffering or harm to a party in the matter, unless grave reasons exist for release of information (6)
*information on civil defence or rescue preparations and on safety investigations, if the release would endanger rescue work, civil defence preparations, safety or security or their continued development, or would endanger getting information in future safety investigations, or would hurt the victims of an accident, their memory or their loved ones (8)
*information on financial, monetary, labour or fiscal policy measures or their preparations or pre-studies if the release would defeat the purpose of such measures, endanger the negotiation position of the state or otherwise cause great harm to the management of such policies (11)
*studies conducted by regulatory authorities of financial and pension institutions, if the studies include information on the regulated bodies and the release would endanger the proper functioning of financial markets (12)
*documents containing information on endangered species or valuable natural areas, if the release would endanger their preservation (14)
*documents pertaining to an investigation or other control measure by an authority if the release would endanger the regulatory control measure or its purpose (15)
*detailed returns of political candidates on their campaign funding (15)
*business and professional secrets of public bodies, if a competing the body would suffer economic harm, or a public or private body pursuing competing or similar activities would gain a competitive advantage by the release or if the possibilities of a body bound by the Publicity Act to make advantageous purchases or other financial arrangements would be harmed (17)
*documents used by a public body in a collective bargaining or labour action if the release would harm the public body as the employer (18)
*documents used for preparation of a legal action, if the release would harm a public body as a party to a suit (19)
*documents containing information on entrance examination or other examination or test, if the release would defeat the purpose of the test or exam or prevent its future use (22)
* documents containing sensitive information on the private life of a suspect, plaintiff, witness or other party to a criminal investigation, or information on the victim that would hurt the victim's memory or her loved ones, unless the release is necessary to conduct the work of an authority (26)

Non-open information remains non-open for 25 years after it was created or obtained by an authority. Documents that are non-open to protect the privacy of an individual remain non-open for 50 years after the protected individual has died.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§31.2,31,5}}

If information is still, after 25 years, valid and describes a security measure of a building, facility, system or method or it is still part of a plan used for national defence or civil defence, it remains non-open as long as the information is pertinent for the purpose. The same indefinite non-openness applies to all documents under international security obligations, if the release might still affect Finnish foreign relations negatively. The non-openness of other documents may be prolonged up to 55 years by the [[Council of State (Finland)|Council of State]], if necessary to safeguard a protected interest.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§31.3–4}}

===France===
In [[France]], the accountability of public servants is a constitutional right, according to the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''.

The implementing legislation is the '''Loi n°78-753 du 17 juillet 1978 portant diverses mesures d'amélioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal''' (''Act No. 78-753 of 17 July 1978. On various measures for improved relations between the Civil Service and the public and on various arrangements of administrative, social and fiscal nature''). It sets as a general rule that citizens can demand a copy of any administrative document (in paper, digitised or other form), and establishes the ''Commission d’Accès aux Documents Administratifs'', an independent administrative authority, to oversee the process.

===Georgia===

{{main|Access to public information in Georgia}}

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the General Administrative Code contains a '''Law on Freedom of Information'''.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the federal government passed a freedom of information law on September 5, 2005; it was last updated on August 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_ifg/index.html Federal Act Governing Access to Information held by the Federal Government (Freedom of Information Act)]''. The law of September 5, 2005, with amendments as of August 7, 2013; English translation from the German provided by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Available on the website of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, as part of the project "Gesetze im Internet" (laws on the Internet), in cooperation with juris GMBH, a legal information service. Retrieved 2015-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The law grants each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. No legal, commercial, or any other kind of justification is necessary.

Twelve of the sixteen [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]—[[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], [[Rheinland-Pfalz]], [[Saarland]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Thuringia|Thüringen]]—have approved individual "[[w:de:Informationsfreiheitsgesetz|Informationsfreiheitsgesetze]]" (Freedom of Information laws).

===Greece===
{{Main|Access to public information in Greece}}

In [[Greece]], the 1975 Greek Constitution guaranteed the right of access to administrative documents and the right of citizens to obtain information. However it was not until 1986 that the first law was passed to provide for access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorovinis|first1=Vassilis|last2=Etairia|first2=Elliniki|title=Doors to Democracy|date=June 1998|publisher=The Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe|location=Szentendre, Hungary|isbn=963 8454 58 X|page=89|url=http://archive.rec.org/REC/Publications/PPDoors/WEST/cover.html|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 16 (Right to Access Administrative Documents—Δικαίωμα γνώσης διοικητικών εγγράφων) of Law 1599/1986 (State-citizenry Relationship—Σχέσεις Κράτους-πολίτη) introduced the right of all citizens to read most administrative documents. This right is now codified as article 5 (Access to documents—Πρόσβαση σε έγγραφα) of the Administrative Procedural Code (Κώδικας Διοικητικής Διαδικασίας), Law 2690/1999. Under this article, citizens have a right to know the content of administrative documents. Administrative documents are defined as those produced by public sector entities, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, instructions, responses, consultatory responses, and decisions. In addition, citizens with a legitimate interest may also access ''private'' documents stored by public services. The right cannot be exercised if the document concerns the private or family lives of others, or if the document's confidentiality is safeguarded by specific legal provisions. Furthermore, the public body can refuse access if the document refers to discussions in the Cabinet, or if accessing the document can seriously hamper criminal or administrative violation investigations carried out by judicial, police, or military authorities.

Citizens may study the documents at the place where they are archived, or they may obtain a copy at their own cost. Access to one's own medical data is provided with the help of a doctor. Access to documents should take into account whether they be covered by copyright, patent, or trade secret regulations.

In addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the [[Freedom of information legislation#European Union|European Union Directive 2003/98/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html Article 5 of the Administrative Procedures Code — Document Access] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730040742/http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html |date=2007-07-30 }} (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]] there are no laws specifically enacted to guarantee the freedom of information.

Since March 1995, the [[Government of Hong Kong]] has promulgated a "Code on Access to Information" to serve a similar purpose. This code, like other internal regulations of the Government, was not legislated by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and has a minimal legal status. It requires government agencies listed in its appendix to appoint Access to Information Officers to answer citizens' requests for governmental records. A fee may be charged prior to the release of information. The code does not require the government to archive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gov.hk/en/index.htm |title=Code on Access to Information |publisher=Access.gov.hk |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], the '''Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Public Access to Data of Public Interest''' of 1992 extends a right of access to all data of public interest, defined as any information processed by a body performing a governmental function. Complaints and contested applications may be appealed to the Data Protection Commissioner or to the court.

In 2005 the Parliament adopted the '''Act on the Freedom of Information by Electronic Means''' (Act XC of 2005). The Act has three basic parts: 1. electronic disclousure of certain data by public sector bodies, 2. publicity of legislation and 3. openness of Court decisions.

===Iceland===
In [[Iceland]] the Information Act (Upplysingalög) Act no. 50/1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/lagas/141b/2012140.html |title=2012 nr. 140 28. desember/ Upplýsingalög |publisher=Althingi.is |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives access to public information.

===India===
{{main|Right to Information (India)}}

The [[Right to Information Act]] (RTI Act) was passed by [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] on 11 May 2005 and was published in the gazette of India on 15 June 2005. It came into effect on 12 October 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangedco.gov.in/chapter1.php|title=home page|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816165037/http://www.tangedco.gov.in/chapter1.php|archive-date=2016-08-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_right-to-information-act-to-complete-five-years-on-october-12_1450688 |title=Right to Information Act to complete five years on October 12 &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the erstwhile Freedom of information Act, 2002. The Supreme Court of India had, in several Judgments prior to enactment of both Acts, interpreted Indian Constitution to read Right to Information as the Fundamental Right as embodied in Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and also in Right to Life. RTI Act laid down a procedure to guarantee this right. Under this law all Government Bodies or Government funded agencies have to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO). The PIO's responsibility is to ensure that information requested is disclosed to the petitioner within 30 days or within 48 hours in case of information concerning the life or liberty of a person. The law was inspired by previous legislation from select states (among them [[Tamil Nadu]] (1997), [[Goa]] (1997), [[Rajasthan]] (2000), [[Karnataka]] (2000), [[Delhi]] (2001), [[Maharashtra]] (2002) etc.) that allowed the right to information (to different degrees) to citizens about activities of any State Government body.

A number of high-profile disclosures revealed corruption in various government schemes such scams in [[Public Distribution System]]s (ration stores), disaster relief, construction of highways etc. The law itself has been hailed as a landmark in India's drive towards more openness and accountability.

However the RTI India has certain weaknesses that hamper implementation.

[[RTI NEWS]]

'''On International Right to Information Day 1000 Copies of The RTI Act Sent by Mr. Naveen Agrawal in India'''

Nagpur (Dt.28/10/2018). 28 September is observed as International Right to Information Day across the world. Mr. Naveen Maheshkumar Agrawal, Registrar, Dada Ramchand Bakhru Sindhu Mahavidyalaya, with a view to creating awareness about the Right to Information Act, 2005 in society sent the soft copies of the RTI Act to 1000 people on International Right to Information Day. It was indeed a novel way on his part to spread awareness about the Act. The copies of the Act were sent in English, Hindi and Marathi languages. Introducing transparency in the government work is the main purpose of this Act. But even to the lack of awareness in information seeker and information provider, the effective implementation of the said act is badly affected. In 2017 also Mr. Naveen Agrawal had sent 101 applications under RTI Act 2005 to different public authorities seeking information on different issues on International Day of Right to Information with the purpose of creating awareness about the Act.
&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alasdair S., A Great and Revolutionary Law? The First Four Years of India's Right to Information Act (January 9, 2010). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1527858 Available at SSRN.]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been questions on the lack of speedy appeal to non-compliance to requests. The lack of a central PIO makes it difficult to pin-point the correct PIO to approach for requests. There is also a criticism of the manner in which the Information Commissioners are appointed to head the information commission. It is alleged by RTI Activists that bureaucrats working in close proximity with the government are appointed in the RTI Commissions in a non-transparent manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090528/punjab.htm#2 TribuneIndia.com], Appointment of bureaucrat as Punjab CIC draws flak&lt;/ref&gt; The PIO, being an officer of the relevant Government institution, may have a vested interest in not disclosing damaging information on activities of his/her Institution, This therefore creates a conflict of interest. In the state of Maharashtra it was estimated that only 30% of the requests are actually realised under the Maharashtra Right to Information act. The law does not allow disclosure of information that affects national security, defence, and other matters that are deemed of national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filertionline.in|title=File RTI Online - Suchana ka Adhikar - Filing RTI across India|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtiindia.org RTI India]: The Complete Right to Information Portal of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtiact2005.com/ RTI Act, 2005]: RTI Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://getup4change.org/rti/ GetUp4Change]: Online Community to file RTI applications anonymously.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinerti.com OnlineRTI]: Portal to submit RTI applications online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtination.com RTINation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529073651/http://www.rtination.com/ |date=2012-05-29 }}: Portal to file RTI applications online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison between Indian and British legislative efforts see [http://202.71.128.135:5/bc/focusdetails.asp?ID=19 British Council India's LEGAL eNEWS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927100419/http://202.71.128.135:5/bc/focusdetails.asp?ID=19 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rti.gov.in/rticorner/studybypwc/index-study.htm |title=Study conducted by Pricewaterhouse Cooper for the Department of Personnel and Training in 2008-2009 on the implementation of the RTI Act |publisher=Rti.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
The Law on Dissemination of and Free Access to Information was approved by Iranian Parliament in 2008. Its English and Arabic renditions were officially released as part of the government's efforts to promote Freedom of Information (FOI) in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iran-releases-english-arabic-versions-of-law-on-free-access-to-information/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the Freedom of Information Act 1997&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997_13.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208023235/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997_13.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; came into effect in April, 1998.  This provided for members of the public to access information specifically about themselves, amend incorrect information, and request an explanation behind administrative decisions concerning themselves, as well as allowing any person to access records generated by a list of specified public bodies. The Act is seen as having led to a sea-change in the relationship between the citizen, journalists, [[Department of state (Ireland)|government departments]] and [[Irish Government#Public sector|public bodies]]. Disclosure is the default assumption of the Act; bodies can withhold information only by citing exemptions specified in the legislation. Decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for information may be reviewed by the [[Information Commissioner]].

The Act was subsequently amended by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0009/index.html|title=Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003|publisher=IrishStatuteBook.ie|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments introduced fees for non-personal requests and restricted the kinds of material which could be accessed.

On 14 October 2014, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002113/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/ Freedom of Information Act 2014] repealed the 1997 and 2003 Acts, removing most of the restrictions introduced in 2003 and widened the range of bodies covered to all public bodies, unless specifically exempt. It also allowed for the Government to prescribe (or designate) other bodies receiving significant public funds, so that the FOI legislation applies to them also.

One particular controversy which has caused concern to journalists and historians is that traditionally government ministers would annotate and sign any major policy or report documents which they had seen. However this practice has fallen out of favour because of the new openness. This annotation and signing of documents has often given a [[paper trail]] and unique insight as to "what the minister knew" about a controversy or how he or she formed an opinion on a matter. Also civil and public servants have become more informal, in keeping written records of potentially controversial meeting and avoiding writing memos as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=1583676&amp;issue_id=13822 |title=Harney accused over 'new culture of secrecy' in Health - National News, Frontpage - Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this information would not often be released, and sometimes only under the [[thirty year rule]], the fact that government ministers now do not annotate and sign documents creates the concerns that while government is open it is not accountable as to who did or saw what or how decision making process works.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], the Freedom of Information Law, 5758-1998, supported by the Freedom of Information Regulations, 5759-1999, controls freedom of information. It defines the bodies subject to the legislation by a set of listed categories - essentially, most public bodies - and provides for the government to publish a list of all affected bodies. However, this list does not seem to have been made publicly available, if indeed it was ever compiled.{{POV check inline|date=November 2011}} Many public bodies are not obliged to follow the law, which limits the potential for use by the public.

The Israeli Freedom of Information Law has, in some cases, actually achieved the opposite intended result.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} some Government agencies now take the position that a citizen may only request information via FOIL—i.e., an official letter designated as such and including the 95 [[Israeli new shekel|shekel]] fee. Thus an Israeli citizen in many cases cannot simply write a letter asking a question, and can be asked to file a FOIL application with a fee and wait the minimum statutory 30 days for a reply, which the agency can extend to 60 days. In many cases FOIL letters are simply ignored,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} or some laconic response is sent stating the request is either unclear, unspecific, too vague or some other legalese, anything in order to keep the information away from the public.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} When the 60 days are up, if the anticipated result usually yield nothing significant,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} the applicant must petition the District Court to compel disclosure, a procedure that requires attorneys to draft pleadings and a payment of (approximately) $420 court fee. A judgement in such FOIL appeals in Israel can take many months, and again the agency can easily{{POV statement|date=September 2011}} avoid disclosure by simply not complying, although risking being charged with contempt of court. While there are some successes in courts compelling Israeli government agencies to disclose information, they are usually in non-controversial areas. The law provides for the expected{{POV check inline|date=November 2011}} "security" exemption and an applicant applying for such information can expect not to benefit from FOIL (and also have his or her court appeal rejected). it will be noted that Applicants can sometimes be helped by [[The Movement for Freedom of Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meida.org.il |title=Meida.org.il |publisher=Meida.org.il |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Chapter V of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 provides for access to administrative documents. However, the right to access is limited. The law states that those requesting information must have a legal interest. The 1992 regulations require "a personal concrete interest to safeguard in legally relevant situations." The courts have ruled that this includes the right of environmental groups and local councilors to demand information on behalf of those they represent. It was amended in 2005. The revision appears to adopt the court rulings and relax the interest somewhat to allow access when an individual can show they represent a more general public interest.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, the relevant legislation is the '''Access to Information Act, 2002'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Access to Information Unit Jamaica Archives &amp; Records Department|title=The Access to Information Act 2002|url=http://www.ati.gov.jm/sites/default/files/Documents/atiact_0.pdf|website=ati.gov.jm/content/access-information-act|publisher=Government of Jamaica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], the "Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs" (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律) was promulgated in 1999. The law was enforced in 2001.

In many local governments, it establishes the regulations about information disclosure (情報公開条例) from the latter half of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (総務省) [http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/translation3.htm Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219011722/http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/translation3.htm |date=2013-02-19 }}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20010423185834/http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/mainpoint1.htm Main Points of the Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/IRON&gt;--&gt;

===Latvia===
The Constitution of Latvia states: "Article 100. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to freely receive, keep and distribute information and to express his or her views. Censorship is prohibited." The right to access state held information has been repeatedly recognised by the Constitutional Court of Latvia, most notably in its judgment "On Conformity of the Cabinet of Ministers 21 January 1997 Regulations No.46 "On Government Agreements" with the 20 November 1998 "Information Accessibility Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/?lang=2&amp;mid=19 |title=Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia |publisher=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judgment 04-02(99)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law on Freedom of Information was signed into law by the State President in November 1998 and has been amended a number of times recently. Any person can ask for information in "any technically feasible form" without having to show a reason. The request can be oral or written. Bodies must respond in 15 days.

===Malta===
On the 1st of September 2012, Legal Notice 156 of 2012 brought the Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 496 of the Laws of Malta) fully into force, allowing the public (resident citizens of Malta, the EU and the EEA) to submit requests for documents/information held by the Government. FOI requests are submitted free of charge but processing of documents by public authorities may require the public to pay fees which never exceed Eur 40. When access to documents is refused, the FOIA in Malta provides for a complaint and appeal mechanism that can be ultimately resolved through the Courts of Appeal.

===Liberia===
President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] signed the Freedom of Information Act of 2010 into law in October 2010. [[Liberia]] became only the fourth country in [[Africa]], and the first in [[West Africa]], to pass such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/node/8622|title=Ellen Signs "Freedom of Information Act" into Law|newspaper=Daily Observer|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows both the media and individual citizens to demand information from any public authority or any private authority that carries out government functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010111890.html|title=Liberian President Signs Freedom of Information Act Into Law|newspaper=allAfrica.com|date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=February 2017}}

{{Main|Access to public information in the Republic of Macedonia}}

Article 16 of the Constitution of Macedonia guarantees "access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information".

The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006. It is scheduled to go into force in September 2006.The law allows any natural or legal person to obtain information from state and municipal bodies and natural and legal persons who are performing public functions. The requests can be oral, written or electronic. Requests must be responded to in 10 days.

===Malaysia===
The state of [[Selangor]] passed the Freedom of Information Enactment (Selangor) 2010 on 1 April 2011, allowing the Malaysian public an access to the state documents including that of local councils, city halls and state government-linked companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-passes-freedom-of-information-enactment/|title=Selangor passes Freedom of Information Enactment|accessdate=1 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404002324/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-passes-freedom-of-information-enactment/|archivedate=4 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the state of [[Penang]] passed the Freedom of Information bill on 4 November 2011, allowing the public to access to state documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/11/4/nation/20111104200415&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106202826/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F11%2F4%2Fnation%2F20111104200415&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 November 2011|title=Penang passes Freedom of Information Bill|accessdate=5 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states are under the ruling of the federal opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]].

===Mexico===
The Constitution was amended in 1977 to include a right of freedom of information. Article 6 says in part, "the right of information shall be guaranteed by the state." The Supreme Court made a number of decisions further enhancing that right.

The Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information was unanimously approved by Congress in April 2002 and signed by President Fox in June 2002. It went into effect in June 2003.

===Montenegro===
{{main|Access to public information in Montenegro}}
A freedom of information law was passed in Montenegro late in 2005, after a process of several years.

===Netherlands===
Article 110 of the Constitution states: "In the exercise of their duties government bodies shall observe the principle of transparency in accordance with the rules to be prescribed by Act of Parliament."

The Dutch act on public access to government information entered into force in 1980 and is updated several times later. Under the act known as the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur|nl|3=Openbaarheid van bestuur#Nederland}}'', or ''Wob'' for short, any person can demand information (called ''wobbing'') related to an administrative matter if it is contained in documents held by public authorities or companies carrying out work for a public authority. The request can either be written or oral. The authority has two (on environmental issues) or four weeks to respond. The act also obliges the government to provide information ''unsolicited'' as it is in the interest of good and democratic governance.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the relevant legislation is the [[Official Information Act 1982]]. This implemented a general policy of openness regarding official documents and replaced the Official Secrets Act.

===Nigeria===
Former President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] signed into law the Freedom of Information (FoI) Bill, awaited for 12 years by media proprietors and practitioners alike, during which the Villa got knocks for filibustering and lawmakers complained of bombardment by campaigners.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on February 24, 2011 and the Senate dialled up integrity on March 16 as it delivered on promise to pass it.

The harmonised version was passed by both Chambers on May 26, 2011.It was conveyed to Jonathan on May 27, and he signed it on '''May 28, 2011''', according to a statement Aso Rock issued on Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://independentngonline.com/DailyIndependent/Article.aspx?id=34777|title=Jonathan signs FoI Bill|newspaper=Daily Independence|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two states in Nigeria (namely Ekiti and Lagos State) have adopted the Freedom of Information Act at State level but they have extended the response date at State level from 7 days to 14 days. More states are expected to adopt the bill and come up with their own version.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Freedom of Information Act in Pakistan}}
President [[Pervez Musharraf]] promulgated the Freedom of Information Ordinance 2002 in October 2002.&lt;ref name=foi2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Information Ordinance promulgated|url=http://www.transparency.org.pk/documents/FIO.pdf|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows any citizen access to public records held by a public body of the federal government including ministries, departments, boards, councils, courts and tribunals. It does not apply to government owned corporations or provincial governments. The bodies must respond within 21 days.

More recently, by virtue of the 18th Amendment of 2010, article 19A has been inserted in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=constit20&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of Pakistan|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the right to access to information the status of a fundamental constitutional right. Article 19A "Right to Information" reads: "Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law".

===Paraguay===
The National Constitution of [[Paraguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Paraguay_2011.pdf|title = Constitution of Paraguay|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted in 1992, guarantees the right to be informed and to receive true, responsible, and equitable information (Art. 28). The same article states that public sources of information are free, and that a law will regulate the modalities, time periods, and sanctions “in order to make this right effective”.  In practice, this last provision delayed the recognition of the right due to the absence of a law making it “effective”. Congress, government agencies and Courts were reluctant to enforce the right to access public sources of information until 2013. A Supreme Court judgment (No. 1306 of 15 October 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pj.gov.py/descargas/AYS-1306.pdf|title = Acción de Inconstitucionalidad en el juicio "Defensoria del Pueblo c/ Municipalidad de San Lorenzo".|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the beginning of what has been called a “Transparency Spring&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ultimahora.com/la-primavera-la-transparencia-n934443.html|title = La Primavera Transparente|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The ruling from the Supreme Court was made in the context of an [[Recurso de amparo|Amparo]] filed by a citizen called Jose Daniel Vargas Tellez, after the San Lorenzo Municipality denied him access to the information about the names, the job descriptions and the wages of all the employees that were working in that public office.  The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals rejected the Amparo on the grounds that information of that type was considered sensitive by the Data Protection and Privacy Act (Law 1682/02 and 1969/02). The latter rulings were challenged on constitutional grounds and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Vargas Tellez holding that while this information relating to the identity and wages of public employees and officers constitutes personal propriety data, it is nonetheless registered in a “public source of information”, which makes it available to any citizen who requests it. The right to access to these informations is recognised under the Constitution and international instruments such as the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Art. 13); The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Art. 19); and the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (Art. 13).

Following the Supreme Court's decision, and with the support of the civil society and President [[Horacio Cartes]], the first Transparency law was enacted (Law No. 5189/14) requiring all public offices to disclose information regarding the use of public funds to pay salaries. In addition, The Freedom of Information and Government Transparency Law (Law 5282/2014) was enacted in 2014 and a final regulation of 2015 (Executive Decree 4064/15) set the final step in the road to Transparency. These rules expressly recognize that the right to access public information is a human right, which improves the State, promotes citizen participation and public accountability, and serves as a tool to combat corruption. Currently, all requests to access public information can be done [http://informacionpublica.paraguay.gov.py/portal/#!/buscar_informacion#busqueda online] through a single portal, and government offices are obliged to respond within 15 days.

Paraguay became internationally committed to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance after becoming a member of the [[Open Government Partnership]]. Presently, most government offices have [http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/1298-acceso-a-la-informacion-publica-y-transparencia-gubernamental/1298 Transparency offices] and can provide information to citizens and receive reports of corruption.

'''Rectification, Clarification and Destruction of False or Distorted information:'''

Art 28 of the Constitution also states that any person affected by the diffusion of a false, distorted, or ambiguous information has the right to demand its rectification or its clarification by the same means and under the same conditions in which it was divulged, without prejudice to the other compensatory rights. There is also a specific law that regulates [[Habeas data|Habeas Data]], and any citizen can request a copy of publicly or privately held information relating to him, and can demand that any inaccurate data found be destroyed.

===South Africa===
{{main|Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000}}
Section 32 of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] guarantees "the right of access to any information held by the state; and any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights." This right is implemented through the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which was enacted on 2 February 2000. The right of access to ''privately'' held information is an interesting feature, as most freedom of information laws only cover governmental bodies.

===South Korea===
The Constitutional Court ruled in 1989 that there is a constitutional right to information "as an aspect of the right of freedom of expression and specific implementing legislation to define the contours of the right was not a prerequisite to its enforcement."

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka's [http://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/6007.pdf Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 ] was certified on 4 August 2016. After much debate and many amendments to the draft Bill, the final Act comprising 44 Sections was certified in early August 2016. The implementation of the Act is expected to take time due to the necessity of establishing cadre positions in government institutions to provide information to the general public. The Act is considered to hold many strengths and positive features that would effectively authorize citizens to be actively involved in the process of governance. Moreover, Article 14A(1) introduced by virtue of  [http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/19th_Amendment_E.pdf 19th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka] has paved the way for the recognition of right to information as a fundamental right.

===Sweden===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Zenon Panoussis]] --&gt;
In [[Sweden]], the [[Freedom of the Press Act]] grants public access to official documents and is included in the [[Constitution of Sweden#Principle of Public Access|Constitution of Sweden]]. Dating back to 1766, it is the first freedom of information legislation in the modern sense. In modern times the right has become known as the Principle of Public Access ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''offentlighetsprincipen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.se/how-sweden-is-governed/the-principle-of-public-access-to-official-documents/|title=The Principle of Public Access to Official Documents|publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the [[Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act]]. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the [[Riksdag]].

===Switzerland===
Switzerland is a federal state. Access to federal documents is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on the Principle of Freedom of Information in Public Administration, and supervised by the [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20022540/index.html Federal Act on Freedom of Information in the Administration of 17 December 2004 (status as of 19 August 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 19 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Access to documents at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal level]] is governed by cantonal laws, which are mostly similar to the federal law.

The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] (2000 c. 36) is the implementation of freedom of information legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] on a national level, with the exception of Scottish bodies, which are covered by the [[Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002]] (2002 asp. 13). Environmental information is covered by further legislation [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]. [[Tony Blair]], the UK Prime Minister who introduced the Freedom of Information Act, later expressed regret over the Act, claiming that the Act impeded the ability of officials to deliberate "with a reasonable level of confidentiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/2010/09/why_tony_blair_thinks_he_was_a.html|title=Why Tony Blair thinks he was an idiot|last=Rosenbaum|first=Martin|date=1 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B.

[[Ralph Nader]] has been credited with the impetus for creating this act, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Henriette Mantel, Steve Skrovan (directors)|year=2006|title=An Unreasonable Man|medium=motion picture |url=http://anunreasonableman.com/|publisher=Genius Entertainment|isbn=9781594445965|oclc=138363823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments were signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on October 2, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oct. 2, 1996: FOIA Law Ushers in Digital Democracy|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/10/1002electronic-foia/|website=wired.com|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act applies only to [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]]. However, all of the states, as well as the District of Columbia and some territories, have enacted similar statutes to require disclosures by agencies of the state and of local governments, though some are significantly broader than others. Some state and local government agencies attempt to get around state open records laws by claiming copyright for their works and then demanding high fees to license the public information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Barbara A.|title=Copyright and State Government: An Analysis of Section 119.083, Florida's Software Copyright Provision|journal=Florida State University Law Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=441–486|year=1992|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flsulr20&amp;div=22&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441–42}} Some states expand government transparency through [[Freedom of information in the United States|open meeting laws]], which require government meetings to be announced in advance and held publicly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3670">'''French labour law''' is the system of [[labour law]] operating in [[France]].

==History==
During the French Revolution, the ''[[Le Chapelier Law 1791]]'' was passed to prohibit unions or guilds and strikes in particular, with a proclamation of "free enterprise". On 25 May 1864, the ''[[loi Ollivier]]'' was passed to reverse the prohibitions on strike action.

The prohibitions on forming trade unions were  lifted by [[Waldeck Rousseau]]'s laws passed on 21 March 1884.

Between 1936 and 1938 the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid [[Annual leave|vacation]] for workers, and the [[Matignon Accords (1936)]]. This established the right to organise a union, to bargain collectively, a legal [[right to strike]], and was followed by enactments which limited the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime, and guaranteed paid holidays.

The [[Grenelle agreements]] negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 crisis]], reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:section syndicale d'entreprise|fr:section syndicale d'entreprise]]'' December 27, 1968 law&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum wage was also increased by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti|fr:SMIG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 [[Lionel Jospin]]'s government then enacted the [[35-hour workweek]], down from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] enacted the [[New Employment Contract]] (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more [[Labour market flexibility|flexibility]] in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it was lending favour to [[contingent work]]. In 2006 he then attempted to pass the [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that it was met by [[2006 labour protests in France|students and unions' protests]]. President [[Jacques Chirac]] finally had no choice but to repeal it.&lt;ref&gt;Alain-Christian Monkam, "French Employment Law", Village de la Justice, 2011, http://www.village-justice.com/articles/French-Employment,10968.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[right to disconnect]]" law came into force in January 2017, which means that companies with more than 50 workers will be obliged to draw up a charter of good conduct. This charter sets out the hours in which staff are not supposed to send or answer emails. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38479439 |title=French workers get 'right to disconnect' from emails out of hours |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of international law''' examines the evolution and development of public international law in both state practice and conceptual understanding. Modern international law developed out of Renaissance Europe and is strongly entwined with the development of western political organisation at that time. The development of European notions of sovereignty and nation states would necessitate the development of methods for interstate relations and standards of behaviour, and these would lay the foundations of what would become international law. However, while the origins of the modern system of international law can be traced back 400 years, the development of the concepts and practises that would underpin that system can be traced back to ancient historical politics and relationships thousands of years old. Important concepts are derived from the practice between Greek [[city-states]] and the [[Roman law]] concept of [[ius gentium]] (which regulated contacts between Roman citizens and non-Roman people).  These principles were not universal however.  In East Asia, political theory was based not on the equality of states, but rather the cosmological supremacy of the [[Emperor of China]].

== Early history ==
Basic concepts of international law such as [[treaties]] can be traced back thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bederman|first=David J.|title=International law in antiquity|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-79197-9|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of treaties include around 2100BC an agreement between the rulers of the [[city-states]] of Lagash and Umma in [[Mesopotamia]], inscribed on a stone block, setting a prescribed boundary between their two states.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite book | title=A concise history of the law of nations | author=Nussbaum, Arthur | year=1954 | pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1000BC, an agreement was signed between Ramses II of Egypt and the king of the Hittites establishing "eternal peace and brotherhood" between their two nations: dealing with respect for each other’s territory and establishing a form of defensive alliance.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt;
The [[ancient Greeks]] before [[Alexander the Great]] formed many small states that constantly interacted.  In peace and in war, an inter-state culture evolved that prescribed certain rules for how these states would interact.  These rules did not apply to interactions with non-Greek states, but among themselves the Greek inter-state community resembled in some respects the modern international community.

The [[Roman Empire]] did not develop an international law, as it acted without regard to any external rules in its dealings with those territories that were not already part of the empire.  The Romans did, however, form municipal laws governing the interactions between private Roman citizens and foreigners.  These laws, called the ''jus gentium'' (as opposed to the ''jus civile'' governing interactions between citizens) codified some ideas of basic fairness, and attributed some rules to an objective, independent "[[natural law]]."  These ''jus gentium'' ideas of fairness and natural law have survived and are reflected in modern international law.

== Nation-states ==
After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] and the [[collapse of the Holy Roman Empire]] into independent cities, principalities, kingdoms and nations, for the first time there was a real need for rules of conduct between a large international community.  Without an empire or a dominant religious leadership to moderate and direct international dealings, most of Europe looked to [[Justinian's code of law]] from the Roman Empire, and the [[canon law of the Catholic Church]] for inspiration.

International trade was the real catalyst for the development of objective rules of behaviour between states.  Without a code of conduct, there was little to guarantee trade or protect the merchants of one state from the actions of another.  Economic self-interest drove the evolution of common international trade rules, and most importantly the rules and customs of [[maritime law]].

As international trade, exploration and warfare became more involved and complex, the need for common international customs and practices became even more important.  The [[Hanseatic League]] of the more than 150 entities in what is now Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states developed many useful international customs, which facilitated trade and communication among other things.  The Italian city-states developed diplomatic rules, as they began sending ambassadors to foreign capitals.  Treaties—agreements between governments intended to be binding—became a useful tool to protect commerce.  The horrors of the [[Thirty Years' War]], meanwhile, created an outcry for rules of combat that would protect civilian communities.

== Hugo Grotius ==
{{main|Hugo Grotius}}
International practices, customs, rules and treaties proliferated to the point of complexity.  Several scholars sought to compile them all into organized treatises.  The most important of these was [[Hugo Grotius]], whose treatise ''[[De Jure Belli Ac Pacis Libri Tres]]'' is considered the starting point for modern international law. Before [[Hugo Grotius]], most European thinkers treated law as something independent of mankind, with its own existence.  Some laws were invented by men, but ultimately they reflected the essential natural law.  Grotius was no different, except in one important respect:  Unlike the earlier thinkers, who believed that the natural law was imposed by a deity, Grotius believed that the natural law came from an essential universal reason, common to all men.

This [[rationalist]] perspective enabled Grotius to posit several rational principles underlying law.  Law was not imposed from above, but rather derived from principles.  Foundation principles included the axioms that promises must be kept, and that harming another requires restitution.  These two principles have served as the basis for much of subsequent international law.  Apart from natural-law principles, Grotius also dealt with international custom, or voluntary law.  Grotius emphasized the importance of actual practices, customs and treaties—what "is" done—as opposed to normative rules of what "ought to be" done. This [[positivist]] approach to international law strengthened over time.  As nations became the predominant form of state in Europe, and their man-made laws became more important than religious doctrines and philosophies, the law of what "is" similarly became more important than the law of what "ought to be."

== Treaty of Westphalia ==
{{main|Treaty of Westphalia}}
The Westphalian treaties of 1648 were a turning point in establishing the principle of [[state sovereignty]] as a cornerstone of the international order.  However the first attempts at formulating autonomous theories of international law occurred before this, in Spain, in the 16th century.  Most prominent among the early theorizers were the Roman Catholic theologians [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Francisco Suárez]]. Suárez is especially notable in this regard in that he distinguished between [[ius inter gentes]] and [[ius intra gentes]] which he derived from ius gentium (the rights of peoples).  Ius inter gentes corresponds to modern international law. In 1625, [[Hugo Grotius]] followed with the first systematic treatise on international law, ''[[de iure belli ac pacis]]'', which dealt with the laws of war and peace. One important aspect of Grotius's treatment of international law is that he no longer bases it exclusively upon [[natural law]], but also accepts that states among themselves can also create binding rules of law (ius voluntarium).

Still, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the idea of natural law as a basis for international law remained influential, and were further expressed in the works of [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Yet, in the second half of the 18th century, a shift occurs towards positivism in international law.  In addition, the idea of international law as a means for maintaining international peace is challenged due to the increasing tensions between the European great powers (France, [[Prussia]], [[Great-Britain]], Russia and [[Austria]]).  This tension between legal norms and political imperatives is well reflected in the century's most important treatise on international law, [[Emer de Vattel]]'s ''[[Du Droit des Gens]]'' (1758).  At the end of the century, [[Immanuel Kant]] believes that international law as a law that can justify war does not serve the purpose of peace anymore, and therefore argues in ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]'' (''Zum Ewigen Frieden'', 1795) and the ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (''Metaphysik der Sitten'', 1797) for creating a new kind of international law.

After World War I, an attempt was made to establish such a new international law of peace, of which the [[League of Nations]] was considered to be one of the cornerstones, but this attempt failed.  The [[Charter of the United Nations]] (1945) in fact reflects the fact that the traditional notion of state sovereignty remains the key concept in the law of nations.

In the historiography of international law, some German authors, most notably among them [[Wilhelm Grewe]] and Karl-Heinz Ziegler, have argued that several periods can be distinguished, such as the Spanish era (1494–1648), the French era (1648-1789/1815), the English era (1789/1815-1919) and the American era since 1919.  The transitions between these eras are often marked by grand peace settlements, such as the earlier mentioned treaties of Westphalia (1645–48), the treaties of [[Ryswick]] and [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] (1697/1714), [[Vienna]] (1814–15), Paris (1919) and San Francisco (the UN Charter, 1945).

== The League of Nations ==
{{main|League of Nations}}
Following World War I, as after the Thirty Years' War, there was an outcry for rules of warfare to protect civilian populations, as well as a desire to curb invasions.  The [[League of Nations]], established after the war, attempted to curb invasions by enacting a treaty agreement providing for economic and military sanctions against member states that used "external aggression" to invade or conquer other member states.  An international court was established, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], to arbitrate disputes between nations without resorting to war.  Meanwhile, many nations signed treaties agreeing to use international arbitration rather than warfare to settle differences.  International crises, however, demonstrated that nations were not yet committed to the idea of giving external authorities a say in how nations conducted their affairs.  Aggression on the part of Germany, Italy and Japan went unchecked by international law, and it took a Second World War to end it.

== The postwar era ==
After World War II, as after the First World War and the Thirty Years' War, there was a strong desire to never again endure the horrors of war endured by the civilian populations. The League of Nations was re-attempted through another treaty organization, the [[United Nations]].

The postwar era has been a highly successful one for international law.  International cooperation has become far more commonplace, though of course not universal.  Importantly, nearly two hundred nations are now members of the United Nations, and have voluntarily bound themselves to its charter.  Even the most powerful nations have recognized the need for international cooperation and supports, and have routinely sought international agreement and consent before engaging in acts of war.

International law is, of course, only partly about the conduct of war.  Most rules are civil, concerning the delivery of mail, trade, shipping, air travel, and the like.  Most rules are obeyed routinely by most countries, because the rules make life easier for all concerned.  The rules are rarely disputed.  But some international law is extremely political and hotly debated.  This includes not just the laws of warfare but also such matters as fishing rights.

== Modern customary international law ==
An important development in modern international law is the concept of "consent."  Before World War II, a nation would not have been considered to be bound by a rule unless it had formally agreed to be bound by it, or it was already customarily abiding by that rule.  Now, however, merely consenting to an international practice is sufficient to be bound by it, without signing a treaty.

An evolution of the positivist approach of Grotius, the concept of consent is an element of customary international law.  Customary international law is essentially what states actually do, plus the ''opinio juris'' of what states believe international law requires them to do.

Customary international law applies to every country, regardless of whether they have formally agreed to it.  At the same time, all countries take part in forming customary international law by their practices and decisions.  As new rules arise, countries accept, reject or modify them.  When most countries are following a rule, everyone else will be held to it.  Therefore, doing nothing is the same as consenting.  Nations that did not take action may find themselves bound by an international law that is not to their advantage.

Customary international law can be overruled, however, by a treaty.  For this reason, much customary international law has been agreed to formally by treaties between nations.

==Modern treaty law==
Treaties are essentially contracts between countries.  They are agreements by which the parties intend to be bound.  If treaties are broken, their effectiveness is weakened because there is no guarantee that future promises will be kept.  So there is a strong incentive for nations to take treaties very seriously.

Modern nations engage in a two-step procedure for entering into treaties.  The first step is signing the treaty.  Being a signatory to a treaty means that a country intends to enter into the agreement.  The second step is ratifying the treaty.  A country that has ratified a treaty has gone beyond merely intending to enter into the agreement, and is now bound by it.  This is a critical distinction, and sometimes a point of confusion.  A nation may be a signatory to a treaty for many years without ever having ratified it.

Each country ratifies treaties its own way.  The United States requires the two-thirds support of the Senate, the upper body of its legislature, for a treaty to be ratified; both the executive and the legislature must agree.  In Canada, on the other hand, ratification is strictly an executive action, and no parliamentary approval is required before the nation is bound.

Modern treaties are interpreted according to the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]].  This convention is so widely accepted that even nations that are not parties to the convention follow it.  The convention's most important and sensible rule is that a treaty should be interpreted according to the plain meaning of its language, in the context of its purpose, and in good faith.  This prevents much squabbling and unnecessary nit-picking.  It also makes treaty authors spell out what they are trying to accomplish, to make interpretation easier, in a non-binding "preamble."

In the modern world, international law is contested for its inability to enforce its rulings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13970">'''Intellectual rights to magic methods''' refers to the legal and ethical debate about the extent to which [[Property|proprietary]] or [[exclusive right]]s may subsist in the methods or processes by which [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks or illusions are performed. It is a subject of some controversy. 

On one side, many magicians argue that methods represent "[[intellectual property]]" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as "[[Exposure (magic)|exposure]]" and many magicians react angrily to it. 

While many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all "[[Exposure (magic)|exposure]]", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works – works with living and identifiable creators.

==Possible legal protection==
There are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. [[Copyright]], [[patent]], [[trade secret]] and [[trademark]] law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. 

===Copyright===
Under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., [[United States Copyright Law|copyright law]] only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves.

The [[idea–expression dichotomy]] specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.

Another potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose &amp; Her Shadow.&lt;ref name="tellercase"/&gt;

Magic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] against America Online to remove a video from their website.

=== Patents ===
An [[invention]] or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially [[patentability|patentable]] in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works.

Notably, in 1938, [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] was sued by magician [[Horace Goldin]] over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]'' trick.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (D.N.Y. 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web

===Trade secret and contract law===
Magic methods are effectively forms of [[trade secret]] and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of "[[confidentiality]]" and "[[contract law]]" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information – i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright.

A company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates.  A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. 

Information which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the [[public domain]] may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of [[Trade secret#Legal development to protecting trade secrets|confidentiality]]. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available.

==Court cases==
{{globalize/US|section|date=November 2017}}
Court cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of [[case law]]. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include:

* '''1920s–1930s:'''  [[Horace Goldin]] was involved in many legal actions related to the ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]'' illusion, including a successful unfair competition claim in 1922 against the makers of a film that exposed the method,&lt;ref&gt;''Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays'', New York (Dec 1922), referenced in [https://web.archive.org/web/20151104073050/http://www.jstor.org/stable/789035 |The Yale Law Journal], Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201, and also in [http://www.cap-press.com/pdf/1605.pdf ''Advanced Torts: Cases and materials''], (Law Casebook Series), Carolina Academic Press, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and an unsuccessful unfair competition claim in 1938 against the [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] for exposing the secret in an advertisement for cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 22 F. Supp. 61 (SDNY 1938).&lt;/ref&gt; The latter case was dismissed because Goldin's 1923 patent on the illusion revealed its mechanism to the public.
* '''1943:''' Charles "Think-a-Drink" Hoffman sued Maurice Glazer for violation of his copyright and trademark rights in his "Think-a-Drink" act. The Supreme Court of Florida upheld the trademark decision for Hoffman, but held that Hoffman's act was not "dramatic" enough to qualify for Copyright Protection under the 1909 definition.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer v. Hoffman, 153 Fla. 809 (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1947:''' The Harold Lloyd Corporation sued Universal Pictures Company for copyright violation of its film "Movie Crazy." In the infringed scenes, the protagonist accidentally puts on a magician's coat and he is plagued by a series of bewildering magic effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10760655899099210600&amp;q=162+f.2d+354&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002 Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corporation, 162 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1947)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1998:''' Joseph Harrison and a number of other magicians filed an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit against SF broadcasting and Fox Broadcasting for exposing the secrets to a number of illusions on their [[Masked Magician]] special.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison v. SF Broadcasting. No. Civ. A. 98–1107. 1998 WL 355462 (E.D. La. Jun. 30, 1998). Chief Judge Sear stated, "I recognize that Plaintiffs' Petition seeks to redress the betrayal of the honor code among magicians, but such redress is not available here because no legal rights have been violated." &lt;/ref&gt; They sought relief for violation of the magicians' honor code under Louisiana's abuse of rights doctrine, but were denied because the doctrine only applies to contracts and property.
* '''1998:''' [[André Kole]] tried to sue the makers of the ''[[Masked Magician]]'' television specials to prevent exposure of the ''[[Table of Death]]'' trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Codes of practice==
The most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of [[ethics]] or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]], has a [[Ethical code|Code of Ethics]] which states:
:''All members of the International Brotherhood of Magicians agree to oppose the willful exposure to the public of any principles of the Art of Magic, or the methods employed in any magic effect or illusion.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.magician.org/CodeOfEthics.htm 
 |title=The International Brotherhood of Magicians (anti-exposure) code of ethics 
 |accessdate=2007-03-12 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310230344/http://www.magician.org/CodeOfEthics.htm 
 |archivedate=2007-03-10 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that "exposing" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians.

However, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider{{Who|date=January 2010}} the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1008">The '''Interconfessional laws''' were a series of 19th century laws in [[Austria]] which were meant to install a government based on [[Separation of Church and State]] and voted on 25 May, 1868. 

==Opposition==
Bishop [[Franz-Josef Rudigier|Rudigier]] of Linz became known for his memorable struggle against these laws, which were not only hostile to the Church, but to the marriage and school laws. The opposition to these ordinances led to judicial proceedings against the bishop and to a fine, which was, however, at once remitted by the Emperor. 

==Confiscated land==
This defense of the rights of the Church with regard to the Christian schools had another negative result.  In 1869 the Liberal parliamentary majority confiscated the lands forming the endowment of the [[diocese of Linz]], and withheld them until the downfall of Liberalism in 1883.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">The '''International Association of Prosecutors''' (IAP) is the only global [[NGO|non-governmental organisation]] of [[prosecutor]]s, established by the [[United Nations]] in 1995, [[Vienna]].

Organisation includes about 200,000 [[group (sociology)|members]] from over 120 [[Sovereign state|states]].

It was established due to rapid growth in transnational [[crime]] like [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]] and [[fraud]].
From its website, "The IAP is the only worldwide organization of prosecutors.  It was established in 1995 and now has more than 145 organizational members from over 96 different jurisdictions, representing every continent, as well as many individual members.

The website sets out the objects of the IAP.  All organizational members of the IAP are expected to commit to the Standards of Professional Responsibility and Statement of the Essential Duties and Rights of Prosecutors adopted by the IAP in 1999. In April 2013 a complaint was lodged against an Executive Committee member, Dr. Ali bin Fadhel Al- Buainain who as head of the Office of Public Prosecution in Bahrain has acted contrary to these standards by prosecuting Bahraini nationals for activities protected by the rights to freedom expression and assembly and for failing to adhere to fair procedures and due process standards, as asserted by Ceartas Irish lawyers for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceartaslaw.org/blog/entry/bahrain-repression-and-the-attorney-general.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120040956/http://www.ceartaslaw.org/blog/entry/bahrain-repression-and-the-attorney-general.html |archivedate=2013-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22nd 2013, IAP President James Hamilton acknowledged receipt of the complaint and stated that it is “something we’re going to look very carefully at”, and the outcome “will certainly set a precedent for how we deal with a complaint”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/international-prosecutors-group-to-meet-over-bahraini-membership-1.1366086&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Dr. Ali bin Fadhel Al- Buainain has sought to be re-elected to the IAP Executive Committee at the 18th Annual General Meeting of the IAP on September 11, 2013, and it has been reported by the Bahrain State News Agency that he has already been re-elected to it for another three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/567856&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership brings many advantages and opportunities, including the chance to attend the annual conference.  As well as providing lively and interesting discussion on questions which are of practical concern to prosecutors, the annual conferences provide excellent opportunities for networking and getting to know colleagues from other countries.  Annual conferences takes place in different venues each year.

Regional conferences in Africa, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe/Central Asia, North America and the Caribbean and the Asia-Pacific region are now regular events in the IAP, and are mainly aimed at front line prosecutors. Information concerning these and other events can be found on the website.

The Association also produces regular newsletters which are distributed to members.  In addition a considerable amount of information on the website is available only to members including a members forum where members can exchange information and experiences.  A Global Prosecutors E-Crime Network is accessible through the website and contains much information of interest to prosecutors concerning cyber crime. Similarly the ‘Forum for International Criminal Justice’ is also accessible via the website for those seeking information and contacts in that area."

'''Iran Venezuela Bi-National Bank''' ({{lang-fa|بانک مشترک ایران و ونزوئلا}}, {{lang-es|Banco Binacional Irán-Venezuela}}) is an [[international financial institution]] that was founded in 2010 with an aim to develop commercial ties between [[Iran]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Norman A.|date=February 2012|title=Iran's Venezuelan Gateway|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/HHRG1122.pdf|journal=Iran Strategy Brief|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It started as a [[joint venture]] between two state-owned banks, [[Banco Industrial de Venezuela]] and [[Export Development Bank of Iran]] with a starting capital of $200 million offered equally by both parties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/65918/5-foreign-banks-licensed-by-iran|title=5 Foreign Banks Licensed by Iran|date=2017-06-06|work=Financial Tribune|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] imposed sanction on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-oil-sanctions/u-s-blacklists-firms-for-evading-iran-oil-sale-sanctions-idUSBRE94814Q20130509|title=U.S. blacklists firms for evading Iran oil sale sanctions|last=Gardner|first=Timothy|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, an official in the [[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] told press that "[the] bank is not given much freedom" and it is being managed one-sidedly by Iran, because the Venezuelan side does not participate in the general assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.trend.az/iran/business/2427169.html|title=Joint Iran-Venezuela bank not much of a bank: Iran|date=2015-08-25|work=Trend.Az|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the Iranian side was willing to sell its share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/53228/iran-to-sell-shares-in-joint-bank-with-venezuela|title=Iran to Sell Shares in Joint Bank With Venezuela|date=2016-11-08|work=Financial Tribune|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3577">'''Judicial restraint''' is a theory of [[judicial interpretation]] that encourages [[judge]]s to limit the exercise of their own power.

In deciding questions of [[constitutional law]], judicially restrained jurists go to great lengths to defer to the legislature. Judicially restrained judges respect [[stare decisis]], the principle of upholding established precedent handed down by past judges.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961645-6,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2017}}{{better source|date=December 2017}}

==Leading voices in judicial restraint==
Former Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], considered to be one of the first major advocates of the philosophy, would describe the importance of judicial restraint in many of his books.&lt;ref&gt;http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25262-oliver-wendell-holmes-jr-legal-theory-and-judicial-restraint/&lt;/ref&gt; One noted academic described Associate Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]], a Democrat appointed by [[Franklin Roosevelt]], as the "model of judicial restraint".&lt;ref&gt;''A Justice for All'', by Kim Isaac Eisler, page 11; {{ISBN|0-671-76787-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the conservative [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] Court overturned some of the precedents of the more liberal Warren Court, ''Time'' magazine said he was not following the theory of judicial restraint.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;  However, Rehnquist was also acknowledged as a more conservative advocate of the philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2005-09-03/justice/rehnquist.legacy_1_william-hubbs-rehnquist-judicial-legacy-supreme-court?_s=PM:LAW {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120224830/http://articles.cnn.com/2005-09-03/justice/rehnquist.legacy_1_william-hubbs-rehnquist-judicial-legacy-supreme-court?_s=PM%3ALAW |date=2012-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimalism doctrine==
[[Minimalism (judicial)|Judicial minimalists]] argue that judges should put great emphasis on adherence to ''[[stare decisis]]'' and [[precedent]].  Minimalists argue that judges should make only minor, incremental changes to constitutional law to maintain that stability.  They ask judges to do this by creating small, case-specific rulings rather than broad, sweeping rulings.

==Political question doctrine==
The [[political question]] doctrine encourages courts to decline to rule in certain categories of politically controversial cases.  Under this theory, a court acknowledges that the Constitution might have been violated but declines to act.  It is often described as a type of judicial restraint, although it can be considered a form of judicial activism against plaintiffs whose rights have been violated and find their cases dismissed.

The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of [[creationism]], and that the school board policy violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The judge's decision sparked considerable response from both supporters and critics.

Eleven parents of students in [[Dover, Pennsylvania|Dover]], [[York County, Pennsylvania]], near the city of [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], sued the Dover Area School District over the school board requirement that a statement presenting intelligent design as "an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view" was to be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when evolution was taught.&lt;ref&gt;Following the change in curriculum, the school board had a nine sentence (four-paragraph) statement prepared. In its final form it asserted that Darwin's "Theory is not a fact" and said that "Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view.

== Outcomes ==

=== Legal ===
On December 20, 2005, Jones issued his 139-page [[Question of fact|findings of fact]] and decision ruling that the Dover mandate requiring the statement to be read in class was unconstitutional. The ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science, and permanently barred the board from "maintaining the ID Policy in any school within the Dover Area School District, from requiring teachers to denigrate or disparage the scientific theory of evolution, and from requiring teachers to refer to a religious, alternative theory known as ID."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.]], [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|H. Conclusion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local school board ===
All eight of the Dover school board members who were up for re-election on November 8, 2005, were defeated by a set of challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class. (The ninth member was not up for re-election.) The new school board president subsequently stated that the board did not intend to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090621131533/http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=5945 Judge Rules Against 'Intelligent Design'], Michael Powell, [[The Washington Post]], December 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Intelligent Design}}

From 2002, William (Bill) Buckingham and Alan Bonsell, members of the [[Dover Area School District]] [[Board of Education]] who were [[Young Earth creationism|young earth creationists]], had made various statements supporting teaching [[creationism]] alongside [[evolution]]. At a board meeting on June 7, 2004, Buckingham mentioned creationism and raised objections to the proposed use of the textbook ''Biology'' written by [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and Joseph S. Levine, describing it as "laced with Darwinism" and saying it was "inexcusable to have a book that says man descended from apes with nothing to counterbalance it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania |date=December 20, 2005 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/5:Promoting_Religion#Page_103_of_139 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story made the York newspapers, and Buckingham was telephoned by [[Discovery Institute]] staff attorney Seth Cooper, whose tasks included "communicating with legislators, school board members, teachers, parents and students" to "address the topic of ID in a scientifically and educationally responsible way" in public schools. He later stated that he made the call to "steer the Dover Board away from trying to include intelligent design in the classroom or from trying to insert creationism into its {{sic|cirriculum}}", an account Buckingham has disputed. Cooper sent the book and DVD of ''[[Icons of Evolution]]'' to Buckingham, who required the Dover High School science teachers to watch the DVD. They did not take up the opportunity to use it in their classes.

Cooper advised that the Discovery Institute was not offering legal advice, and soon afterwards Buckingham contacted Richard Thompson of the [[Thomas More Law Center]], who agreed to represent the Dover Board, and recommended the book ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''.&lt;ref name=DID/&gt; On October 18, 2004, the school board voted 6–3 resolving that there were to be lectures on the subject, with ''Pandas'' as a reference book, and that the following statement was to be added to their [[biology]] curriculum: "Students will be made aware of the gaps/problems in Darwin's theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to, intelligent design. Note: Origins of life is not taught."&lt;ref name="board resolution n" /&gt;

On November 19, 2004, the Dover Area School District issued a press release stating that, commencing in January 2005, teachers would be required to read the following statement to students in the ninth-grade biology class at Dover High School:

{{quote|The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin's theory of evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part.

Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it is still being tested as new evidence is discovered. The Theory is not a fact. Gaps in the Theory exist for which there is no evidence. A theory is defined as a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations.

Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view. The reference book ''Of Pandas and People'', is available for students to see if they would like to explore this view in an effort to gain an understanding of what intelligent design actually involves.

As is true with any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind. The school leaves the discussion of the origins of life to individual students and their families. As a standards-driven district, class instruction focuses upon preparing students to achieve proficiency on standards-based assessments.|[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/1:Introduction#Page 1 of 139|(page 1 of decision)]]}}

The three school board members who voted against it resigned in protest, and science teachers in the district refused to read the statement to their ninth-grade students, citing the Pennsylvania state code 235.10(2), which requires that "The professional educator may not ... Knowingly and intentionally misrepresent subject matter or curriculum." Instead, the statement was read to students by a school administrator.

The school board's statement asserting that there are "gaps" in evolution and that it specifically is a theory "not a fact" singled out evolution, implying it is just a hunch, even though this is not the actual meaning of the term "[[scientific theory]]". The reference to ''Of Pandas and People'' and presentation of intelligent design as an alternative "explanation of the [[origins of life]]" presented it as though it were a scientific explanation, in contrast to the way that evolution was described. Encouraging students to "keep an open mind" about alternatives without offering an alternative scientific explanation implied an invitation to meditate on a religious view, endorsing the religious view in a way similar to the disclaimer found to be unconstitutional in the ''[[Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education]]'' case. The school board claimed the statement does not teach intelligent design and simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution, but no such statements were made about other subjects. As part of the presentation, the administrators stated that "there will be no other discussion of the issue and your teachers will not answer questions on the issue", giving intelligent design a position not applied to scientific topics.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/3:Disclaimer#Page 43 of 139|pp. 43–46]], Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Memorandum Opinion, December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The board denied that intelligent design was "religion in disguise," despite being represented in court by the [[Thomas More Law Center]], a conservative Christian not-for-profit law center that uses litigation to promote "the religious freedom of [[Christianity|Christians]] and time-honored [[family values]]". Its stated purpose is "... to be the sword and shield for people of faith".

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed suit on December 14, 2004, on behalf of eleven parents from the Dover school district, and sought a law firm willing to take on the case at the risk of not being paid if the case was lost. Eric Rothschild, a partner at [[Pepper Hamilton LLP]] and a member of the [[National Center for Science Education]] legal advisory council, was quick to agree to take the case on such a contingency basis.

The [[Discovery Institute]]'s John West said the case displayed the ACLU's "[[Orwellian]]" effort to stifle scientific discourse and objected to the issue being decided in court. "It's a disturbing prospect that the outcome of this lawsuit could be that the court will try to tell scientists what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not," West said. "That is a flagrant assault on [[free speech]]." Opponents, represented by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[National Association of Biology Teachers]], contended that his statement is not just ironic, but hypocritical, as the Discovery Institute opposes [[Naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]], the basic principle that limits science to natural phenomena and natural causes without assuming the existence or non-existence of the [[supernatural]], which by definition is beyond natural explanation.

Despite its earlier involvement, the Discovery Institute was concerned that this would be a test case and that the defendants had earlier displayed their religious motivations. This tension led to disagreements with the Thomas More Law Center and the withdrawal of three Discovery Institute fellows as defense experts prior to their depositions&amp;nbsp;– [[William A. Dembski]], [[Stephen C. Meyer]] and [[John Angus Campbell]]. This was purportedly because the Thomas More Law Center refused to allow these witnesses to have their own attorneys present during deposition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2005/10/discovery-institute-thomas-more-law-center-squabble-aei-foru-00704 Discovery Institute and Thomas More Law Center Squabble in AEI Forum], October 23rd, 2005 [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; but Discovery Institute director [[Bruce Chapman]] later said that he had asked them not to testify (as well as Behe and Minnich, who testified anyway).&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002953668_id26m.html Seattle's Discovery Institute scrambling to rebound after intelligent-design ruling], David Postman, [[The Seattle Times]], April 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the publisher of ''Of Pandas and People'', the [[Foundation for Thought and Ethics]] (FTE), filed a motion seeking to intervene in the case. FTE argued that a ruling that intelligent design was religious would have severe financial consequences, citing possible losses of approximately half a million dollars. By intervening, FTE would have become a co-defendant with the Dover Area School Board, and able to bring its own lawyers and [[expert witness]]es to the case. FTE's president Jon Buell implied that if allowed to intervene, FTE would bring Dembski and Meyer as expert witnesses. In his decision on the motion, Jones ruled that FTE was not entitled to intervene in the case because its motion to intervene was not timely, describing FTE's reasons for not trying to become involved earlier as "both unavailing and disingenuous." Jones also held that FTE had failed to demonstrate that it has "a significantly protectable interest in the litigation warranting intervention as a party" and that its interests would not be adequately represented by the defendants.

In the November 2005 elections, none of the members of the Dover School Board who voted for the intelligent design policy were re-elected, and a new school board, which rejected the policy, took office. This effectively precluded the possibility of an appeal to a higher court.

== Trial ==

The trial began on September 26, 2005.

=== Opening statements ===

==== Plaintiffs ====
Eric Rothschild gave the opening statement for the plaintiffs. He said that the plaintiffs would be able to provide many examples of school board members wishing to balance the teaching of evolution with creationism. He attacked prior defense claims that it was a minor affair by saying that there is no such thing as a "little" constitutional violation. He also provided the definition of creationism given by an early draft of ''Pandas'': "Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands." He compared this with what was eventually published: "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, et cetera." (The definitions had come up earlier in a July 14 pre-trial hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/webfm_send/164 |page=99|date=2005-07-14 |title=Oral Argument |accessdate=2009-11-18}}, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, July 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) He also argued that intelligent design was not [[protoscience|science in its infancy]], but rather was [[pseudoscience|not science at all]].

==== Defense ====
Patrick Gillen gave the opening arguments for the defense. He started by saying that the goal of the board and its supporters was to enhance science education. He argued that the policy was a "modest change." He distanced the policy from alleged statements by then board member William Buckingham that the plaintiffs argued showed clear religious intent: "The board listened to the science faculty more than it listened to Bill Buckingham." He argued that the policy did not have a "religious agenda." Gillen mentioned that board member Alan Bonsell had done his own reading. He said Bonsell was "aware of intelligent design theory, and that 300 or so scientists had signed a statement indicating that biologists were exaggerating claims for the theory. He had read about the famous [[Piltdown man]] hoax. He had an interest in creationism."

=== Witnesses ===

==== Witnesses for the plaintiffs ====
;September 27, 2005
* [[Kenneth R. Miller]], a [[biology]] [[professor]] from [[Brown University]] and noted author and commentator opposed to the intelligent design and creationist movements, was the first witness. He testified as an [[expert witness]] that "Intelligent design is not a testable theory and as such is not generally accepted by the scientific community." He said that the idea of intelligent design was not subject to [[falsifiability|falsification]], and demonstrated that many claims made by intelligent-design advocates against evolution were invalid. When asked what the harm was in reading the statement, Miller gave a two-fold response. 1) "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I]&lt;/nowiki&gt;t falsely undermines the scientific status of evolutionary theory and gives students a false understanding of what theory actually means." And 2) "As a person of faith who was blessed with two daughters, who raised both of my daughters in the church, and had they been given an education in which they were explicitly or implicitly forced to choose between God and science, I would have been furious, because I want my children to keep their religious faith."
* Tammy Kitzmiller testified as a [[fact witness]]. She was the lead plaintiff and a parent of a child in the Dover school system.
* Aralene "Barrie" D. Callahan, a Dover parent, was a plaintiff and was for ten years a board member of the Dover Area School District. She testified that Alan Bonsell, a board member, argued in a board retreat in Spring 2003 that if evolution were taught then creationism should also be taught.
* Bryan Rehm was the last witness of the day. He was a former [[physics]] teacher at Dover and a parent to children attending school at the Dover Area School District. Both he and his wife were plaintiffs and taught [[Vacation Bible School]]. Rehm testified that Alan Bonsell, then-chairman of the board's curriculum committee, had asked teachers to watch a video on intelligent design titled ''[[Icons of Evolution]]''. Teachers had expressed concern that Bonsell did not believe in evolution and wished to see classroom discussions of evolution balanced "fifty-fifty" with creationism.
;September 28
* [[Robert T. Pennock]] is a [[philosopher]] now working on the [[Avida]] [[digital organism]] project at [[Michigan State University]] where he is an associate professor. He is the author of many books and articles critical of intelligent design. He testified as an expert witness.
* Julie Smith is a parent and plaintiff. She made only one point: that the policy created a hostile atmosphere for her daughter, Katherine. She said her daughter was harassed for her [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] background, being told that she is an [[atheist]] since she accepted [[evolution]].

Dover Area School District&lt;/ref&gt; and also furnished the court with a written expert witness report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/webfm_send/326 |title=Barbara Forrest Supplement to Expert Witness Report |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a supplemental report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/webfm_send/328 |title=Barbara Forrest expert report |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest is a professor in philosophy in the Department of History and Political Science at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]]. She and scientist [[Paul R. Gross]] co-authored the book ''[[Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 2004).

&lt;!--

--&gt;Before her testimony, the TMLC filed a motion to have her excluded as an expert witness. In that motion they characterized her as "little more than a conspiracy theorist and a web-surfing, 'cyber-stalker' of the Discovery Institute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/webfm_send/470 |title=Motion in limine to exclude Forrest |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/webfm_send/469 |title=Brief supporting motion in limine to exclude Forrest |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones denied the motion.

&lt;!--

--&gt;Forrest gave testimony on the history of the intelligent design movement, citing writings of prominent figures (such as [[Discovery Institute]]'s "[[Wedge strategy|Wedge Document]]", [[Phillip E. Johnson|Phillip Johnson]]'s "How the Evolution Debate Can be Won", and of [[William Dembski]]). She also testified that ID was merely another name for the creationism movement, attempting to present a religious proposition as a scientific viewpoint. She stated that Johnson "regards evolution as a threat to the Bible in its entirety and as a threat to the moral fabric of American culture," and that one of the goals of his movement is to unify the religious world. She added that there is "no way to reconcile &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; at all" the Dover school board newsletter statement that intelligent design is a scientific theory with Paul Nelson's statements in the interview "The Measure of Design".

&lt;!--

--&gt;Forrest noted that she was unaware of any evidence that the members of the School board had seen the "Wedge Document" before the lawsuit.

&lt;!--

--&gt;Several days before her scheduled testimony, the Discovery Institute publicly ridiculed her on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/vise_strategy_undone_kitzmiller_et_al._v._dover_area_school_district The "Vise Strategy" Undone], [[Barbara Forrest]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/a/2901 Dover Trial Preview to Witness Testimony], [[Center for Science and Culture]], [[Discovery Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witnesses for the defense ====
;October 17–19
* [[Michael Behe]] was the first witness for the defense. Behe is professor of [[biochemistry]] at [[Lehigh University]] in Pennsylvania, and a leading intelligent design proponent who coined the term [[irreducible complexity]] and set out the idea in his book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~inbios/faculty/behe.html |title=Lehigh University Department of Biological Sciences |publisher=Lehigh.edu |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511040224/http://www.lehigh.edu/~inbios/faculty/behe.html |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a primary witness for the defense, Behe was asked to support the idea that intelligent design was legitimate science. Behe's critics have pointed to a number of key exchanges under [[cross examination]], where he conceded that, "There are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am.html |title=Kitzmiller v.

In response to a question about [[astrology]] he explained: "Under my definition, a scientific theory is a proposed explanation which focuses or points to physical, observable data and logical inferences. There are many things throughout the history of science which we now think to be incorrect which nonetheless ... would fit that definition. Yes, astrology is in fact one, and so is the ether theory of the propagation of light, and ... many other theories as well."&lt;ref&gt;Behe cross examination in the [http://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/trial_transcripts/2005_1018_day11_pm.pdf official court transcript], pp.38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

His simulation modelling of evolution with [[David Snoke]] described in a 2004 paper had been listed by the [[Discovery Institute]] amongst claimed "Peer-Reviewed &amp; Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/a/2640 Peer-Reviewed &amp; Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design (Annotated)], [[Discovery Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; but under oath he accepted that it showed that the biochemical systems it described could evolve within 20,000 years, even if the parameters of the simulation were rigged to make that outcome as unlikely as possible.&lt;ref name="p88"&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v.

In an email response to a complaint by social studies teacher Brad Neal, Baksa referred to ''The Myth of Separation'' by [[David Barton (author)|David Barton]], a book Baksa had received from Superintendent Richard Nilsen, who had received it from board member Alan Bonsell. The book calls separation of church and state "absurd." Baksa also discussed attempted changes to the statement. Teachers suggested adding "Darwin's theory of evolution continues to be the dominant scientific explanation of the origin of species," but this was eliminated by the board. The teachers also recommended altering it to read "Because Darwin's theory is a theory, there is a significant amount of evidence that supports the theory, although it is still being tested as new evidence is discovered." Citing his belief the board would reject this, Baksa eliminated the "significant amount of evidence."

He also stressed a distinction from the philosophy of science between the "context of discovery" (what motivates a scientist) and the "context of justification" (how the scientist's theory is judged) in order to mitigate the undeniably religious origins of intelligent design. Fuller memorably called for an "affirmative action" program for intelligent design, which did not win much favor with Jones in his final decision. Fuller's testimony was cited by lawyers for both the plaintiffs and the defense in their closing statements.

=== Decision ===
{{wikisource|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.}}
On December 20, 2005, Jones found for the plaintiffs and issued a [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al.|139 page decision]], in which he wrote:

{{quote|
* For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the religious nature of ID [intelligent design] would be readily apparent to an objective observer, adult or child. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 24 of 139|page 24]])
* A significant aspect of the IDM [intelligent design movement] is that despite Defendants' protestations to the contrary, it describes ID as a religious argument. In that vein, the writings of leading ID proponents reveal that the designer postulated by their argument is the God of Christianity. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 26 of 139|page 26]])
* The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 31 of 139|page 31]])
* The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/3:Disclaimer#Page 43 of 139|page 43]])
* Throughout the trial and in various submissions to the Court, Defendants vigorously argue that the reading of the statement is not 'teaching' ID but instead is merely 'making students aware of it.' In fact, one consistency among the Dover School Board members' testimony, which was marked by selective memories and outright lies under oath, as will be discussed in more detail below, is that they did not think they needed to be knowledgeable about ID because it was not being taught to the students. We disagree.&amp;nbsp;... an educator reading the disclaimer is engaged in teaching, even if it is colossally bad teaching.&amp;nbsp;... Defendants' argument is a red herring because the Establishment Clause forbids not just 'teaching' religion, but any governmental action that endorses or has the primary purpose or effect of advancing religion. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/3:Disclaimer#Page 46 of 139|footnote 7 on page 46]])
* After a searching review of the record and applicable caselaw, we find that while ID arguments may be true, a proposition on which the Court takes no position, ID is not science. We find that ID fails on three different levels, any one of which is sufficient to preclude a determination that ID is science. They are: (1) ID violates the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking and permitting supernatural causation; (2) the argument of [[irreducible complexity]], central to ID, employs the same flawed and illogical contrived dualism that doomed creation science in the 1980s; and (3) ID's negative attacks on evolution have been refuted by the scientific community. ... It is additionally important to note that ID has failed to gain acceptance in the scientific community, it has not generated peer-reviewed publications, nor has it been the subject of testing and research. Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#4. Whether ID is Science|page 64]]) [for "contrived dualism", see [[false dilemma]].]
* [T]he one textbook [Pandas] to which the Dover ID Policy directs students contains outdated concepts and flawed science, as recognized by even the defense experts in this case. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 86 of 139|pages 86–87]])
* ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the ''controversy'', but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|page 89]])
* Accordingly, we find that the secular purposes claimed by the Board amount to a pretext for the Board's real purpose, which was to promote religion in the public school classroom, in violation of the Establishment Clause. ([[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 132 of 139|page 132]])}}

[[File:Judge John E Jones III.jpg|thumb|right|Judge [[John E. Jones III]] issued the decision in the case]]In his '''[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Conclusion]]''', he wrote:

{{quote|
* The proper application of both the [[endorsement test|endorsement]] and [[Lemon v. Kurtzman#Lemon test|Lemon tests]] to the facts of this case makes it abundantly clear that the Board's ID Policy violates the Establishment Clause. In making this determination, we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents. {{bracket|...}}
* The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy. With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom.
* The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial.}}

== Responses ==
Jones anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in his decision that:

{{quote|Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an [[wikt:activist judge|activist judge]]. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court. Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources.}}

Fulfilling Jones's prediction, [[John G. West]], Associate Director of the [[Center for Science and Culture]] at [[Discovery Institute]], said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian evolution through government-imposed censorship rather than open debate, and it won't work. He has conflated Discovery Institute's position with that of the Dover school board, and he totally misrepresents intelligent design and the motivations of the scientists who research it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/12/dover_intelligent_design_decis001761.html Dover Intelligent Design Decision Criticized as a Futile Attempt to Censor Science Education], Robert Crowther, Evolution News &amp; Views, [[Discovery Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Settlement of the legal fees ==
On February 21, 2006, the newly elected Dover Area School Board voted, unanimously with one abstention, to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages due to the parents and their lawyers as a result of the verdict in the case, a large sum of money for a small district. The previous school board had been offered the opportunity to rescind its policy, and avoid paying legal fees, immediately after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, but it declined. The parents' attorneys Pepper Hamilton stated that court records would show that they were entitled to more than $2 million, but were going to accept less than half that amount in recognition of the small size of the school district, and because the school board that voted for the policy had been voted out of office, leaving the new school board "having the bill placed in their laps." The previous school board had been defended without charge by the Thomas More Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Kauffman | first =Christina | title =Dover gets a million-dollar bill | publisher =York Dispatch | date =February 22, 2006 | url =http://www.yorkdispatch.com/searchresults/ci_3535139 | accessdate =2007-08-12 | format = | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://archive.is/20130105132526/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/searchresults/ci_3535139 | archivedate =January 5, 2013 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Katskee, assistant legal director for Americans United, said of the trial's cost, "Any board thinking of trying to do what the Dover board did is going to have to look for a bill in excess of $2 million," and "I think $2 million is a lot to explain to taxpayers for a lawsuit that should never be fought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2006/02/intelligent-design-costs-dover-over-1000000-00899 |title="Intelligent design" costs Dover over $1,000,000 | date =February 24, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=NCSE Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential perjury and deceit ==
After the trial, there were calls for the defendants, accused of not presenting their case honestly, to be put on trial for committing perjury. "Witnesses either testified inconsistently, or lied outright under oath on several occasions," Jones wrote. "The inescapable truth is that both [Alan] Bonsell and [William] Buckingham lied at their January 3, 2005 depositions. ... Bonsell repeatedly failed to testify in a truthful manner. ... Defendants have unceasingly attempted in vain to distance themselves from their own actions and statements, which culminated in repetitious, untruthful testimony." An editorial in the ''[[York Daily Record]]'' described their behavior as both ironic and sinful, saying that the "unintelligent designers of this fiasco should not walk away unscathed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = OUR OPINION: Investigate perjury in Dover ID case Judge Jones issued a broad, sensible ruling&amp;nbsp;— finding that some board members lied. | journal = York Daily Record | date = December 21, 2005 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=YK&amp;p_theme=yk&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10F714F29CDB92C0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | id = MERLIN_1306067}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John E.

*# In his January 2005 deposition, Buckingham denied knowing where the book donations came from.
*# During the trial, plaintiff attorney Steve Harvey produced a 2004-10-04 check from board member Buckingham for $850 with the memo "for Pandas and People" written out to Donald Bonsell, father of school board president Alan Bonsell. Buckingham had given the check to Alan Bonsell, who gave it to his father, who would "take it off the table" (according to Alan Bonsell) and buy the books.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Devil in Dover|The Devil in Dover, p.171]]&lt;/ref&gt; The money had come from donations from parishioners of Buckingham's church after he stood up and said the board needed it. Bonsell also denied in deposition knowing where the books came from.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Devil in Dover|The Devil in Dover, p.166]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Behe defended his version of the definition of scientific theory as being one that is commonly used among scientists. Who these scientists are and where they use the Behe definition was not clarified. But Behe's employer, Lehigh University, in an undated proclamation, stated the department faculty's unequivocal support for evolution and "...

*# Behe engaged in [[Quoting out of context|quote-mining]], at best, regarding the bacterial flagellum. During his 2005-10-17 (Day 10) morning testimony, when asked "Have other scientists acknowledged these design features of the flagellum?", Behe cited a 1998 article in the journal Cell by Brandeis University professor David J. DeRosier, [http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(00)81141-1 The Turn of the Screw, The Bacterial Flagellar Motor], and Derosier's statement that the bacterial flagellum looked designed. Behe left it at that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ncse.com/files/pub/legal/kitzmiller/trial_transcripts/2005_1017_day10_am.pdf Behe testified that Derosier agreed]&lt;/ref&gt;
*# He omitted, as Derosier pointed out in the Nova documentary, that Derosier wrote that bacterial flagellum '''looked''' like it was designed by a '''human'''. Derosier went on to add that in fact, the evidence pointed to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/intelligent-design-trial.html Derosier]&lt;/ref&gt; That is not explicit in the article, but Derosier is known as an evolution proponent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/sci-ev/sci_vs_ev_26.htm Derosier known as evolution proponent]&lt;/ref&gt; so Behe should have known, since he quotes Derosier seemingly as in agreement, that Derosier disagreed with him regarding whether the bacterial flagellum points to evolution or Intelligent Design.

== Analysis and criticism ==
The ''[[University of Montana-Missoula|University of Montana]] Law Review'' published three articles addressing this topic in its winter 2007 issue.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.umt.edu/mlr/Editors%27%20Note.pdf Articles - Editor's Note: Intelligent Design Articles]", ''[[University of Montana]] Law Review'', Volume 68, Number 1, April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; David K. DeWolf, [[John G. West]] and [[Casey Luskin]], senior fellows or officers of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, that the Jones court should not have addressed the question of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the decision will have no effect on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWolf |first=David K. |author2=West, John G. |author3=Luskin, Casey |year=2007 |title=Intelligent Design will survive ''Kitzmiller v.

It had been an essential part of the ruling to consider whether ID was a legitimate scientific theory as claimed by its proponents, and DeWolf, et al. had implicitly recognised this by citing the [[Lemon v.

'''''Lochead-MacMillan v AMI Insurance Ltd''''' [2012] NZHRRT 5 was an important case on privacy law in New Zealand that was decided in the [[Human Rights Review Tribunal]]. Besides reinforcing the principle that a person can receive general damages for breaches of privacy for humiliation and injury of feelings, it set the precedent of increasing such an award from the then $7,500 to $10,000, and was prominent enough to be included on the Privacy Commission's June 2012 newsletter.

==Background==
The Lochead-MacMillan's house in Waiuku was insured with AMI Insurance. When their house later burnt down, they made an insurance claim with AMI. AMI in assessing the claim, got an investigator to interview the claimants. Two interviews were conducted, both of which were recorded by the investigator.

On 4 February 2010, the claimants requested AMI for a copy of audio files and transcripts, which under the Privacy Act they had the legal right to obtain.  Only the transcript for the second interview was provided on 22 February, which was incomplete, and the transcript for the first interview was only provided in June.

With regards the request for the audio files, it was never acknowledged despite they were legally required to do so within 20 working days of the request. This request was never complied with by AMI, as at some stage the audio files were lost by them.

On 2 March 2010, unaware that the audio files were lost, requested AMI again for the audio files, and 3 days later AMI informed them that their claim had now been accepted, although there was still a dispute of the amount that was to be paid by AMI.

The claimants again requested the audio files from AMI on 13 April 2010.

Concerned about the progress of their insurance claim, on 6 May 2010 they requested AMI to also provide a copy of the VFR fire investigation report. While in this instance they got a reply from AMI on 21 May, they refused to provide them with the report on the grounds of litigation privilege.

Five days later, they claimants later accepted, under protest, a lesser amount than they had claimed. They did so without the benefit of having the investigators report on hand.
However, after this matter was investigated by the Privacy Commission, AMI released the report to them on 3 November.

The claimants then filed a claim with the Human Rights Review Tribunal.

==The Decision==
The Tribunal ruled that AMI breached the Lochead-MacMillan's privacy on numerous grounds, including not giving a written decision to access requests, not providing records within a reasonable time, and not informing them of their right to lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commission.

Furthermore, the Tribunal ruled that AMI's claim of litigation privilege was not genuine, as when they said this, they had no reasonable contemplation of litigation on the matter.

The Tribunal made a ruling for damages of $10,000 for the violation and the injury to Lochead-MacMillan's feelings.

'''Mahoney v Ashton''' was a slavery case brought before the General Court of the Western Shore in [[Annapolis]], Maryland in 1791. On October 18, 1791 the slave Charles Mahoney filed a petition for freedom before the court against his owner, Father John Ashton, a Roman Catholic priest and former [[Jesuit]]. Mahoney claimed that he was descended from a free woman named Ann Joice, an indentured servant, making him a free man. Mahoney v. Ashton dragged on for twelve years, including three jury trials and two appeal hearings. The result was inconclusive, but on the 4th of May 1804 John Ashton recorded a deed that "forever set free Charles Mahoney.", and agreed to "relinquish and renounce all claim whatever which I have or ever had to him."

The case involved hundreds of participants including many notable members of the Maryland slave-owning gentry, including [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]].

'''Marriage vows''' are promises each partner in a couple makes to the other during a [[wedding ceremony]] based upon Western Christian norms. They are not universal to marriage and not necessary in most legal jurisdictions. They are not even universal within Christian marriage, as [[Eastern Christians]] do not have marriage vows in their traditional wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/?page_id=7204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the time of the [[Roman Empire]] (17 BC{{snds}}476 AD) the lower classes had "free" marriages. The [[bride]]'s father would deliver her to the [[groom]], and the two agreed that they were [[Wedding|wed]], and would keep the vow of [[marriage]] by mutual consent. Wealthy Romans, though, would sign documents listing property rights to publicly declare that their union was legalized and not a [[common law marriage]]. This was the beginning of the official recording of marriage{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

The oldest traditional wedding vows can be traced back to the manuals of the medieval church. In England, there were manuals of the dioceses of Salisbury (Sarum) and York. The compilers of the first [[Book of Common Prayer]], published in 1549, based its marriage service mainly on the Sarum manual.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Evan (1901) ''The Prayer-Book: its history, language and contents''. London: Wells Gardner, Darton &amp; Co., p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The betrothal in the Sarum manual: "I N. take the N. to my weddyd wyf to have and to holde fro thys day forwarde, for beter for wers, for richere for porere; in sykenesse and in hele [health]; tyl dethe us departe; if holy chyrche it wol ordeyne; and thereto I plycht the my trouthe". (In the woman's pledge, "hele" is followed by "to be bonere and buxum"; "bonere" means "gracious" or "gentle", "buxum" means "obedient")&lt;br&gt;Daniel, Evan (1901) ''The Prayer-Book: its history, language and contents''. London: Wells Gardner, Darton &amp; Co., pp. 493-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon agreement to marry, the [[Church of England]] usually offered couples a choice. The couple could promise each other to "[[love]] and cherish" or, alternatively, the groom promises to "love, cherish, and worship", and the bride to "love, cherish, and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Heart Weddings - The History of Wedding Vows|url=http://www.allheartweddings.com/the_history_of_wedding_vows.html|publisher=All Heart Weddings|accessdate=26 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530091806/http://www.allheartweddings.com/the_history_of_wedding_vows.html|archive-date=30 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

=== Roman Catholic ===

Couples wedding in the Roman Catholic Church essentially make the same pledge to one another. According to the Rite of Marriage (#25) the customary text in English is:&lt;ref name="cwv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catholic wedding vows|url=http://catholicweddinghelp.com/topics/catholic-wedding-vows.htm|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I, ____, take you, ____, to be my (husband/wife). I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, Catholic wedding vows may also take the following form:&lt;ref name="cwv" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I, ____, take you, ____, to be my  lawfully wedded (husband/wife), to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The priest will then say aloud "You have declared your consent before the Church. May the Lord in his goodness strengthen your consent and fill you both with his blessings. What God has joined, men must not divide. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism_it/p2s2c3a7_it.htm |title=Catechismo della Chiesa Cattolica; pt. 2, sez. 2, cap. 3, art. 7: Il sacramento del matrimonio|language=Italian|accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican===

The law in England authorizes marriages to be legal if properly carried out and registered in the Church of England and some other religious bodies (e.g. Jewish, Quakers): other men and women who wish to marry can be married by a local official authorized to do so (civil ceremony). Circumstances may result in the same partners having both ceremonies at different times, though this is rare. The vows, presence of witnesses, and civil registration are absolute requirements under the law.

[[Civil marriage|Civil ceremonies]] often allow couples to choose their own marriage vows, although many civil marriage vows are adapted from the traditional vows, taken from the [[Book of Common Prayer]], "To have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zr8PAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=book+of+common+prayer&amp;ei=qoTtSqOpHYnaygSl9MyLDg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]:|title=The Book of Common Prayer|author=|date=|work=google.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were first published in English in the prayer book of 1549, based on earlier Latin texts (the Sarum and York Rituals of the medieval period). An older version of the final phrase is " until death us depart" where "depart" means "separate". "Until death us depart" had to be changed due to changes in the usage of "depart" in the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book of 1662]]. In the 1928 prayer book (not authorized) and in editions of the 1662 prayer book printed thereafter "obey" was retained (in the 1928 book an alternative version omitted this). The 1928 revised form of Matrimony was quite widely adopted, though the form of 1662 was also widely used, though less so after the introduction of the [[Alternative Service Book]].

The original wedding vows, as printed in The [[Book of Common Prayer]], are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Groom: I,____, take thee,_____, to be my  wedded Wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to [[love]] and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bride: I,_____, take thee,_____, to be my  wedded Husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]], till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then, as the groom places the ring on the bride's finger, he says the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With this Ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Alternative Service Book (1980) two versions of the vows are included: the bride and groom must select one of the versions only. Version A:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I, ____, take you, ____, to be my wife (or husband), to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy law, and this is my solemn vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Version B is identical except for the clause "to love and to cherish" where the groom says "to love, cherish, and worship" and the bride says "to love, cherish, and obey".&lt;ref&gt;''The Alternative Service Book 1980, together with the Liturgical Psalter''. Colchester: William Clowes, 1980; pp. 290-91&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 the service in Common Worship the normal vows are as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I,''N'', take you, ''N'', to be my wife (or husband), to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy law, in the presence of God I make this vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the bride and groom may choose to replace the clause "to love and to cherish" with "to love, cherish, and obey" when the bride makes her vows.&lt;ref&gt;''Common Worship Pastoral Services' Church House Publishing; P 108 &amp; P 150&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 1922, the Episcopal Church voted to remove the word "obey" from the bride's section of wedding vows. Other churches of the Anglican Communion each have their own authorized prayer books which in general follow the vows described above though the details and languages used do vary.

===Quaker===
{{See also|Quaker wedding}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], since the first law regulating marriage (the [[Marriage Act 1753]]), the state recognises marriages conducted by the "[[Quakers|Society of Friends]]" (Quakers), Jews, and the [[Church of England]].

The declarations made in Quaker marriage were first set down in a [[London Yearly Meeting]] minute in 1675&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hull|first1=William I.|title=William Penn and the Dutch Quaker migration to Pennsylvania.|date=1970|publisher=Genealogical Pub. Co.|location=Baltimore|isbn=0806304324|page=206|edition=Repr. d. Ausg. Swarthmore, 1935.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Man: Friends, in the fear of the Lord, and before this assembly, I take my friend ''AB'' to be my wife, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto her a loving and faithful husband, until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us.&lt;ref name=Hull /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Woman: Friends, in the fear of the Lord, and before this assembly, I take my friend ''CD'' to be my husband, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto him a loving and faithful wife, until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us.&lt;ref name=Hull /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The procedure is restated in a minute of [[London Yearly Meeting]] of 1754,&lt;ref name=Hull /&gt; and the declarations remained the same until the twentieth century.  In July 1922, the Committee on the Marriage Declaration was set up, and this reported to London Yearly Meeting in 1923, and after reference to a further committee the final phrase was changed to ''as long as we both on earth shall live'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carnall|first1=Geoffrey|title=Gandhi's interpreter : a life of Horace Alexander|date=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780748640454|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the option of ''until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us'' remained as an alternative.

The current declarations allowed in [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Friends, I take this my friend [name] to be my spouse, promising, through divine assistance, to be unto him/her a loving and faithful spouse, so long as we both on earth shall live.&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Britain Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)|title=Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain|date=2014|edition=5th|chapter=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following alternatives are currently allowed:
* The declaration may be prefaced by ''In the presence of God''&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed" /&gt;
* The declaration may be prefaced by ''In the fear of the Lord and in the presence of this assembly''&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed" /&gt;
* The word ''spouse'' may be replaced by ''wife'' or ''husband'' as appropriate or by ''partner in marriage''&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed" /&gt;
* The phrase ''through divine assistance'' may be replaced by the words ''with God’s help''&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed" /&gt;
* The phrase ''so long as we both on earth shall live'' may be replaced by the words ''until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us''&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed" /&gt;
* The declaration may be made in Welsh in "places where the Welsh tongue is used"&lt;ref name="Quaker Faith and Practice 5th ed" /&gt;

== Civil marriage ==

===England and Wales===

Whilst couples may add to these, under the [[Marriage Act 1949]], all civil marriage in [[England and Wales]], and marriage by an authorised person (this includes religious marriage not carried out by the [[Anglican]] church, [[Jewish]] or [[Society of Friends]] (Quakers)), must include the following declaration and contracting words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do solemnly declare that I know not of any lawful impediment why I  ____ may not be joined in matrimony to ____.&lt;ref name="marriage act 1949"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|ukpga|12-13|Geo6|76|Marriage Act 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call upon these persons here present to witness that I ____ do take thee ____ to be my lawfully wedded wife/husband.&lt;ref name="marriage act 1949" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Marriage Ceremony (Prescribed Words) Act 1996'' allowed an alternative declaration of either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I declare that I know of no legal reason why I ____ may not be joined in marriage to ____.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Registrar/Minister'': Are you ____ free lawfully to marry ____&lt;br&gt;''Man/Woman'': I am. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

and an alternative of the contracting words of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I ____ take you/thee ____ to be my wedded wife/husband.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

The wedding vows as practised in most English-speaking countries derive ultimately from the [[Sarum rite]] of mediaeval England.  The first part of the vows of the Sarum rite is given in Latin, but is instructed to be said by the priest "in linguam materna", i.e. in the "mother tongue" of those present.&lt;ref name="davies"/&gt;  The vows of the first English prayer book of 1549 mostly correspond to those of the Sarum rite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">'''Matthew Ashby''' was born in [[York County, Virginia]], in 1727. He is a notable and rare example of the successful escape from [[slavery]] and indentured servitude. The son of a [[black slave]] and a white indentured servant, he was born free under Virginia law, which at the time gave children the legal status of their mothers. Ashby worked around the [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] area as a [[carter (disambiguation)|carter]] and [[carpenter]]. He was also known to deliver messages for the state, working for [[Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt|Governor Botetourt]]. Although he himself was indentured until the age of 31, by law, he managed to acquire many things that were well out of the realm of the average slave or servant, including a [[silver]] watch, candle making supplies, tea boards, and books.  

Matthew married Ann, a slave of the [[bricklayer]], Samuel Spurr. They had two children named John and Mary, who attended the Bray school affiliated with the College of William and Mary.   Ms. Anne Wager taught the children the [[Church of England]] [[catechism]] as well as other subjects. Matthew was able to use his free status to buy his children and wife from Spurr, at the cost of £150.  

Despite owning his own children and wife Ashby still had to petition the government for their freedom. Standing before the council, Ashby proclaimed that his wife had been faithful and diligent in all her wifely duties, and that his children were also deserving of their freedom. The council deliberated and found that they agreed with his proposal and his family was granted their freedom in 1769. Two years later Ashby died of a [[heart disease]], leaving his family alone. Having freed his family from slavery and amassing a sizable estate with monetary value well above the average indentured servant or slave.

It was written by the male passengers of the ''[[Mayflower]],'' consisting of [[Puritans#Puritans and Separatists|separatist Puritans]], adventurers, and tradesmen. The Puritans were fleeing from religious persecution by [[James VI and I|King James of England]].

The Mayflower Compact was signed aboard ship on November 11, 1620.  They used the [[Julian Calendar]], also known as [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style dates]], which was ten days behind the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Signing the covenant were 41 of the ship's 101 passengers&lt;ref name="Prince1736" /&gt;&lt;ref name="passengers" /&gt; while the ''Mayflower'' was anchored in [[Provincetown Harbor]] within the hook at the northern tip of [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref name="Young1841" /&gt;

== Reasons for the Compact ==
The ''Mayflower'' was originally bound for the [[Colony of Virginia]], financed by the [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London]]. Storms forced them to anchor at the hook of [[Cape Cod]] in Massachusetts, however, as it was unwise to continue with provisions running short. This inspired some of the non-Puritan passengers (whom the Puritans referred to as "Strangers") to proclaim that they "would use their own liberty; for none had power to command them" since they would not be settling in the agreed-upon Virginia territory.&lt;ref name="bradford1620"/&gt; To prevent this, the Pilgrims determined to establish their own government, while still affirming their allegiance to the Crown of England. Thus, the Mayflower Compact was based simultaneously upon a [[majoritarianism|majoritarian]] model and the settlers' allegiance to the king. It was in essence a social contract in which the settlers consented to follow the community's rules and regulations for the sake of order and survival.{{sfn|Young|1841|p=120}} 

The Pilgrims had lived for some years in [[Leiden]], a city in the Dutch Republic. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick states, "Just as a spiritual covenant had marked the beginning of their congregation in Leiden, a civil covenant would provide the basis for a secular government in America."&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Philbrick (2006), ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War'', Penguin Book, New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|978-0-14-311197-9}}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayflower Compact Bradford.jpg|right|thumb|Bradford's transcription of the Compact]]
The original document has been lost,&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt; but three versions exist from the 17th century: printed in ''[[Mourt's Relation]]'' (1622),&lt;ref name="Mourt1622" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mourt1865" /&gt; which was reprinted in ''Purchas his Pilgrimes'' (1625);&lt;ref name=Purchas1906/&gt; hand-written by [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] in his journal ''[[Of Plimoth Plantation]]'' (1646);&lt;ref name="Bradford1901" /&gt; and printed by Bradford's nephew [[Nathaniel Morton]] in ''New-Englands Memorial'' (1669).&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt; The three versions differ slightly in wording and significantly in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.&lt;ref name="Mourt1865" /&gt; William Bradford wrote the first part of ''Mourt's Relation'', including its version of the compact, so he wrote two of the three versions. The wording of those two versions is indeed quite similar, unlike that of Morton. Bradford's handwritten manuscript is kept in a vault at the State Library of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="vault" /&gt;

The document was signed under the Old Style [[Julian calendar]], since England did not adopt the [[Gregorian calendar]] until 1752.  The Gregorian date would be November 21.

== Signers ==
[[File:1920USstamp5centPilgrimTercentenarySigningCompact.jpg|thumb|right|1920 U.S. postage stamp depicting the signing of the compact]]
A list of 41 male passengers who signed the document was supplied by Bradford's nephew [[Nathaniel Morton]] in his 1669 ''New England's Memorial''. [[Thomas Prince]] first numbered the names in his 1736 ''A Chronological History of New-England in the form of Annals''.&lt;ref name=Prince1736/&gt; The original document has been lost, so Morton is the sole source for the signers. He probably had access to the original document, but he could not have known the actual order in which it was signed simply by inspecting it. Morton's arrangement of names might not have been the arrangement on the original document, and the names on the original may not have been arranged in any orderly fashion. Prince's numbers are based solely on Morton, as he himself stated.&lt;ref name=Bowman/&gt;

Morton's list of names was unnumbered and untitled in all six editions (1669–1855), although their order changed with successive editions. In his original 1669 edition, the names were placed on two successive pages forming six short columns, three per page.&lt;ref name=Bowman/&gt; In subsequent editions, these six short columns were combined into three long columns on a single page in two different ways, producing two different orders in unnumbered lists of signers. The second (1721) and third (1772) editions changed the order of the first edition by combining the first and fourth columns into the first long column, and similarly for the other columns. The fifth (1826) and sixth (1855) editions returned the names to their original first edition order by combining the first and second short columns into the first long column, and similarly for the other columns. Prince numbered the names in their original 1669 Morton order. He added titles (Mr. or Capt.) to 11 names that were given those titles by William Bradford in the list of passengers at the end of his manuscript.&lt;ref name=Prince1736/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradford1901/&gt; 

The following list of signers is organized into the six short columns of Morton (1669) with the numbers and titles of Prince. The names are given their modern spelling according to Morison.&lt;ref name=Morison/&gt; Use the numbers for the order used by genealogists and half of unnumbered lists (Samuel Fuller will be the eighth name), but merge the half columns vertically into full columns for the order used by the other half of unnumbered lists (John Turner will be the eighth name).

{{Politics of New York}}
'''New York energy law''' is the [[Statutory law|statutory]], [[Regulation|regulatory]], and [[common law]] of the [[United States|state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] concerning the policy, conservation, taxation, and utilities involved in [[energy]].  Secondary sources have also influenced the law of energy in the Empire State.

The myriad legal issues concerning [[hydrofracking]] in New York has in the 2010s spawned a new body of legal authority with primary authorities such as case law, statutes, and zoning regulations, as well as secondary sources such as law review and newspaper articles, for this rapidly changing field of law.

==Energy Law (Consolidated Laws)==
The ''[[New York Consolidated Laws]]'' includes a statutory code called the "Energy Law".&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Energy Law § 1-101, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS New York State Legislature official web site], go to "ENG", then "Article 1", finally "1–101 – Short title". Accessed August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under New York law, "energy" and "energy resources" are defined as:

{{quote|"Energy"  means work or heat that is, or may be, produced from any fuel or source whatsoever. ... "Energy resources" shall mean any force or material which yields or has the potential to yield  energy, including but not limited to electrical, fossil,  geothermal, wind, hydro, solid waste, tidal, wood, solar and nuclear sources.|N.Y. Energy Law § 1-103 (5) and (6).&lt;ref&gt;N.Y.

Accessed February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The N.Y. Energy Law became effective on July 26, 1976 as Chapter 17-A of the [[Consolidated Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;See Preface, N.Y. Energy Law (McKinney's); L. 1976, Chap. 819, sec. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1970s was a period of tremendous expansion of both federal and state laws concerning energy.

This code is divided into these articles, which are ''not'' sequential:&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Energy Law, at Consolidated Laws, at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS New York State Legislature official website], go to "ENG".  Accessed February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Hydrofracking==
{{main|Hydraulic fracturing}}
{{see also|Queenston Formation}}
The myriad legal issues concerning [[hydrofracking]] in New York has spawned a whole body of law, with primary authorities such as case law, statutes, and zoning regulations, as well as secondary sources such as law review and newspaper articles, on this rapidly changing field of law.

===Court cases and analysis===

====''Dryden'' and ''Middletown''====
In February 2012, two cases of first impression, ''Anschutz Exploration Corp. v. Town of Dryden'' and ''Cooperstown Holstein Corp. v. Town of Middletown'', dealt with the issue of whether towns in New York can use local [[zoning law]]s to ban hydrofracking, within their [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s, or whether such action would be preempted by N.Y. Environmental Conservation Law § 23-0303 (2).&lt;ref name="Zoning and preemption"&gt;Charles Gottlieb, ''Hydrofracking, Local Zoning, and State Preemption'', paper presented at the [[Warren M. Anderson]] Legislative Breakfast Series, "Hydrofracking - Balancing the 3 E's: Energy, Environment, and Economic Development," February 28, 2012 ([[Albany Law School]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anschutz1&gt;''Anschutz Exploration Corp. v. Town of Dryden''  __ N.Y.S.2d ___ (Index # 2012-0902) (N.Y. Supreme Ct. Tompkins Co. February 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazette2&gt;Andrew Carden, "Another victory for anti-frackers," ''[[Legislative Gazette]]'', March 6, 2012, pp. 8, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Cooperstown1&gt;''Cooperstown Holstein Corp. v. Town of Middletown'', __ N.Y.S.2d ___ (Index # 2012-0930) (N.Y. Supreme Ct. Otsego Co. February 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  In each of these two cases, [[New York Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the defendant towns, that the state Oil, Gas, and Solution Mining Law's superseding language&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Environmental Conservation Law § 23-0303 (2), found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&amp;QUERYDATA=$$ENV23-0303$$@TXENV023-0303+&amp;LIST=LAW+&amp;BROWSER=EXPLORER+&amp;TOKEN=24382709+&amp;TARGET=VIEW N.Y.

Retrieved February 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; did not preempt their zoning laws.&lt;ref name="Zoning and preemption" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lebrun1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Time-is-on-our-side-in-hydrofracking-fight-3379894.php|work=Albany Times Union|title=Time is on our side in hydrofracking fight|last=LeBrun|first=Fred|date=March 4, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal and political issues raised by these explosive cases were the subject of a seminar organized on February 28, 2012 by the [[Albany Law School]].&lt;ref name="Zoning and preemption" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Balancing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=297&amp;event_id=600 |title=First Anderson Legislative Seminar of 2012 to Tackle Hydrofracking |author=Patricia Salkin |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Anschutz'' case got the most publicity and analysis in the immediate aftermath, because it was decided a week earlier than the ''Cooperstown'' court.  Opponents of hydrofacking "emerged trimphant" after winning ''Anschutz''.&lt;ref name=Gazette1&gt;Andrew Carden, "Judge rules local governments can ban fracking," ''[[Legislative Gazette]]'', February 28, 2012, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Phillip R. Rumsey relied in part on cases from [[Colorado]] that allowed local governments to regulate gas drilling,&lt;ref name=Gazette1 /&gt; as well as from [[Pennsylvania]], which concerned the very same [[Marcellus shale]] that is being drilled in [[Upstate New York]].&lt;ref name="Zoning and preemption" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anschutz1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, the ''Anschutz'' relied on ''Huntley &amp; Huntley, Inc. v. Borough Council of the Borough of Oakmont'', 964 A.2d 855, 858 (Penn. 2009); see also Charles Gottlieb, ''Hydrofracking, Local Zoning, and State Preemption'', ''op.cit.'', 4-5, notes 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Anschutz'' distinguished this zoning situation from a bonding requirement, which is a direct regulation of the industry that is preempted by the N.Y. Department of Environmental Conservation's permit fees and regulatory scheme.&lt;ref name="Zoning and preemption" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''Envirogas, Inc. v. Town of Kiatone'', 112 Misc. 2d 432, 434 (N.Y. Supreme Ct. Erie Co. 1982), ''aff'd'' 89 A.D.2d 1056 (4th Dept. 1982), lv. den'd'' 58 N.Y.2d 602 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  That court also relied on cases that allowed "exclusionary zoning" that prohibits of "natural resources within the town as a permitted use if limiting that use is a reasonable exercise of its police powers ...."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gottlieb, ''Hydrofracking, Local Zoning, and State Preemption'', ''op.cit.'', 4, n. 11, citing ''Anschutz Exploration Corp. v. Town of Dryden''  __ N.Y.S.2d ___ (Index # 2012-0902) (N.Y. Supreme Ct. Tompkins Co. February 21, 2012), slip opinion at 12-13; in turn citing ''Matter of Gernatt Asphalt Prods., Inc. v. Town of Sardina'', 87 N.Y.2d 668, 681-682, 684 (1996) and ''Envirogas, Inc. v. Town of Kiatone'', ''op cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cooperstown'', a farmer named Jennifer Huntington leased 400 acres of her land for natural drilling, and she sued after the town changed its zoning laws to ban fracking.&lt;ref name=Gazette2 /&gt;  This case has a similar outcome; the town of Middlefield won at the trial court level, in a decision by Acting Justice Daniel F. Cerio.&lt;ref name=Gazette2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooperstown1 /&gt;  An attorney at [[Earthjustice]] lauded the ''Cooperstown'' decision, while the attorney who had represented ''Anschutz'' criticized both decisions.&lt;ref name=Gazette2 /&gt;

Since both courts are within the Third Department of the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]], and they would be appealed,&lt;ref name=Gazette2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lebrun1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazette1/&gt; they were to be consolidated upon appeal.  Attorneys for the town of Dryden indicated they are in the process of perfecting the appeal as of September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=|last=Sabratino|first=Dan|title=Drilling bands to face appeal|publisher=''Legislative Gazette''|pages=2, 15|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'' columnist Fred LeBrun noted that while opponents are expecting a win, "plenty in our government" predict a successful appeal, so he "wouldn't bet either way."&lt;ref name=Lebrun1 /&gt;  However, two bloggers noted that the appeals have not been perfected as of August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdacc.org/2012/08/05/lebrun-cuomo-about-to-permit-fracking-aug-2012/|work=GDACC: Gas Drilling Awareness for Cortland County blog |title=LeBrun–Cuomo about to permit fracking–Aug. 2012|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.shaleshockmedia.org/2012/08/05/the-appeal-of-no-appeal/|work=Shaleshock media blog |title=Fracker's Complete Lack of Appeal|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searches of the website for, and an inquiry into, {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} the Third Department shows that neither losing party has perfected their appeals as of October 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/ad3/CalendarPages/netcal.htm|work=[[New York State Unified Court System]] website|title=Appellate Division, Third Judicial Department Calendar Pages|date=October 17, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complicating the appeals, [[Norse Energy]] has also become involved in the ''Anschutz'' case.  Back in October 2011, Norse Energy put up their [[Assignment (law)|leases for sale]], claiming the moratorium by Governor Paterson had hurt the international company's prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20111021/NEWS01/110210398/Norse-Energy-puts-N-Y-land-rights-sale |title=Norse Energy puts N.Y. land rights for sale: Gas company hurt by moratorium on drilling|work=Gannette News|author=|date=October 21, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Norse bought Anschutz's leases, and thus would have to be replaced as lead plaintiff against the Town of Dryden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solidshale.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/analysis-is-there-a-seachange-on-fracking-in-new-york/|work=Solid Shale (blog)|title=Anschutz Quits Dryden Suit |last=Northrup|first=Chip|date=September 30, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.shaleshockmedia.org/2012/09/20/anschutzs-appeal-doa/|work=Shale Shock (blog)|title=Norse Energy as Zombie Plaintiff |last=Northrup|first=Chip|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seachange&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solidshale.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/analysis-is-there-a-seachange-on-fracking-in-new-york/|work=Solid Shale (blog)|title=Analysis: Is There a Seachange on Fracking in New York? |last=Cail|first=Krys|date=September 30, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Norse Energy's attorneys appear to be arguing that a "[[Utilitarianism|greater good]]" will come about if they are allowed to drill despite the local government's opportunity.&lt;ref name=Seachange /&gt;

On March 21, 2013, the Third Department issued their ruling in ''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', upholding the decision of the N.Y. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', ___ A.D.3d ____ (3d Dept. March 21, 2013) (docket 515227).&lt;/ref&gt;  For a unanimous court, Presiding Justice [[Karen A. Peters]] upheld the lower court's denial of [[intervenor]] status for the environmental group, DRAC, and the constitutionality of the Town of Dryden's zoning ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', slip op. at 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court allowed Norse Energy to be substituted for Anschutz.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', slip op. at 3, note 2, citing N.Y. CPLR 1018, 1021.&lt;/ref&gt;  "As a preliminary matter," they approved "Supreme Court's denial of DRAC's motion to intervene", based on the group's failing to prove "a substantial interest ... different from other residents of the Town."&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', slip op. at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, noting the Town could do a good job at defending its interests, instead granted ''[[amicus]]'' status to DRAC and a half dozen others.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', slip op. at 6, note 4, citing ''Matter of Pace-O-Matic, Inc. v. New York State Liquor Auth.'', 72 A.D.3d 1144, 1144 (3d Dept. 2010) and ''Quality Aggregates v. century Concrete Corp.'', 213 A.D.2d 919, 920-921 (3d Dept. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing the [[New York State Constitution]] and four [[New York Court of Appeals]] cases, the Third Department noted that the state's local governments have broad [[home rule]] powers under its state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', slip op. at 6-7, citing N.Y. Const. Article IX; ''DJL Rest. Corp. v. City of New York'', 96 N.Y.2d 91, 96 (2001), and three other cases.&lt;/ref&gt;  It agreed with the lower court that the local law is not pre-empted, either expressly or by implication.&lt;ref&gt;''Matter of Norse Energy Corp. USA v. Town of Dryden'', slip op. at 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2014, the New York Court of Appeals upheld the local zoning ordinances, as well as the lower court cases that had allowed them, in a 5-2 decision authored by Judge [[Victoria Graffeo]].&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of Mark S. Wallach, as Chapter 7 Trustee for Norse Energy Corp. USA, v. Town of Dryden'', cases 130 and 131 (2014), see [https://www.scribd.com/doc/231976936/063014-NYSCOA-Frack-Ban-Ruling slip opinion].

====Other cases====
In July 2012, Lenape Resources, a natural gas drilling company, threatened to sue state and local governments over a hydrofracking ban by the town of [[Avon (town), New York|Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Albany Times-Union''|page=A3|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=Driller threatens state over local shale gas bans|date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in July 2012, Justice Ferris Lebous ruled in the [[Broome County, New York]] case of ''Jeffrey v. Ryan'' that, while the city of [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] has the right to enact a local regulation, they did not enact a proper moratorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/MarcellusDN/ny-judge-ferris-lebous-ruling-against-binghamton-fracking-moratorium Decision on ''Jeffrey v.

===Administrative response===
While those appeals were pending, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in mid-June 2012 that Governor Cuomo and his staff were deliberating on a plan to restrict hydrofracking to five counties in the southern tier of New York, along the Pennsylvania border, where the Marcellus shale is deepest and drilling is least likely to pollute [[well water]] supplies in those [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref name="restricted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/nyregion/hydrofracking-under-cuomo-plan-would-be-restricted-to-a-few-counties.html?_r=1&amp;hp|last=Hakim|first=Danny|title=Cuomo Plan Would Limit Gas Drilling to a Few Counties in New York|publisher=''New York Times'' |date=June 13, 2012|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Drilling would not be allowed in these areas:
*New York City and its [[drainage basin|watershed]]
*Towns that have banned or not agreed to the practice (over 100 towns and villages have banned it, but several dozen have asked for it)
*The [[Catskill State Park]] (which is 'forever wild' under the [[New York State Constitution]])
*Areas of surface land directly over certain aquifers
*Land within [[National Historic Landmark District]]s.&lt;ref name="restricted" /&gt;
The ''[[Albany Times Union]]'' the next day filed a front-page, [[above the fold]] story questioning the plan's leak as a "[[trial balloon]]," which had quickly garnered both criticism and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Is-trial-balloon-full-of-shale-gas-3632650.php#ixzz1xnd7KzJ2|last=Karlin|first=Rick|title=Is trial balloon full of shale gas?: A report that Gov.

In August 2012, LeBrun filed a column that a limited plan was moving forward to allow hydrofracking in the Southern Tier, which he characterized as the "[e]nd of the anti-frack world."&lt;ref name=LeBrun2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/End-of-the-anti-frack-world-near-3763195.php|work=Albany Times Union|title=End of the anti-frack world near|last=LeBrun|first=Fred|date=August 4, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/143551/a-m-roundup-limited-hydrofracking-on-the-way/|work=Albany Times Union 'Capitol Confidential' blog|title=A.M.

|last=Coin|first=Glen|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wading through 60,000 comments, the [[New York Department of Environmental Conservation]] was looking at a "ramp up" period, allowing 50 wells in 2013, and 100 wells in 2014, and only in towns that want them.&lt;ref name=LeBrun2 /&gt;

Governor Cuomo's budget did not expect any revenues from hydrofracking in [[fiscal year]] 2012-2013.&lt;ref name=Gazette2 /&gt;  There was a study that indicates that New York lacks a state tax on gas production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/63145742/New-York-State-Gas-Production-Tax|title=New York State Gas Production Tax|work=scribd.com |last=Northrup|first=Jimmy|date=n.d.|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Martens]], the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|Commissioner of DEC]], has overall responsibility for regulating all hydrofracking programs.  Eugene Leff, his Deputy Commissioner for Remediation and Materials Management, has responsibility for "Materials Management, Environmental Remediation and Mineral Resources", which would include hydrofracking regulations, if any were to be released.  Bradley Field is the Director for "Management and regulation of mineral resource development [and] Oil &amp; Gas Regulation ... [to] Oversee permitting, compliance and enforcement of all regulated wells in New York."  All media and other press inquiries must go directly through Emily DeSantis, at Press Operations, who is the Department spokesperson and who issues all press releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/about/556.html|title=DEC Central Office Program Directory|last=|first=|date=n.d.|publisher=|work=[[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]]|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leff was one of the panelists on NYSBA's 2012 seminar on "Marcellus Shale: New Regulations and Challenges".&lt;ref name="Marcellus CLE" /&gt;

As of early 2014, administrative inaction lead to what the [[Sierra Club]] called a "[[de facto]] moratorium ... for new drilling of natural gas wells" in the State "using hydrofracking technology."&lt;ref name="Sierra 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Susan|work=Sierra Club Hudson/Mohawk Group|volume=48|issue=1|date=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Susan Lawrence, writing an [[open letter]] to the group, cited six reasons for the effective ban:
# The DEC had "not finalized" the environmental impact statement.
# Governor Cuomo and the DEC were waiting for the Department of Health to issue a report first.
# The state budget for [[Fiscal year|FY]] 2013-2014 had no funding for state employees to process the necessary applications.
# Cuomo had stated publicly that he would not decide on the issues until after the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2014|November election]].
# The ''Dryden'' and ''Middletown'' cases were pending before the New York Court of Appeals.
# The public had concerns in light of the recent increase in rail shipments of oil from hydraulically fractured [[Bakken formation]] wells in North Dakota through [[Upstate New York]].&lt;ref name="Sierra 2014"/&gt;

'''Open Invention Network''' ('''OIN''') is a [[patent]] non-aggression community that supports freedom of action in [[Linux]] as a key element of [[Open-source software|open source]] software. OIN acquires patents and licenses them royalty-free to its community members who, in turn, agree not to assert their own patents against Linux and Linux-related systems and applications.&lt;ref&gt;Cover Pages web site, [http://xml.coverpages.org/OIN-Announce.html ''Open Invention Network Collects Patents to Promote Royalty-Free Linux''], November 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Based in [[Durham, NC]], the company was founded on November 10, 2005 by [[IBM]], [[Novell]], [[Philips]], [[Red Hat]], and [[Sony]]. [[NEC]] subsequently became a Member. In December 2013, Google became a Member. In July 2016, it was announced that Toyota became a Member. On October 10, 2018, Erich Andersen announced that Microsoft joined as a licensee.&lt;ref&gt;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-joins-open-invention-network-to-help-protect-linux-and-open-source/&lt;/ref&gt; Canonical and TomTom are Associate Members.  Keith Bergelt is the chief executive of the company. Bergelt had previously served as President and CEO of Paradox Capital, LLC&lt;ref&gt;Open Invention Network web site, [http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/press_management.php ''Management Team'']. Consulted on June 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Invention Network has more than 1,300 U.S. and international patents and patent applications. It holds the [[Commerce One]] [[Web services]] patents (previously acquired by Novell for $15.5 million), which cover several fundamentals of current [[business-to-business]] [[e-commerce]] practice. OIN's founders intend for these patents to encourage others to join, and to discourage legal threats against Linux and Linux-related applications. As of October 2018, OIN had more than 2,650 community members (licensees).&lt;ref&gt;http://openinventionnetwork.com/press_release10_16_13.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of key applications considered by OIN, according to Red Hat's Mark Webbink,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Webbink in Linux Magazine, [http://www.linux-mag.com/id/2497 ''The Open Invention Network''], April 27th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; includes [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Novell Evolution|Evolution]], [[Fedora Directory Server]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[GIMP]], [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Mono (software)|Mono]], [[Mozilla]], [[MySQL]], [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]], [[OpenLDAP]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Open-Xchange]], [[Perl]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Samba (software)|Samba]], [[Security-Enhanced Linux|SELinux]], [[Sendmail]], and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].

On March 26, 2007, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] licensed OIN's portfolio, thus agreeing not to assert patents against the GNU/Linux-based environment, including competitors [[MySQL]] and [[PostgreSQL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Shankland |url=http://news.cnet.com/Oracle+bands+with+open-source+patent+group/2100-7344_3-6170717.html|title=Oracle bands with open-source patent group|publisher=[[News.com]]|accessdate=2007-03-27|date=2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; when used as part of a GNU/Linux system. Oracle exercised a Limitation Election on March 29, 2012. On August 7, 2007, [[Google]] also joined OIN as a licensee.&lt;ref&gt;InformationWeek, [http://www.informationweek.com/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201203579 ''Google To Join Group To Protect Linux From Possible Patent Challenge''], August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 2007, [[Barracuda Networks]] joined OIN as a licensee.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Asay, [http://www.barracudanetworks.com/ns/news_and_events/news.php?nid=340 ''Barracuda Networks: An unsung hero of open source and a new member of Open Invention Network''], barracudanetworks.com, In the News, October 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2009 [[TomTom]] joined OIN as a licensee.&lt;ref&gt;PRWEB, [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/03/prweb2253274.htm ''Open Invention Network Extends The Linux Ecosystem As TomTom Becomes Licensee''].&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the European Open Source software manufacturer [[Univention Corporate Server|Univention]] joined OIN as a licensee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2009, Open Invention Network acquired 30 patents, from [[Allied Security Trust]], another defensive patent management organization, that had been acquired from Microsoft through a private auction. If the patents had been acquired by patent trolls, they might have caused financial obstacles to Linux developers, distributors and users. OIN was able to avert this issue with the patent acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125236988735891147&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October, 2018, [[Microsoft]] joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/10/microsoft_open_invention_network/|title=Microsoft has signed up to the Open Invention Network. We repeat. Microsoft has signed up to the OIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways to participate with Open Invention Network==

Open Invention Network has three levels of participation, each of which helps to promote open source as a modality for invention and ensure ongoing freedom of action for GNU/Linux community members:

*'''Members''' — Open Invention Network receives significant financial backing from large companies. OIN's Members include Google, [[Microsoft]], IBM, NEC, Philips, Red Hat, Sony, [[SUSE]] and Toyota.
*'''Associate Members''' — Associate Members are recruited from Linux-related companies. Associate Members make a commitment to the Linux Community by virtue of their commitments to and membership in OIN and help to ensure that patent issues do not impair growth of Linux-based systems.
*'''Licensees''' — Any company or organization that agrees to refrain from using its patent portfolio against the Linux System may become an OIN licensee. Licensees benefit from royalty-free access to a valuable and growing portfolio of strategic patents, as well as from ongoing communication with OIN concerning Linux-related patent issues. In so doing, licensees facilitate their access to OIN resources such as Linux Defenders, which is designed to address patent issues with the potential to impact Linux. OIN licensees, be they founding members, associate members or licensees, contribute to an ever-expanding community of companies that share a common goal of ensuring freedom of action in and across the GNU/Linux ecosystem. Through their unified commitment to Linux, they limit the negative effect of patent-based challenges mounted by companies antagonistic to Linux and open source innovation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/open-invention-network-announces-associate-member-program-and-recruits-canonical-as-its-first-associate-member-2010-06-22?reflink=MW_news_stmp&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2010, OIN announced a new Associate Member program and the recruitment of Canonical (previously an OIN licensee) as its first associate member.&lt;ref&gt;OIN, [http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/press_release06_22_10.php ''Open Invention Network Announces Associate Member Program and Recruits Canonical As Its First Associate Member''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010116/http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/press_release06_22_10.php |date=2010-06-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement drew criticism from anti-software-patent activist and a European lobbyist [[Florian Müller (author)|Florian Müller]],&lt;ref&gt;TheRegister, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/22/canonical_oin_patent_defender/ ''Ubuntu daddy in patent class of its own'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniweb, [http://www.daniweb.com/news/story291830.html ''Canonical Assimilated by the OIN Borg'']&lt;/ref&gt; who had previously criticized&lt;ref&gt;ZDNet, [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/mueller-calls-oin-a-scam/6613 ''Mueller calls OIN a scam'']&lt;/ref&gt; the OIN for a lack of transparency and for defining arbitrarily the scope of the patent protection it offers. Florian Mueller's credibility in attacking OIN has been called into question due to his paid relationship with corporate sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/10/study-on-worldwide-use-of-frand.html] "Study on the worldwide use of FRAND-committed patents"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linux defenders==
OIN encourages practices that eliminate low-quality patents—the foodstuff of aggressive strategics and patent trolls.&lt;ref&gt;http://linuxdefenders.org/about&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, OIN encourages the Linux and open source communities to become active in:

*"[[Inter Partes Review]]", also known as “IPRs”, is a procedure for challenging the validity of an issued patent owned by a third party. By challenging patents with IPRs, the Linux and broader open source community can help to eliminate them. Unified Patents has successfully invalidated a number of patents using Inter Partes Review.&lt;ref&gt;http://unifiedpatents.com/unified-invalidates-claims-in-ipr-against-marathon-owned-vantage-point-technology/&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Third-Party Preissuance Submissions" provide for challenging the validity of a patent application.  They provide a mechanism for third parties to submit [[prior art]] of potential relevance to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] during the examination of another party’s patent application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/patent/initiatives/third-party-preissuance-submissions&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the Linux and broader open source community can help to eliminate patents, and particularly help to mitigate the issuance of new low-quality patents.  A patent application challenger may remain unnamed or anonymous by asking a firm to complete the Third-Party Preissuance Submission on its behalf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law360.com/articles/588491/7-things-to-know-about-3rd-party-submissions-of-art&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Defensive publication|Defensive publications]]" codify ‘known’ inventions that have not previously been patented so that they can be brought to the attention of the patent office to ensure that later developed patent applications claiming such inventions do not issue. Defensive Publications are a vehicle which allows the Linux and broader open source community to create valuable prior art that ensures future freedom-of-action / freedom to operate in the areas covered by them.  Many Defensive Publications can be searched for free in IP.com’s Prior Art Database.&lt;ref&gt;https://priorart.ip.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women''' (OP-CEDAW) is an international [[treaty]] which establishes complaint and inquiry mechanisms for the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW). Parties to the Protocol allow the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] to hear complaints from individuals or inquire into "grave or systematic violations" of the Convention. The Protocol has led to a number of decisions against member states on issues such as [[domestic violence]], [[parental leave]] and [[forced sterilization]], as well as an investigation into the [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|systematic killing of women]] in the Mexican city of [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]].

The Protocol was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 6 October 1999, and in force from 22 December 2000. As of September 2017, the Protocol has 80 [[Signature|signatories]] and 109 [[Ratification|parties]].&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cedaw.htm |publisher=UN OHCHR |accessdate=6 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825232556/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cedaw.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention outlawed discrimination against women,&lt;ref&gt;CEDAW, Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not include any mechanism by which this prohibition could be legally enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meron |first=Theodor |title=Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Prohibition of Discrimination Against Women |journal=American Journal of International Law |volume=84 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=213–217 |jstor=2203022 |doi=10.2307/2203022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual complaints mechanism was suggested during the original drafting of CEDAW, but was rejected at the time.&lt;ref name=gomez&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felipe Gómez Isa |title=The Optional Protocol for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: Strengthening the Protection Mechanisms of Women’s Human Rights |journal=Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=291–321 [305] |year=2003|url=http://www.ajicl.org/AJICL2003/vol202/Gomez.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifteen years later, the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] of the 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]] suggested that new procedures were needed to implement the Convention, and suggested a "[[right of petition]]".&lt;ref name="DAW-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/history.htm |title=CEDAW: History of the Optional Protocol |publisher=UN [[Division for the Advancement of Women]] |accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent expert group produced a draft in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kwong-leung Tang |editor-first=Caroline |editor-last=Sweetman |title=Women and leadership |publisher=Oxfam |year=2000 |pages=65–72 |chapter=The Leadership Role of International Law in Enforcing Women's Rights: The Optional Protocol to the Women's Convention  |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-85598-452-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a complaint procedure and an inquiry procedure, and this was adopted for further study by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in early 1995.&lt;ref name="CEDAW-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N96/179/04/IMG/N9617904.pdf?OpenElement |title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (Fourteenth Session) |publisher=UN CEDAW |date= |accessdate=28 July 2008 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an Optional Protocol was further endorsed by the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in 1995, which called for "the elaboration (of) a draft optional protocol to the Women's Convention that could enter into force as soon as possible."&lt;ref name="AI-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior51/008/2002/en/ |title=Claiming Women's rights: the Optional Protocol to the UN Women's Convention |publisher=Amnesty International |year=2001 |accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1996 the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] established an open-ended working group to produce a formal draft.&lt;ref name="AI-history"/&gt; This reported back after three years of deliberation in early 1999.  The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 54/4, 6 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women outlaws discrimination on the basis of gender, and obliges its parties to repeal discriminatory laws and guarantee equality in the fields of health, employment, and education.&lt;ref name=AI-history/&gt; The Optional Protocol is a subsidiary agreement to the Convention.  It does not establish any new rights, but rather allows the rights guaranteed in the Convention to be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/eng/Library/The-Optional-Protocol-to-CEDAW-its-applicability-on-the-ground |title=The Optional Protocol to CEDAW &amp; its applicability "on the ground" |publisher=Association for Women's Rights in Development |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 1–7 create an individual complaints mechanism similar to those of the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] and Article 14 of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]. Parties agree to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to consider complaints "by or on behalf of" individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Convention have been violated.&lt;ref name=Art1&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt; If a complaint is submitted on behalf of a victim, then this requires their consent, unless the submitter can justify acting without it.&lt;ref name=Art2&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes "justification" in such a case is up to the Committee.&lt;ref name=MacKinnon&gt;{{cite journal |title=CEDAW's Optional Protocol Procedures |last=MacKinnon |first=Catherine |journal=Interights Bulletin |volume=14 |issue=4 |year=2004 |pages=173–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability for complaints to be submitted on behalf of victims is seen as vital in allowing NGOs such as women's organizations and human rights groups to use the Protocol to enforce the Convention.&lt;ref name="AI-history"/&gt;

Complainants must have exhausted all domestic remedies, and anonymous complaints and complaints referring to events which occurred before the country concerned joined the Optional Protocol are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee can request information from and make recommendations to a party,&lt;ref&gt;OP-CEDAW, Articles 6 &amp; 7.&lt;/ref&gt; though these are not binding.&lt;ref name=Sokhi-Bulley&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bal Sokhi-Bulley |title=The Optional Protocol to CEDAW: First Steps |journal=Human Rights Law Review |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=157 |year=2006 |doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngi029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 8–10 create an inquiry mechanism. Parties may permit the Committee to investigate, report on and make recommendations on "grave or systematic violations" of the Convention.&lt;ref name=Art8&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee may invite the relevant party to respond and inform it of any measures taken as a result of such an inquiry, either directly or through the normal reporting process under the Convention.&lt;ref name=Art9&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties may opt out of this obligation on signature or ratification,&lt;ref&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt; but only Bangladesh, Belize, Colombia, Cuba and Tajikistan have done so.&lt;ref name=parties/&gt;

Article 11 requires parties to ensure that those complaining under the Optional Protocol are not subjected to ill-treatment or intimidation.&lt;ref name=Art11&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 13 requires parties to inform their citizens about the Convention, the Optional Protocol, and the rulings of the Committee, so as to facilitate complaints.&lt;ref name=Art13&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 12 and 14 govern the procedure&lt;ref name=Art14&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and reporting&lt;ref name=Art12&gt;OP-CEDAW, Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Committee in handling complaints.

Articles 15–21 govern ratification, [[entry into force]], and amendment of the Optional Protocol.

==Reservations and membership==

A number of parties have made [[Reservation (law)|reservations]] and interpretative declarations to their application of the Protocol.  [[Bangladesh]], [[Belize]] and [[Colombia]] have exercised their right under Article 10 of the Protocol not to recognise the jurisdiction of the Committee to investigate "grave or systematic violations" of the Convention.&lt;ref name=parties/&gt; Colombia declares that neither the Protocol nor the Committee can require it to decriminalise "offences against life or personal integrity".&lt;ref name=parties/&gt;

Not every state which is a party to CEDAW is a party to the Protocol, and several major states still remain outside the Protocol. The United States has not become a signatory because it has not yet ratified CEDAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aauw.org/About/international_corner/upload/CEDAWin-the-US.pdf |title=CEDAW in the United States |publisher=AAUW |accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan does not participate in any of the individual communications mechanisms for human rights treaties, but is currently considering joining while observing how these procedures are functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/AdvanceVersions/CEDAW-C-JPN-Q6-Add1.pdf |title=Responses to the list of issues and questions with regard to the consideration of the sixth periodic report: Japan (CEDAW/C/JPN/Q/6/Add.1) |date=14 April 2009 |publisher=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |accessdate=5 February 2010 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is currently "studying the problem of accession to
the Optional Protocol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/379/77/PDF/N0637977.pdf?OpenElement |title=Responses to the list of issues and questions for consideration of the combined fifth and sixth periodic report of China (CEDAW/C/CHN/Q/6/Add.1) |date=8 June 2006 |publisher=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |accessdate=4 February 2010 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual complaints==

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has considered eleven complaints against seven countries since the Optional Protocol came into force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/dec-views.htm |title=Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: Optional Protocol: Decisions/Views |publisher=UN [[Division for the Advancement of Women]] |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on subjects such as [[domestic violence]], [[division of property]], [[forced sterilization]] and [[parental leave]].  Six complaints were rejected for lack of jurisdiction or because the complainants had not exhausted all domestic remedies.  The other five decisions are summarised below:

In 2005, in the case of ''A.T. v. Hungary'',&lt;ref name="AT-v-Hungary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/docs/Case2_2003.pdf |title=Views of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 7, paragraph 3, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: Communication No.: 2/2003, Ms. A. T. v. Hungary |date=26 January 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee ruled that [[Hungary]] had violated numerous articles of the Convention by failing to adequately protect women against [[domestic violence]].  It recommended that the complainant be immediately protected from her abusive former partner, and that Hungary improve its handling of domestic violence cases and immediately adopt the Committee's previous recommendation for a law allowing protection and exclusion orders.&lt;ref name="AT-v-Hungary"/&gt; The recommendations were implemented by the time of Hungary's sixth periodic report to the Committee in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/402/22/PDF/N0640222.pdf?OpenElement |title=Sixth periodic report of Hungary under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |pages=50 |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, in the case of ''Dung Thi Thuy Nguyen v. The Netherlands'',&lt;ref name="DTTN-v-Netherlands"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/docs/Case3_2004.pdf |title=Views of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 7, paragraph 3, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: Communication No. 3/2004: Dung Thi Thuy Nguyen v. The Netherlands |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee expressed concerns about aspects of [[parental leave]] provisions in [[The Netherlands]]. It recommended the Dutch government collect further information on the number of women combining part-time salaried employment with self-employment, and review the law if this revealed that a significant number of women were disadvantaged.&lt;ref name="DTTN-v-Netherlands"/&gt;

In 2006, in the case of ''A.S. vs Hungary'',&lt;ref name="AS-v-Hungary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/decisions-views/Decision%204-2004%20-%20English.pdf |title=Views of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 7, paragraph 3, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: Communication No.: 4/2004, Ms. A. S. v. Hungary |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee ruled that the [[forced sterilization]] of a [[Romani people|Romani]] woman in Hungary violated the Convention.  It recommended compensating the complainant for the breach of her rights, a full review of legislation surrounding [[informed consent]] in cases of sterilisation to ensure it complied with international human rights standards, and ongoing monitoring of Hungarian medical facilities to ensure that any changes were put into practice.&lt;ref name="AS-v-Hungary"/&gt;

In 2007, in the cases of ''Şahide Goekce (deceased) v. Austria''&lt;ref name="SG-v-Austria"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/495/43/PDF/N0749543.pdf?OpenElement |title=Views of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 7, paragraph 3, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: Communication No. 5/2005: Şahide Goekce (deceased) v. Austria |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fatma Yildirim (deceased) v. Austria'',&lt;ref name="FY-v-Austria"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/495/37/PDF/N0749537.pdf?OpenElement |title=Views of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 7, paragraph 3, of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: Communication No. 6/2005: Fatma Yildirim (deceased) v. Austria |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee ruled that the Austrian government was failing to protect women from domestic violence.&lt;ref name="SG-v-Austria"/&gt; It recommended strengthening the implementation and monitoring of existing domestic violence laws and greater training for police.&lt;ref name="FY-v-Austria"/&gt;

==Inquiries==

The Committee has also conducted one inquiry into "grave or systematic violations" under Article 8, in relation to the [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|systematic killing of women]] in the Mexican city of [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]].&lt;ref name="Mexico-8"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw32/CEDAW-C-2005-OP.8-MEXICO-E.pdf |title=Report on Mexico produced by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention, and reply from the Government of Mexico |date=27 January 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This found "serious lapses in compliance"&lt;ref name="Mexico-8-p42"&gt;''Report on Mexico'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Mexican government and tolerance of severe and systematic abuses of women's rights.&lt;ref name="Mexico-8-p42"/&gt; The Committee recommended the involvement of federal as well as state authorities in the investigation of the murders,&lt;ref name="Mexico-8-p43"&gt;''Report on Mexico'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; the punishment of negligent or complicit officials and those involved in the persecution of victims' relatives,&lt;ref name="Mexico-8-p44"&gt;''Report on Mexico'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased violence prevention plans.&lt;ref name="Mexico-8-p46"&gt;''Report on Mexico'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and criticism==
The impact of an international treaty can be measured in two ways: by its acceptance, and by its implementation.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book |title=The U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |last=Lérner |first=Natán |publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff International |page=165 |year=1980 |isbn=90-286-0160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heyns |first1=Christof |last2=Viljoen |first2=Frans |title=The Impact of the United Nations Human Rights Treaties on the Domestic Level |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |volume=23 |pages=483–535 |year=2001 |doi=10.1353/hrq.2001.0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the first measure, the Optional Protocol has gained widespread international acceptance.  Most major states are parties, and the protocol is the second most-accepted enforcement mechanism after the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/research/research-projects/nchr/#tabs-2 |title=Nominal Commitments to Human Rights: A Global Survey |publisher=University College London School of Public Policy  |date=1 August 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As of December 2009, OP-ICCPR had 113 parties to OP-CEDAW's 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second measure, the number of complaints dealt with by the committee has been limited. A 2008 assessment for the UK government found that the protocol had hardly been used by NGOs as originally expected, that the reasoning of the Committee was unpredictable, and that it had not affected policy-making.&lt;ref name=murdoch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/un-optional-protocol-women.pdf |title=The Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW): The Experience of the United Kingdom |author=Jim Murdoch |page=1 |year=2008 |accessdate=17 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110322191207/http:/www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/un-optional-protocol-women.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that there had been some limited success in highlighting the importance of effective policies to protect women from domestic violence and forced sterilization, but that outside these areas, the protocol "has not led to a breakthrough in advancing women's rights."&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt; It concludes that unless greater efforts are made to highlight [[awareness raising|awareness]] of the Optional Protocol and build trust in the rulings of the Committee, the complaints mechanism will remain under-utilized.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch (2008), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The protocol has been criticised by legal academics such as Bal Sokhi-Bulley and feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] who view the complaints mechanism as difficult, lengthy,&lt;ref name=Sokhi-Bulley/&gt; and lacking [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]].&lt;ref name=MacKinnon/&gt;  The voluntary nature of the protocol and the non-binding nature of its "recommendations" are seen as key limits on its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Isa (2003), p. 320 – 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sokhi-Bulley (2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kwong-leung Tang |title=Internationalizing Women's Struggle against Discrimination: The UN Women's Convention and the Optional Protocol |journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1182 |year=2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bch135 |doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, these critics tend to view the protocol as a valuable, if flawed, instrument for realizing [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Isa (2003), p. 319 – 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sokhi-Bulley (2006), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang (2004), p. 1185.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7970">The '''Plant Variety Protection Act''' of 1970 (PVPA), 7 U.S.C. §§ 2321-2582, is an [[intellectual property]] statute in the [[United States]].  The PVPA gives breeders up to 25 years of exclusive control over new, distinct, uniform, and stable sexually reproduced or tuber propagated plant varieties.  A major expression of [[plant breeders' rights]] in the United States, the PVPA grants protection similar to that available through [[patents]], but these legal schemes differ in critical respects.  The PVPA should not be confused with [[Plant Patent Act|plant patents]], which are limited to asexually reproduced plants (not including tuber propagated plants).

==Basic provisions==

The PVPA confers a limited period of legal control to breeders of sexually reproduced or [[tuber]] propagated plant varieties.  In order to be eligible for a certificate under the PVPA, a plant variety must satisfy four requirements.  First, it must be ''new'', in the sense that propagating or harvested material has not been sold or otherwise disposed of for purposes of exploitation for more than one year in the United States, or more than four years in any foreign jurisdiction (or six years in the case of a tree or vine).  Second, the variety must be ''distinct''—that is, clearly distinguishable from any other publicly known variety.  Distinctness may be based on one or more identifiable morphological, physiological, or other characteristics, including commercially valuable characteristics affecting activities such as milling and baking (in the case of [[wheat]]).  Third, the variety must be ''uniform'', in the sense that any variations are describable, predictable, and commercially acceptable.  Finally, the variety must be ''stable'', in the sense that the variety, when reproduced, will remain unchanged with regard to its essential and distinctive characteristics within a reasonable degree of commercial reliability.

A plant variety certificate gives the breeder the right to exclude others from selling the variety, or offering it for sale, or reproducing it, or importing it, or exporting it, or using it in producing (as distinguished from developing) a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] or different variety.  The term of protection runs 20 years from the certificate's date of issue, or 25 years in the case of a tree or vine.

==Exemptions==

Unlike the [[Patent Act of 1952]], the PVPA contains three exemptions that significantly limit the scope of the plant breeder's [[exclusive right]].  First, the PVPA's provision safeguarding the "public interest in wide usage" allows the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to declare an otherwise protected variety open on the basis of equitable remuneration to the owner, upon a finding that no more than two years of [[compulsory licensing]] of a protected variety is necessary in order to insure an adequate supply of fiber, food, or feed and that the owner is unwilling or unable to meet public demand at a price which may reasonably be deemed fair.  Second, the PVPA's "research exemption" declares that the use and reproduction of a protected variety for plant breeding or other bona fide research shall not constitute infringement.

The PVPA's third exemption permits a farmer to save seed from protected varieties and to use such saved seed in the production of a crop without infringement.  Prior to 1994, this exemption also allowed farmers to sell such saved seed to others without infringement.  [[Asgrow Seed Company]] sued Denny and Becky Winterboer over the scope of this exemption. Asgrow won at District Court, and then lost at the Court of Appeals. The scope of the exemption to sell seeds was confirmed and defined by the 1995 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/513/513.US.179.92-2038.html 513 U.S. 179] (1995). In 1994, legislation to bring the PVPA into compliance with the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention also included amendments that eliminated the exemption for sales, but continued to allow farmers to save and replant seed on their own farms without infringement.

==Contrasting plant variety certificates, plant patents, and utility patents==

Plant variety certificates should not be confused with plant patents.  The Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) and the [[Plant Patent Act]] of 1930 provide protection based on different types of plant reproductive strategies.  The PVPA, which authorizes plant variety protection certificates, protects sexually reproduced and [[tuber]] propagated plants, whereas the Plant Patent Act, which authorizes plant patents, is limited to asexually reproduced plants, excluding tuber propagated plants.  However, the same plant may be protected under both the Plant Variety Protection Act and the Plant Patent Act of 1930. The most appropriate means of protection may be decided by the applicant based on the applicant's business requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ngwi.org/files/documents/%5BBLALOCK%5D%20USDA.pdf|title = USDA Invention Licensing and Plant Variety Protection|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Blalock|first = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plant may also be eligible for protection under the Patent Act of 1952, as long as patentability requirements are met.  Additionally, the same plant may be protected by a utility patent as well as a plant variety protection certificate and/or a plant patent.  The landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'', [[Case citation|447 U.S. 303]] (1980), suggested the possibility of securing utility patents on plants previously thought eligible solely for protection under the PVPA.  Two decades later, in the 2001 decision of ''[[J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc]].'', [[Case citation|534 U.S. 124]] (2001), the Court conclusively held that sexually reproduced plants eligible for protection under the PVPA are also eligible for utility patents.

==The PVPA and international law==

The Plant Variety Protection Act represents the United States' effort to comply with the ''Union pour la Protection des Obtentions Végétales'' (also known as UPOV or the [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]]), an international [[treaty]] concerning [[plant breeders' rights]].  The PVPA likewise constitutes part of the United States' compliance with the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] annex of the [[World Trade Organization]] treaty, also known as TRIPs.

A '''position of trust''' is any position that requires its holder to enjoy the trust of those who elected or chose the holder. It is often used in a more restricted sense defined by an organization or by legislation.

According to one common definition, it is any position that has responsibility for "cash, keys, or kids (minors)". The concept of "keys" refers to security, including IT security and management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policies.uga.edu/FA/nodes/view/1124/Background-investigations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unf.edu/hr/employment/Pre-Employment_Background_Checks.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another common definition, it is any position of authority over another person or within an organization, for example as a [[supervisor]].

Crimes committed by a person in a position of [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] may be penalized more severely under the law, and those wishing to occupy positions of trust may be subject to special restrictions such as background checks.

==Parties involved==
A typical position of trust at the personal level involves [[child custody]] or [[power of attorney]]. The same would be true for the five standard professions; medicine, law, finance, education and engineering. Any regulated profession dealing with the health and safety of others usually requires certification and licensing and would be a position of trust. The same would be true in the hierarchy of relationships involved in education, employment, financial matters and government.

==Sexual relations==
In the United Kingdom, the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|Sexual Offences Act 2000]] prohibits a person in a position of trust from performing sexual acts with someone who cannot consent, which includes minors and "very vulnerable people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/documents/UnderstandingSexualOffencesReform.htm |title=understanding sexual offense reform |publisher=Jubilee-centre.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily used for the protection of young people who are above the [[age of consent]] but under the age of 18 and for the protection of people with mental disabilities. Only after a person is no longer in a position of trust may they pursue a sexual relationship with a person previously entrusted to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13705/abuse-position-trust.html law.jrank.org]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1999/apr1999/gr_126545_1999.html G.R. No. 126545] retrieved 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, molestation by a person in a position of trust is also a criminal offence in [[Singapore]] punishable by imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lum|first1=Selina|title=Doctor fails in bid to have conviction relooked but is allowed to defer jail term|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/doctor-fails-in-bid-to-have-conviction-relooked-but-is-allowed-to-defer-jail|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, [[incest]] itself is not prosecutable,{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} but if an adult commits incest with a family member that is a minor, the adult can be prosecuted for abusing his/her position of trust. The adult family member does not have to be biologically related to the minor to be prosecutable for this offence. The relevant legislation also applies to adults who are family members only by marriage.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1757">A '''production quota''' is a goal for the [[Production (economics)|production]] of a [[good (economics)|good]]. It is typically set by a government or an organization, and can be applied to an individual worker, firm, industry or country. Quotas can be set high to encourage production, or can be used to restrict production to [[Price controls|support a certain price level]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Quotas, like other trade restrictions, are typically used to benefit the producers of a good at the expense of consumers in that economy. Possible effects include [[Political corruption|corruption]] (bribes to increase a quota allocation) or [[smuggling]] (concealed actions to exceed a quota). Quotas are considered to be less economically efficient than [[tariff]]s, which in turn are less economically efficient than [[free trade]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

*[[Common Agricultural Policy]] by the [[European Union]]

The '''Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Right Act, 2001''' ('''PPVFR Act''') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] that was enacted to provide for the establishment of an effective system for protection of [[Plant variety (law)|plant varieties]], the [[Plant breeders' rights|rights of farmers and plant breeders]], and to encourage the development and [[Horticulture|cultivation]] of new varieties of plants. This act received the assent of the [[President of India]] on the October 30, 2001.

The PPV&amp;FR Act, 2001 was enacted to grant intellectual property rights to plant breeders, researchers and farmers who have developed any new or extant plant varieties.  The Intellectual Property Right granted under PPV&amp;FR Act, 2001 is a dual right – one is for the variety and the other is for the denomination assigned to it by the breeder. The rights granted under this Act are heritable and assignable and only registration of a plant variety confers the right. Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant.  Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner. Farmers' varieties are eligible for registration and farmers are totally exempted from payment of any fee in any proceedings under this Act.  The period of protection for field crops is 15 years and for trees and vines is 18 years and for notified varieties it is 15 years from the date of notification under section 5 of Seeds Act, 1966. Annual fee has to be paid every year for maintaining the registration and renewal fee has to be paid for the extended period of registration. Farmers can claim for compensation if the registered variety fails to provide expected performance under given conditions.  The rights granted under this Act are exclusive right to produce, sell, market, distribute, import and export the variety.  Civil and criminal remedies are provided for enforcement of breeders' rights and provisions relating to benefit sharing and compulsory licence in case registered variety is not made available to the public at reasonable price are provided. Compensation is also provided for village or rural communities if any registered variety has been developed using any variety in whose evolution such village or local community has contributed significantly.  The procedural details and modes of implementing this Act are provided in PPV&amp;FR Rules, 2003.  In the present article, we are discussing some of the important legal provisions of this Act along with some of the case studies.

== Definition ==
According to sec 2(c), "breeder" means a person or group of persons or a farmer or group of farmers or any institution which has "bred, evolved or developed any variety."&lt;ref&gt;http://agricoop.nic.in/PPV&amp;FR%20Act,%202001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sec 2(k), "farmers" means any person who –
* "Cultivates [[crops]] by cultivating the land himself; or"
* "Cultivates crops by directly supervising the cultivation or land through any other person; or conserves and preserves, severally or jointly, with any other person any wild species or traditional varieties"; or
* "Adds value to such wild species or traditional varieties through selection and identification of their useful properties."

== Plant Genome Saviour Awards ==
The community of farmers who have engaged in conservation, improvement and preservation of genetic resources of economic plants and their wild relatives particularly in areas identified as agro-biodiversity hotspots are awarded annually from Gene Fund.  The name of the award is [http://www.plantauthority.gov.in/PGSFA.htm Plant Genome Saviour Community Award] and the amount is INR 10,00,000 for each community.  A maximum of five awards are conferred in a year.

The Authority also confers '''Plant Genome Savior "Farmer Reward" and "Farmer Recognition"''' to the farmers engaged in the conservation of genetic resources of landraces and wild relatives of economic plants and their improvement through selection and preservation and the material so selected and preserved has been used as donors of gene in varieties registerable under the PPV&amp;FR Act, 2001 (53 of 2001) [http://www.plantauthority.gov.in/pdf/GN_601.pdf].  There shall be maximum of 10 rewards (citation, momento and cash of INR to be decided by Central Government) and 20 recognitions (consisting of a citation and memento and cash award to be decided by Central Government) in a year.

The '''Royal Decree of 27 July 1887''' was a rule of law signed by King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] of [[Belgium]], the then private owner of the [[Congo Free State]], providing for the establishment of a monetary system for the free state and the introduction of a local currency, the Congolese franc, with a value set at 1/3100 of a kilo of 90% pure gold.

This decree was promulgated exactly 5 months after the ''Royal Decree of 27 February 1887 relating to commercial entities'', which provided a legal operating framework for establishing companies to perform acts of a commercial nature, and the actions taken by these companies, while conducting business in the Congo Free State. 

The present commercial law of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] can trace its origins to this decree.

'''Rudolf Berthold Schlesinger''' (1909 – November 10, 1996) was a [[German American]] legal scholar known for his contributions to the study of [[comparative law]], a discipline that examines the differences and similarities among the legal systems of nations.

== Biography ==

Schlesinger was the son of a [[lawyer]] and a relative of [[bankers]]. He was born in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in 1909. His father was American, which is why Schlesinger acquired dual citizenship per [[jus sanguinis]]. As he was growing up, he exhibited especial intellectual abilities, but also a great interest for sports and art. He completed his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[commercial law]], earning his degree in law from the [[University of Munich]] in 1933. He then worked as a lawyer for the bank that years before had been founded by his predecessors. He developed a background in finance while also helping German [[Jew]]s transfer their assets out of the country in order to escape [[Nazi]] persecution.

In 1938, with the Nazi party gaining strength, Schlesinger, who was Jewish, emigrated to the United States. Soon, he enrolled in the [[Columbia Law School]], where he became the first, and perhaps the only, non native English speaking editor of the [[Columbia Law Review]]. He graduated first in his class in 1942 and started working as an assistant to a [[New York Supreme Court]] judge. He briefly worked at [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]], a renowned New York law firm; however, in 1948 he moved into academia and started teaching in the [[Cornell Law School]], where he later became a professor of comparative law.

He also wrote important studies of [[civil procedure]] and international business transactions and directed a ten-year international research project on [[contract]]s.

In 1975 he left, as Professor Emeritus, and became a professor in the [[University of California]]'s [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|Hastings College of the Law]], until his retirement in 1995. Schlesinger and his wife, Ruth Hirschland Schlesinger, both died on November 10, 1996, in [[San Francisco, California]], an apparent double suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/22/us/rudolf-schlesinger-87-expert-on-the-world-s-legal-systems.html | work=The New York Times | title=Rudolf Schlesinger, 87, Expert On the World's Legal Systems | first=Wolfgang | last=Saxon | date=November 22, 1996 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schlesinger and comparative law ==

Schlesinger had an enormous impact on U.S. and European legal studies. Foremost was his pioneering 1950 book on comparative law, ''Comparative Law: Cases, Text, Materials'', which ultimately influenced two generations of readers.  His arrival in the field during the early 1950s helped to give it both greater legitimacy and popularity in legal academia. His book ''Comparative Law: Cases, Texts, Materials'' (1950), written while Schlesinger taught at [[Cornell University]], became a staple of law school curricula and entered its fifth edition in the late 1990s.

In 1955, working on behalf of the New York Law Revision Commission, he examined the important question of whether to codify commercial law. His study, "Problems of Codification of Commercial Law" (1955), paralleled the development of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. In 1995 the American Journal of Comparative Law published a tribute to Schlesinger that praised the brilliance of his "heroic work" and noted that its influence went beyond U.S. law: "Today's serious efforts to find and develop a unitary European private law is, consciously or unconsciously, a continuation of Schlesinger's effort."
In the 1960s Schlesinger launched the Cornell project on "Formation of Contract. A Study on the common core of legal systems" which deployed the entirely original methodology of the "factual approach" in comparative legal scholarship. The result of the Cornell seminars is a two-volume book published by Oceana in 1968 under Schlesinger's editorship. In 1993 Schlesinger's successor at Hastings Ugo Mattei together with Italian  comparativist [[Mauro Bussani]] launched the "Common Core of European Private Law Project" deploying the Cornell factual approach to study European contract, property and tort law. The results of the common core project that "on the shoulders os Schlesinger" involves some two hundred scholars from all over the world are published in an ongoing series at Cambridge University Press.

'''Sand''' is a [[granular]] material composed of finely divided [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[mineral]] particles. It is defined by size, being finer than [[gravel]] and coarser than [[silt]]. Sand can also refer to a [[Soil texture|textural class]] of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of terms in soil science.|date=1976|publisher=Agriculture Canada| location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0662015338|page=35|url=http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/1976-glossary/pub1459_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-[[tropical]] [[coastal]] settings is [[silica]] (silicon dioxide, or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), usually in the form of [[quartz]]. The second most common type of sand is [[calcium carbonate]], for example, [[aragonite]], which has mostly been created, over the past half billion years, by various forms of life, like [[coral]] and [[shellfish]]. For example, it is the primary form of sand apparent in areas where reefs have dominated the ecosystem for millions of years like the [[Caribbean]].

Sand is a non-renewable resource over human timescales, and sand suitable for making concrete is in high demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Constable|first1=Harriet|title=How the demand for sand is killing rivers|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-41123284|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=BBC News Magazine|date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

[[File:CoralPinkSandDunesSand.JPG|thumb|Sand from [[Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park]], [[Utah]]. These are grains of [[quartz]] with a [[hematite]] coating providing the orange color.]]
[[File:PismoBeachSand.JPG|thumb|Sand from [[Pismo Beach, California]]. Components are primarily [[quartz]], [[chert]], [[igneous rock]] and shell fragments.]]

The exact definition of sand varies. The scientific [[Unified Soil Classification System]] used in engineering and geology corresponds to US Standard Sieves,&lt;Ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/fi/cdrom/fao_training/fao_training/general/x6706e/x6706e11.htm Unified Soil Classification System]&lt;/ref&gt; and defines sand as particles with a diameter of between 0.074 and 4.75 millimeters. By another definition, in terms of [[particle size (grain size)|particle size]] as used by [[geologist]]s, sand particles range in diameter from 0.0625&amp;nbsp;mm (or {{Fraction|1|16}}&amp;nbsp;mm) to 2&amp;nbsp;mm. An individual particle in this range size is termed a ''sand grain''. Sand grains are between [[gravel]] (with particles ranging from 2&amp;nbsp;mm up to 64&amp;nbsp;mm by the latter system, and from 4.75&amp;nbsp;mm up to 75&amp;nbsp;mm in the former) and [[silt]] (particles smaller than 0.0625&amp;nbsp;mm down to 0.004&amp;nbsp;mm).  The size specification between sand and gravel has remained constant for more than a century, but particle diameters as small as 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm were considered sand under the [[Albert Atterberg]] standard in use during the early 20th century. The grains of sand in [[Archimedes]] [[Sand Reckoner]] written around 240 BCE, were 0.02 mm in diameter. A 1953 engineering standard published by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] set the minimum sand size at 0.074&amp;nbsp;mm. A 1938 specification of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Leonard Church, "Civil Engineering Handbook" McGraw-Hill Book Company (1959) p. 8-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand feels gritty when rubbed between the fingers. [[Silt]], by comparison, feels like [[flour]]).

[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14688 grades sands as fine, medium, and coarse with ranges 0.063&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.63&amp;nbsp;mm to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm.  In the United States, sand is commonly divided into five sub-categories based on size: very fine sand ({{Fraction|1|16}} – {{Fraction|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;mm diameter), fine sand ({{Fraction|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;mm – {{Fraction|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;mm), medium sand ({{Fraction|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;mm – {{Fraction|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;mm), coarse sand ({{Fraction|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;mm – 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and very coarse sand (1&amp;nbsp;mm – 2&amp;nbsp;mm). These sizes are based on the [[Particle size (grain size)|Krumbein phi scale]], where size in Φ = -log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D; D being the particle size in mm. On this scale, for sand the value of Φ varies from −1 to +4, with the divisions between sub-categories at whole numbers.

[[File:Volcanic sand (Perissa, Santorini, Greece).jpg|thumb|Close up of black volcanic sand from Perissa, [[Santorini]], Greece]]
The most common constituent of sand, in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings, is [[silica]] (silicon dioxide, or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), usually in the form of [[quartz]], which, because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness, is the most common [[mineral]] resistant to [[weathering]].

The composition of mineral sand is highly variable, depending on the local rock sources and conditions. The bright [[coral sand|white sands]] found in tropical and subtropical coastal settings are eroded [[limestone]] and may contain [[coral]] and [[Seashell|shell]] fragments in addition to other [[organism|organic]] or organically derived fragmental material, suggesting sand formation depends on living organisms, too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susanscott.net/Oceanwatch2002/mar1-02.html Seaweed also plays a role in the formation of sand]. Susanscott.net (1 March 2002). Retrieved on 24 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gypsum]] sand dunes of the [[White Sands National Monument]] in [[New Mexico]] are famous for their bright, white color. [[Arkose]] is a sand or [[sandstone]] with considerable [[feldspar]] content, derived from  [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] of a (usually nearby) [[granite|granitic]] rock outcrop. Some sands contain [[magnetite]], [[chlorite group|chlorite]], [[glauconite]] or [[gypsum]]. Sands rich in [[magnetite]] are dark to black in color, as are sands derived from volcanic [[basalt]]s and [[obsidian]]. [[Chlorite group|Chlorite]]-[[glauconite]] bearing sands are typically green in color, as are sands derived from [[basaltic]] [[lava]] with a high [[olivine]] content. Many sands, especially those found extensively in [[Southern Europe]], have [[iron]] impurities within the quartz [[crystals]] of the sand, giving a deep yellow color. Sand deposits in some areas contain [[garnet]]s and other resistant minerals, including some small [[gemstone]]s.

[[File:Pitted sand grains Western Desert.jpg|thumb|Pitted sand grains from the Western Desert, Egypt. Pitting is a consequence of wind transportation.]]
The study of individual grains can reveal much historical information as to the origin and kind of transport of the grain.&lt;ref&gt;Krinsley, D.H., Smalley, I.J. 1972. Sand. American Scientist 60, 286-291&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quartz sand]] that is recently weathered from [[granite]] or [[gneiss]] quartz crystals will be angular. It is called [[grus (geology)|grus]] in geology or ''sharp sand'' in the building trade where it is preferred for concrete, and in gardening where it is used as a soil amendment to loosen clay soils. Sand that is transported long distances by water or wind will be rounded, with characteristic abrasion patterns on the grain surface. Desert sand is typically rounded.

People who collect sand as a hobby are known as [[arenophile]]s.  Organisms that thrive in sandy environments are psammophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psammophile|title=Psammophile

* Railroads: [[Railroad engineer|Engine drivers and rail transit operators]] use sand to improve the traction of wheels on the rails.
* Recreation. Playing with sand is a favorite beach time activity. One of the most beloved uses of sand is to make sometimes intricate, sometimes simple structures known as sand castles. Such structures are well known for their impermanence. Sand is also used in children's play. Special play areas enclosing a significant area of sand, known as sandboxes, are common on many public playgrounds, and even at some single family homes. Sand dunes are also popular among climbers, motorcyclists and [[beach buggy]] drivers.

* [[Zoanthid]] "skeletons": Animals in this order of marine [[benthic]] [[cnidaria]]ns related to [[coral]]s and [[sea anemone]]s, incorporate sand into their [[mesoglea]] for structural strength, which they need because they lack a true skeleton.

==Resources and environmental concerns==
Only some sands are suitable for the construction industry, for example for making [[concrete]]. Because of the growth of population and of cities and the consequent construction activity there is a huge demand for these special kinds of sand, and natural sources are running low. In 2012 French director [[Denis Delestrac]] made a documentary called "[[Sand Wars]]" about the impact of the lack of construction sand. It shows the ecological and economic effects of both legal and illegal trade in construction sand.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sand-wars.com/ Sand Wars teaser] here.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The story of climate change gets star treatment|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=26 April 2014|pages=28–9|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229660.800?full=true|author=[[Simon Ings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://future.arte.tv/de/thema/straende-gefahr#article-anchor-1781 Strände in Gefahr?] Arte Future, last updated 23 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Sand's many uses require a significant [[dredging]] industry, raising environmental concerns over fish depletion, landslides, and flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres|first1=Aurora, et al.|title=The world is facing a global sand crisis|url=https://theconversation.com/the-world-is-facing-a-global-sand-crisis-83557|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=The Conversation|date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia ban sand exports, citing these issues as a major factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14588255|title=The hourglass effect|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=14 October 2009|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that the annual consumption of sand and gravel is 40 billion tons and sand is a US$70 billion global industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beiser|first1=Vince|title=The Deadly Global War for Sand|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/illegal-sand-mining/|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=Wired|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hazards ==
While sand is generally non-toxic, sand-using activities such as [[sandblasting]] require precautions. Bags of silica sand used for sandblasting now carry labels warning the user to wear respiratory protection to avoid breathing the resulting fine silica [[dust]]. [[Safety data sheet]]s for silica sand state that "excessive inhalation of crystalline silica is a serious health concern".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplot.com/industrial/silica/silica_msds.cfm Silica sand MSDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311043051/http://www.simplot.com/industrial/silica/silica_msds.cfm |date=11 March 2006 }}. Simplot (13 March 2011). Retrieved on 24 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas of high [[pore water pressure]], sand and salt water can form [[quicksand]], which is a [[colloid]] [[hydrogel]] that behaves like a liquid. Quicksand produces a considerable barrier to escape for creatures caught within, who often die from exposure (not from submersion) as a result.

== Manufactured sand ==
Manufactured sand (M sand) is sand made from rock by artificial processes, usually for construction purposes in cement or concrete. It differs from river sand by being more angular, and has somewhat different properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 5456819|year = 2016|last1 = Pilegis|first1 = M.|title = An Investigation into the Use of Manufactured Sand as a 100% Replacement for Fine Aggregate in Concrete|journal = Materials|volume = 9|issue = 6|pages = 440|last2 = Gardner|first2 = D.|last3 = Lark|first3 = R.|pmid = 28773560|doi = 10.3390/ma9060440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4098">A '''Special Advocate''' is a [[lawyer]], usually a [[barrister]] or [[advocate]], sometimes a [[solicitor]], who is appointed to represent the interests of a party in closed proceedings, i.e. proceedings from which that party has been excluded. Special advocates are generally prohibited from discussing any evidence that has been the subject of closed proceedings with the excluded party. They are most often used in the context of cases involving [[national security]] but have also been used in other matters, including parole board hearings and data protection claims.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]] Special advocates are lawyers independent of government and appointed by the Court to protect the interests of persons named in security certificates during the hearings from which persons named in certificates and their own lawyers are excluded. Special advocates are not, however, in a solicitor-client relationship with the person named in the certificate.  Special advocates have the required government security clearance for accessing information which the government must keep confidential because its disclosure would be injurious to national security or endanger a person's safety. Special advocates will be under strict obligations to maintain the confidentiality of that information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/sa-as/faq.html Frequently Asked Questions: Bill C-3 and Special Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Charkaoui that the security certificate provisions in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act were unconstitutional because the process violated the rights of persons named in a certificate to a fair hearing. The Supreme Court of Canada suspended the declaration of invalidity for one year to give Parliament time to amend the security certificate legislation. The Government responded to Charkaoui with Bill C-3. This legislation adds a special advocate regime to security certificate and related proceedings under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. It attempts to strike a balance between protecting the rights of persons named in a certificate and ensuring the confidentiality of information which, if disclosed, would be injurious to national security or endanger a person's safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/sa-as/faq.html Frequently Asked Questions: Bill C-3 and Special Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, Special Advocates have been authorised either by [[statute]] or by [[precedent]] to appear in closed proceedings before the [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]], [[Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission]], [[Employment Tribunal]], [[Northern Ireland Sentences Review Commission]], [[Northern Ireland Life Sentences Review Commission]] or special security tribunal (as defined by Sections 90 to 92 of the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=The operation of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) and the use of Special Advocates| url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmconst/323/32307.htm |periodical=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Constitutional Affairs Committee]]| volume=Seventh Report of Session 2004–05| issue=1| page=45| date=2005-04-03| id=HC 323-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Northern Ireland Act 1998| url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1998/47/ukpga/c47/partVIII |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| volume=1998| issue=47| pages=90–92| date=1998-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
Two special advocates were appointed in 2005 to represent Ahmed Zaoui, an Algerian asylum seeker who had been detained as a risk to national security, in a review carried out by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. The proceedings against Zaoui were subsequently withdrawn in 2007.

'''''Terry v. Ohio''''', 392 U.S. 1 (1968), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibition on unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] is not violated when a police officer stops a suspect on the street and frisks him or her without [[probable cause]] to [[arrest]], if the police officer has a [[reasonable suspicion]] that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime and has a reasonable belief that the person "may be armed and presently dangerous."

For their own protection, after a person has been stopped, police may perform a quick surface search of the person’s outer clothing for [[weapons]] if they have reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is armed. This reasonable suspicion must be based on "specific and articulable facts" and not merely upon an officer's hunch. This permitted police action has subsequently been referred to in short as a "stop and [[frisking|frisk]]," or simply a "''Terry'' frisk". The ''Terry'' standard was later extended to temporary detentions of persons in vehicles, known as [[traffic stop]]s; see [[Terry stop]] for a summary of subsequent jurisprudence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The rationale behind the Supreme Court decision revolves around the understanding that, as the opinion notes, "the [[exclusionary rule]] has its limitations." The meaning of the rule is to protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures aimed at gathering evidence, not searches and seizures for other purposes (like prevention of crime or personal protection of police officers).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Majority opinion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
[[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren's]] opinion for the Court began by reciting first principles. The Fourth Amendment protects "people, not places", against "unreasonable searches and seizures". The question the Court confronted was whether "in all the circumstances of this on-the-street encounter", Terry's reasonable expectation of privacy had been impermissibly invaded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The procedure called "stop and frisk" was controversial. Police argue that they require a certain flexibility in dealing with quickly evolving and potentially dangerous situations that arise during routine patrol of the streets. On the other hand, those suspicious of giving the police broad investigatory power contended that the police should not be able to assert their authority over citizens without some specific justification upon intrusion into protected personal security, coupled with judicial oversight to ensure that the police do not routinely abuse their authority. For the Court, however, the question was not the propriety of the police actions in the abstract but the admissibility of the evidence obtained through that police action. "In our system evidentiary rulings provide the context in which the judicial process of inclusion and exclusion approves some conduct as comporting with constitutional guarantees and disapproves other actions by state agents." For this purpose the [[exclusionary rule]] of ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|367|643|1961}}, had evolved and been applied against both state and federal agents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Thus the question was not whether the stop-and-frisk procedure was proper by itself, but whether the exclusionary rule was an appropriate deterrent of police misconduct during such encounters.  {{quote|Proper adjudication of cases in which the exclusionary rule is invoked demands a constant awareness of these limitations.  The wholesale harassment by certain elements of the police community, of which minority groups, particularly Negroes, frequently complain, will not be stopped by the exclusion of any evidence from any criminal trial. Yet a rigid and unthinking application of the exclusionary rule, in futile protest against practices which it can never be effectively used to control, may exact a high toll in human injury and frustration of efforts to prevent crime.|''Terry v. Ohio''|392 U.S. 1, 14–15}}  In view of these concerns, the Court next asked whether it is "always unreasonable for a policeman to seize a person and subject him to a limited search for weapons unless there is probable cause for an arrest."{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Concurring opinion of Justice White ==
[[Byron White|Justice White]] joined the opinion of the Court but suggested that

:"There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the streets. Absent special circumstances, the person approached may not be detained or frisked but may refuse to cooperate and go on his way. However, given the proper circumstances, such as those in this case, it seems to me the person may be briefly detained against his will while pertinent questions are directed to him. Of course, the person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest, although it may alert the officer to the need for continued observation."&lt;ref&gt;''Terry'', 392 U.S. at 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the lack of obligation to respond when detained under circumstances of ''Terry'', this opinion came to be regarded as persuasive authority in some jurisdictions, and the Court cited these remarks in dicta in ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}}, at 439. However, in ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'', {{ussc|542|177|2004}}, the Court held that neither of these remarks was controlling in a situation where a state law required a detained person to identify himself. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas==
[[William O. Douglas|Justice Douglas]] strongly disagreed with permitting a stop and search absent probable cause:

:"We hold today that the police have greater authority to make a 'seizure' and conduct a 'search' than a judge has to authorize such action. We have said precisely the opposite over and over again."&lt;ref&gt;''Terry'', 392 U.S. at 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"To give the police greater power than a magistrate is to take a long step down the totalitarian path. Perhaps such a step is desirable to cope with modern forms of lawlessness. But if it is taken, it should be the deliberate choice of the people through a constitutional amendment."&lt;ref&gt;''Terry'', 392 U.S. at 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
{{More citations needed|date=November 2018}} 
''Terry'' set precedent for a wide assortment of [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] cases. The cases range from street stop-and-frisks to traffic stops in which pat-down searches could be conducted on the driver or passengers.  In ''[[Michigan v. Long]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Michigan'', 463 U.S. 1032 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that car compartments could be constitutionally searched if an officer had reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous. Thus the compartments are viewed as an extension of the suspect's person. This is known as "frisking the lunge area," as an officer may protect himself by searching any areas from which the suspect could grab a weapon.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The ''Terry'' doctrine was markedly extended in the 2004 case of ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'', {{ussc|542|177|2004}}, in which the Supreme Court held that a state law requiring the suspect to identify himself during a ''Terry'' stop did not necessarily violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibitions of unreasonable searches and seizures or the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] privilege against self-incrimination (although potentially could if the citizen in question reasonably believed that such identification could be used to incriminate). The Court did not legalize this process in all states but instead left it up to the states to decide whether they would pass such laws. So far 24 states have passed such laws.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The Court most recently cited ''Terry v. Ohio'' in ''[[Arizona v. Johnson]]''. In that 2009 case, the Court ruled 9–0 in favor of further expanding ''Terry,'' granting police the ability to frisk an individual in a stopped vehicle if there is reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is armed and dangerous. This fulfills only the second prong of ''Terry'' (the first prong—reasonable suspicion that a crime has, is, or will be committed—is fulfilled by whatever traffic violation prompted the pull-over). According to ''[[Whren v. United States]]'', any traffic violation, no matter how small, is legitimate basis for a [[traffic stop]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In ''[[Heien v. North Carolina]]'', on a 8–1 decision in December 2014, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] expanded the reasonable suspicion factor of the [[Terry stop]] to cover a police officer’s reasonable [[mistake of law]] that gives rise to "reasonable suspicion" that justifies a traffic stop under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;SCOTUSblog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oyez, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">In the [[United States|U.S.]], '''Part 97''' is the section of [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) [[law|rule]]s and [[regulation]]s that pertains to [[amateur radio]] and the conduct of [[amateur radio operators]]. It is a part of [[Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations|Title 47]] of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR).

== Subparts ==

Part 97 consists of six subparts (A through F) and two appendices.

=== A. General Provisions ===

Subpart A contains fifteen sections, numbered 97.1–29.

Subpart A defines a number of terms relevant to the provisions of Part 97, and establishes the amateur service as a "voluntary, noncommercial communications service" devoted to advancement of the amateur art, the skills associated with it, and the international goodwill that it brings, especially with regard to the provision of emergency communications. It also establishes the basic constraints and rights that pertain to amateur licensing and conduct, including licensing requirements and limitations on station equipment and power output.

=== B. Station Operating Standards ===

Subpart B contains eleven sections, numbered 97.101–121.

Subpart B details the standards of communication conduct expected of amateur operators, including the types of transmissions authorized and prohibited by the FCC, limitations pertaining to third-party and international communications, and on-air station identification requirements.

Among other limitations, this section forbids the transmission of "music using a phone emission," except incidentally during authorized rebroadcasting of signals from a U.S. government space station (typically communications from the [[Space Shuttle]]).

=== C. Special Operations ===

Subpart C contains eleven sections, numbered 97.201–221.

Subpart C details rules and regulations pertaining specifically to a number of special operating procedures, including auxiliary and repeater stations, message forwarding, communications between earth and space stations, telecommand and the transmission of coded telemetry data, and automatic station control.

=== D. Technical Standards ===

Subpart D contains nine sections, numbered 97.301–317.

Subpart D sets forth all requirements pertaining to amateur radio frequency allocations, the [[List of amateur radio modes|emission modes]] allowed, and the technical standards according to which they may be used.

=== E. Emergency Communications ===

Subpart E contains four sections, numbered 97.401–407.

Subpart E supports the service of amateur radio operators in times of disaster by establishing basic standard operating procedures to use in case an emergency should occur. Primarily, it authorizes ''any'' use of radio technology for the "immediate safety of human life and immediate protection of property," regardless of all other FCC regulations, when no alternative is available. It also establishes the [[Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service]] (RACES), a civil defense communications service intended for activation in times of war or threat to national security.

=== F. Qualifying Examination Systems ===

Subpart F contains thirteen sections, numbered 97.510–527.

Subpart F lays out the examination and certification systems whereby amateur radio operators are licensed. This includes outlining the structure and conduct of [[Volunteer Examiner Coordinator]]s (VECs), organizations that accredit and organize the volunteer examiners (VEs) who administer test elements to prospective licensees.

=== Appendices ===

Part 97 has two appendices:

*Appendix 1: Places Where the Amateur Service is Regulated by the FCC
*Appendix 2: VEC Regions

The '''Transport Integration Act 2010''' (the Act)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/BC2280585B69A291CA2577910008AF32/$FILE/10-6a010.pdf Official version of the Act available at the Victorian Government legislation web site]&lt;/ref&gt; is a law enacted by the [[Parliament of Victoria|Parliament of the State of Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The Act is the prime transport [[statute]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], having replaced major parts of the ''[[Transport Act 1983]]'', which was renamed as the ''[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/7BB774D3E0245B77CA2577CE00030B90/$FILE/83-9921a153.pdf%20 Official version of the Act]. This Act was renamed by the Transport Integration Act. It is now titled the '''[[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the Transport Integration Act is to "...create a new framework for the provision of an integrated and sustainable transport system in Victoria...".&lt;ref&gt;See section 1 of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act broadly seeks to unify all elements of the Victorian transport portfolio to ensure that transport and land use agencies work together towards the common goal of an integrated and sustainable transport system.

In essence, the Transport Integration Act sets out the policy framework for transport in Victoria and establishes and sets the charters of the key agencies who make decisions which affect the planning and operation of the State's transport system.

One commentator has opined that "(T)he Act is a leading example of modern and progressive principles-based legislation. It marked a fundamental shift away from detailed, prescriptive rules to higher level guidance and more flexible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;David Withington, ''The Transport Integration Act: a major change for the transport portfolio, but why should planners take notice?'', Planning News, Volume 37, No. 10, November 2011, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The Transport Integration Act is administered by the Minister for Public Transport, the [[Jacinta Allan|Hon Jacinta Allan MLA]], and the Minister for Ports and Minister for Roads, the [[Luke Donnellan|Hon Luke Donnellan MLA]].

[[Image:Melbourne airport control tower and united B747.jpg|thumb|Shot of the airport control tower and a United B747 at [[Melbourne Airport]].  Transport to and from the airport is currently only available by car or bus. The absence of an integrated rail link has been a matter of public debate in Victoria in recent years. ]]

The policy area of the Act contains a vision, objectives and principles for the transport system in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]],&lt;ref&gt;See Part 2 of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt; making it clear that the transport system needs to be integrated and sustainable - in economic terms, in environmental terms and in social terms.   The Act therefore establishes transport in Victoria as a [[triple bottom line]] issue.

The Act also consolidates and establishes most of the transport agencies in Victoria&lt;ref&gt;See Parts 3 and 5 - 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and applies its policy framework to those agencies and other non transport interface agencies whose planning and land use activities can have significant effects on the transport system.

== Planning ==

While comprehensive coverage of transport portfolio matters can be expected of a transport statute the most radical feature of the Transport Integration Act may be its reach into planning activities which are not administrated by transport agencies but which nonetheless can have a major impact on the transport system.   Withington observed that "(F) for the first time, the scope of the State's principal transport statute reaches beyond transport agencies to include "interface bodies" such as planning authorities and land managers".&lt;ref&gt;David Withington, ''The Transport Integration Act: a major change for the transport portfolio, but why should planners take notice?'', Planning News, Volume 37, No. 10, November 2011, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also requires the development of a transport plan for Victoria and requires that the plan be periodically revised.&lt;ref&gt;See Part 4 of the Act.  The Act initially adopted the Brumby Government's [[Victorian Transport Plan]] as the first plan.  However, the defeat of that Government and the subsequent abandonment the Victorian Transport Plan led to the requirement being made generic by amendments made by the Transport Legislation Amendment (Public Transport Development Authority) Act 2011. The change commenced on 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also requires transport agencies regulated by the Act to prepare corporate plans and to coordinate them with the central [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] and other affected transport agencies.&lt;ref&gt;See section 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

Withington observed that "(T) the Act is designed to encourage people to think - in a structured way - about the impacts of their decisions on the transport system.  It is detailed enough to provide clear direction, but also flexible enough to accommodate agencies' different roles and responsibilities and a wide range of different circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;David Withington, ''The Transport Integration Act: a major change for the transport portfolio, but why should planners take notice?'', Planning News, Volume 37, No. 10, November 2011, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parts ==
[[File:Port-of-melbourne-freight-train.jpg|thumb|A train loaded with containers at Swanson Dock East at the [[Port of Melbourne]].  Legislation like the Transport Integration Act and its underlying policy framework seeks to prompt State and local government agencies to improve transport and land use integration.  Future Government policies and projects can be expected to result in improved rail connectivity at places like [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria's]] ports. ]]

The Transport Integration Act is divided into eight parts -
# Preliminary
# Vision statement, Objectives, Principles and Statements of Policy Principles
# Administration (Ministers, [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]], the Secretary, the Transport Infrastructure Development Agent)
# Planning (Transport plan, Corporate plans)
# Transport System Agencies ([[Director of Public Transport]], [[Public Transport Development Authority]], [[VicRoads|Roads Corporation]], [[Taxi Services Commission]])
# Transport Corporations ([[VicTrack|Victorian Rail Track]], [[V/Line|V/Line Corporation]], Linking Melbourne Authority, [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]], Port of Hastings Development Authority, Victorian Regional Channels Authority)
# Transport Safety Agencies ([[Director, Transport Safety]] and [[Chief Investigator, Transport Safety]])
# General

== Coverage ==
The coverage of the Act is broad and extends to all State-controlled transport activities including most land and water-based transport and some air transport activities.

=== Transport system activities ===
The Act applies to most State transport agencies and their activities through its coverage of Victoria's "transport system".&lt;ref&gt;See definition of "transport system" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;   Accordingly, it applies&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of "transport system" in section 3, in particular paragraph (a).&lt;/ref&gt; to things such as -

* heavy and light rail systems including [[trains]] and [[trams]]
* [[roads]] and [[vehicles]] including [[cars]], [[truck]]s and [[bicycles]]
* [[port]]s and waterways including commercial [[ships]]&lt;ref&gt;Note, some shipping matters are controlled by the Commonwealth under legislation such as the Navigation Act 1912.  Other matters are within the jurisdiction of States such as [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] through Acts such as the Transport Integration Act and other statutes like the Marine Act 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and recreational vessels
* air transport systems&lt;ref&gt;Note, many air transport regulation matters are controlled by the Commonwealth Government.  The Transport Integration Act would apply, for example, to planning controls at some [[airports]] and in respect of transport connections to other airports by road and rail.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Transport system" is defined widely to include not only system infrastructure and conveyances, but also such things&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of "transport system" in section 3, in particular paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).&lt;/ref&gt; as -

* communication systems and other technologies
* strategic, business and operational plans
* schedules, timetables and ticketing systems
* labour components
* service components.

The Act's coverage of the transport system is therefore extensive.  This occurs because "(T) the (Act) recognises that a 21st century transport system should be conceived and planned as a single system performing multiple tasks rather than separate transport modes.

=== Land use and other activities affecting transport ===
The Transport Integration Act also seeks to integrate land use and transport planning and decision-making by extending the framework to land use agencies whose decisions can have significant impact on transport.&lt;ref&gt;See definition of "interface body" in section 2 of the Act.  The broad definition of the "transport system" in section 3 is equally relevant to the activities of these agencies.  See also section 25 of the Act regarding its application to interface bodies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the Act can apply to the activities of a range of [[planning]], [[land use]] and other agencies.  Generally, the Transport Integration Act "...provides that planning authorities must have regard to the policy framework when preparing a Planning Scheme Amendment...which is 'likely to have a significant impact on the planning system' ".&lt;ref&gt;David Withington, ''The Transport Integration Act: a major change for the transport portfolio, but why should planners take notice?'', Planning News, Volume 37, No. 10, November 2011, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overarching status of Act ===
The Transport Integration Act has an overarching status in the hierarchy of Victoria's transport [[legislation]].  All other Victorian transport laws, including those relating to particular aspects of the regulation of [[trains]], [[trams]], [[roads]], [[port]]s, transport projects and [[safety]], are identified as "transport legislation" under the Act&lt;ref&gt;See definition of "transport legislation" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore captured by the framework and are subordinate to it.

The Act also sits above "interface legislation" in its application to interface bodies.&lt;ref&gt;See definition of "interface legislation" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the Act captures the enabling legislation which creates and empowers the non transport agencies who have a significant impact on the transport system and requires those agencies to have regard to the key policy elements in the Act needed to guide sound transport and land use planning.

== Affected agencies ==

=== Transport agencies ===

The project includes a rail bypass of [[Wodonga]] and track upgrades between [[Melbourne]] and [[Albury-Wodonga]] to improve interstate rail freight and passenger services links.  ]]

The transport decision makers and agencies established and empowered by the Transport Integration Act include -

* Ministers (currently the Minister for Public Transport, the Minister for Roads and the Minister for Ports)
* the Secretary of the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]]
* the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]]
* the Transport Infrastructure Development Agent
* the [[Director of Public Transport]]
* the [[Victorian Public Transport Development Authority|Public Transport Development Authority]]
* the [[Taxi Services Commission]] (initially conducting the [[Taxi Industry Inquiry]])
* the Roads Corporation ([[VicRoads]])
* Victorian Rail Track ([[VicTrack]])
* [[V/Line|V/Line Corporation]]
* the Linking Melbourne Authority
* the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]]
* the [[Port of Hastings Development Authority]]
* the Victorian Regional Channels Authority
* the [[Director, Transport Safety]]
* the [[Chief Investigator, Transport Safety]]
* the Regional Rail Link Authority&lt;ref&gt;This agency was added on 28 October 2010 by Order made under the Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act requires Victorian transport agencies - including the [[Director of Public Transport]], the [[Public Transport Development Authority]], [[VicRoads]], [[Port of Melbourne Corporation|the Port of Melbourne Corporation]], [[VicTrack]], [[V/Line]] and the Linking Melbourne Authority – to work collaboratively towards the common goal of an integrated and [[sustainable transport]] system.

=== Private transport operators ===
The Act does not apply directly to the private entities contracted to provide metropolitan [[passenger rail]] and [[tram]] services in Victoria, nor does it apply to metropolitan and regional [[bus]] operators.  However, State transport agencies must have regard to the framework under the Act when exercising statutory functions in relation to these private transport operators (including contract management).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, section 67 (1)(e) of the Act which provides that the [[Director of Public Transport]] has as one of his or her functions the "...entering and managing [[contracts]] for passenger services and other ancillary or incidental transport services..." (paragraph (i)).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interface agencies ===
The interface decision makers and agencies affected by the Transport Integration Act include -

* relevant Victorian Government Ministers including the Minister for Planning
* the Department of Planning and Community Development
* the Growth Areas Authority
* the Department of Sustainability and Environment
* [[Parks Victoria]]
* Major Projects Victoria
* [[Places Victoria]], formerly VicUrban
* [[Local Government Areas of Victoria|municipal councils]]

The Act requires that the interface agencies, including [[land use]] agencies, take account of the new Act and its policy directions when making decisions that are likely to have a significant impact on the [[transport system]].&lt;ref&gt;See section 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, the Transport Integration Act also supports and assists the development, implementation and updating of a transport plan for the State.&lt;ref&gt;See Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy framework ==

=== General ===
The centrepiece of the Transport Integration Act is the high level [[policy framework]] contained in Part 2.  The key features of the policy framework are a vision for the [[transport system]], six transport system objectives and seven decision making principles.  The core of the policy framework is drawn from the principles of [[sustainability]] as applied to the transport sector.  The framework recognises that transport is part of a broader policy [[goal]] of achieving [[sustainable development]], both locally and globally.

=== Sustainability ===
[[Image:Tram-and-trains-in-melbourne.jpg|thumb|Trams pass trains on the [[Flinders Street Viaduct]] in the Melbourne CBD.]]
In general, the policy framework in the Act adopts the core principles of sustainable development or sustainability and translates that policy into a contemporary and enforceable legislative form in a transport context.

=== Transport system objectives ===
[[Image:401-bus-north-melbourne.jpg|thumb| The route 401 prepaid shuttle from [[North Melbourne railway station]] to the [[University of Melbourne]] provides an innovative example of transport integration. However, community pressure exists in Melbourne for more permanent improvements to passenger transport including construction of the [[Melbourne Metro Rail Project|Melbourne Metro]] project, a planned metropolitan rail tunnel.  The tunnel is proposed to travel from [[South Kensington railway station]] (north west of the [[Melbourne CBD]]) to [[Caulfield railway station]] (in the south east).  The proposal was announced in December 2008 as part of the former Victorian State Government's [[Victorian Transport Plan]] but is unfunded.  Its current status is unclear.]]

==== Overview ====
The transport system objectives in the Transport Integration Act cover the following matters&lt;ref&gt;In sections 8-13.&lt;/ref&gt; -
* social and economic inclusion
* economic prosperity
* [[environmental sustainability]]
* integration of transport and land use
* efficiency, coordination and reliability
* [[safety]] and health and wellbeing.

The objectives therefore draw heavily on the key sustainability concepts described above.  Agencies must have regard to the objectives when they make decisions or exercise functions which are sourced back to the authority of the Act.

==== The need for objectives ====
The objectives essentially describe the outcomes sought to be achieved by the scheme.  The need for clear and consistent objectives in policy and legislation settings for transport in Victoria was recognised by both the [[Transport Legislation Review]] and the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission (VCEC), the latter as part of its final report on managing transport congestion in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;''Making the right choices:  Options for managing transport congestion'' - Final Report September 2006  - Victorian Government 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;   VCEC observed that -

::"The government’s congestion policy priorities need to be supported by clear legislative objectives. If the legislation covering organisations charged with delivering the government’s priorities does not reinforce its policy goals, agencies’ authority to deliver on those goals can be undermined.  This is true for most transport policy areas, but particularly so for congestion where the legislation must support a coordinated  approach across many agencies if congestion is to be effectively addressed."&lt;ref&gt;''Making the right choices:  Options for managing transport congestion'' - Final Report September 2006  - Victorian Government 2006 - page 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

VCEC commented on the failure of the previous central Victorian Government transport statute, the [[Transport Act 1983]], to set out clear objectives for the transport system and transport agencies: "...the Act does not include a statement of its purpose or objectives to guide interpretation and decision making.  Notwithstanding the absence of express objectives in the Transport Act, this and other Acts state the legislative objectives and functions for the key government agencies involved in transport policy development and service delivery."&lt;ref&gt;''Making the right choices:  Options for managing transport congestion'' - Final Report September 2006  - Victorian Government 2006 - page 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

VCEC went on to recommend the development of clear and coordinated objectives to apply across the transport portfolio:  "(H) having appropriate high level objectives that ‘cascade’ down into related objectives for each agency is a prerequisite for achieving the government’s desired outcomes for the transport sector. Such objectives can encourage agencies to work consistently to achieve these outcomes, and reduce the risk of inconsistent behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;''Making the right choices:  Options for managing transport congestion'' - Final Report September 2006  - Victorian Government 2006 - page 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision making principles ===

==== Overview ====
The decision making principles in the Transport Integration Act cover the following matters&lt;ref&gt;In sections 15-21.&lt;/ref&gt; -
* integrated decision making
* [[triple bottom line]] assessment
* equity
* transport system user perspective
* [[precautionary principle]]
* [[stakeholder engagement]] and community participation
* transparency.

==== Purpose ====
The decision making principles essentially describe the process elements which must be taken into account by agencies in pursuing the objectives of the scheme and ultimately, the vision for the transport system.  For example, a transport decision which has impacts across all tiers of government - local, State and national - should have regard to an integrated decision making process where due regard is had for effects across all three tiers rather than concentrating on only one or two tiers.

=== Applying the framework ===
[[File:Melbournebikeshare station Macarthur St 2010.jpg|thumb|Melbourne Bike Share station on Macarthur St beside a tram line near the Parliament Railway station.]]
In broad terms, transport agencies and interface agencies caught by the Act must have regard to the objectives and principles when exercising their powers and performing their functions.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 24 and 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework recognises that many transport system decisions involve competing interests and that decisions are unlikely in many cases to satisfy all parties.  This is inherent in the listing of a series of objectives and principles which involve deliberate overlap and tension and which can require careful thought to reconcile.   As a result, the Act merely requires that agencies "have regard" to the matters - that is actively consider them - and does not attempt to prescribe particular outcomes in individual cases.  In addition, the framework specifically provides that the weight to be given to each objective and principle in the Act is not prescribed by the scheme itself and instead is ultimately a matter to be determined by the relevant agency which is responsible for the decision.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 26 and 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect of the framework ===
The vision statement in the Act is drawn on in the purpose of the Transport Integration Act.&lt;ref&gt;See section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vision statement and transport system objectives are also relevant to the charters and therefore the legal powers of each transport agency established under the Act.

Each transport agency is required to pursue its statutory object consistent with the vision and the objectives.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see section 137 which contains the primary object of the Linking Melbourne Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; By way of example, if a transport agency is considering establishing a new transport service such as a rail line or bus line and procuring new rolling stock or buses, it must explicitly turn its mind to the matters in Part 2 of the Act as early as the planning stages of such a project.  Planning agencies have the same obligations.

Adherence to the Act can generally be pursued through [[administrative law]] avenues including merits review&lt;ref&gt;Link to Administrative Review Council summary of "merits review" - http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/arcHome.nsf/Page/FAQS#a6&lt;/ref&gt; in some cases.  However, the Act does not create a civil cause of action.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Integration Act 2010, section 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the Act ==
The underlying [[policy]] for the Transport Integration Act was in development for some years before it was presented to the [[Victorian Parliament]] as a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] for scrutiny, debate and passage.

=== Process ===
In 2007, after several years work the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] released a [[discussion paper]] outlining a policy proposal for a new Transport Integration Bill for Victoria.  An extensive stakeholder consultation process followed throughout [[Melbourne]] and regional [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].   The ''Transport Legislation Review: Stakeholder Feedback Summary''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/$UNIDS+for+Web+Display/4587CE393D780AF3CA25741700020969/$FILE/TLR-StakeholderFeedbackSummaryWEB.pdf An online copy of this document is available at the Department of Transport website]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to reflect the key views held by stakeholders.   Released in 2008, it drew on formal submissions as comments made at workshops, forums and briefings during the [[community engagement]] program.

The two-year [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] and community consultation process informed the development of the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] proposal, culminating in the release in July 2009 of the Policy Statement ''Towards an integrated and sustainable transport future: a new legislative framework for transport in Victoria''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/$UNIDS+for+Web+Display/336EB666427AE28FCA25760200221400/$FILE/Towards%20an%20integrated%20and%20sustainable%20transport%20future%20WEB.pdf An online copy of this document is available at the Department of Transport website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles-based approach ===
The policy areas of the Transport Integration Act provide an example of principles-based legislation.  This type of legislation relies on broad principles to articulate the outcomes to be achieved by the regulated entities.  The Australian Law Reform Commission has described this approach in the following terms -

::"Principles-based regulation can be distinguished from rules-based regulation in that it does not necessarily prescribe detailed steps that must be complied with, but rather sets an overall objective that must be achieved. In this way, principles-based regulation seeks to provide an overarching framework that guides and assists regulated entities to develop an appreciation of the core goals of the regulatory scheme. A key advantage of principles-based regulation is its facilitation of regulatory flexibility through the statement of general principles that can be applied to new and changing situations."&lt;ref&gt;''For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice'' (ALRC Report 108), Australian Law Reform Commission, May 2008, Vol 1, section 4.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parliamentary approval ==

=== Transport Integration Bill ===
The [[Act of Parliament|Act]] originated as the Transport Integration Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubPDocs.nsf/ee665e366dcb6cb0ca256da400837f6b/98F3688CCE1FCE19CA257685007B58C7/$FILE/561223bi1.pdf Official version of the Bill available at the [[Victorian Government]] legislation web site - Introduction print of the Transport Integration Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubPDocs.nsf/ee665e366dcb6cb0ca256da400837f6b/98F3688CCE1FCE19CA257685007B58C7/$FILE/561223exi1.pdf Official version of the explanatory memorandum for the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] available at the [[Victorian Government]] legislation web site - Explanatory memorandum for the Transport Integration Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bill was introduced into the [[lower house]] of the [[Victorian Parliament]] (the Legislative Assembly) on 8 December 2009 by the Hon [[Lynne Kosky]] MP, the then Minister for Public Transport.  [[Second reading]] for the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was moved on 10 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tex.parliament.vic.gov.au/bin/texhtmlt?form=VicHansard.dumpall&amp;db=hansard91&amp;dodraft=0&amp;house=ASSEMBLY&amp;speech=8582&amp;activity=Second+Reading&amp;title=TRANSPORT+INTEGRATION+BILL&amp;date1=10&amp;date2=December&amp;date3=2009&amp;query=true%0a%09and+%28+activity+contains+'Second+Reading'+%29%0a%09and+%28+hdate.hdate_3+=+2009+%29%0a%09and+%28+hdate.hdate_2+contains+'December'+%29%0a%09and+%28+house+contains+'ASSEMBLY'+%29%0a [[Victorian Parliament]], [[Legislative Assembly]], [[Hansard]], 10 December 2009 - Second reading speech extract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was eventually debated and passed by the [[Legislative Assembly]] without opposition on 4 February 2010.  The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced immediately into the [[upper house]] of the [[Victorian Parliament]] (the Legislative Council) and [[second reading]] moved on the same day by the Hon [[Martin Pakula]] MLC who had succeeded [[Lynne Kosky]] as Minister for Public Transport in the period since the Bill's introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tex.parliament.vic.gov.au/bin/texhtmlt?form=VicHansard.dumpall&amp;db=hansard91&amp;dodraft=0&amp;house=COUNCIL&amp;speech=9533&amp;activity=Second+Reading&amp;title=TRANSPORT+INTEGRATION+BILL&amp;date1=4&amp;date2=February&amp;date3=2010&amp;query=true%0a%09and+%28+data+contains+'transport'+%29%0a%09and+%28+activity+contains+'Second+Reading'+%29%0a%09and+%28+hdate.hdate_3+=+2010+%29%0a%09and+%28+hdate.hdate_2+contains+'February'+%29%0a%09and+%28+house+contains+'COUNCIL'+%29%0a Victorian Parliament, Legislative Council, Hansard,  4 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transport Integration Bill was ultimately passed without opposition by the [[Legislative Council]] on 23 February 2010.  The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] then received the [[Royal Assent]] to become an Act on 2 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See endnotes, Transport Integration Act 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transport Integration Act was subsequently proclaimed to commence on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Government Gazette, Special Gazette (no. 256), 30 June 2010, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ports Integration Bill ===
The "port corporations", the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]], the Port of Hastings Corporation and the Victorian Regional Channels Authority were originally not included in the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] proposal and were added later to the Transport Integration Act scheme by the Transport Legislation Amendment (Ports Integration) Bill 2010 (the Ports Integration Bill).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubStatbook.nsf/f932b66241ecf1b7ca256e92000e23be/DC0EBDEDEA2991E1CA257782001C2AC4/$FILE/10-045a.pdf Official version of the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] available at the [[Victorian Government]] legislation web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ports Integration Bill merged the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]] and the Port of Hastings Corporation under a rebadged [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]] banner.  The Ports Integration Bill was proclaimed to commence on 1 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Government Gazette, Special Gazette (no. 337), 24 August 2010, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;  This formally brought the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]] and the Victorian Regional Channels Authority within the Transport Integration Act framework on that date.

The merger of the Port of Melbourne Corporation and the Port of Hastings Corporation has been reversed - see changes to the Act below.

== Major amendments to the Transport Integration Act ==
A number of significant amendments have already been made to the Transport Integration Act:

=== Climate Change Act ===
The ''Climate Change Act 2010'' amended the ''Transport Integration Act'' to amend  the [[environmental sustainability]] objective in the transport system objectives of the Transport Integration Act.&lt;ref&gt;Section 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment changed that objective by providing that the transport system should actively contribute to the reduction of the overall contribution of transport-related [[greenhouse gas emissions]].  In addition, the change require relevant agencies to have regard to preparing for and adapting to the challenges presented by [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 73, Climate Change Act 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Climate Change Act was passed on 3 September 2010, received [[royal assent]] on 14 September 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/ Victorian Official version of the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] and [[Act of Parliament|Act]] including passage and commencement information available at the [[Victorian Government]] legislation web site - Legislation and Parliamentary Documents]&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced on 1 July 2011.
[[File:Melbourne transport.jpg|right|thumb| Taxis and trams in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]]. Taxis are as vital to the public transport mix of Melbourne as the city's iconic trams.]]

=== Taxi industry reform ===
The [[Transport Legislation Amendment (Taxi Services Reform and Other Matters) Act 2011]] amended the Transport Integration Act to create the [[Taxi Services Commission]]. The Commission was created as an inquiry body in first instance charged with conducting the [[Taxi Industry Inquiry]], a major inquiry into the taxi industry and taxi services in Victoria, and then to become the ongoing taxi industry regulator in place of the current regulator, the [[Director of Public Transport]] and the Victorian Taxi Directorate.

=== Public Transport Victoria===
The ''Transport Legislation Amendment (Public Transport Development Authority) Act 2011'' amended the ''Transport Integration Act'' to establish the Public Transport Development Authority, trading as  [[Public Transport Victoria]], and to make other related changes. The legislation partially commenced on 15 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;See www.legislation.vic.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt; Further parts of the amending legislation will be proclaimed in the future to provide for the full establishment of the PTDA and to abolish the agencies it replaces - the [[Director of Public Transport]], the [[Transport Ticketing Authority]] and MetLink.

=== Port of Hastings Development Authority Act ===
The ''Transport Legislation (Port of Hastings Development Authority) Act 2011'' amended the ''Transport Integration Act'' to reverse the merger of the [[Port of Melbourne]] Corporation and the [[Port of Hastings]] Corporation, which occurred in September 2010, and to establish a Port of Hastings Development Authority to oversee the development of the Port of Hastings as a competitor in container trade to the Port of Melbourne. The legislation was passed on 16 August 2011,&lt;ref&gt;See the status of Bill at www.legislation.vic.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt;  and came into force on 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See Transport Legislation (Port of Hastings Development Authority) Act 2011, section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other jurisdictions ==
[[File:Vline-sprinter.jpg|thumb| V/Line operated 'Sprinter' railcar at North Shore in [[Geelong]] in regional Victoria. ]]
Nicholas Low has observed that the transport policy directions of both Victoria and New South Wales have pursued "integration" from the start of the 21st century, particularly integrated planning for the various modes of transport and the integration of transport and land use planning.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Low, ''Australian Cities, Transport Integration and the Global Dilemma of Mobility'', State of Australian Cities, 5th SOAC Conference, 30 November 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, Victoria went further and remains alone among Australian jurisdictions in presenting these general policy directions to full Parliamentary scrutiny and entrenching them in legislative form.   Low comments that the Act "...provides strong legislative support for the development of an integrated and sustainable transport system...".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Low, "Australian Cities, Transport Integration and the Global Dilemma of Mobility'', State of Australian Cities, 5th SOAC Conference, 30 November 2011, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure and Transport has commented that -

::"Victoria has progressively modernised its transport legislation.  The Transport Integration Act 2010, the new principal transport statute, sets out a vision, objectives and principles for transport, making it clear that the transport system needs to be integrated and sustainable.  The Act requires transport agencies and other decision makers to have regard to broader social, economic and environmental considerations.  It unites all elements of the transport portfolio to ensure that transport agencies work towards a common goal of an integrated transport system.  It integrates land use and transport planning and decision making by extending the framework to land-use agencies whose decisions can significantly affect transport, including the government's planning functions, municipal councils, the Growth Area Authority and Parks Victoria".&lt;ref&gt;State of Australian Cities 2011, Major Cities Unit, Department of Infrastructure and Transport 2011, page 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency noted that the Transport Integration Act appeared to be the only Australian transport statute which explicitly recognised the risks posed by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, ''The Role of Regulation in Facilitating or Constraining Adaption to Climate Change for Australian Infrastructure'', Report for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Australian Government, released 20 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports continue to call for the adoption of policy and statutes which recognise emphasis on Transport Integration Act objectives including sustainability.  "Moving Australia 2030", a report generated by the Moving People 2030 Taskforce in March 2013 which included representation from planning, public transport, bus and rail lobby groups, is the latest of these documents.  The report instances the Act as a case study for driving integrated decision making in transport, land use planning and sustainability and as a model to be followed by other jurisdictions in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;"Moving Australia 2030", Moving People 2030 Taskforce, March 2013, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these observations, other jurisdictions including the Commonwealth have yet to respond to Victoria's leadership towards greater integration and sustainability in transport systems and their regulation.  In fact, concerns exist that national developments are moving away from integrated transport solutions towards greater silo based activity as shown by the establishment of distinct sole purpose national regulators for heavy vehicles, rail and maritime.&lt;ref&gt;2013 has seen the creation of a National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, a National Rail Safety Regulator and further maritime industry regulatory centralisation in the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Norman Swann, "(T) the challenge is to apply this new thinking into outcomes for the State - and nationally."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Swann, ''Why is it so difficult to have policy based on evidence rather than belief?'', The Economics of Transport - Smarter Transport - Better Cities, Metropolitan Transport Forum, GAMUT, Melbourne, Australia, March 2011, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British anti-slavery measures and naval bombardment of Lagos in 1851==
In Britain's early 19th century fight against the [[Trans Atlantic Slave Trade]], its [[West Africa Squadron]], or Preventative Squadron as it was also known, continued to pursue Portuguese, American, French, and  Cuban slave ships and to impose anti-slavery treaties with West African coastal chiefs with so much doggedness that they created a strong presence along the West African coast from [[Sierra Leone]] all the way to the [[Niger Delta]] (today's Nigeria) and as far south as Congo.&lt;ref name=Smith-1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, Britain appointed [[John Beecroft]] Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of [[Fernando Pó (island)|Fernando Pó]]) until his death in 1854.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Howard Temperley, ‘Beecroft, John (1790–1854)’, rev. Elizabeth Baigent, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos under Oba [[Kosoko]] was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of [[Benin]] and [[Biafra]] and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the [[Bombardment of Lagos]] (or Reduction of Lagos). The British installed Oba [[Akintoye|Akitoye]], ousted [[Oba (king)|Oba]] Kosoko, and signed a treaty on January 1, 1852 between Great Britain and Lagos that outlawed the slave trade, ushering in the '''consular period''' in Lagos' history, wherein Britain provided military protection to Lagos.

==Treaty Text==
The text of the Lagos Treaty of 1852 is transcribed below:&lt;ref name=Smith-Appendix&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate 1851-1861|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780520037465|pages=135–137 Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Commodore Henry William Bruce, Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty’s ships and vessels on the West Coast of Africa, and John Beecroft, Esquire.

'''Article I'''
&lt;br /&gt;
''The export of slaves to foreign countries is for ever abolished in the territories of the King and Chiefs of Lagos; and the King and the Chiefs of Lagos; and the King and Chiefs of Lagos engage to make and to proclaim a law prohibiting any of their subjects, or any person within their jurisdiction, from selling or assisting in the sale of any slave for transportation to a foreign country; and the King and Chiefs of Lagos promise to inflict a severe punishment on any person who shall break the law.

'''Article III'''
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Article IV'''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

''Encouragement shall be given to such Missionaries or Ministers in the pursuits of industry, in building houses for their residence, and schools and chapels. They shall not be hindered or molested in their endeavours to teach the doctrines of Christianity to all persons willing and desirous to be taught; nor shall any subject of the King and Chiefs of Lagos who may embrace the Christian faith be on that account, or on account of the teaching or exercise thereof, molested or troubled in any manner whatsoever.

''The King and Chiefs of Lagos further agree to set apart a piece of land, within a convenient distance of the principal towns, to be used as a burial-ground for Christian persons. And the funerals and sepulchres of the dead shall not be disturbed in any way or upon any account.

'''Article IX'''
&lt;br /&gt;

The '''Trial of Xiao Chen''' ({{zh|s=肖真|p=Xiāo Zhēn}}) in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], for the murder of Hiren Mohini in [[Mount Eden]], [[New Zealand]], is notable as the first time a New Zealand [[murder]] has been tried in a foreign court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/08/02/chinese-national-is-tried-for-new-zealand-murder-on-native-soil/ |title=Chinese National is Tried For New Zealand Murder on Native Soil  |work=blogs.voanews.com |year=2011 |quote=A Chinese man has confessed in court to killing a New Zealand taxi driver in a case that breaks new legal ground for the two countries. |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chinese media, the case was frequently referred to as "New Zealand's first murder case" (新西兰第一命案).&lt;ref name="Sina" /&gt;

==Crime==
Hiren Mohini, a taxi driver born in [[Mumbai]],&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3292164"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3292164/Funeral-for-slain-taxi-driver-Hiren-Mohini |title=Funeral for slain taxi driver Hiren Mohini |author=David Gadd and Michael Fox |date=4 February 2010 |agency=with [[NZPA]] |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; had picked up a fare in central [[Auckland]] and gone to Mt Eden between 1am and 2am on 31 January 2010. In Mt Eden he was fatally stabbed, apparently by a passenger. Police found a knife and soon had a suspect, based partly on CCTV footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10623458 |title=Knife found as search for killer stepped up   |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10625121 |title=Appeal to Asian community over taxi driver suspect |work=nzherald.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NZ$]]100,000 was raised from the New Zealand public to support Mohini's family.

The suspect, Xiao Zhen, was a 23-year old Chinese national and kitchen worker at the [[Skycity Auckland|SkyCity casino complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/murder-case-tests-china-nz-link/story-e6frg6so-1225988004716 |title=Murder case tests China-NZ link|work=theaustralian.com.au |quote=Mr Zhen, a kitchen worker at SkyCity casino, was identified from security camera images as the prime suspect. |accessdate=8 August 2011 |date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhen left New Zealand for China on 4 February, apparently to visit a sick grandfather. China does not have an [[extradition]] agreement with New Zealand and in any case does not extradite Chinese citizens even when an extradition treaty does exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2011/01/21/commentary/china-reasonably-pre-empting-n-z-justice/|title=China 'reasonably' pre-empting N.Z. justice |work=The Japan Times |year=2011 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
After reciprocal visits between the [[New Zealand Police|New Zealand]] and [[Chinese police]], Xiao Zhen was arrested in Shanghai in June 2010.&lt;ref name="Sina" /&gt;&lt;ref name="confession"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10742620 |title=Cabbie's killer confesses in China  |work=nzherald.co.nz |quote=Shanghai  |accessdate=8 August 2011 |date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the New Zealand evidence was translated into Chinese by the New Zealand police for the trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10741412 |title=Kiwi cops leave for historic China murder trial |work=nzherald.co.nz |accessdate=8 August 2011 |date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Second [[Intermediate People's Court]] in Shanghai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.eastday.com/e/110803/u1a6031941.html |title=Eastday-Local admits killing taxi driver |work=english.eastday.com |year=2011 |quote=Xiao admitted guilt at the Shanghai No. 2 Intermediate People's Court, saying he felt sorry for the victim and his family. |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320092232/http://english.eastday.com/e/110803/u1a6031941.html |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at which the suspect confessed.&lt;ref name="confession"/&gt; Xiao Zhen claimed that Mohini had verbally insulted him after he boarded the taxi. Xiao demanded that he stop the taxi and refused to pay the fare. A struggle ensued, and Xiao Zhen stabbed the driver with a kitchen knife.&lt;ref name="Sina"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2011-08-18/151423012807.shtml | title=杀害新西兰出租车司机留学生回沪获刑十五年 | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | date=18 August 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial lasted only a few hours, with no in-person evidence presented, but Mandarin translations of witness statements and evidence were handed up to the judges. A verdict and sentence was expected on 17 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/crime/news/article.cfm?c_id=30&amp;objectid=10744662 |title=Taxi driver murder verdict due next week |work=nzherald.co.nz |quote=Mandarin |accessdate=13 August 2011 |date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August Xiao Zhen was sentenced to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10745734 |title=Taxi driver killer jailed in China |work=nzherald.co.nz |quote="We have reviewed the case and found that the defendant showed regret during the trial and the lawyer pleaded for a lighter sentence. The court approved that, and the final ruling is that he should serve 15 years, and be deprived of political rights for a further four," said Judge Jiang Zhengyu. Li Liping, Xiao's aunt, said after the verdict that she felt Xiao Zhen deserved the sentence. "Our family failed to bring him up properly," she said, tearfully. "We do not think we will appeal and we think 15 years is correct. We now feel we can look the victim's family in the face". |accessdate=17 August 2011 |date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the commencement of the trial the New Zealand authorities obtained formal written assurances that the death penalty would not be invoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shanghaiist.com/2011/08/03/shanghai_student_charged_in_court_h.php |title=Shanghai student charged in court here for murder of taxi driver in New Zealand - Shanghaiist |work=shanghaiist.com |year=2011 |quote=Detective Senior Sergeant Hywel Jones said the Auckland City Police handed the case over to the Chinese after formal written assurances by the Chinese government that the death penalty would not be applied. |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand does not have the death penalty for murder.

Associate Professor Bill Hodge of the [[University of Auckland]] called the trial "an insult to New Zealand [[jurisdiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10699328 |title=China murder trial 'insult to NZ jurisdiction'|work=nzherald.co.nz |quote='To me, it is an insult to the jurisdiction of New Zealand.'  |accessdate=8 August 2011 |date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
