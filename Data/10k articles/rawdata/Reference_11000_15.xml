'''2006 murder of TRO workers''' refers to the incident of abduction of seven [[Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation]] (TRO) employees who were tortured and executed by the [[TMVP]] paramilitary group. One employee Premini Thanuskodi was gang raped and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/remembering-the-abduction-of-tro-staff-on-29-30-january-2006/ Remembering The Abduction Of TRO Staff On 29 &amp; 30 January, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tamilnation.co/indictment/continuingwar/060130tro.htm#Memorial_service Sri Lanka Paramilitaries abduct Tamil staff members of Tamils Rehabilitation Organization (TRO) in Welikande/Batticaloa, 30 January 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abduction==
Seven TRO workers were abducted in two separate incident on January 2006 in [[Jaffna]]. The first incident happened when five workers were traveling from [[Batticalo]] to [[Kilinochchi]].  They were subjected to checks at the [[Sri Lanka Army]] checkpoint at Welikanda. At this point they noticed a white van behind them. After traveling a short distance from the checkpoint the workers were attacked by armed men in the white van. The assaulter then tied the workers and took them to a camp in the jungle. Three of the five abducted were released later. The next day another 15 workers were abducted 100 meters in front of the Walikanda checkpoint. 10 of the 15 abducted were released and were told to prepare the funeral rights for their colleges.&lt;ref name='AI'&gt;{{cite news | title=SRI LANKA | date=2007-06-10 | publisher=AI | url=http://www.amnesty.be/doc/article7274.html | work=Amnesty international | accessdate=2007-07-03 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718051221/http://www.amnesty.be/doc/article7274.html | archive-date=2012-07-18 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The President of Sri Lanka has asked the security forces to speed up the investigation concerning the abduction of the TRO workers. He further asked to search the Walikanda area for the abducted. The government also denied any links to this abduction.

[[Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation]] has alleged that their staff were abducted by the [[TamilEela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal|Karuna Group]], a paramilitary organization which is believed to be working with the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. It further added that they have not received any reports or response from any investigating authorities.&lt;ref name='TRO'&gt;{{cite news | title= Abducted TRO Aid Workers Believed Dead| date=2007-07-05 | publisher=TRO | url =http://www.troonline.org/123aboutus.htm| work =| accessdate = 2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amnesty International]] has asked for the immediate release of these workers &lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;

The former US [[Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs]], Christina Rocca, made an appeal for their release.&lt;ref name="TRO"/&gt;

The [[LTTE]] expressed concern over the abduction of the TRO workers.&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news | title= Swift probe ordered on TRO abductions| date=2007-07-03 | publisher=BBC | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2006/02/060205_ltte_president.shtml| work =BBC Sinhala| accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicting reports==
UTHR reported that the [[LTTE]] had staged the abduction of the TRO workers but later said that they were not correct on this statement.&lt;ref name='UTHR'&gt;{{cite news | title=The Missing TRO workers| date=2007-07-03 | publisher=UTHR | url =http://www.uthr.org/bulletins/bul42.htm#_Toc153735236| work =| accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, TRO alleged that a government backed paramilitary was responsible for this abduction &lt;ref name='BBC'/&gt;

[[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)]], is a neurodegenerative disease that typically affects adults around 54-67&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiò|first=A.|last2=Logroscino|first2=G.|last3=Traynor|first3=B.J.|last4=Collins|first4=J.|last5=Simeone|first5=J.C.|last6=Goldstein|first6=L.A.|last7=White|first7=L.A.|date=2013|title=Global Epidemiology of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review of the Published Literature|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/351153|journal=Neuroepidemiology|language=english|volume=41|issue=2|pages=118–130|doi=10.1159/000351153|issn=0251-5350|pmc=4049265}}&lt;/ref&gt; years of age, although anyone can be diagnosed with the disease.  People diagnosed with ALS live on average 2–4 years after diagnosis due to the quick progression of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobson|first=Esther V.|last2=McDermott|first2=Christopher J.|title=Supportive and symptomatic management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrneurol.2016.111|journal=Nature Reviews Neurology|volume=12|issue=9|pages=526–538|doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2016.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.als.ca/about-als/|title=About ALS - ALS Society of Canada|work=ALS Society of Canada|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The progression and severity of ALS is rated by doctors on the ALS Functional Rating Scale, which has been revised and is referred to as ALSFRS-R.

== Criteria ==
ALSFRS-R includes 12 questions that can have a score of 0 to 4.  A score of 0 on a question would indicate no function while a score of 4 would indicate full function.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Sarah|last2=Al Khleifat|first2=Ahmad|last3=Al-Chalabi|first3=Ammar|date=2017-03-28|title=What causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?|journal=F1000Research|volume=6|doi=10.12688/f1000research.10476.1|issn=2046-1402|pmc=5373425|pmid=28408982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cedarbaum|first=Jesse M.|last2=Stambler|first2=Nancy|last3=Malta|first3=Errol|last4=Fuller|first4=Cynthia|last5=Hilt|first5=Dana|last6=Thurmond|first6=Barbara|last7=Nakanishi|first7=Arline|title=The ALSFRS-R: a revised ALS functional rating scale that incorporates assessments of respiratory function|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022510X99002105|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|volume=169|issue=1-2|pages=13–21|doi=10.1016/s0022-510x(99)00210-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This scale has been useful for doctors in diagnosing patients, measuring disease progression and also for researchers when selecting patients for a study and measuring the potential effects of a [[clinical trial]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mora|first=Jesús S|date=2017-10-01|title=Edaravone for treatment of early-stage ALS|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442217302892|journal=The Lancet Neurology|volume=16|issue=10|pages=772|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALSFRS-R scale has some limitations though since it is not useful to compare scores of people who present with different onset.  In [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] the main type of onset is bulbar, followed by limb-onset; which describes the region of motor neurons first affected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Individuals may also present with respiratory onset,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rooney|first=James|last2=Burke|first2=Tom|last3=Vajda|first3=Alice|last4=Heverin|first4=Mark|last5=Hardiman|first5=Orla|date=2017-05-01|title=What does the ALSFRS-R really measure? A longitudinal and survival analysis of functional dimension subscores in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/88/5/381|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|language=en|volume=88|issue=5|pages=381–385|doi=10.1136/jnnp-2016-314661|issn=0022-3050|pmid=27888187}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this occurs very rarely.  Since there are three different types of ALS, ALSFRS-R scores are often grouped in categories depending on type of onset.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Since there are three main pathways of progression, the questions are also divided in relation to the types of onset.  Questions 1 to 3 are related to bulbar onset, questions 4 to 9 are related to limb onset and questions 10-12 are related to respiratory onset.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Progression ==
ALSFRS-R scores calculated at diagnosis can be compared to scores throughout time to determine the speed of progression.  The rate of change, called the ALSFRS-R slope can be used as a prognostic indicator.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimura|first=F.|last2=Fujimura|first2=C.|last3=Ishida|first3=S.|last4=Nakajima|first4=H.|last5=Furutama|first5=D.|last6=Uehara|first6=H.|last7=Shinoda|first7=K.|last8=Sugino|first8=M.|last9=Hanafusa|first9=T.|date=2006-01-24|title=Progression rate of ALSFRS-R at time of diagnosis predicts survival time in ALS|url=http://www.neurology.org/content/66/2/265|journal=Neurology|language=en|volume=66|issue=2|pages=265–267|doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000194316.91908.8a|issn=0028-3878|pmid=16434671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elamin|first=Marwa|last2=Bede|first2=Peter|last3=Montuschi|first3=Anna|last4=Pender|first4=Niall|last5=Chio|first5=Adriano|last6=Hardiman|first6=Orla|date=2015-06-01|title=Predicting prognosis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a simple algorithm|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-015-7731-6|journal=Journal of Neurology|language=en|volume=262|issue=6|pages=1447–1454|doi=10.1007/s00415-015-7731-6|issn=0340-5354|pmc=4469087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ALSFRS-R score is a recognized prognostic indicator,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; it is more useful to compare various indicators including [[vital capacity]] (FVC%) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergner|first=M.|last2=Bobbitt|first2=R. A.|last3=Carter|first3=W. B.|last4=Gilson|first4=B.

Relating the ALSFRS-R score to staging criteria is also useful in determining prognosis.  King's system relies on the clinical spread of disease as a measure of progression&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roche|first=Jose C.|last2=Rojas-Garcia|first2=Ricardo|last3=Scott|first3=Kirsten M.|last4=Scotton|first4=William|last5=Ellis|first5=Catherine E.|last6=Burman|first6=Rachel|last7=Wijesekera|first7=Lokesh|last8=Turner|first8=Martin R.|last9=Leigh|first9=P.

'''''A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, in Three Parts''''' or '''''Morrison's Chinese dictionary''''' (1815-1823), compiled by the Anglo-Scottish [[missionary]] [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] was the first Chinese-English, English-Chinese dictionary. Part I is Chinese-English arranged by the 214 [[Kangxi radical]]s, Part II is Chinese-English arranged alphabetically, and Part III is English-Chinese also arranged alphabetically. This groundbreaking [[reference work]] is enormous, comprising 4,595 pages in 6 [[quarto]] volumes and including 47,035 [[Headword|head]] [[Chinese character|characters]] taken from the 1716 ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]''. However, Morrison's encyclopedic dictionary had flaws, notably failing to distinguish [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants: the pronunciation ''taou'' is given for both aspirated ''táo'' ([[wikt:桃|桃]], "peach") and unaspirated ''dào'' ([[wikt:道|道]], "way; the [[Tao]]").

{{Main article| Robert Morrison (missionary)}}
Robert Morrison (1782-1834) is credited with several historical firsts in addition to the first bidirectional Chinese and English dictionary. He was the first [[Protestant]] missionary in China, started the first Chinese-language [[periodical]] in 1815 {{harvcol|Wilkinson|2015|p=850}}, collaborated with [[William Milne (missionary)|William Milne]] to write the first [[Chinese Bible Translations|translation of the Bible into Chinese]] in 1823, helped to found the English-language ''[[The Canton Register]]'' in 1827, and compiled the first Western-language dictionary of a regional [[Varieties of Chinese|variety of Chinese]] {{harvcol|Morrison|1828}}.

Morrison joined the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1804 and was chosen to lead a mission to China. They sent him to study at [[Gosport]] and introduced him to a young [[Cantonese]] man studying English in London: Robert Morrison transcribes his name as "Yong Sam Tak", Eliza Morrison as "Yung-san-tih" in "Mandarin" transcription {{harvcol|Morrison|1839|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XRI6AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Tsae%20a-keen&amp;pg=PA217 Vol. I, p. 217].}}, and whose actual name was probably Rong Sande ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|容|三|德}}}}) {{harvcol|Strandenaes|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q0HBN4770MQC&amp;pg=PA126 126–7]}}. In 1807, the LMS instructed Morrison to sail to [[Guangzhou]] (then known as "Canton") and continue studying until he had "accomplished [his] great object of acquiring the language", whereupon he would "turn this attainment into a direction which may be of extensive use to the world: perhaps you may have the honour of forming a Chinese Dictionary, more comprehensive and correct than any preceding one", as well as translating the Bible into Chinese {{harvcol|Morrison|1839|loc=Vol. I, p. 70}}.

Upon his arrival in the [[Qing Empire]], Morrison learned that the Chinese were prohibited from teaching their language to foreigners, forcing him to [[Chinese as a foreign language|study Chinese]] secretly and hide his books from sight. Morrison eventually found two tutors, the scholar "Ko Seen-sang" and Abel Yun, who had learned [[Latin]] from [[Jesuit China missions|Catholic missionaries]]. Together, they began to translate the scriptures and compile the dictionary. In 1809, the [[East India Company]] employed Morrison as their translator, which legitimized his presence in Guangzhou's [[Thirteen Factories]] and provided sufficient income to continue working on the dictionary project and Bible translation. He translated and printed the [[Acts of the Apostles]] in 1810 and completed his Chinese Grammar in 1811. The situation worsened in 1812 when the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] issued an edict adding Christianity to the list of banned witchcrafts and superstitions, making the printing of Chinese-language books on the subject a capital crime {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=3}}. The LMS sent the missionary [[William Milne (missionary)|William Milne]] to assist Morrison in translating and printing the scriptures. In 1814, the East India Company sent the printing engineer [[Peter Perring Thoms]]. Together with Morrison's Chinese assistants such as [[Cai Gao]] and [[Liang Fa]], he created the Chinese character font for the dictionary. Morrison worked on producing ''A Dictionary of the Chinese Language'' for more than 15 years with "extraordinary perseverance, industry, and ingenuity" {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=5}}.

Morrison described the bilingual Chinese dictionaries that he used as sources for his own lexicographical work: "several MS. Dictionaries of the old Missionaries, in English and French, and, latterly, the printed copy of Father Basil's Dictionary" {{harvcol|Morrison|1839|Vol. II, p. 454}}. This refers to the 9,000-entry 1698 ''Dictionarium Sino-Latinum'' manuscript of the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] Basilio Brollo or de Glemona (1648-1704), which the French orientalist [[Joseph de Guignes]] (1759-1845) translated as the 1813 ''{{lang|fr|Dictionnaire Chinois, Français et Latin}}'' without any attribution to the original author {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=306}}. Brollo's innovation was to provide a Chinese character dictionary alphabetically collated by transliteration, with a user-friendly index arranged by radicals and strokes, successfully combining Chinese and European lexicographic traditions {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=313}}. This lexicographical macrostructure was adopted in Morrison's dictionary, and most bilingual Chinese dictionaries up to the present day.

The first volume of Morrison's Chinese dictionary was published in 1815 and the last in 1823. All 6 volumes were printed by {{nowrap|P. P. Thoms}} in [[Portuguese Macao|Macao]] and published and sold by Black, Parbury, &amp; Allen, the booksellers to the East India Company. The dictionary was printed in a run of 750 copies at a total cost of [[GBP|₤]]10,440 {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=300}} or ₤12,000 {{harvcol|Broomhall|1927|p=173}}; they sold for the "princely sum" of 20 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] {{harvcol|Wilkinson|2015|p=84}}. The LMS was unable to subsidize the entire project, but the directors of the East India Company agreed to pay because they recognized the dictionary's incalculable benefit, not only to missionaries but also to their own employees {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=5}}. The later volumes were published simultaneously in London by Kingsbury, Parbury, &amp; Allen or by Black, Parbury, &amp; Allen.

The ''Dictionary of the Chinese Language'' marked a new era in the compilation and publication of bilingual Chinese works. Before the 19th century, Catholic missionaries such as Basilio Brollo had compiled many bilingual manuscript dictionaries, but their circulation was inevitably restricted by the difficulties of copying a dictionary by hand. The initial edition of 750 copies and subsequent reprints enabled Morrison's dictionary to reach a wider readership and have a far more profound impact {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=316}}.

Morrison's dictionary is composed of three parts or six [[quarto]] ({{convert|306|x|242|mm|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or}}) volumes published in different years. Part I has 3 volumes with Volume I published in 1815 containing 18 pages in the preface, 930 pages in the dictionary proper, and 2 additional pages consisting of advertisements {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a}}. Volume II, published in 1822, is composed of 884 pages {{harvcol|Morrison|1822a}}, and Volume III, published in 1823, is composed of 908 pages {{harvcol|Morrison|1823}}. Part II has two volumes: Volume I published in 1819 contains 20 pages in the preface and 1,090 pages in the dictionary proper {{harvcol|Morrison|1819}}, and Volume II published in 1820 contains 6 pages in the preface, 178 pages in the first section, and 305 pages in the second section of the dictionary proper {{harvcol|Morrison|1820}}. Part III was published in 1822 with only one volume containing 5 pages in the preface and 480 pages in the dictionary proper {{harvcol|Morrison|1822b}}{{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=6}}.

The publication of Morrison's dictionary attracted the attention of scholars worldwide, and Part II was reprinted from 1865 until 1913. The revised preface says the second part "has been generally commended by experienced Sinologues as the most perfect and useful of the whole" {{harvcol|Morrison|1865|p=i}}. In 1865, the London Mission Press in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] and [[Trubner and Co|Trubner &amp; Co.]] in London first republished Part II in 2 volumes, totaling 1630 pages. In 1913, [[Zhonghua Book Company]] reprinted Part II in a pocketbook size, which made it much more affordable and easier to carry {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=6}}.

Morrison's lexicographical legacy is reflected in two facts: his dictionary's macrostructure and microstructure became the model for many later Chinese-English dictionaries, and his transliteration system was adopted as the basis for [[Wade-Giles]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=321}}.

Morrison's Chinese dictionary became the prototype for other 19th-century works. The English [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] missionary and Bible translator [[Walter Henry Medhurst]] compiled the 1842 and 1847 ''Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing all the Words in the Chinese Imperial Dictionary, Arranged According to the Radicals''. Medhurst claimed this was an original translation based on the ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]'', but it was in fact just an edited abridgment of Morrison's dictionary, a "plagiarism rather than an original compilation" {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=318}}. The American sinologist and missionary [[Samuel Wells Williams]] compiled the 1874 ''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language|Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'', whose Chinese title ({{lang|zh|漢英韻府}}) echoed that of Part II of Morrison's work ({{lang|zh|五車韻府}}). The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst, [[Elijah Coleman Bridgman]], and others were published in small numbers, they became "very scarce, while the number of students has increased tenfold", and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison {{harvcol|Williams|1874|p=v}}. Williams explicitly identified "Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien" as a more important source for his own work than Morrison's dictionary {{harvcol|Williams|1874|p=vi}}. The British diplomat and sinologist [[Herbert Giles]] edited ''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', published in 1892 and 1912. Giles praised Morrison as "the great pioneer" of Chinese-English lexicography, but criticized his failure to mark aspiration. He said Medhurst "attempted aspirates" but omitted some and wrongly inserted others. While Williams correctly marked aspiration and tones, Giles says "he provided too few phrases, and mistranslated a large number of those" {{harvcol|Giles|1892|pp=vii-viii}}. Ironically, Yang's textual analysis finds that Giles's dictionary is more closely linked to Williams's than to Morrison's {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=318}}.

Morrison's Chinese dictionary introduced a systematic transliteration system that was used for over four decades until it was replaced by [[Thomas Francis Wade]]'s [[Wade romanization|romanization scheme]] in 1867; that became the basis for the [[Wade-Giles]] system of 1892-1912, which was widely used and still survives alongside [[pinyin]] romanization. Morrison's system was almost forgotten after being replaced by Wade romanization, but [[James Legge]] adopted it virtually unchanged into the [[Legge romanization]] used in his ''Chinese Classics'' series {{harvcol|Legge|1861–1872}}{{harvcol|Coblin|2003|p=355}}. Morrison's romanization system influenced the Wade, Legge, and Wade-Giles schemes {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=313}}.

Robert Morrison's dictionary is still in use two hundred years after its publication. For example, the American sinologist [[W. South Coblin]] analyzed Morrison's romanization of Mandarin for clues about the pronunciation of early 19th-century standard Chinese {{harvcol|Coblin|2003}}. Morrison's pronunciation glosses followed the lower Yangtze [[Koiné language|koiné]] as the standard [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Mandarin]] of the time, "what the Chinese call the [[Nanjing dialect|Nanking Dialect]], than the [[Beijing dialect|Peking]]" {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|p=xviii}}{{harvcol|Morrison|1815b|p=x}}.

==Content==
The title pages of the dictionary's parts give two versions of the full title. Part I's title page (shown above) reads "Part the First; Containing Chinese and English, Arranged According to the Radicals; Part the Second; Chinese and English, Arranged Alphabetically; and Part the Third, English and Chinese". The title pages of Part II and Part iii read "Part the First, Containing Chinese and English Arranged According to the Keys; Part the Second, Chinese and English Arranged Alphabetically, and Part the Third, Consisting of English and Chinese". Each part of the dictionary is a complete and independent unit in itself {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=6}}.

===Part I: A Dictionary of the Chinese Language===
[[File:MorrisonDCL.1823.513.pdf|thumb|300px|The entry on {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道}}}} ("Taou", now ''dào'') in Part I of Morrison's dictionary {{harvcol|Morrison|1823|p=513}}. The original did not include [[Chinese tones|tone]] marks, but a reader has added it to this entry.]]
Part I, '''''A Dictionary of the Chinese Language''''', is supertitled in Chinese—but not English—as a "[[Chinese character|character]] dictionary" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|字典}}}}). It was a Chinese-to-English dictionary, organized by the [[Kangxi radical|214 radical system]] employed by the 1716 ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]''. These [[Chinese radical|radicals]] are the initial or major graphic components of [[Chinese characters]], ranging from 1 to 17 [[Stroke (CJKV character)|strokes]]. In Morrison's dictionary, Volume I starts with [[Radical 1]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|一}}}}, "one") and ends at [[Radical 41]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|寸}}}} ("thumb; [[Chinese inch]]") {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a}}; Volume II starts with [[Radical 42]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|小}}}}, "small") and stops at [[Radical 119]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|米}}}}, "rice") {{harvcol|Morrison|1822}}; and Volume III begins with [[Radical 120]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|糸}}}}, "silk") and ends the dictionary with [[Radical 214]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|龠}}}}, "flute") {{harvcol|Morrison|1823}}. Vols. II &amp; III were published simultaneously in London by Kingsbury, Parbury, &amp; Allen.

Morrison acknowledged his debt to the ''Kangxi Dictionary'' in his introduction to Volume I, saying it "forms the ground work" of Part I {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|p=ix}}, including its arrangement, number of characters (47,035), and many of its definitions and examples {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=313}}. However, it also differed in significant ways. Chinese scholars have found that the majority of the Kangxi dictionary's usage examples were taken from books before the 10th century and ignored vulgar forms and expressions. Morrison also noticed this and chose examples better suited to his intended readership {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=315}}, adding vulgar, humorous, colloquial, and modern examples. For instance {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=9}}, Morrison included descriptions for {{lang|zh|{{linktext|王八}}}} (''wángba'', "tortoise" but also "cuckold; son of a bitch; pimp") and {{lang|zh|{{linktext|烏龜}}}} (''wūguī'', "tortoise" but also "cuckold") as "terms of abuse, denoting one who lives on his wife's prostitution; one lost to virtue". Similarly {{lang|zh|{{linktext|王八蛋}}}} (''wángbadàn'', "turtle egg" but also "son of a bitch") as "a bastard, in opprobrious language" {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|p=188}}. Morrison's dictionary also gives Chinese usage examples and quotations from a wide range of sources, including classical literature, law, medicine, novels, and numerous unidentified contemporary sources.

His [[Chinese calligraphy|orthographic standard]] for the dictionary's "Radicals, and of the large Characters throughout the work," was said to have been "taken from an excellent Dictionary" {{harvcol|Morrison|1815|p=1}}. This was either [[Sha Mu]]'s 1787 ''Yiwen Beilan'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|藝|文|備覽}}}}, "Literary Writings for Consultation", or ''E-wǎn-pe-lan'' in Sha's romanization)  or its 1807 reprint. Morrison's copy is now located at the [[University of London]]'s [[SOAS, University of London#Library|SOAS Library]]. A comparative study of its annotations confirms its influence, although this remained less marked than that of the ''Kangxi Dictionary'' {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=312}}.

Philosophically, Morrison's dictionary departed from that ordered by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] by including not only the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Four Books and Five Classics]] but many more items drawn from [[Taoism|Taoist]] and [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts. [[Yang Huiling|Yang]] uses the example of the dictionary's first entry, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|一}}}} (''yi'', "one") {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=316}}, which notes
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Secl [Sect] Taou affirms, that {{lang|zh|道生一一生二二生三三生萬物…}} "Taou produced one, one produced two, two produced three, and three produced all things." If it be asked, what then is Taou? They reply, 靜極乃道也… "Extreme quiescence, or a state of perfect stillness is Taou." The Three, when speaking of their external appearance, they call {{lang|zh|天之秀氣地之生氣感和風之清氣…}} "The heaven's adorning principle, earth's life giving principle, and the pure principle of the exciting harmonizing wind"; or as they define it, "That aerial principle, or influence, by which the heavens and earth act on each other." The internal Three, they call {{lang|zh|氣之清神之靈精之潔靜裏分陰陽而精氣神同化於虛無…}} "The clear unmixed influence, the intelligence of spirit; the purity of essence; in the midst of quiescence separated the Yin and Yang. Essence, influence and spirit, together operated in a state of vacuum." (Taou tĭh king). Their notions of the great One Cause of all things, are very fanciful and obscure {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|pp=12–3}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first quote is from ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (Ch. 42) and the others from commentaries.

The first volume of Part I and its two companion volumes were written in notably different styles. Volume I is "notoriously abundant" in encyclopedic examples and quotations, while the other two volumes of Part I just provide brief definitions and a few examples {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=314}}. When Morrison published the first volume of Part I in 1815 after 8 years of hard work, he realized that if he tried to compile the rest of the dictionary on such a comprehensive scale, he might not finish the dictionary in his lifetime. He then changed course and rapidly published Part II in 1819 and 1820. His dictionary's alphabetically arranged Part II, with concise definitions and brief usage examples, proved to be more useful for learners of Chinese but lacked the rich quotations that made the first volume of Part I a model of an "encyclopedic and culturally rich bilingual dictionary" {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=315}}. To illustrate Volume I's "grand scope" and "many surprises", Wu Xian &amp; al. cited the 40-page entry for {{lang|zh|{{linktext|學}}}} (''xue'', "study; receive instruction; practice; imitate; learn; a place of studying") {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|pp=746–85}} whose usage examples and illustrations range across the traditional [[Chinese educational system]] from "private school" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|學館}}}}, ''xueguan'') to "government-run [[prefecture (China)|prefectural]] school" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|府學}}}}, ''fuxue''), explain the [[imperial examination]] civil service system from "county candidates" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|秀才}}}}, ''xiucai'') to "members of the imperial [[Hanlin Academy]]" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|翰林}}}}, ''hanlin''), and include a variety of related terms and passages such as 100 rules for schools, details on examination systems, and a list of books for classical study. They conclude that the dictionary's "richness of information was unprecedented" {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=10}}.

An example of a later entry is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道}}}} (''dào'', "way") in Volume III {{harvcol|Morrison|1823|p=513}}. It is given with his [[Chinese tones|atonal]] romanization "TAOU" under [[Radical 162]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|辵}}}}, "walk"), with the [[roman numeral]] IX noting that it has nine [[Stroke (CJKV character)|strokes]] beyond those of the base radical. The [[regular script]] character and pronunciation are given alongside its [[small seal script|small seal]] and [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] forms, followed by English translations, derived terms, and usage examples. In this case, the word is glossed as "A way; a path; being at the head; the way that leads to; a thoroughfare on all sides. A principle. The principle from which heaven, earth, man, and all nature emanates." Of the 22 words and usages given, the first six are medical terms (e.g., "Seaou pëen taou {{lang|zh|{{linktext|小便道}}}} the urinary passage; the vagina") and the last thirteen are [[circuit (administrative division)|administrative circuit]]s of imperial China (e.g., "{{lang|zh|{{linktext|河南|道}}}} [[Henan|Ho-nan]] taou") The other three are notice of the [[Daoguang Emperor]]'s [[Chinese era names|era name]] ("Taou-kwang yuen nëen {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道光|元|年}}}} the first of Taoukwang, 'reason's glory,' title of the reigning emperor of China (A.D. 1821)"); the common word ''[[wikt:道喜|dàoxǐ]]'' ("Taou he {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道喜}}}} to congratulate, an expression used amongst equals"); and a citation from [[Confucius]]'s ''[[Analects]]'' ("Taou tsëen shing che kwǒ {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道|千|乘|之|國}}}} To rule or govern a nation that can send forth a thousand [[Chinese chariot|war chariots]]").

===Part II: A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, Arranged Alphabetically===
[[File:MorrisonDCL.1819.820.pdf|thumb|300px|The entry on {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道}}}} ("Taou", now ''dào'') in Part II of Morrison's dictionary {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=820}}.]]
[[File:MorrisonDCL.1820.229.pdf|thumb|300px|A page of script variants for {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道}}}} ("Taou", now ''dào'') from Part II of Morrison's dictionary {{harvcol|Morrison|1820|p=229}}.]]
Part II, '''''A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, Arranged Alphabetically''''', is supertitled in Chinese—but not English—as a ''Wuche Yunfu'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|五車|韻府}}}}, "Erudition Phonetic Dictionary"). The name literally means a "five-cart[loads of books, a classical idiom for "erudite"] storehouse of euphony", and copies the title of an earlier [[rime dictionary]] compiled by [[Chen Jinmo]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|陳|藎|謨}}}}) and [[Han Yihu]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|含|一|胡}}}}), who gave its unpublished manuscript to the editors of the ''Kangxi Dictionary''. They made extensive use of it, with definitions often identical in both works {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=v}}. Morrison claimed to have worked from Chen and Han's dictionary, rearranging its roughly 40,000 characters according to [[syllabary|syllables]] instead of pronunciations and tones {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|pp=v–vi}} with the help of the ''Fenyun'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|分|韻}}}}, "Divisions of Rimes") and Basilio Brollo's dictionary, as well as contemporary words from elsewhere. This work took about seven years {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=7}}. Yang's comparative study of Parts I and II found, however, that the definitions of both are clearly based on the ''Kangxi Dictionary'' and reflect little content from original ''Wuche Yunfu'' {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=312}}.

Part II is in two volumes. In Volume I, the preface explains the dictionary's composition, purpose and orthography and the main section is a "Syllabic Dictionary" in which [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] Chinese words are collated in [[alphabetical order]] {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|pp=1-1065}}. In Volume II, the first section contains a table of the [[Kangxi radical|214 ''Kangxi'' radicals]], a [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-and-stroke]] index of the characters in Volume I, and an English-to-Chinese index of words that gives the character numbers in Volume I {{harvcol|Morrison|1820|pp=iii–179}}. The second independent section "A Synopsis of Various Forms of the Chinese Character" giving the [[regular script]], [[semi-cursive script]], [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]], [[clerical script]], [[Small Seal Script|small seal script]], and [[bronze script]] forms of various [[Chinese character|characters]] {{harvcol|Morrison|1820|pp=1–305}}. Part II of the dictionary contains 12,674 character entries, far fewer than the 47,035 entries in Part I  {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=313}}. On the other hand, it continued to provide an estimated 20,000 examples and Chinese quotations in Chinese characters, accompanied with romanization and English translations, a vast improvement over earlier dictionaries without examples or Basilio Brollo's Chinese–Latin dictionaries, which presented its examples only in romanization {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=314}}. Vol. I was only published in Macao, but Vol. II was published simultaneously at London by Black, Parbury, &amp; Allen.

The preface notes Morrison's intent: "The Author's object has been, and the intention of the Dictionary ought to be, to communicate the Language to ''Europeans''." {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=viii}}. Its content is wide-ranging. "There are beautiful pieces of poetry, interesting and instructive portions of History and Biography; and important Moral Maxims, in Chinese that is a language amongst the ''most ancient'' and the ''most extensively'' known on earth,… it is the ''living language'' of five nations, which together, constitute one third of the mankind." Wu and Zheng say, "Far more than a mere dictionary of the Chinese language, Morrison's dictionary is a history book, a biography, a collection of idiomatic expressions and common sayings of the Chinese people, and, last but not least, full of the Christian evangelical message expressed in many ways." {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=7}}, In both Part I{{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|p=ix}} and II {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=37}}, discussion of paper ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|紙}}}}) occasions discussion of its invention by [[Cai Lun]], although his name appears as both "Tsae Lun" or "Tsae-lun" and one entry mistakenly places him in the 10th century {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=37}} instead of the 1st. Another example is the entry on {{lang|zh|{{linktext|猜}}}} (''cāi'', "guess; suspect"), which occasions a digression on a Chinese drinking game: "{{lang|zh|{{linktext|猜拳}}}} to guess the number of fingers thrown out, or stretched straight from a previously folded hand, which is a drunken amusement of the Chinese. When the opponent guesses the right number of fingers thrown out, at the instant he speaks, he wins, and the person throwing out his fingers has to drink as a forfeit." {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=8}}.

Part II—unlike Part I—includes notation regarding Chinese tones. Unfortunately, Morrison transcribed the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tone distinctions]] of [[Middle Chinese]] rhyme dictionaries rather than [[Chinese tones|those]] of [[modern Chinese]]. The romanizations of Part II are left unmarked for a "level" tone ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|平}}}}, ''píng''), given a [[grave accent]] (e.g., à) for a "rising" tone ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|上}}}}, ''shǎng''), given an [[acute accent]] (e.g., á) for a "departing" tone ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|去}}}}, ''qù''), and a [[breve]] (e.g., ǎ) for an "entering" tone. By the time Morrison was composing his dictionary, the old level tone had begun dividing into modern Mandarin's [[first tone (Mandarin)|high]] and [[second tone (Mandarin)|rising]] tones; the old rising tone had begun dividing into the modern [[third tone (Mandarin)|third]] and [[fourth tone (Mandarin)|falling]] tones;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and the entering tone had ceased to exist {{harvcol|Norman|1988|p=173}}. Only the old departing tone continued to exist, as the modern falling tone. (In other dialects of Chinese, such as [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], these tones developed separately{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} but Morrison employed the [[Nanjing dialect]] of his era's [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].) {{harvcol|Morrison|1815a|p=xviii}}{{harvcol|Morrison|1815b|p=x}}.

Part II also includes etymological glosses of the formation of the Chinese characters. Although these were often (inaccurate) guesses or [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]], they helped students of Chinese as a second language to comprehend and memorize characters. Wu Xian &amp; al. draw attention to his treatment of the character {{lang|zh|{{linktext|仰}}}} (''yǎng'', "look up; admire"), which now consists of [[Radical 9]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|人}}}}, "person") and {{lang|zh|{{linktext|卬}}}} (''áng'', "high") {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=7}}. Morrison wrote, "YANG 仰, from ''man'' and ''to look upwards''. To raise the head and look upwards with expectation or desire..." {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=994}}. Two subsequent centuries of study and archeological discoveries have greatly increased understanding of how Chinese characters originated. It is now established that "Originally {{lang|zh|卬}} depicted a person standing next to {{lang|zh|卩}} (''jié'') a person kneeling. Another {{lang|zh|{{linktext|亻}}}} ({{lang|zh|人}} ''rén'') person was added later, forming {{lang|zh|仰}}." {{harvcol|Wenlin Institute|2016|p=}}.

The entry for {{lang|zh|{{linktext|道}}}} in the second part of Morrison's dictionary gives a graphic variant {{lang|zh|{{linktext|衟}}}}, the entry number 9945, the acute accent [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|"departing" tone]], the character origin "From ''to walk'' and ''head''", translation equivalents, and 12 usage examples. The English translation runs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A way; a path; being at the head; the way that leads to; a thoroughfare on all sides. A principle. The priuciple {{sic}} from which heaven, earth, man, and all nature emanates. Le {{lang|zh|理}} is a latent principle; Tanu {{sic}} is a principle in action. Correct, virtuous principles and course of action. Order and good principles in a government and country. A word; to speak; to say; the way or cause from or by which; to direct; to lead in the way. To accord with or go in a course pointed out. The name of a country. Used by the Buddhists for a particular state of existence, whether amongst human beings or amongst brutes {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=820}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The usage examples include words from [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]]: "Taou {{lang|zh|道}} in the [[Tao Te Ching|books]] of [[Lao-tse|Laou-tsze]] is very like the ''Eternal Reason'' of which some Europeans speak; ''{{lang|la|Ratio}}'' of the [[Ancient Rome|Latins]], and the ''[[Logos]]'' of the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]."; and using ''zhì'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|帙}}}}, "cloth case for a book"), "Taou těë {{lang|zh|道帙}} a certificate by which the priests of Buddha are entitled to three days provision at every temple they go to."

{{anchor|III|Part III|An English and Chinese Dictionary}}

===Part III: An English and Chinese Dictionary===
Part III, '''''An English and Chinese Dictionary''''', was given without a Chinese supertitle. It comprises Morrison's English-to-Chinese dictionary and is arranged [[English alphabet|alphabetically]] from "A" ("A, {{lang|zh|英文音母碎字之第一}} Ying wǎn, yin moo suy tsze che te yǐh, The first letter of the English Alphabet.") {{harvcol|Morrison|1822b|p=1}} to "Zone" ("ZONE, a [[Zone (vestment)|girdle]], {{lang|zh|帶子}} tae tsze; {{lang|zh|圍帶}} wei tai.") {{harvcol|Morrison|1822b|p=480}}. It was printed simultaneously in London by Black, Parbury, &amp; Allen.

Its entries are terser than those of the Chinese volumes, particularly Part I, Volume 1. The entry for "way" is "WAY, road, or path, {{lang|zh|路}} loo; {{lang|zh|道}} taou; {{lang|zh|途}} too. A method or means, {{lang|zh|法}} fa" {{harvcol|Morrison|1822b|463}}. The fraught issue of [[Chinese names for the God of Abrahamic religions|Chinese names for God]] occasioned a somewhat fuller treatment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''GOD''' or the Deus of the Chinese was originally, and is still most generally {{lang|zh|{{linktext|神}}}} [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shin]]; in the plural, Dii, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|神鬼}}}} Shin kwei, and {{lang|zh|{{linktext|神祇}}}} Shin ke. A sort of Supreme God, is in the ancient books expressed by {{lang|zh|{{linktext|上帝}}}} [[shangdi|Shang-te]]. [[genius (spirit)|Genii]] of particular places are also expressed by {{lang|zh|{{linktext|神}}}} Shin, as {{lang|zh|{{linktext|河神}}}} ho shin, God of the river; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|山神}}}} shan shin, god of the hill, &amp;c. All these gods are in Chinese notions inferior to {{lang|zh|{{linktext|天}}}} [[tian|Ten]], Heaven {{harvcol|Morrison|1822b|pp=189–90}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
Robert Morrison's Chinese-English dictionary has received both blame and praise. Considering that he was a self-taught lexicographer who compiled a dictionary of such a colossal size and scope, working with assistants who did not speak English, it would inevitably fall short of perfection, such the typographical errors and misprints noted above. Within his lifetime, the publication of Morrison's Chinese dictionary did not bring him universal acclaim, but instead triggered a controversy as to the authorship {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=300}}. In 1818 and again in 1830, the German orientalist [[Julius Klaproth]] accused Morrison of merely translating Chinese dictionaries rather than compiling a new or original one {{harvcol|Klaproth|1818}}{{harvcol|Klaproth|1830}}. In response to Klaproth's challenges, Morrison wrote an 1831 letter to the ''Asiatic Journal'' that describes the dictionary's compilation in detail. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of no better way of writing a Dictionary of any language, than that which I pursued; namely, to make use of all the native Dictionaries I could collect, with the original books referred to in them; to employ native scholars to assist me in consulting those several works, and in ascertaining their exact meaning... In the whole of the work, there was no mere copying from one book into another; no mere translation from one language into another; but an exercise of judgment and choice, throughout: and if any man may be called the author of a Dictionary, Morrison may justly be called the author of the Dictionary attributed to him. {{harvcol|Morrison|1839|loc=Vol. II, pp. 453-454}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In retrospect, a "major flaw" in Morrison's dictionary is the failure to distinguish the [[phonemic contrast]] between [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and unaspirated consonants {{harvcol|Coblin|2003|p=352}}. [[Herbert Giles]]'s ''Chinese-English Dictionary'' says Morrison's 1819 volume gave no aspirates, "a defect many times worse" than would be omitting the [[rough breathing]] in a Greek lexicon, and Medhurst's 1843 edition attempted aspirates, but omitted many and wrongly inserted others {{harvcol|Giles|1892|p=vii}}. [[Samuel Wells Williams]]'s 1874 ''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language|Syllabic Dictionary]]'' was apparently the first dictionary to get this distinction sorted out {{harvcol|Norman|1988|p=173}}.

Another flaw is Morrison's treatment of some characters that have more than one pronunciation and meaning: {{lang|zh|{{linktext|臭}}}} means "foul; stinking; disgusting; disgraceful" when pronounced ''chòu'' but simply "odor; smell; scent" when read ''xiù'' {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=9}}. Morrison listed both senses with the first pronunciation and treated it as similar to the neutral and disagreeable senses of the English "smell":
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''{{lang|zh|臭}} Chow''' Smell or flavor generally; scent; offensive smell; disagreeable odours; fume or effluvia. Stink; to smell; that which is morally offensive. The character is formed from Keuen {{lang|zh|{{linktext|犬}}}} A dog, in allusion to that animal finding its way by the scent. {{lang|zh|{{linktext|香臭}}}} Heang chow, a fragrant smell; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|惡臭}}}} Gŏ chow, a bad smell; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|遺|臭|萬|年}}}} E chow wan nëen, to leave an eternal reproach on one's name; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|其|臭|如|蘭}}}} Ko chow joo lan, it smells fragrant as the [[orchid|Lan-flower]]. {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=94}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In these derived terms, the negative senses would be read ''chòu'', but the pleasant "fragrant as an orchid" would use the pronunciation ''xiù''. Another example is when he takes the {{lang|zh|{{linktext|郎}}}} in {{lang|zh|{{linktext|招|郎|入|室}}}} to mean "bride" {{harvcol|Morrison|1819|p=23}} when the intended sense is a "bridegroom" being invited to live with his in-laws {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=10}}.

On the other hand, Morrison's Chinese dictionary has won critical acclaims from scholars all over the world since the publication of the first volume in 1815. Alexander Leith Ross wrote to Morrison that his dictionary had an extensive circulation in Europe, and would be "an invaluable treasure to every student of Chinese" {{harvcol|Morrison|1839|loc=Vol. I, p. 494}}. The French sinologist [[Stanislas Julien]] described Part II as "without dispute, the best Chinese Dictionary composed in a European language" {{harvcol|Morrison|1865|p=i}}. The American missionary William A. Macy said all the missionaries and scholars of Chinese had used Morrison's dictionary as the "common fountain" from which they could "obtain the knowledge they desired" {{harvcol|Macy|1860|p=568}}. One modern scholar calls Morrison's dictionary "the greatest achievement of any researcher of Chinese" {{harvcol|Ryu|2009|p=9}}. Another describes the comprehensive bilingual dictionary compilation and publication project as "unprecedented and unsurpassed in 19th-century China" {{harvcol|Yang|2014|p=303}}. Wu and Zheng say Morrison's was the first widely used Chinese-English dictionary and has served as a "milestone in the early promotion of communications between China and the West" {{harvcol|Wu and Zheng|2009|p=3}}. A recent book on Chinese lexicography says that although Morrison's dictionary "contained numerous errors" when examined from a modern perspective, "the dictionary delineated the basic configuration of a bilingual dictionary and shed a good deal of light upon the design and compilation of English-Chinese, Chinese-English, and other bilingual dictionary types" {{harvcol|Yong and Peng|2008|p=386}}. Morrison's obituary notice summarizes his dedication and contribution to the world, "In efforts to make this [Chinese] language known to foreigners and chiefly to the English, he has done more than any other man living or dead." {{harvcol|Anon.|1835|p=178}}.

''A depiction of Ameinias, sculpted by [[Malcolm Lidbury]] for the 2016 Cornwall LGBT History project.'']]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Ameinias''' was a young man who fell in love with the beautiful Beotian hunter [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who had already spurned his male suitors, according to the version of Narcissus's myth by [[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] (''Narrations,'' 24). Narcissus also spurned him and gave him a sword. Ameinias committed suicide at Narcissus's doorstep after being rejected by Narcissus. He had prayed to [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] to give Narcissus a lesson for all the pain he provoked. Narcissus walked by a pool of water and decided to drink some. He saw his reflection, became entranced by it, and killed himself because he could not have his object of desire,&lt;ref name="greekmyths-greekmythology.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/narcissus-myth-echo/|title=The myth of Narcissus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or gazing endlessly at the image, he slowly pined away and was transformed by the [[nymphs]] into a [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus flower]]. Others say he was instead filled with remorse and killed himself beside the pool—and from his dying life's blood the flower was born.&lt;ref name="Narkissos in theoi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Narkissos.html|title=Narcissus and Ameinias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the 1986 Sveriges Radio's Christmas calendar|Bland tomtar och troll (radio programme)}}
'''''Among Gnomes and Trolls''''' ({{Lang-sv|Bland [[tomte|tomtar]] och [[troll]]}}), is a popular [[Sweden|Swedish]] folklore and fairy tales annual and children's fairy tale anthology published since 1907. One of the most noted of the early illustrators is artist [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]].

The first four volumes were illustrated by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]. Volume 5 (1911) was illustrated by Norwegian illustrator Louis Moe, after which Bauer resumed illustrating from 1912 to 1915 (volumes 6-9). 1916 had no issue, but the series continues in 1917, illustrated by Aina Masolle and Gustaf Tengren, marking the series' first woman illustrator. From 1918 to 1926 Gustaf Tenggren was the sole illustrator. Between 1927 and 1980, [[Einar Norelius]] was the chief illustrator. Among the writers were authors such as [[Hjalmar Bergman]], [[Helena Nyblom]], [[Margareta Ekström]], [[Gösta Knutsson]] and [[Edith Unnerstad]].&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;

Several books with extracts from the original volumes illustrated by John Bauer have been published. The first one was published in 1931 to raise money for a memorial honouring Bauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=John|title=John Bauers bästa: ett urval sagor ur Bland tomtar och troll åren 1907–1915|date=1931|publisher=Åhlén &amp; Åkerlund|location=Stockholm|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/john-bauers-basta-ett-urval-sagor-ur-bland-tomtar-och-troll-aren-1907-1915/oclc/492479986|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''André René Roussimoff''' (May 19, 1946 – January 27, 1993), best known as '''André the Giant''', was a French [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[actor]].&lt;ref name="OWO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|title=André the Giant Profile|accessdate=September 22, 2008|website=Online World of Wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921232831/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|archivedate=September 21, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He famously feuded with [[Hulk Hogan]], culminating at [[WrestleMania III]] in 1987. His best-remembered film role was that of Fezzik, the giant in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; His size was a result of [[gigantism]] caused by excess growth hormone, which later resulted in [[acromegaly]]. It also led to his being called "The [[Eighth Wonder of the World]]".&lt;ref name="wwearchive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andre the Giant: Bio |website=WWE |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/andrethegiant|accessdate=2 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501202657/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/andrethegiant/bio/|archivedate=May 1, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AndreWebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrethegiant.com/|title=André the Giant official website |accessdate=July 8, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022027/http://www.andrethegiant.com/|archivedate=July 4, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as [[WWE]]), André was a [[List of WWE Champions|one-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] and a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champion]]. In 1993, André was the first ever to be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1993)|class of 1993]].&lt;ref name="wwebio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Andre the Giant: Bio|website=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/andrethegiant |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book |title=WWE Legends |last=Solomon |first=Brian |pages=68–71 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] | year=2006|isbn=978-0-7434-9033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
André Roussimoff was born in [[Ussy-sur-Marne|Molien]], in the canton of [[La Ferté-sous-Jouarre|La Ferté-sous-jouarre]], of [[Slavs|Slavic]] heritage,{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hbo.com/content/hboweb/en/documentaries/andre-the-giant/andre-the-giant-synopsis.html |title=Andre The Giant |last=Sports |first=HBO |date=2018 |website=HBO.com |publisher=HBO Sports |access-date=April 10, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Boris and Mariann Roussimoff. His parents were immigrants to France, his father was [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. His nickname growing up was "Dédé". As a child, he displayed symptoms of [[gigantism]] very early, reaching a height of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a weight of {{convert|208|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} by the age of 12.

Roussimoff was a good student, particularly in [[mathematics]], but he dropped out after the eighth grade since he did not think having a [[Secondary school|high school]] education was necessary for a farm labourer. He spent years working on his father's farm, where, according to his brother, Jacques, he could perform the work of three men. He also completed an [[apprenticeship]] in woodworking, and next worked in a factory that manufactured engines for [[baler|hay balers]]. None of these occupations, however, brought him any satisfaction.&lt;ref name=AEbio&gt;{{cite episode |title=André the Giant |series=Biography |network=[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E Network]] | airdate=January 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career ===
At the age of 18, Roussimoff moved to Paris and was taught [[professional wrestling]] by a local promoter who recognised the earning potential of Roussimoff's size. He trained at night and worked as a mover during the day to pay living expenses.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; Roussimoff was billed as "Géant Ferré", a name based on the French folk hero [[:fr:Grand Ferré|Grand Ferré]],{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}} and began wrestling in Paris and nearby areas. Canadian promoter and wrestler Frank Valois met Roussimoff in 1966, becoming his business manager and adviser. Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Africa]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}}{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt;

He made his Japanese debut in 1970, billed as "Monster Roussimoff", wrestling for the [[International Wrestling Enterprise]]. Wrestling as both a singles and tag-team competitor, he quickly was made the company's tag-team champion alongside Michael Nador.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref name=IWAtagchamp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/iwe/iwe-t.html |title=IWA World Tag Team Title |website=Wrestling Titles |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Japan, doctors first informed Roussimoff that he suffered from [[acromegaly]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt;

Roussimoff next moved to [[Montréal]], Canada, where he became an immediate success, regularly selling out the [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pain and Passion |last=McCoy |first=Heath |page=96 |publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-787-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, promoters eventually ran out of plausible opponents for him and, as the novelty of his size wore off, the gate receipts dwindled.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; Roussimoff was defeated by [[Adnan Al-Kaissie]] in [[Baghdad]] in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;''The Sheik of Baghdad: Tales of Celebrity and Terror from Pro Wrestling's General Adnan'' Triumph Books 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestled numerous times in 1972 for Verne Gagne's [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as a special attraction until Valois appealed to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince McMahon Sr.]], founder of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), for advice.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=9}} McMahon suggested several changes. He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster, and to enhance the perception of his size, McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as [[dropkick]]s (although he was capable of performing such agile maneuvers before his health deteriorated in later life). He also began billing Roussimoff as "André the Giant" and set up a travel-intensive schedule, lending him to wrestling associations around the world,&lt;ref name=Legends /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dusty: Reflections of an American Dream |last=Rhodes |first=Dusty |authorlink=Dusty Rhodes (wrestler) |pages=95–96 |publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2005 |isbn=978-1-58261-907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=71}} to keep him from becoming overexposed in any area.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; Promoters had to guarantee Roussimoff a certain amount of money as well as pay McMahon's WWWF booking fee.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=12–13}}

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation ===

==== "Undefeated streak" (1973–1987) ====
On March 26, 1973, André debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later World Wrestling Federation) as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], defeating [[Buddy Wolfe]] in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWWF73"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/73.htm |title=WWWF @ New York City, NY – Madison Square Garden – March 26, 1973 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André was one of professional wrestling's most beloved "[[BabyFace (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]" throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. As such, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] often stated that André had never been defeated for 15 years by pinfall or submission prior to [[WrestleMania III]]; however, André had lost in matches outside of the WWF: a pinfall loss in Mexico to [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]] in 1984 and a submission loss in Japan to [[Antonio Inoki]] in 1986.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/inoki.html |title=Antonio Inoki: Career History |website=Puroresu Central |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had sixty-minute time-limit draws with the two other major world champions of the day, [[Harley Race]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

In 1976, André fought professional [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Chuck Wepner]] in an unscripted boxer-versus-wrestler fight. The wild fight was shown via telecast as part of the undercard of the [[Muhammad Ali]] versus Antonio Inoki fight and ended when André threw Wepner over the top rope and outside the ring and won via count out.

In 1980, he feuded with Hulk Hogan, where unlike their more famous matches in the late 1980s, Hogan was the villain and André was the hero, wrestling him at Shea Stadium's [[Showdown at Shea]] and in Pennsylvania, where after André pinned Hogan to win the match, Hogan bodyslammed André much like their legendary WrestleMania III match in 1987. The feud continued in Japan in 1982 and 1983 with their roles reversed and with Antonio Inoki also involved.

In 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wide Wrestling Federation to his son, [[Vince McMahon]], Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling |last=Hornbaker |first=Tim |page=193 |publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him. McMahon signed André to these terms in 1984, although he still allowed him to work in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=69–70}}

One of André's feuds pitted him against the "Mongolian Giant" [[Killer Khan]]. According to the storyline, Khan had snapped André's ankle during a match on May 2, 1981, in [[Rochester, New York]], by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his knee-drop.&lt;ref name=MainEvent&gt;{{cite book |title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s |last=Shields |first=Brian |pages=55–58 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] | year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, André had broken his ankle getting out of bed the morning before the match.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=48}} The injury and subsequent rehabilitation was worked into the existing André/Khan storyline. After a stay at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, André returned with payback on his mind. The two battled on July 20, 1981, at Madison Square Garden in a match that resulted in a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|double disqualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=339 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their feud continued as fans filled arenas up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to witness their matches. On November 14, 1981, at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]], André decisively defeated Khan in what was billed as a "Mongolian stretcher match", in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=48–60}} The same type of match was also held in Toronto. In early 1982 the two also fought in a series of matches in Japan with Arnold Skaaland in André's corner.

[[File:Andre the Giant.jpg|thumb|André (second from right) feuded with [[Big John Studd]] (left) in the build towards [[WrestleMania I]], and later with [[King Kong Bundy]] (second from left)]]
Another feud involved a man who considered himself to be the "true giant" of wrestling: [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=MainEvent /&gt; Throughout the early to mid-1980s, André and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try to determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level when he and partner [[Ken Patera]] knocked out André during a televised tag-team match and proceeded to cut off André's hair.&lt;ref name=MainEvent /&gt; After gaining revenge on Patera, André met Studd in a "[[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]] challenge" at the first [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]], held March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.&lt;ref name="Shields2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Shields |title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ktv7Nj2C9QUC&amp;pg=PA150 |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4516-0467-2 |pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; André slammed Studd to win the match and collect the [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 prize, then proceeded to throw cash to the fans before having the bag taken from him by Studd's manager, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]].&lt;ref name=WMIfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |title=WrestleMania I Facts/Stats |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021042204/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |archivedate=October 21, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at [[WrestleMania 2]], on April 7, 1986, André continued to display his dominance by winning a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which featured top [[National Football League]] stars and wrestlers.&lt;ref name=WM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/ |title=WrestleMania 2 results |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029102035/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/ |archivedate=October 29, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; André last eliminated [[Bret Hart]] to win the contest.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=107}}

After WrestleMania 2, André continued his feud with Studd and [[King Kong Bundy]]. Around this time, André requested a leave of absence to tend to his health, effects from his acromegaly that were beginning to take their toll, as well as tour Japan. He had also been cast in the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. To explain André's absence, a storyline was developed in which Heenan—suggesting that André was secretly afraid of Studd and Bundy, whom Heenan bragged were unbeatable—challenged André and a partner of his choosing to wrestle Studd and Bundy in a televised tag-team match. When André failed to show, WWF president [[Jack Tunney]] indefinitely suspended him.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |title=WWE Encyclopedia |last1=Shields |first1=Brian |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin |pages=12–13 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]] | year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the summer of 1986, upon André's return to the United States, he began wearing a mask and competing as the "Giant Machine" in a stable known as [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|the Machines]]. ([[Blackjack Mulligan|Big Machine]] and [[Bill Eadie|Super Machine]] were the other members, (Hulk Hogan (as "Hulk Machine") and [[Roddy Piper]] (as "Piper Machine") were also one-time members).  The WWF's television announcers sold the Machines—a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was copied from the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character "Super Strong Machine", played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html |title=The Machines' Profile |website=Online World of Wrestling |accessdate=July 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210036/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html |archivedate=June 21, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; —as "a new tag-team from Japan" and claimed not to know the identities of the wrestlers, even though it was obvious to fans that it was André competing as the Giant Machine. Heenan, Studd, and Bundy complained to Tunney, who eventually told Heenan that if it could be proven that André and the Giant Machine were the same person, André would be fired. André thwarted Heenan, Studd, and Bundy at every turn. Then, in late 1986, the Giant Machine "disappeared," and André was reinstated. Foreshadowing André's heel turn, Heenan expressed his approval of the reinstatement but did not explain why.

==== WWF Champion and various rivalries (1987–1989) ====
[[File:Andre and Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|right|André was managed by [[Bobby Heenan]] (foreground) during parts of his feud with [[Hulk Hogan]].]]

André agreed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in early 1987 to be the counter to the biggest "[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]" in professional wrestling at that time, [[Hulk Hogan]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=131}} On an edition of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' in 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] for three years; André came out to congratulate him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=132–133}} On the following week's ''Piper's Pit'', André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being "the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history." Although André had suffered a handful of [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate André and ended up being the focal point of the interview. Apparently annoyed, André walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=134–135}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm |title=WWF @ East Rutherford, NJ – Meadowlands – January 5, 1987 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=April 2, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510061259/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discussion between André and Hogan was scheduled, and on a ''Piper's Pit'' that aired February 7, 1987, the two met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm |title=WWF @ Tampa, FL – SunDome – January 26, 1987 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=March 27, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510061259/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm| archivedate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan was introduced first, followed by André. André was led by longtime rival Bobby Heenan.

Speaking on behalf of his new protégé, Heenan accused Hogan of being André's friend only so he would not have to defend his title against him. Hogan tried to reason with André, but his pleas were ignored as he challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania III]]. Hogan was still seemingly in disbelief as to what André was doing, prompting Heenan to say "You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan" before André ripped off the T-shirt and crucifix from Hogan, with the crucifix scratching Hogan's chest, causing him to bleed.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=136–139}}

Following Hogan's acceptance of André's challenge on a later edition of ''Piper's Pit'', the two were part of a 20-man over-the-top rope battle-royal on the 14 March edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event results|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="history623"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=623 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the battle royal was won by [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], André claimed to have gained a psychological advantage over Hogan when he threw the WWF World Heavyweight Champion over the top rope. The match, which was actually taped on February 21, 1987,&lt;ref name="history623" /&gt; aired only two weeks before WrestleMania III to make it seem like Hogan had met his match in André the Giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIfSsZa186w |title=Battle Royal with Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant |date=July 8, 2013 |author=WWE |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At WrestleMania III, he was billed at {{convert|520|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}},&lt;ref name=WMIII&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116004246/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 16, 2006 |title=WrestleMania III – André the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan – WWE Championship |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011|quote=It was billed as the biggest main event in the history of sports entertainment: Hollywood Hogan vs. Andre the Giant. Hogan, in his third year as WWE Champion, was set for the biggest challenge of his life in the form of the 7-foot-4, 520-pound Andre, who betrayed his former best friend in exchange for his long-awaited shot at the championship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stress of such immense weight on his bones and joints resulted in constant pain.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; After recent back surgery, he was also wearing a brace underneath his wrestling singlet.{{sfnp|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|pp=71–72}} In front of a record crowd, Hogan won the match after body-slamming André (later dubbed "the bodyslam heard around the world"), followed by Hogan's running leg drop finisher.&lt;ref name=WMIII /&gt; Years later, Hogan claimed that André was so heavy, he felt more like {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and that he tore his [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] when slamming him.

Another myth about the match is that no one, not even WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], knew until the day of the event whether André would lose the match. In reality, André had agreed to lose the match some time before, mostly for health reasons. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body-slammed André in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan had slammed a then-face André following their match at the "[[Showdown at Shea]]" on August 9, 1980, though André was much lighter (around {{convert|470|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}) and more athletic at the time (Hogan also slammed André in a match in [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania]], a month later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology|medium=DVD |publisher=[[WWE]] | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in the territorial days of American wrestling three years before WWF began national expansion, so many of those who watched WrestleMania III had never seen the Giant slammed (André had also previously allowed [[Harley Race]], [[Canek (wrestler)|El Canek]] and [[Stan Hansen]], among others, to slam him).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=157}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story |last=Race |first=Harley |authorlink=Harley Race |page=90 |publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C. |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58261-818-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of WrestleMania III, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the André–Hogan match that took place then. The feud between André and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. During their approximately one minute of battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated André and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by André's partners, Bundy and [[One Man Gang]], and would be counted out. André went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 – Main Event |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before Hogan returned to the ring to attack André and knock him out of the ring. André later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull André away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a piece of wood over André's back (which he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|no-sold]]) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the ''SNME'' battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and André, and to make it seem that André was certain to win easily when they did meet.

In the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|the "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to André to win it for him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=172–175}} André and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-André rematch on ''The Main Event'', to air 5 February 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, André won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was "detained backstage", and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,&lt;ref&gt;Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television, February 5, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; but was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, [[Earl Hebner]]),&lt;ref&gt;"A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow," ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.

After winning, André "sold" the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF president]] Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant.&lt;ref name=wwechamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |title=Andre the Giant's first reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624001310/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |archivedate=June 24, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], André and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that André was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, André and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.

At the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], André and DiBiase (billed as [[The Mega Bucks]]) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]] (known as [[The Mega Powers]]) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, [[Miss Elizabeth]], (Savage's wife Elizabeth Hulette) distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.

Concurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, André was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out André with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, André regularly got the upper hand in the feud.

[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|André's feud with [[Jake Roberts]] derived from André's [[ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].]]
André's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said André was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened André; as a result, André suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside during André's matches, causing him to run from the ring in fright (since he knew what was inside the bag). Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger André.

In 1989, André and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and André as the heel. During the late summer and Autumn of 1989, André engaged in a brief feud, consisting almost entirely of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squashed]] the aging André in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the "next big thing".{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=297–300}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling |last=Hart |first=Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart |page=233 |publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA#Current imprints|Grand Central Publishing]] | year=2008 |isbn=978-0-446-53972-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Colossal Connection (1989–1990) ====
{{Main|The Colossal Connection|l1=The Colossal Connection}}
In late 1989, André was joined with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] to form a new tag team called [[the Colossal Connection]], in part to fill a void left by the departure of [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] ([[the Brain Busters]], who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging André in the main event spotlight. The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters). At a television taping on December 13, 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles.&lt;ref name=tagchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121 |title=Andre the Giant and Haku's first reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720013735/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121 |archivedate=July 20, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; André and Haku successfully defended their title, mostly against Demolition, until [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241 |title=Demolition's third reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128115003/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241 |archivedate=November 28, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, a furious Heenan blamed André for the title loss and after shouting at him, slapped him in the face; an angry André responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=321–322}} André also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting support for André and turning him face for the first time since 1987. Due to his ongoing health issues, André was not able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging in André.

On weekend television shows following WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan vowed to spit in André's face when he came crawling back to the Heenan Family. However André would wrestle one more time with Haku, teaming up to face Demolition on a house show in Honolulu, HI, on April 10, André was knocked out of the ring and The Colossal Connection lost via countout. After the match, André and Haku would fight each other, marking the end of the team. André's final match of 1990 came at a combined WWF/All Japan/New Japan show on April 13 in Tokyo, Japan when teamed with [[Giant Baba]] to defeat Demolition in a non-title match. André would win by gaining the pinfall on [[Barry Darsow|Smash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm |title=1990 |work=The History of WWE |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sporadic appearances (1990–1992) ====
André returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, André made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11 in Reseda, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/indy/uwf/uwfcards.html |title=Herb Abram's Universal Wrestling Federation Cards |work=Pro-Wrestling History |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with [[Captain Lou Albano]] and put over the UWF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSE0klOkkII |title=Andre the Giant &amp; Lou Albano UWF January 1991 |author=Andre The Giant |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on November 30 at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced André's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). André was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-VFCvdFtbc |title=WWF Primetime 1991 Royal Rumble Report |author=MrYoyo123321 |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His on-air return finally took place at the WWF's ''Super-Stars &amp; Stripes Forever'' [[USA Network]] special on March 17, 1991, when he came out to shake the hand of [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]] after an altercation with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, at [[WrestleMania VII]], he came to the aid of the Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=326}} André finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=1991 |work=The History of WWE |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10 he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit.&lt;ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com" /&gt; (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], and [[Mr. Fuji]]) trying to recruit André one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to André and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, [[Jimmy Hart]] appeared live on ''WWF Superstars'' to announce that he had successfully signed André to tag-team with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]. However, when asked to confirm this by [[Gene Okerlund]], André denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking André from behind (injuring his knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1991 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |quote=(Date: May 6, 1991 Shown: June 1, 1991) Included an in-ring interview by Gene Okerlund in which André the Giant refused Jimmy Hart's offer to become his manager only to have his knee attacked by Earthquake, using Hart's megaphone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]] and forming [[the Natural Disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1991 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |quote=(Date: May 28, 1991 Shown: June 15, 1991)Earthquake &amp; WWF Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated Tugboat &amp; the Bushwhackers at 4:05 when Earthquake pinned Luke with a sit-down splash after Tugboat attacked both of his teammates; after the match, Tugboat embraced with his new friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to André's final major WWF appearance at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam '91]], where he seconded [[the Bushwhackers]] in their match against the Disasters.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=333}} André was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack André, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and André, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with André's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

His last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XX: 20th Anniversary|Clash of the Champions XX]]'' special that aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on 2 September 1992.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=336}}

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling and Universal Wrestling Association (1990–1992) ===
After WrestleMania VI, André spent the rest of his in-ring career in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and Mexico's [[Universal Wrestling Association]], where he performed under the name "André el Gigante." He toured with AJPW three times per year, from 1990 to 1992, usually teaming with [[Giant Baba]] in tag-team matches.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=335}} He also made a couple of guest appearances for Herb Abrams' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], in 1991, feuding with [[Big John Studd]], though he never had a match in the promotion. He did his final tour of Mexico in 1992 in a selection of six-man tag matches alongside [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and a variety of Lucha Libre stars facing among others [[Bad News Allen]] and future WWF Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=926&amp;page=4&amp;year=1992&amp;promotion=68 |title=Matches: Andre The Giant: Wrestlers Database |work=The Internet Wrestling Database |first=Philip |last=Kreikenbohm}}&lt;/ref&gt; André wrestled his final match for AJPW in 1992, after which he retired from professional wrestling.

== Acting career ==
André branched out into acting again in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967 French boxing film, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch ("[[Bigfoot]]") in a two-part episode aired in 1976 on the television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=18–19}} He appeared in other television shows, including ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'', ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]'', ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and 1990's ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]''.

Towards the end of his career, André starred in several films. He had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' as Dagoth,{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=79}} the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]). That same year, André also made an appearance in ''[[Micki &amp; Maude]]'' (billed as André Rousimmoff). He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role,&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; in the 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. Both the film and André's performance retain a devoted following.  In shoot interviews, wrestlers have stated that Andre was so proud of being in "Princess Bride", he carried a copy of the movie everywhere he went to watch whenever he could.

In his last film, he appeared in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]] as a [[circus]] giant in the comedy ''[[Trading Mom]]'', which was released a year after his death.

==Personal life and death==
Roussimoff was mentioned in the ''[[Guinness World Records|1974 Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the highest-paid wrestler in history at that time. He had earned US $400,000 in one year during the early 1970s.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=18}}

Roussimoff has been unofficially crowned "the greatest drunk on Earth"{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=123}} for once consuming 119 {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} beers (over 41 litres/72 pints) in six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madconomist.com/5-coolest-beer-records |title=5 Coolest Beer Records |website=MadConomist |last=Davydov |first=Dmitri|date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an episode of WWE's ''Legends of Wrestling'', [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] said Roussimoff once drank 156 {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} beers (over 73 litres/126 pints) in one sitting, which was confirmed by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. [[The Fabulous Moolah]] wrote in her autobiography that Roussimoff drank 127 beers in a [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], hotel bar and later passed out in the lobby. The staff could not move him and had to leave him there until he awoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellison |first=Lillian |authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah |title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003 |isbn=978-0-06-001258-8 |publisher=ReaganBooks |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tale recounted by [[Cary Elwes]] in his book about the making of ''The Princess Bride'' has Roussimoff falling on top of somebody while drunk, after which the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] sent an undercover officer to follow Roussimoff around whenever he went out drinking in their city to make sure he did not fall on anyone again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Elwes |first=Cary |authorlink=Cary Elwes |last2=Layden |first2=Joe |title=As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4767-6402-3 |publisher=Touchstone |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story also says prior to his famous [[WrestleMania III]] match, Andre drank 14 bottles of wine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250824/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv | title=WrestleMania III (1987)}}&lt;/REF&gt;

An [[urban legend]] exists surrounding Roussimoff's 1987 surgery in which his size made it impossible for the [[anesthesiologist]] to estimate a dosage via standard methods; consequently, his alcohol tolerance was used as a guideline instead, which has since become a widely used measuring tool in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2013/10/27/true-stories-from-the-fake-world-of-pro-wrestling/ True stories from the fake world of wrestling], by David Shoemaker, at the ''[[New York Post]]''; published October 27, 2013; retrieved March 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff was arrested by the [[Linn County, Iowa]], sheriff in 1989 and charged with assault after he allegedly roughed up a local television cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |title=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530034919/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |archivedate=May 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=300}}

[[William Goldman]], the author of the novel and the screenplay of ''The Princess Bride'', wrote in his nonfiction work ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' that Roussimoff was one of the gentlest and most generous people he ever knew. Whenever Roussimoff ate with someone in a restaurant, he would pay, but he would also insist on paying when he was a guest. After one meal, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] had quietly moved to the cashier to pay before Roussimoff could, but then found himself being physically lifted, carried from his table and deposited on top of his car by Roussimoff and [[Wilt Chamberlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uproxx.com/videos/2012/09/arnold-schwarzeneggers-dinner-wilt-chamberlain-andre-giant/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dinner With Wilt Chamberlain and Andre the Giant |first= |last= |website=Uproxx |date= 2012-09-25|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is despite the lack of official references to Roussimoff's height other than the 7&amp;nbsp;ft 4 in (224&amp;nbsp;cm) (the WWE website lists Roussimoff as being 7'4").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/superstars/andrethegiant Andre the Giant WWE bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff owned a ranch in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]], looked after by two of his close friends. When he was not on the road, he loved spending time at the ranch tending to his cattle, playing with his dogs and entertaining company. While there were custom-made chairs and a few other modifications in his home to account for his size, tales that everything in his home was custom-made for a large man are said to be exaggerated. Since Roussimoff could not easily go shopping due to his fame and size, he was known to spend hours watching [[QVC]] and made frequent purchases from the shopping channel.&lt;ref name="Being Andre the Giant"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/general/feature/25122751/being-andre-the-giant|title=Being Andre the Giant|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff died in his sleep of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] on the night of January 27, 1993, in a Paris hotel room. He was found by his [[chauffeur]].&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=337}} He was in Paris to attend his father's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D6113AF932A05752C0A965958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Andre&amp;st=nyt |title=Andre the Giant, 46, Professional Wrestler (Obituary) |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 31, 1993 |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Roussimoff decided to stay in France longer to be with his mother on her birthday. He spent the day before his death visiting and playing cards with some of his oldest friends in Molien.&lt;ref name="Being Andre the Giant"/&gt;

André had finalized his will in New York on October 30, 1990, with his lawyer. In the will, André specified that his remains be cremated and "disposed of". Upon his death in Paris, André's family in France held a funeral for him, intending to bury him near his father. When they learned of André's wish to be cremated, his body was flown to the United States, where he was [[cremated]] according to his wishes.&lt;ref name="Being Andre the Giant"/&gt; His ashes were scattered at his ranch ({{coord|35.116211|-79.80634|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-NC|name=Roussimoff Ranch}}) in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="AEbio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/4797970/ |title=Andre the Giant lived, died in small N.C. town |website=WRAL News |location=Raleigh, NC |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as per his will, André left his estate to his sole beneficiary: his daughter Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HBO|title=Andre The Giant|url=https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/andre-the-giant|website=HBO|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other media ==

André made numerous appearances as himself in video games, starting with ''[[WWF WrestleMania (1989 video game)|WWF WrestleMania]]''. He also appears posthumously in ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', ''[[WWF No Mercy]]'', ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw]]'', ''[[WWE All Stars]]'', [[WWE 2K14]], [[WWE 2K16]], ''[[WWE 2K17]]'', ''[[WWE 2K18]]'', ''[[WWE 2K19]]'' and many others.

In January 2005, WWE released ''André The Giant'', a [[DVD]] focusing on the life and career of André. The DVD is a reissue of the out-of-print ''André The Giant'' [[VHS]] made by [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] in 1985, with commentary by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] and [[Tazz]] replacing Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura's commentary on his WrestleMania match with Big John Studd. The video is hosted by [[Lord Alfred Hayes]]. Later matches, including André's battles against Hulk Hogan while a heel, are not included on this VHS.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Big Show with Andre the Giant trophy.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Big Show]] – a wrestler often compared with André due to his size – was the winner of the 2015 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at [[WrestleMania 31]], and is posing alongside the [[André the Giant Memorial Trophy]], which goes to the winner of the annual match.]]
* In 1993, when the then-World Wrestling Federation created the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]], André the Giant was the inaugural and sole inductee in the [[WWE Hall of Fame (1993)|class of 1993]].&lt;ref name="wwebio" /&gt;
* André was the inspiration for the [[1998 in film|1998 film]] ''[[My Giant]]'', written by his friend [[Billy Crystal]], whom he had met during the filming of ''The Princess Bride''.
* Paul Wight, better known as [[Big Show]], is more similar in body structure to André than any other wrestler since André's death. He was originally billed as the son of André during his stint in WCW (when he was known as simply "the Giant") despite there being no biological relationship.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=341–342}} While also suffering from acromegaly, unlike André, Wight did get surgery on his [[pituitary gland]] in the early 1990s, which successfully halted the progress of his condition. The former wrestler [[Jorge González (wrestler)|Giant González]] suffered from problems similar to those that André had near the end of his life and died in 2010 due to [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] complications.
* In 1999, André was the subject of an episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|A&amp;E Biography]]'', titled ''André the Giant: Larger Than Life''. The documentary covered André's childhood and early life in France, as well as the beginning of his wrestling career, his struggles with acromegaly, his personal life, and his final years. André's brother, Jacques Roussimoff, was interviewed for the documentary, as were fellow wrestling personalities [[Gorilla Monsoon]], [[Tim White (wrestling)|Tim White]], [[Arnold Skaaland]], [[Vince McMahon]], [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Killer Kowalski]], [[Rene Goulet]], and Frenchy Bernard, as well as wrestling historian Sheldon Goldberg. Several of André's longtime hometown friends were interviewed as well. The documentary described André as pro wrestling's "first and only international attraction" and that "on his broad shoulders, wrestling rose from its status as a questionable sport to become big business, and some might argue, performance art."
* The [[Andre the Giant Has a Posse|Obey]] brand icon originated from wheatpaste posters that artist [[Shepard Fairey]] created based upon a photo of André the Giant that he had found in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20071230-9999-mz1a30art.html |title=Social ferment not always reflected in fermentation of artworks |first=Robert L. |last=Pincus |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Capcom]]'s video game character [[Hugo (Street Fighter)|Hugo]], from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series (known as Andore in the ''[[Final Fight]]'' series) is based on him.
* The 2014 graphic novel ''André The Giant: The Life and The Legend'' (First Second Books), written and drawn by [[Box Brown]], tells the story of André's life and career. Research for the book included interviews with André's fellow wrestlers and actors such as [[Christopher Guest]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and others.
* On the March 10, 2014, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', [[WrestleMania XXX]] host Hulk Hogan announced that in honor of André's legacy, he was establishing the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, that would take place at the event, with the winner receiving the [[André the Giant Memorial Trophy]] (made in the likeness of André).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2014-03-10/wwe-raw-results-26193637 |title=Raw results: Bryan occupies Raw and Triple H says 'YES!' ... with a twist |work=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2014, at WrestleMania XXX, [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] won the match after eliminating Big Show using a body slam similar to the body slam Hulk Hogan used on André at WrestleMania III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/466849-and-the-winner-of-the-andre-the-giant-battle-royal-is |title=And the Winner of the Andre the Giant Battle Royal Is… |first=Nick |last=Paglino |date=April 6, 2014 |work=Wrestlezone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biopic ===
{{further|André the Giant (film)}}
On 9 May 2016, it was announced that a movie based on the 2015 authorized graphic novel biography ''André the Giant: Closer to Heaven'' was in the plans made by Lion Forge Comics along with producers [[Scott Steindorff]], [[Dylan Russell]] and consulted by André's daughter, Robin Christensen-Roussimoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/andre-the-giant-biopic-1201769286/|title=Andre The Giant Biopic in the Works (EXCLUSIVE)|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=May 9, 2016|work=Variety|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=F7sVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Translation of this scanned page]'' &lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, ''The Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar,'' p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''''' is a collection of [[annals]] in [[Old English]] chronicling the history of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The original manuscript of the ''Chronicle'' was created late in the 9th century, probably in [[Wessex]], during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] (r. 871–899). Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the ''Chronicle'' was still being actively updated in 1154.

Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]] after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the ''Chronicle'' is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]]), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''.

The ''Chronicle'' is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the ''Chronicle'' is the single most important historical source for the period in [[British Isles (terminology)#England|England]] between the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the Romans]] and the decades following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the [[history of the English language]]; in particular, the later [[Peterborough Chronicle|Peterborough text]] is one of the earliest examples of [[Middle English]] in existence.

Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the [[British Library]]. The remaining two are in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford and the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College|Parker Library]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].

==Composition==
All of the surviving manuscripts are copies, so it is not known for certain where or when the first version of the ''Chronicle'' was composed. It is generally agreed that the original version – sometimes known as the ''Early English Annals''&lt;ref&gt;G. O Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; – was written in the late 9th century by a scribe in Wessex.&lt;ref name=Abels_15/&gt;&lt;ref name=KL_41/&gt;{{refn|For example, Richard Abels says that "historians are in basic agreement that the original ''Chronicle'' extended to at least 890." Keynes and Lapidge suggest that "the return of the Vikings to England appears to have occasioned the 'publication', in late 892 or early 893, of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''".&lt;ref name=Abels_15&gt;Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KL_41&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} [[Frank Stenton]] argued from internal evidence that it was first compiled for a secular, but not royal patron; and that “its origin is in one of the south-western shires...at some point not far from the boundary between Somerset and Dorset”.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Stenton, 'The South-Western Element in the Old English Chronicle', in A. G. Little ed, ''Essays in Medieval History presented to T. F. Tout'' (Manchester 1925) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  After the original ''Chronicle'' was compiled, copies were made and distributed to various monasteries. Additional copies were made, for further distribution or to replace lost manuscripts, and some copies were updated independently of each other. Some of these later copies are those that have survived.&lt;ref name=MS_xx&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xx–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant manuscript, the ''Winchester Chronicle'', was written by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, in the margin of the next line; subsequent material was written by other scribes.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xxi–xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop [[Asser]]'s use of a version of the Chronicle in his work ''Life of King Alfred'', known to have been composed in 893.&lt;ref name=KL_55&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original ''Chronicle''; as a result, there is no proof that the ''Chronicle'' was compiled at [[Winchester]].&lt;ref name=CampbellTAS158&gt;Wormald, "Alfredian Manuscripts", p. 158, in Campbell ''et al.'', ''The Anglo-Saxons''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a [[written language]]. The ''Chronicle'', as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_12&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving manuscripts==
[[File:ASC Parker page.png|thumb|right|250px|A page from the Winchester, or Parker, Chronicle, showing the genealogical preface]]

Of the nine surviving manuscripts, seven are written entirely in [[Old English language|Old English]] (also known as Anglo-Saxon). One, known as the ''Bilingual Canterbury Epitome'', is in Old English with a translation of each annal into [[Latin]]. Another, the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]]'', is in Old English except for the last entry, which is in early [[Middle English]]. The oldest (Corp. Chris. MS 173) is known as the ''Winchester Chronicle'' or the ''Parker Chronicle'' (after [[Matthew Parker]], an [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who once owned it). Six of the manuscripts were printed in an 1861 edition for the [[Rolls Series]] by [[Benjamin Thorpe]] with the text laid out in columns labelled A to F.  He also included the few readable remnants of a burned seventh manuscript, which he referred to as [G].  Following this convention, the two additional manuscripts are often called [H] and [I]. The surviving manuscripts are listed below.

==Relationships between the manuscripts==
[[File:ASC schematic.svg|thumb|right|500px|The relationships between seven of the different manuscripts of the Chronicle. The fragment [H] cannot be reliably positioned in the chart. Other related texts are also shown. The diagram shows a putative original, and also gives the relationships of the manuscripts to a version produced in the north of England that did not survive but which is thought to have existed.]]
The manuscripts are all thought to derive from a common original, but the connections between the texts are more complex than simple inheritance via copying. The diagram at right gives an overview of the relationships between the manuscripts. The following is a summary of the relationships that are known.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt;
*[A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] was a copy of [A], made in Winchester, probably between 1001 and 1013.
*[B] was used in the compilation of [C] at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], in the mid-11th century. However, the scribe for [C] also had access to another version, which has not survived.
*[D] includes material from [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by 731 and from a set of 8th-century Northumbrian annals and is thought to have been copied from a northern version that has not survived.
*[E] has material that appears to derive from the same sources as [D] but does not include some additions that appear only in [D], such as the [[Mercia]]n Register.  This manuscript was composed at the [[Peterborough Cathedral|monastery in Peterborough]], some time after a fire there in 1116 that probably destroyed their copy of the Chronicle; [E] appears to have been created thereafter as a copy of a [[Kent]]ish version, probably from [[Canterbury]].
*[F] appears to include material from the same Canterbury version that was used to create [E].
*Asser's ''Life of King Alfred'', which was written in 893, includes a translation of the Chronicle's entries from 849 to 887.  Only [A], of surviving manuscripts, could have been in existence by 893, but there are places where Asser departs from the text in [A], so it is possible that Asser used a version that has not survived.{{refn|For example, Asser omits Esla from Alfred's genealogy; [A] includes Esla but [D] does not.&lt;ref name=KL_228-229&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp.&amp;nbsp;228–229, n.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}
*{{anchor|chronicle}}[[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]] wrote a translation of the Chronicle, known as the  ''Chronicon Æthelweardi'', into Latin in the late 10th century; the version  he used probably came from the same branch in the tree of relationships that [A] comes from.&lt;ref name=MS_xix_2/&gt;
*Asser's text agrees with [A] and with Æthelweard's text in some places against the combined testimony of [B], [C], [D] and [E], implying that there is a common ancestor for the latter four manuscripts.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt;
*At Abingdon, some time between 1120 and 1140, an unknown author wrote a Latin chronicle known as the ''[[Annals of St Neots]]''.  This work includes material from a copy of the Chronicle, but it is very difficult to tell which version because the annalist was selective about his use of the material. It may have been a northern [[recension]], or a Latin derivative of that recension.&lt;ref name=MS_xix_2&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xix–xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the manuscripts described above share a chronological error between the years 756 and 845, but it is apparent that the composer of the ''Annals of St Neots'' was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have preceded them. Æthelweard's copy did have the chronological error but it had not lost a whole sentence from annal 885; all the surviving manuscripts have lost this sentence.  Hence the error and the missing sentence must have been introduced in separate copying steps, implying that none of the surviving manuscripts are closer than two removes from the original version.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', pp.&amp;nbsp;113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the manuscripts==
[[File:ASC.svg|thumb|right|350px|A map showing the places where the various chronicles were written, and where they are now kept.]]

===Winchester Chronicle===
[A]: The ''Winchester'' (or ''Parker'') Chronicle is the oldest manuscript of the ''Chronicle'' that survives. It was begun at [[Old Minster, Winchester]], towards the end of Alfred's reign. The manuscript begins with a genealogy of Alfred, and the first chronicle entry is for the year 60 BC.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; The section containing the ''Chronicle'' takes up folios 1–32.&lt;ref name=ker57/&gt; Unlike the other manuscripts, [A] is of early enough composition to show entries dating back to the late 9th century in the hands of different scribes as the entries were made. The first scribe's hand is dateable to the late 9th or very early 10th century; his entries cease in late 891, and the following entries were made at intervals throughout the 10th century by several scribes. The eighth scribe wrote the annals for the years 925–955, and was clearly at Winchester when he wrote them since he adds some material related to events there; he also uses ''ceaster'', or "city", to mean Winchester.&lt;ref name=EHD_109-12&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', pp.&amp;nbsp;109–112.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript becomes independent of the other recensions after the entry for 975. The book, which also had a copy of the [[Doom book|Laws of Alfred]] and [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] bound in after the entry for 924, was transferred to Canterbury some time in the early 11th century,&lt;ref name=MS_xxi/&gt; as evidenced by a list of books that Archbishop Parker gave to Corpus Christi.&lt;ref name=ker57&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Canterbury, some interpolations were made; this required some erasures in the manuscript. The additional entries appear to have been taken from a version of the manuscript from which [E] descends.&lt;ref name=EHD_109-12/&gt; The last entry in the vernacular is for 1070. After this comes the Latin ''Acta Lanfranci'', which covers church events from 1070–1093. This is followed by a list of [[pope]]s and the Archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the [[pallium]]. The manuscript was acquired by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury (1559–1575)&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; and master of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]], and bequeathed to the college on his death. It now forms part of the Parker Library.

===Abingdon Chronicle I===
[B] ''The Abingdon Chronicle I'' was written by a single scribe in the second half of the 10th century. The ''Chronicle'' takes up folios 1–34.&lt;ref name=ker249&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with an entry for 60 BC and ends with the entry for 977. A manuscript that is now separate (British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178) was originally the introduction to this chronicle; it contains a genealogy, as does [A], but extends it to the late 10th century. [B] was at Abingdon in the mid-11th century, because it was used in the composition of [C]. Shortly after this it went to Canterbury, where interpolations and corrections were made. As with [A], it ends with a list of popes and the archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt;

===Abingdon Chronicle II===
[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - C - 871.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A page from the [C] Abingdon II text of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''. This entry is for 871, a year of battles between Wessex and the Vikings.]][C] includes additional material from local annals at Abingdon, where it was composed.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi/&gt; The section containing the ''Chronicle'' (folios 115–64) is preceded by King Alfred's [[Old English]] translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s world history, followed by a [[menologium]] and some [[Gnomic poetry|gnomic verses]] of the [[Physical law|laws of the natural world]] and of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Then follows a copy of the chronicle, beginning with 60 BC; the first scribe copied up to the entry for 490, and a second scribe took over up to the entry for 1048. [B] and [C] are identical between 491 and 652, but differences thereafter make it clear that the second scribe was also using another copy of the ''Chronicle''. This scribe also inserted, after the annal for 915, the ''Mercian Register'', which covers the years 902–924, and which focuses on [[Æthelflæd]]. The manuscript continues to 1066 and stops in the middle of the description of the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]. In the 12th century a few lines were added to complete the account.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi/&gt;

===Worcester Chronicle===
[D] The Worcester Chronicle appears to have been written in the middle of the 11th century. After 1033 it includes some records from [[Worcester]], so it is generally thought to have been composed there. Five different scribes can be identified for the entries up to 1054, after which it appears to have been worked on at intervals. The text includes material from Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'' and from a set of 8th-century [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbrian]] annals. It is thought that some of the entries may have been composed by [[Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York|Archbishop Wulfstan]]. [D] contains more information than other manuscripts on northern and [[Scotland|Scottish]] affairs, and it has been speculated that it was a copy intended for the Anglicised Scottish court. From 972 to 1016, the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[York]] and Worcester were both held by the same person—[[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] from 972, [[Ealdwulf (died 1002)|Ealdwulf]] from 992, and Wulfstan from 1003, and this may explain why a northern recension was to be found at Worcester. By the 16th century, parts of the manuscript were lost; eighteen pages were inserted containing substitute entries from other sources,&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; including [A], [B], [C] and [E]. These pages were written by [[John Joscelyn]], who was secretary to Matthew Parker.&lt;ref name=ker254&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peterborough Chronicle===
{{main|Peterborough Chronicle}}
[E] ''The Peterborough Chronicle'': In 1116, a fire at the monastery at Peterborough destroyed most of the buildings. The copy of the ''Chronicle'' kept there may have been lost at that time or later, but in either case shortly thereafter a fresh copy was made, apparently copied from a [[Kentish (Old English)|Kentish]] version—most likely to have been from Canterbury.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; The manuscript was written at one time and by a single scribe, down to the annal for 1121.&lt;ref name=ker424&gt;Ker 424-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The scribe added material relating to Peterborough Abbey which is not in other versions. The Canterbury original which he copied was similar, but not identical, to [D]: the Mercian Register does not appear, and [[Battle of Brunanburh (poem)|a poem]] about the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] in 937, which appears in most of the other surviving copies of the Chronicle, is not recorded. The same scribe then continued the annals through to 1131; these entries were made at intervals, and thus are presumably contemporary records. Finally, a second scribe, in 1154, wrote an account of the years 1132–1154; but his dating is known to be unreliable. This last entry is in Middle English, rather than Old English. [E] was once owned by [[William Laud]], Archbishop of Canterbury 1633–1654, so is also known as the ''Laud Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; The manuscript contains occasional glosses in Latin, and is referred to (as "the Saxon storye of Peterborowe church") in an antiquarian book from 1566.&lt;ref name=ker424/&gt; According to Joscelyn, Nowell had a transcript of the manuscript. Previous owners include [[William Camden]]&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "William Camden and the F-Text," p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William L'Isle]]; the latter probably passed the manuscript on to Laud.&lt;ref&gt;Howorth, "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle," p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canterbury Bilingual Epitome===
[F] The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome: In about 1100, a copy of the ''Chronicle'' was written at [[Canterbury Cathedral|Christ Church, Canterbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Gneuss, ''Handlist'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; probably by one of the scribes who made notes in [A]. This version is written in both Old English and Latin; each entry in Old English was followed by the Latin version. The version the scribe copied (on folios 30–70&lt;ref name=ker187/&gt;) is similar to the version used by the scribe in Peterborough who wrote [E], though it seems to have been abridged. It includes the same introductory material as [D] and, along with [E], is one of the two chronicles that does not include the "Battle of Brunanburh" poem. The manuscript has many annotations and interlineations, some made by the original scribe and some by later scribes,&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; including [[Robert Talbot (scribe)|Robert Talbot]].&lt;ref name=ker187&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copy of the Winchester Chronicle===
[A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]/[G] Copy of ''the Winchester Chronicle'': [A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] was copied from [A] at Winchester in the eleventh century and follows a 10th-century copy of an Old English translation of Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History''.&lt;ref name="ker57"/&gt; The last annal copied was 1001, so the copy was made no earlier than that; an episcopal list appended to [A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] suggests that the copy was made by 1013. This manuscript was almost completely destroyed in the 1731 fire at [[Ashburnham House]], where the [[Cotton Library]] was housed.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; Of the original 34 leaves, seven remain, ff. 39–47 in the manuscript.&lt;ref name=ker231/&gt; However, a transcript had been made by [[Laurence Nowell]], a 16th-century antiquary, which was used by [[Abraham Wheelocke]] in an edition of the ''Chronicle'' printed in 1643.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; Because of this, it is also sometimes known as [W], after Wheelocke.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; Nowell's transcript copied the genealogical introduction detached from [B] (the page now British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178), rather than that originally part of this document. The original [A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] introduction would later be removed prior to the fire and survives as British Library Add MS 34652, f. 2.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond J. S. Grant (1996), ''Laurence Nowell, William Lambarde, and the Laws of the Anglo-Saxons'', Atlanta, Ga.: Rodopi, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The appellations [A], [A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] and [G] derive from Plummer, Smith and Thorpe, respectively.&lt;ref name=ker231&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cottonian Fragment===
The ''Cottonian Fragment'' [H] consists of a single leaf, containing annals for 1113 and 1114. In the entry for 1113 it includes the phrase "he came to Winchester"; hence it is thought likely that the manuscript was written at Winchester. There is not enough of this manuscript for reliable relationships to other manuscripts to be established.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; Ker notes that the entries may have been written contemporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easter Table Chronicle===
[I] ''Easter Table Chronicle'': A list of ''Chronicle'' entries accompanies a table of years, found on folios 133-37 in a badly burned manuscript containing miscellaneous notes on charms, the calculation of dates for church services, and annals pertaining to Christ Church, Canterbury.&lt;ref name=ker174&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Chronicle's entries pertain to Christ Church, Canterbury. Until 1109 (the death of [[Anselm of Canterbury]]) they are in English; all but one of the following entries are in Latin.&lt;ref name=ker175&gt;Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of [I] was written by a scribe soon after 1073,&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; in the same hand and ink as the rest of the Caligula MS. After 1085, the annals are in various contemporary hands. The original annalist's entry for the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] is limited to "Her forðferde eadward kyng"; a later hand added the coming of [[William the Conqueror]], "7 her com willelm."&lt;ref name=ker175/&gt; At one point this manuscript was at [[St Augustine's Abbey]], Canterbury.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/cotton/cotframe.htm |title=Cotton Catalogue |accessdate=11 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423110959/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/cotton/cotframe.htm |archivedate=23 April 2007 |deadurl=yes }}  See Caligula A.15, under "Provenance", which gives a description of the manuscript and some of its history.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lost manuscripts===
Two manuscripts are recorded in an old catalogue of the library of Durham; they are described as ''cronica duo Anglica''. In addition, Parker included a manuscript called ''Hist. Angliae Saxonica'' in his gifts but the manuscript that included this, now Cambridge University Library MS. Hh.1.10, has lost 52 of its leaves, including all of this copy of the chronicle.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hh_1_10&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.le.ac.uk/english/em1060to1220/mss/EM.CUL.Hh.1.10.htm | title = Cambridge, University Library, Hh. 1. 10 – The Production and Use of English Manuscripts:1060 to 1220 | accessdate = 23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources, reliability and dating==
The ''Chronicle'' incorporates material from multiple sources. The entry for 755, describing how [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]] took the kingship of [[Wessex]] from [[Sigeberht of Wessex|Sigebehrt]], is far longer than the surrounding entries, and includes direct speech quotations from the participants in those events. It seems likely that this was taken by the scribe from existing saga material.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, ''A New Critical History'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Early entries, up to the year 110, probably came from one of the small encyclopaedic volumes of world history in circulation at the time the Chronicle was first written. The chronological summary to [[Bede]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History'' was used as a source. The Chronicle gives dates and genealogies for [[Northumbria]]n and [[Mercia]]n kings, and provides a list of Wessex bishops; these are likely to have had separate sources. The entry for 661 records a battle fought by Cenwalh that is said to have been fought "at Easter"; this precision implies a contemporary record, which survived and was re-used by the Chronicle scribe.&lt;ref name=MS_xviii&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xviii–xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary annals began to be kept in Wessex during the 7th century.&lt;ref name=YK_128&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The ''Chronicle'' entry for 648 may mark the point after which entries that were written as a contemporary record begin to appear.&lt;ref name="YK_128"/&gt;|group=notes}} The material compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, [[South Saxon]], Mercian and, particularly, [[Wessex|West Saxon]] history, but, with the exception of the Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge, ''Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicle'' grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any historical source, the ''Chronicle'' has to be treated with some caution. For example, between 514 and 544 the ''Chronicle'' makes reference to Wihtgar, who is supposedly buried on the [[Isle of Wight]] at "Wihtgar's stronghold" (which is "Wihtgaræsbyrg" in the original) and purportedly gave his name to the island. However, the name of the "Isle of Wight" derives from the Latin "Vectis", not from Wihtgar. The actual name of the fortress was probably "Wihtwarabyrg", "the stronghold of the inhabitants of Wight", and either the chronicler or an earlier source misinterpreted this as referring to Wihtgar.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwall, ''Dictionary of English Place-Names''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MS_16&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating of the events recorded also requires care. In addition to dates that are simply inaccurate, scribes occasionally made mistakes that caused further errors. For example, in the [D] manuscript, the scribe omits the year 1044 from the list on the left hand side. The annals copied down are therefore incorrect from 1045 to 1052, which has two entries. A more difficult problem is the question of the date at which a new year began, since the modern custom of starting the year on 1 January was not universal at that time. The entry for 1091 in [E] begins at [[Christmas]] and continues throughout the year; it is clear that this entry follows the old custom of starting the year at Christmas. Some other entries appear to begin the year on 25 March, such as the year 1044 in the [C] manuscript, which ends with [[Edward the Confessor]]'s marriage on 23 January, while the entry for 22 April is recorded under 1045. There are also years which appear to start in September.&lt;ref name=MS_xiv&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xiv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts were produced in different places, and each manuscript reflects the biases of its scribes. It has been argued that the ''Chronicle'' should be regarded as [[propaganda]], produced by Alfred's court and written with the intent of glorifying Alfred and creating loyalty.&lt;ref name=CampbellTASS_144&gt;Campbell,''The Anglo-Saxon State'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not universally accepted,{{refn|For example, Keynes and Lapidge comment that we should "resist the temptation to regard it as a form of West Saxon dynastic propaganda".&lt;ref name=KL_40&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} but the origins of the manuscripts clearly colour both the description of interactions between [[Wessex]] and other kingdoms, and the descriptions of the Vikings' depredations. An example can be seen in the entry for 829, which describes [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]]'s invasion of [[Northumbria]]. According to the Chronicle, after Egbert conquered Mercia and [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], he became a "[[bretwalda]]", implying overlordship of all of England. Then when he marched into Northumbria, the Northumbrians offered him "submission and peace". The Northumbrian chronicles incorporated into [[Roger of Wendover]]'s 13th-century history give a different picture: "When Egbert had obtained all the southern kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute."&lt;ref name=MS_60&gt;Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CampbellTAS139&gt;P. Wormald, "The Ninth Century", p. 139, in Campbell ''et al.'', ''The Anglo-Saxons''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the scribes' biases can be seen by comparing different versions of the manuscript they created. For example, [[Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia|Ælfgar]], earl of [[East Anglia]], and son of [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]], the earl of Mercia, was exiled briefly in 1055. The [C], [D] and [E] manuscripts say the following:&lt;ref name=MS_184&gt;Translations from Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 184–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CampbellTAS222&gt;Campbell ''et al.'', ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [C]: "Earl Ælfgar, son of Earl Leofric, was outlawed without any fault ..."
* [D]: "Earl Ælfgar, son of Earl Leofric, was outlawed well-nigh without fault ..."
* [E]: "Earl Ælfgar was outlawed because it was thrown at him that he was traitor to the king and all the people of the land. And he admitted this before all the men who were gathered there, although the words shot out against his will."

Another example that mentions Ælfgar shows a different kind of unreliability in the ''Chronicle'': that of omission. Ælfgar was Earl of Mercia by 1058, and in that year was exiled again. This time only [D] has anything to say: "Here Earl Ælfgar was expelled, but he soon came back again, with violence, through the help of Gruffydd. And here came a raiding ship-army from [[Norway]]; it is tedious to tell how it all happened."&lt;ref name=MS_184 /&gt; In this case other sources exist to clarify the picture: a major Norwegian attempt was made on England, but [E] says nothing at all, and [D] scarcely mentions it. It has sometimes been argued that when the ''Chronicle'' is silent, other sources that report major events must be mistaken, but this example demonstrates that the'' Chronicle'' does omit important events.&lt;ref name=CampbellTAS222 /&gt;

==Use by Latin and Anglo-Norman historians==
The three main [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] historians, [[John of Worcester]], [[William of Malmesbury]] and [[Henry of Huntingdon]], each had a copy of the ''Chronicle'', which they adapted for their own purposes.&lt;ref name=ASE_36&gt;Lapidge, ''Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Symeon of Durham]] also had a copy of the ''Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt; Some later medieval historians also used the ''Chronicle'', and others took their material from those who had used it, and so the ''Chronicle'' became "central to the mainstream of English historical tradition".&lt;ref name=ASE_36/&gt;

Henry of Huntingdon used a copy of the ''Chronicle'' that was very similar to [E]. There is no evidence in his work of any of the entries in [E] after 1121, so although his manuscript may actually have been [E], it may also have been a copy—either one taken of [E] prior to the entries he makes no use of, or a manuscript from which [E] was copied, with the copying taking place prior to the date of the last annal he uses.  Henry also made use of the [C] manuscript.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt;

The [[Waverley Annals]] made use of a manuscript that was similar to [E], though it appears that it did not contain the entries focused on Peterborough. The manuscript of the chronicle translated by [[Geoffrey Gaimar]] cannot be identified accurately, though according to historian [[Dorothy Whitelock]] it was "a rather better text than 'E' or 'F'". Gaimar implies that there was a copy at Winchester in his day (the middle of the 12th century); Whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day was at Winchester in the mid-tenth century. If it survived to Gaimar's time that would explain why [A] was not kept up to date, and why [A] could be given to the monastery at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt;

John of Worcester's ''[[John of Worcester#Chronicon ex chronicis|Chronicon ex chronicis]]'' appears to have had a manuscript that was either [A] or similar to it; he makes use of annals that do not appear in other versions, such as entries concerning [[Edward the Elder]]'s campaigns and information about Winchester towards the end of the chronicle. His account is often similar to that of [D], though there is less attention paid to [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Scotland]], an identifying characteristic of [D]. He had the Mercian register, which appears only in [C] and [D]; and he includes material from annals 979–982 which only appears in [C]. It is possible he had a manuscript that was an ancestor of [D]. He also had sources which have not been identified, and some of his statements have no earlier surviving source.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt;

A manuscript similar to [E] was available to [[William of Malmesbury]], though it is unlikely to have been [E] as that manuscript is known to have still been in Peterborough after the time William was working, and he does not make use of any of the entries in [E] that are specifically related to Peterborough. It is likely he had either the original from which [E] was copied, or a copy of that original. He mentions that the chronicles do not give any information on the murder of [[Alfred Aetheling]], but since this is covered in both [C] and [D] it is apparent he had no access to those manuscripts. On occasion he appears to show some knowledge of [D], but it is possible that his information was taken from John of Worcester's account. He also omits any reference to a battle fought by [[Cenwealh]] in 652; this battle is mentioned in [A], [B] and [C], but not in [E]. He does mention a battle fought by Cenwealh at [[Wirtgernesburg]], which is not in any of the extant manuscripts, so it is possible he had a copy now lost.&lt;ref name=EHD_113-4/&gt;

==Importance==
The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' is the single most important source for the history of England in Anglo-Saxon times. Without the ''Chronicle'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (the ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), it would be impossible to write the history of the English from the Romans to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]];&lt;ref name=BlairAITASE_355&gt;Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Howe]] called them "the two great Anglo-Saxon works of history".&lt;ref name=howe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Howe|year=2004|title=Rome: Capital of Anglo-Saxon England|journal=[[Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|pages=147–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that records and annals of some kind began to be kept in England at the time of the earliest spread of Christianity, but no such records survive in their original form. Instead they were incorporated in later works, and it is thought likely that the ''Chronicle'' contains many of these. The history it tells is not only that witnessed by its compilers, but also that recorded by earlier annalists, whose work is in many cases preserved nowhere else.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_11&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its importance is not limited to the historical information it provides, however. It is just as important a source for the early development of English.&lt;ref name=BlairAITASE_355 /&gt; The ''Peterborough Chronicle'' changes from the standard [[Old English]] literary language to early [[Middle English]] after 1131, providing some of the earliest Middle English text known.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; Howe notes, in "Rome: Capitol of Anglo-Saxon England", that many of the entries indicate that Rome was considered a spiritual home for the Anglo-Saxons, Rome and Roman history being of paramount importance in many of the entries; he cites the one for AD 1, for instance, which lists the reign of [[Augustus|Octavian Augustus]] before it mentions the birth of Christ.&lt;ref name=howe/&gt;

The ''Chronicle'' is not without literary interest. Inserted at various points since the 10th century are Old English poems in celebration of royal figures and their achievements: "[[Battle of Brunanburh (poem)|The Battle of Brunanburh]]" (937), on King [[Æthelstan]]'s victory over the combined forces of Vikings, Scots and the Strathclyde Britons, and five shorter poems, "[[Capture of the Five Boroughs]]" (942), "The Coronation of King Edgar" (973), "[[The Death of King Edgar]]" (975), "The Death of Prince Alfred" (1036), and "The Death of King Edward the Confessor" (1065).

==History of editions and availability==
An important early printed edition of the ''Chronicle'' appeared in 1692, by [[Edmund Gibson]], an English jurist and divine who became [[Bishop of Lincoln]] in that year.  Titled ''Chronicon Saxonicum'', it printed Latin and Old English versions of the text in parallel columns and became the standard edition until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The title in full is ''Chronicon Saxonicum; seu Annales Rerum in Anglia Praecipue Gestarum, a Christo nato ad Annum Usque MCLIV. deducti, ac jam demum Latinitate donati. Cum Indice Rerum Chronologico. Accedunt Regulae ad Investigandas Nominum Locorum Origines. Et Nominum Locorum ac Virorum in Chronico Memoratorum Explicatio.'' A detailed description of a first edition is listed at {{cite web|url=http://www.lawbookexchange.com/oct02/law-books-oct02-2.html |title=Law Books – October 2002 List |accessdate=2 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128043121/http://www.lawbookexchange.com/oct02/law-books-oct02-2.html |archivedate=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was superseded in 1861 by [[Benjamin Thorpe]]'s [[Rolls Series|Rolls]] edition, which printed six versions in columns, labelled A to F, thus giving the manuscripts the letters which are now used to refer to them.

[[John Earle (professor)|John Earle]] wrote ''Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Earle|title=Two of the Saxon chronicles parallel: with supplementary extracts from the others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT0LAAAAYAAJ|year=1865|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Plummer]] edited this book, producing a ''Revised Text'' with notes, appendices, and glossary in two volumes in 1892 and 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Earle|author2=Charles Plummer|title=Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel: Text, appendices and glossary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7osAAAAMAAJ|year=1892|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHD_129&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition of the A and E texts, with material from other versions, was widely used; it was reprinted in 1952.&lt;ref name=EHD_129/&gt;

===Editions of the individual manuscripts===
Beginning in the 1980s, a new set of scholarly editions have been printed under the series title "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition". Some volumes are still projected, such as a volume focusing on the northern recension, but existing volumes such as Janet Bately's edition of [A] are now standard references.&lt;ref name=MS_xxi /&gt; A recent translation of the Chronicle is [[Michael Swanton]]'s ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which presents translations of [A] and [E] on opposite pages, with interspersed material from the other manuscripts where they differ.

A facsimile edition of [A], ''The Parker Chronicle and Laws'', appeared in 1941 from the [[Oxford University Press]], edited by Robin Flower and Hugh Smith.&lt;ref name=EHD_129/&gt; A recent scholarly edition of the [B] text is ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition, 4, MS B'' by S. Taylor (Cambridge, 1983).&lt;ref name=MS_xxi/&gt; The [C] manuscript was edited by H.A. Rositzke; ''The C-Text of the Old English Chronicles'', in ''Beitrage z. engl. Phil.'', XXXIV, Bochum-Langendreer, 1940; and the [D] manuscript in ''An Anglo-Saxon Chronicle from British Museum Cotton MS., Tiberius B. iv'', edited by E. Classen and F.E. Harmer, Manchester, 1926. Rositzke also published a translation of the [E] text in ''The Peterborough Chronicle'' (New York, 1951). The [F] text was printed in F.P. Magoun, Jr., ''Annales Domitiani Latini: an Edition'' in "Mediaeval Studies of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies", IX, 1947, pp.&amp;nbsp;235–295.&lt;ref name=EHD_129/&gt; The first edition of [G] was Abraham Whelock's 1644 ''Venerabilis Bedae Historia Ecclesiastica'', printed in Cambridge;&lt;ref name=EHD_129/&gt; there is also an edition by Angelica Lutz, ''Die Version G der angelsächsischen Chronik: Rekonstruktion und Edition'' (Munich, 1981).&lt;ref name=MS_xxi/&gt;

'''''Arbeidernes Leksikon''''' (''The Laborers' Encyclopedia'') is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[encyclopedia]] published in six volumes in the 1930s.

It was the first reference book in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] to have a pronounced class bias, and the first encyclopedia outside of the [[Soviet Union]] to be directed specifically at the [[working class]]. The publication had a connection with the Norwegian [[labor movement]]'s goal to spread knowledge among the working and [[Underclass|lower class]], and in doing so could break the monopoly the [[middle class]] had on the dissemination of information in society. They thought that the existing encyclopedias had a middle class bias.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

The idea of such an encyclopedia came within the group that produced the laborers' magazine ''[[Arbeidermagasinet]]''. This magazine was produced from 1927 by members of the [[Communist Party of Norway]] (founded 1923). Communist Party member [[Jakob Friis]] was hired as chief editor of the encyclopedia in 1930.&lt;ref name=uiotekst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iln/forskning/forskergrupper/tekstvitenskap/sakprosa/AL%20prosjektbeskrivelse.pdf|title=En teksthistorisk undersøkelse av Arbeidernes leksikon (1931–36)|format=PDF|date=5 June 2007|publisher=University of Oslo|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 January 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}} (description of research project)&lt;/ref&gt; The work was published by the ''Arbeidermagasinet''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s publishing company in six volumes from 1932 to 1936. In addition to Jakob Friis, [[Trond Hegna]] worked as editor; from the third volume on, [[Dagfin Juel]] worked as a co-editor.

The Communist Party was reluctant to the whole project, and the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] was negative as well. In April 1933, ''Arbeidernes Leksikon'' received a grant from the group ''[[Mot Dag]]'', which had formerly been affiliated with the Communist and Labour parties, but now was independent. ''Mot Dag'' leader [[Erling Falk]] was involved with the editorial work.&lt;ref name=uiotekst/&gt;

A selection of articles from the encyclopedia was published in 1974 in a three-volume reprint by the publishing house [[Pax Forlag]]. This publishing house also published its own class encyclopedia, ''[[Pax Leksikon]]''.

Portions of the encyclopedia are available online.

'''''Bach v Longman''''' 2 Cowper 623 (1777) is a landmark judgment regarding [[copyright]]. The case was concerning whether or not printed music fell within the protection of the [[Statute of Anne]] (1710). Lord Mansfield held that published music is protected as 'writing' within the terms of the [[Statute|legislation]].

{{For|the 1935 collection of Wodehouse's short stories|Blandings Castle and Elsewhere}}

'''Blandings Castle''' is a recurring [[fictional location]] in the stories of British comic writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]], being the seat of [[Lord Emsworth]] (Clarence Threepwood, 9th Earl of Emsworth), home to many of his family and the setting for numerous tales and adventures. The stories were written between 1915 and 1975.

The series of stories taking place at the castle, in its environs and involving its denizens have come to be known as the "Blandings books", or indeed, in a phrase used by Wodehouse in his preface to the 1969 reprint of the first book, "the Blandings Castle Saga".&lt;ref&gt;

In a radio broadcast on 15 July 1961, [[Evelyn Waugh]] said: "The gardens of Blandings Castle are that original garden from which we are all exiled."&lt;ref&gt;

==The Castle==

Blandings Castle, lying in the picturesque [[River valley|Vale]] of Blandings, [[Shropshire]], England, is two miles from the town of [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Market Blandings|Market Blandings]], home to at least nine pubs, most notably the [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#The Emsworth Arms|Emsworth Arms]].

The tiny hamlet of [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Blandings Parva|Blandings Parva]] lies directly outside the castle gates and the town of [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Much Matchingham|Much Matchingham]], home to [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Matchingham Hall|Matchingham Hall]], the residence of [[Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe]], is also nearby.

The castle is a noble pile, of Early [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] building ("its history is recorded in England's history books and [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]] has written of its architecture", according to ''[[Something Fresh]]''). One of England's largest [[stately home]]s, it dominates the surrounding country, standing on a knoll of rising ground at the southern end of the celebrated Vale of Blandings; the [[Severn]] gleams in the distance. From its noble battlements, the [[Wrekin]] can be seen.

The famous moss-carpeted Yew Alley (subject to the devious gravelling schemes of [[List of minor Blandings characters#Angus McAllister|Angus McAllister]]) leads to a small wood with a rough [[gamekeeper]]'s cottage, which [[Psmith]] made use of, not to write poetry as he at first claimed, but to stash stolen jewellery. Another gamekeeper's cottage, in the West Wood, makes a pleasant home for the [[Empress of Blandings]] for a spell. The rose garden is another famous beauty spot, ideal for courting lovers. There is a lake, where Lord Emsworth often takes a brisk swim in the mornings.

The house has numerous guest rooms, many of which haven't been used since [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] roamed the country. Of those still in use, the Garden Room is the finest, usually given to the most prestigious guest; it has a balcony outside its French windows, which can be easily accessed via a handy drainpipe.

The main [[library]] has a smaller library leading off it, and windows overlooking some flowerbeds; it is here that Lord Emsworth is often to be found on wet days, his nose deep in an improving tome of country lore, his favourite being [[List of minor Blandings characters#Augustus Whiffle|Whiffle]] on ''The Care of the Pig''.

===Possible locations===

There have been a number of attempts to locate and identify the possible locations of Blandings:

* In 1977, [[Richard Usborne]] included in his appendix to the unfinished ''[[Sunset at Blandings]]'' a report by [[Michael Cobb (railway historian)|Michael Cobb]]. Based on train journeys and travel times described in the stories, Cobb argues that [[Buildwas]] or [[Much Wenlock]] fit the description of Market Blandings best, which places Blandings Castle in their immediate surroundings. Parenthetically, he also asks "Could anyone have considered that Blandings Castle was really [[Apley Hall|Apley Park]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wodehouse|first=Pelham Grenville|title=Sunset at Blandings|year=1977|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|isbn=0701122374|pages=195|author2=appendices by Richard Usborne  |author3=ill. by Ionicus }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apley Park (or Hall) is less than six miles from Buildwas.
* In 1987, Norman Murphy in his ''In Search of Blandings'' looked at a whole range of criteria based around architecture and landscape features. His main suggestions were [[Sudeley Castle]], [[Gloucestershire]] for the castle itself, and [[Weston Park]], [[Staffordshire]] for the gardens. The owners of Sudeley, also the resting place of Queen [[Katherine Parr]], have since emphasised the Wodehouse connection.
* In 1999, Norman Murphy again suggested [[Hunstanton#Literary associations|Hunstanton Hall]] in [[Norfolk]], the home of the LeStrange family from 1137 to 1954, where Wodehouse visited in the 1920s, as inspiration for Blandings, its master, and "the real Empress of Blandings".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy 1999, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, Dr Daryl Lloyd and Dr Ian Greatbatch (two researchers in the Department of Geography and [[Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis]], [[University College London]]) made use of a [[Geographic Information System]] to analyse a set of geographical criteria, such as a [[viewshed]] analysis of [[The Wrekin]] and drive time from [[Shrewsbury]]. Their final conclusion was that Apley Hall (the [[Whitmore baronets]]) was the best suited location for fulfilling the geographical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby 2003, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts 2003, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residents and guests==

===The family===

{{Main|List of P. G. Wodehouse characters#Threepwood family}}

The master of Blandings is, nominally at least, [[Lord Emsworth]]. Clarence, the ninth Earl, is an amiably absent-minded old chap, who is charming because of his slow, relaxed lifestyle and the simple obsessions that make him oblivious to the absurd melodrama of his family, namely his home, gardens, pumpkins, and his champion pig, [[Empress of Blandings]]. He is never happier than when pottering about the grounds on a fine sunny day.

Lord Emsworth's ten sisters (all of whom look like the "daughter of a hundred earls", except for Hermione, who looks like a cook), his brother [[Galahad Threepwood|Galahad]] ("Gally"), his daughter [[List of minor Blandings characters#Lady Mildred Mant|Mildred]], his sons [[Freddie Threepwood|Freddie]] and [[List of minor Blandings characters#George Threepwood, Lord Bosham|George]], and his numerous nieces, nephews, and in-laws inhabit the castle from time to time. For the Threepwood family, and their friends, the castle is forever available for indefinite residence, and is occasionally used as a temporary prison&amp;mdash;known as "[[Devil's Island]]" or "The [[Bastille]]"&amp;mdash;for love-struck young men and ladies to calm down.

Emsworth's sister Ann plays the role of [[châtelain]]e when we first visit the Castle, in ''[[Something Fresh]]''. Following her reign, Lady Constance Keeble acts as châtelaine until she marries American millionaire [[List of minor Blandings characters#James Schoonmaker|James Schoonmaker]].

Lady Julia Fish is "the iron hand beneath the [[leather glove]]", whose son Ronald Fish ("Ronnie") marries a chorus girl named Sue Brown, who is the daughter of the only woman whom Gally ever loved&amp;mdash;Dolly Henderson, though Gally insists Sue is not Ronnie's cousin.

The other sisters are: Charlotte, Dora, Florence, Georgiana, Jane, and Diana, the only one that Gally likes (''[[Sunset at Blandings]]'').

===The staff===

Blandings's ever-present butler is [[Sebastian Beach]], with eighteen years service at the castle under his ample belt, and its other domestic servants have at various times included [[List of minor Blandings characters#Mrs Twemlow|Mrs Twemlow]] the housekeeper, an under-butler named Merridew, and a number of footmen, such as Charles, Thomas, Stokes, James and Alfred. The chauffeurs [[List of minor Blandings characters#Slingsby|Slingsby]] and [[List of minor Blandings characters#Alfred Voules|Alfred Voules]] drive the castle's stately [[Hispano-Suiza]], or, in an emergency, the [[Albatross (automobile)|Albatross]] or the Antelope (''[[Summer Lightning]]'').

Outside of the house, Scottish head gardeners [[List of minor Blandings characters#Thorne|Thorne]] and [[List of minor Blandings characters#Angus McAllister|Angus McAllister]] have tended the grounds, while [[List of minor Blandings characters#George Cyril Wellbeloved|George Cyril Wellbeloved]], [[List of minor Blandings characters#James Pirbright|James Pirbright]] and the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] [[List of minor Blandings characters#Monica Simmons|Monica Simmons]] have each in turn taken care of Lord Emsworth's beloved prize pig, [[Empress of Blandings]].

Emsworth has employed a series of secretaries, most notable among them [[Rupert Baxter]], the highly efficient young man who never seems to be able to keep away from Blandings, despite Lord Emsworth's increasingly low opinion of his sanity. He was succeeded in the post by [[Psmith|Ronald Psmith]], and later by the likes of [[List of minor Blandings characters#Hugo Carmody|Hugo Carmody]] and [[Monty Bodkin]]. The castle's splendid library was catalogued, for the first time since 1885, by [[List of minor Blandings characters#Eve Halliday|Eve Halliday]].

===Notable visitors===

Many people pass through the doors of Blandings, including guests and friends of the family, prospective additions to the family, temporary staff, pig-lovers, day-trippers, detectives, crooks and of course impostors galore. Among the most distinguished are the grumpy [[List of minor Blandings characters#Alaric, Duke of Dunstable|Duke of Dunstable]]; leading brain-specialist [[Sir Roderick Glossop]]; publishing magnate [[George Alexander Pyke, Lord Tilbury|Lord Tilbury]]; the Fifth Earl of Ickenham, known to all as [[Uncle Fred]]; and [[Percy Pilbeam]], head of the Argus Enquiry Agency employed to locate the lost pig and recover Gally's manuscript of his memoirs.

==Books==

Blandings Castle serves as the setting for eleven [[novel]]s and nine [[short story|short stories]].

* ''[[Something Fresh]]'' (1915) —&amp;nbsp;Also published under the title ''Something New''.
* ''[[Leave it to Psmith]]'' (1923)
* ''[[Blandings Castle and Elsewhere]]'' (1935) &amp;ndash; Six short stories of twelve, written from 1926 to 1931, occurring before the events of ''Summer Lightning'':
** "[[The Custody of the Pumpkin]]"
** "[[Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best]]"
** "[[Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey]]"
** "[[Company for Gertrude]]"
** "[[The Go-getter]]"
** "[[Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend]]"
* ''[[Summer Lightning]]'' (1929)
* ''[[Heavy Weather (Wodehouse novel)|Heavy Weather]]'' (1933)
* ''[[Lord Emsworth and Others]]'' (1937) &amp;ndash; One short story of nine:

* ''[[Nothing Serious (short stories)|Nothing Serious]]'' (1950) &amp;ndash; One short story of ten:
** "[[Birth of a Salesman]]"
* ''[[Pigs Have Wings]]'' (1952)
* ''[[Service With a Smile]]'' (1961)
* ''[[Galahad at Blandings]]'' (1965)
* ''[[Plum Pie]]'' (1966) &amp;ndash; One short story of nine (probably to be read before ''Service With a Smile''):
** "[[Sticky Wicket at Blandings]]"
* ''[[A Pelican at Blandings]]'' (1969)
* ''[[Sunset at Blandings]]'' (1977)

Wodehouse worked on ''Sunset at Blandings'' until his death, writing even in his hospital bed. It was unfinished and untitled when he died, and was subsequently edited (by Richard Usborne) and released in its incomplete form with extensive notes on the content.

All nine Blandings short stories were collected together in one volume entitled ''[[Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best (book)|Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best]]'' in 1992.

The Folio Society published a six volume set ''The Best of Blandings'' consisting of ''[[Summer Lightning]], [[Heavy Weather (Wodehouse novel)|Heavy Weather]], [[Uncle Fred in the Springtime]], [[Full Moon]], [[Pigs Have Wings]],'' and ''[[Service with a Smile]]''.

==Film, television and radio==

[[Horace Hodges]] played Lord Emsworth in a [[1933 in film|1933]] [[silent film]] adaptation of ''[[Summer Lightning]]''

The Castle and its inhabitants were the subject of six half-hour adaptations under the title ''Blandings Castle'', made by the [[BBC]] (also known as ''[[The World of Wodehouse]]'' series). Adapted from some of the shorts in ''[[Blandings Castle and Elsewhere]]'' and the classic "[[The Crime Wave at Blandings]]", they were broadcast in 1967 and starred [[Ralph Richardson]] as Lord Emsworth, [[Meriel Forbes]] as Lady Constance, [[Stanley Holloway]] as Beach and [[Derek Nimmo]] as Freddie. Only extracts from one episode survive ("[[Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostshows.com/default.aspx?season=407a2551-82a0-414a-935e-1da1b4594c36 ''The World of Wodehouse'': Series 1: "Blandings Castle"] lostshows.com&lt;/ref&gt; the series having suffered the fate of being [[Wiping|wiped]].

Between 1985 and 1992, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast several adaptations, starring [[Richard Vernon]] as Emsworth and [[Ian Carmichael]] as Galahad.

In 1995, the BBC, with partners including [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]], adapted ''[[Heavy Weather (Wodehouse novel)|Heavy Weather]]'' into a 95-minute [[TV movie]]. It was first screened on [[Christmas Eve]] 1995 in the UK, and shown in the US by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on February 18, 1996. It starred [[Peter O'Toole]] as Lord Emsworth, [[Richard Briers]] as Gally, [[Roy Hudd]] as Beach, [[Samuel West]] as Monty Bodkin and [[Judy Parfitt]] as Lady Constance. It was directed by [[Jack Gold]] with a screenplay by [[Douglas Livingstone (actor)|Douglas Livingstone]], and was generally well received by fans.

Many of the stories and novels are available as [[audiobook]]s, including an abridged series narrated by [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]].

[[BBC One]] has produced a new series of six episodes, called ''[[Blandings (TV series)|Blandings]]'', starring [[Timothy Spall]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] which premiered in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Maggie|title=BBC looks to steal Downton ratings with two helpings of PG Wodehouse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/29/bbc-downton-pg-wodehouse|publisher=''[[The Observer]]''|date=December 29, 2012|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series of seven episodes aired in February 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2710">'''Brinkler Classification''' is the [[library classification]] system  of [[Bartol Brinkler]] described in his article "The Geographical Approach to Materials in the Library of Congress Subject Headings".&lt;ref&gt;Brinkler, Bartol. The geographical approach to materials in the Library of Congress subject headings: report of a study project. s.l.: s.n., 1960. [Accession No: {{OCLC|3853830}}].&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical aspect of a subject may be conveyed through three types of headings labeled A, B, and C. Heading A uses a primary topical description with geographical subdivisions (e.g. Art—Paris).  Type B uses a place-name for the main heading with a topical subdivision (e.g. Paris—Description). C headings use a geographical description of a phrase (e.g. Paris Literature).  

Brinkler explores what type of heading is more useful to a [[patron]], and he finds that it depends on the level of familiarity a patron has with a topic and what approach they take when searching for resources on their topic. Ideally readers will either be looking for everything on a particular topic, or everything regarding a particular place. Bartol Brinkler investigates a system of classification that will best serve these two ideal types of patrons.  He finds working with Type A headings will best assist a patron who is more topic oriented, while using Type B headings is preferable for those who are primarily interested in one place. 

However this is problematic in practice. One possibility is to assign Type A and Type B headings to every resource, but the cataloguing cost would be high.  A system that aids readers regardless of their approach to a topic involves using cross-references (e.g. Canada—Botany, See Botany—Canada).  Admitting that see and see also references would require more work on the part of librarians, Bartol Brinkler notes that librarians must keep in mind "...readers do not have the same knowledge [of classification] and do need all the help they can get..."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

This is the view as seen from the ''tribune royale'', where the king and members of the royal family heard mass.&lt;/center&gt;]]The present '''chapel of the [[Palace of Versailles]]''' is the fifth in the history of the palace.  These chapels evolved with the expansion of the château and formed the focal point of the daily life of the court during the [[Ancien Régime]] (Bluche, 1986, 1991; Petitfils, 1995; Solnon, 1987).

==History of the chapels==

===First chapel===
The château's first chapel dated from the time of Louis XIII, and was located in a detached pavilion at the northeast of the château. Today, the ''pièce de la vaisselle d'or'' in the ''[[Petit Appartement du Roi]]'' occupies the approximate emplacement of the château's first chapel. This chapel followed the two-story palatine model, which was traditional in France; successive chapels at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] followed this model. This chapel was destroyed in 1665 during the construction of the [[Gardens of Versailles|Grotte de Thétys]] (Batifol, 1909, 1913; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1968; Verlet, 1985).

===Second Chapel===
The château's second chapel was created during Louis XIV's second building campaign (1669–1672), when [[Louis Le Vau]] constructed the ''Château Neuf''. When the new part of the château was completed, the chapel was situated in the ''[[Grand Appartement de la Reine]]'' and formed the symmetrical pendant with the ''[[Salon de Diane]]'' in the ''[[Grand Appartement du Roi]]''.  This chapel was used by the royal family and court until 1678 at which time a new chapel was constructed, and this one was converted into the ''Salle des Gardes de la Reine'' (Félibien, 1674; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1972, 1976; Scudéry, 1669; Verlet, 1985).

===Third Chapel===
[[File:Louis XIV of France (1693).jpg|thumb|upright|Louis XIV in prayer in the chapel of 1682 (miniature in the ''Heures de Louis le Grand'', 1693, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], ms. 9477, folio a verso)&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds 2002, color plate 10, before p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Located next to the new ''Salle des Gardes de la Reine'', this chapel served the needs of life at Versailles for a short period of time. Soon after its construction, [[Louis XIV]] found it inconvenient and impractical for his needs as well as those of his court, which he had officially installed at Versailles in 1682.  In 1682, this room was converted into the ''Grande Salles des Gardes de la Reine'' (and now exists as ''la Salle du Sacre'') and a new chapel was built (Combes, 1681; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1972, 1976; Verlet, 1985).

===Fourth Chapel===
With the construction of the ''Aile du Nord'', the north wing of the château, a new chapel was built. Construction of the north wing necessitated the destruction of the [[Gardens of Versailles|Grotte de Thétys]]; it was on this site that the new chapel was built in 1682.  When the fourth chapel was constructed, the ''Salon de l'Abondance'', which had served as entry to the ''Cabinet des Médailles'' in the [[Petit Appartement du Roi]], was transformed into the ''Vestibule de la Chapelle'' — so named as it was from this upper level of the chapel that king and selected members of the royal family heard daily mass.  This chapel remained in use until 1710, and was witness to many of the important events of the court and royal family during the reign of Louis XIV.  Today the ''[[salon d'Hercule]]'' and the lower vestibule occupy the space of this site (Félibien, 1703; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1972, 1976; Piganiole de la Force, 1701; Verlet, 1985).

==={{Anchor|Chapel of Versailles}}Fifth Chapel===

As the focal point of Louis XIV's fourth (and last) building campaign (1699–1710), the fifth and final chapel of the château of Versailles is an unreserved masterpiece.  Begun in 1689, construction was halted due to the [[War of the League of Augsburg]]; [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] resumed construction in 1699. [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart|Hardouin-Mansart]] continued working on the project until his death in 1708, at which time his brother-in-law, [[Robert de Cotte]], finished the project (Blondel, 1752–1756; Marie, 1972, 1976; Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993).  It was to become the largest of the royal chapels at Versailles, and the height of its vaulting alone was allowed to disturb the rather severe horizontality everywhere else apparent in the palace's roof-line, leading to the design being badly treated by some contemporaries; the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|duc de Saint-Simon]] characterized it as an "enormous catafalque".&lt;ref&gt;''Cette belle chapelle de Versailles, si mal proportionnée, qui semble un enfeu par le haut et vouloir écraser le château'' (Saint-Simon p. 244)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the magnificent interior has been widely admired to the present day and served as inspiration for [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] when he designed the chapel for the [[Caserta Palace|Palace of Caserta]] (Defilippis, 1968).

Dedicated to [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]], patron saint of the Bourbons, the chapel was consecrated in 1710.  The palatine model is of course traditional; however, the corinthian colonnade of the tribune level is of a classic style that anticipates the [[Neoclassicism|neo-classicism]] that evolved during the 18th century, although its use here bespeaks a remarkable virtuosity.  The tribune level is accessed by a vestibule, known as the ''Salon de la Chapelle'', that was constructed at the same time as the chapel.  The ''Salon de la Chapelle'' is decorated with white stone and the bas-relief sculpture, ''Louis XIV Crossing the Rhine'' by [[Nicolas Coustou|Nicolas]] and [[Guillaume Coustou the Elder|Guillaume Coustou]] forms the focal point of the rooms décor&lt;ref&gt;This bas relief was originally intended to decorate the ''[[Salon de la Guerre]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993).

The floor of the chapel itself is inlaid with polychromatic marbles, and at the foot of the steps leading to the altar is the crowned monogram of an interlaced double "L" alluding to [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] and Louis XIV (Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993).  The sculptural and painted decoration uses both [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] themes (Lighthart, 1997; Nolhac, 1912–1913; Sabatier, 1999; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993).  The ceiling of the nave represent ''God the Father in His Glory Bringing to the World the Promise of Redemption'' and was painted by [[Antoine Coypel]]; the half-dome of the apse is decorated with [[Charles de la Fosse|Charles de la Fosse's]] ''The Resurrection of Christ''; and, above the royal tribune is [[Jean Jouvenet|Jean Jouvenet's]] ''The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Virgin and the Apostles'' (Nolhac, 1912–1913; Walton, 1993).

[[Image:VersaillesChapelInterior.jpg|thumb|right|Altar of the chapel of Versailles; the very spot where Marie Antoinette married Louis XVI.]]

During the 18th century, the chapel witnessed many court events. ''Te Deums'' were sung to celebrate military victories and the births of children (''[[Fils de France]]'' and ''[[Fils de France|fille de France]]'') born to the king and queen; marriages were also celebrated in this chapel, such as the wedding of Louis XV's son the dauphin [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis]] with the Infanta [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain|Marie-Thérèse d'Espagne]] of Spain on 23 February 1745 and the wedding on 16 May 1770 of the dauphin – later [[Louis XVI of France]] – with [[Marie-Antoinette]].  However, of all the ceremonies held in the chapel, those associated the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]] were among the most elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;1 January was the feast day of the order and promotions into the order were held on this day in the chapel of Versailles&lt;/ref&gt; (Blondel, 1752–1756; Bluche, 2000; Boughton, 1986; Campan, 1823; Croÿ-Solre, 1906–1921; Hézuques, 1873; Luynes, 1860–1865; Nolhac, 1912–1913).

The chapel was de-consecrated in the 19th century and has since served as a venue for state and private events.  Musical concerts are often held in the chapel of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chateauversailles.fr/fr/ Source: Official site of the Château de Versailles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723131539/http://www.chateauversailles.fr/fr/ |date=2008-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative research''' is a research methodology in the [[social science]]s that aims to make comparisons across different [[country|countries]] or [[culture]]s. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of [[poverty]]).

== Development of the tradition ==

As Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of ''episteme'' and ''philo-sophia'', as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. ''Episteme'', as a form and activity in the field of ''logos'', marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) ‘On comparative inquiry: the Ancient Greek origins’. Research paper presented at the conference of the Comparative Education Society in Europe (CESE), Freiburg, Germany, 11/06/14 - 14/06/14. &lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic ''polis''. Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ ''Histories'' demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. ''isegoria'' and ''parrhesia''), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

According also to [[Karl Deutsch]], we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"&gt;Deutsch 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.

Textbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;Clasen 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antal, Dierkes &amp; Weiler 1987: 13&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. [[Globalization]] has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. [[Information technology]] has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.&lt;ref&gt;Øyen 2004: 276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative research defined ==
Comparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"&gt;Heidenheimer, Heclo &amp; Adams 1983: 505&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a "seamless whole."&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esping"&gt;Esping-Andersen 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clasen"/&gt; The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1990: 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate "grand theories," such as [[Marxism]]. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related.&lt;ref&gt;Przeworski &amp; Teune 1970: 31&lt;/ref&gt; The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of [[decommodification]]. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy.&lt;ref name="Esping"/&gt; Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.

Comparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"/&gt; Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.

The [[historical comparative research]] involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

When it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.

[[Image:LISTDeutsch-MythologischeLandschaftsbilder.jpg|thumb|Both 1891 volumes of ''Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder'' by [[Guido von List]] and republished by [[Adolf Schleipfer]]]]
'''''Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder''''' is a two-volume book by [[Guido von List]] published in 1891. Its English [[translation]] is ''German Mythological Landscape Scenes''.

During 1877 and 1887, List had published various journalistic works on his earlier travels and mystical reflections on Loci (local spirits). Many of these pieces were anthologised in 1891 in his famous ''Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder''.

Some of the sketches in his sketchbook (which has drawings from as far back as 1863, when he would have been fifteen years old) demonstrate his interest in nature and ancient sites. Some of these sketches were later used to illustrate his ''Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder''.

'''Dinamation International Corporation''' was a robotics effects company based in [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], and [[Tustin, California|Tustin]], [[California]], United States.

== History ==
It was founded in 1986 by former airline pilot Chris Mays and some neighbors and dropped in March 2001.  (A 2001 Wall Street Journal article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Decline of the Dinamation Dinos: How One Man's Robots Became Passe|work=Wall Street Journal|date=May 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the rise and fall and disappearance of its founder, Chris Mays.)  Originally begun as a way to lease handmade, one-of-a-kind, Japanese-produced robot dinosaurs to North American shopping malls, in time Dinamation defied its original mandate and came to produce its own production-line models for exhibit in [[science museum]]s and [[zoo]]s worldwide.  Dinamation was an example of an American company following, improving upon, and then outpacing its Japanese rivals.

Dinamation started out with a dozen movie special effects technicians, sculptors, painters, and engineers housed in third-tier industrial spaces in Santa Ana, California, where municipal, safety and corporate oversight was minimal and creative freedom maximal.  Given vague guidelines and a selection of consumer-grade dinosaur books for reference, they produced one "beta" show (which was sold, not leased) for a museum in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and also sold a display to the Mesa Southwest Museum in Phoenix, AZ, US (D.I.C. creatures are still on active exhibit there).  Techniques improved (and so did scientific fidelity, up to a point, under the guidance of paleontologists Dr.s [[Robert Bakker]] and [[George Callison]] and given the contributions made by many skilled engineers, inventor/sculptors such as public artists [[Raymond Persinger]] and [[Marianne O'Barr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obarr.sculptor.pro/PROFESSIONAL_SCULPTURE_PORTFOLIO_of_SCULPTOR_MARIANNE_OBARR,_Fine_Art,_Commercial,_Medical_Sculpture_and_Sculpture_Education/Comercial_Art_Portfolio.html/|title=Marianne O'Barr|work=Partial Dinamation Portfolio}}&lt;/ref&gt;, movie effects artists Steve Koch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0462412/|title=Steve Koch|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also designed paint schemes), Brian Sipe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0802608/|title=Brian Sipe|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matt Croteau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189396/|title=Matt Croteau|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, Dinamation had grown to 150 employees embedded in a complex corporate structure and operating out of a {{convert|39000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility in Tustin, California.

Museum attendances soared with every visit by the "Dinosaurs Alive!" shows and remained fairly high afterwards, boosting the revenues (and often the survival) of almost every venue.  Dinamation was for a time quite successful, with exhibits around the world in important museums including the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the National Geographic Museum, and the British Museum of Natural History.

At the end, under a cloud of financial mystery, over 700 American-made 'creatures' were left in limbo, scattered in science museums, trucks, and shipping containers across the United States and abroad.  Some of the orphaned robots have become permanent parts of the displays in the museums that had shows running when the company folded.  Other dinos were sold, lost, disassembled, disposed of, or recycled as spare parts for other dinos in better shape.  Other final vestiges of Dinamation can be seen as ubiquitous uncredited photographs of the dinosaur robots and preproduction art, scattered in children's books, toy art, video backgrounds, and recycled magazine illustrations, as well as appearances in cinema, for example, Woody Allen's film, Alice.    Images of the sculptures in process and in completed sculptures in museum displays are available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.DinosaurSculpture.com&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by far the largest collection of Dinamation creatures ended up as the possessions of Wonder Works USA, in Abilene, TX.  WonderWorks is now owned by Jack Hull, who has been leasing out this collection since 2001 (with the, now former, partner of Hull, John Thomas).

This huge collection has been kept in service by WonderWorks with the reliance upon two former Dinamation technicians, Ken Diggs and Mike Short, that formed Creature Craft in Nebraska.

The T-rex Cafe in Kansas City, KS also has a set of running Dinamation dinosaurs.  Much to children's and parents disappointments, they have always been a mechanically unsound, with extremely poor half attempts - if any- were made for the opening.  Besides gaping holes and pneumatic leaks, camouflage was possibly attempted, resulting in a very garish color palette and extremely questionable decisions to use patterns and techniques, resulting in something horrendous. 
The conditions have not improved in the decade since opening.

== Sculptures ==
Some examples of Dinamation's sculptures can still be seen at the Otway Fly in Victoria, Australia. They can also be viewed at the Museum of Western Colorado's Dinosaur Journey Museum in Fruita, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofwesternco.com/visit/dinosaur-journey/|title=Dinosaur Journey Museum|work=museumofwesternco.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103032748/http://www.museumofwesternco.com/visit/dinosaur-journey/|archivedate=2011-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include a ''Dilophosaurus'', ''Triceratops'', ''Stegosaurus'', ''Utahraptor'', and ''Apatosaurus'' robots, along with ''Tyrannosaurus'' sculptures.

A (very) partial list of the Dinamation robot creatures:

*''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', 1/2-size
*''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', full-size
*''[[Apatosaurus]]'', 1/2-size
*''[[Stegosaurus|Stegosaurus stenops]]'', 1/2-size
*''[[Allosaurus|Allosaurus fragilis]]'', full-size
*''[[Triceratops]]'' sp., 1/2-size
*''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' sp., full-size
*''[[Deinonychus]]'' sp., full-size
*''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' sp., 1/2-size

*''[[Dimetrodon]]'' sp., full-size
*''[[Tenontosaurus]]'', full-size, dead
*''[[Pterygotus]]'' sp., full-size
*''[[Utahraptor]]'' sp., full-size
*''[[Protoceratops]]'' and two ''[[Velociraptor]]s'', 1/2-size
*''[[Dilophosaurus]]'', full-size

and various neotonous 'baby' dinosaurs, including hatching eggs and a pteranadon feeding a fish to youths in a rocky "nest". Others included prehistoric mammals, whales, a great white shark, an 8-limbed Archeteuthis, or  "giant squid," giant insects, and versions of some animals from [[Dougal Dixon]]'s "Future Zoo."

'''''Dumb-Hounded''''' is an American animation short from 1943. It is notable for being the first cartoon to star [[Droopy]].&lt;ref name="IMDB explanation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dumb-Hounded|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035832/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on 20 March 1943 by  [[Metro Pictures|Metro]]-[[Goldwyn Pictures|Goldwyn]]-[[Louis B. Mayer|Mayer]] (MGM) and has a running time of seven minutes.&lt;ref name="IMDB explanation" /&gt;

==Plot==
A wolf escapes from Swing Swing Prison (a parody of [[Sing Sing Prison]]). Many [[bloodhound]]s are freed to search for him, but one of them, Droopy, remains behind and informs the audience that he is the hero of the story. He quickly finds the wolf who tries to escape from Droopy throughout the picture.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Dumb-Hounded |title=Doing Their Bit: Wartime American Animated Short Films, 1939–1945 |url={{Google books |id=hKrmuvh4PQkC |page=140 |plainurl=yes }} |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |accessdate=5 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, everywhere he flees Droopy pops up. In the end Droopy crushes the wolf by dropping a huge rock on his head. When Droopy receives his reward, he jumps about in complete enthusiasm, only to pause and inform the audience, "I'm happy".

* In the early 2000s a [[Cartoon Network]] short ''Thanks a Latté'' features Droopy and the Wolf character in a nearly-similar set-up; where he works at a coffee shop and forces a stingy wolf into giving him a tip when the wolf leaves the shop without paying for his [[latte]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7969">An '''executive summary''', or '''management summary''', is a short document or section of a document, produced for [[business]] purposes, that summarizes a longer report or proposal or a group of related reports in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with a large body of material without having to read it all. It usually contains a brief statement of the problem or proposal covered in the major document(s), background information, concise analysis and main conclusions. It is intended as an aid to decision-making by managers and has been described as the most important part of a [[business plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/documents/execsum/pop2a.cfm|title=Writing@CSU|website=writing.colostate.edu|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3660.html|title=Crafting a Powerful Executive Summary|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2013/12/03/business-plan-outline-23-point-checklist-for-success/|title=Business Plan Outline - 23 Point Checklist For Success|first=Dave|last=Lavinsky|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changeupmerseyside.org.uk/changeupdocs/CTA%20Business%20Planning%20Guide.pdf|title=Rough Guide to Business Planning|work=Greater Merseyside Changeup|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An executive summary differs from an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] in that an abstract will usually be shorter and is typically intended as an overview or orientation rather than being a condensed version of the full document. Abstracts are extensively used in academic research where the concept of the executive summary is not in common usage. "An abstract is a brief summarizing statement... read by parties who are trying to decide whether or not to read the main document", while "an executive summary, unlike an abstract, is a document in miniature that may be read in place of the longer document".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/abstract.htm|title=Abstract|website=www.mhhe.com|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
There is general agreement on the structure of an executive summary - books and training courses emphasise similar points.&lt;ref name=greenhall&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenhall|first=Margaret|title=Report Writing Skills Training Course - How to Write a Report and Executive Summary, and Plan, Design and Present Your Report - An Easy Format for ... of Exercises and Free Downloadable Workbook [|year=2010|publisher=Universe of Learning Ltd|isbn=978-1-84937-036-3|url=http://www.uolearn.com/reportwriting/writingexecutivesummaries.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csuwg&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Guide: Executive Summaries|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/documents/execsum/index.cfm|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howe&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary |url=http://www.fsb.muohio.edu/fsb/content/programs/howe-writing-initiative/student-resources/Writing%20an%20Executive%20Summary.doc |work=Howe Writing Initiative |publisher=Miami School of Business.

* be approximately 5-10% of the length of the main report&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* be written in language appropriate for the target audience&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* consist of short, concise paragraphs&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* begin with a summary&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* be written in the same order as the main report&lt;ref name=greenhall /&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;
* only include material present in the main report&lt;ref name=greenhall /&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;
* make recommendations&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* provide a justification&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* have a conclusion&lt;ref name=csuwg/&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;&lt;ref name=foster /&gt;
* be readable separately from the main report&lt;ref name=greenhall /&gt;&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;&lt;ref name=howe /&gt;
* sometimes summarize more than one document&lt;ref name=csuwg /&gt;

== Importance ==
Executive summaries are important as a communication tool in both academia and business. For example, members of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] Department of Agricultural Economics observes that "An executive summary is an initial interaction between the writers of the report and their target readers: decision makers, potential customers, and/or peers. A business leader’s decision to continue reading a certain report often depends on the impression the executive summary gives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agecon2.tamu.edu/people/faculty/williams-gary/429/Complete%20Writing%20Guidelines.pdf|title=Texas A&amp;M University Department of Agricultural Economics|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

It has been said that, by providing an easy digest of an often complex matter, an executive summary can lead policy makers and others to overlook important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=409|title=Murky Media|website=www.vision.org|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Amanda Sinclair of the [[University of Melbourne]] has argued that this is often an active rather than a passive process. In one study, centred on globalization, she found that policy makers face "pressures to adopt a simple reading of complex issues" and "to depoliticise and universalize all sorts of differences". She claims that "all research was framed under pre-defined and generic headings, such as business case points. The partners' reports were supposed to look the same. The standardization of research occurred via vehicles such as executive summaries: “executives only read the summaries” we were told”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan003381.pdf|title="Doing Critical Research for the Government of Australia By Amanda Sinclair"|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Colin Leys]], writing in The [[Socialist Register]], argues that executive summaries are used to present dumbed down arguments:  "there is remarkably little adverse comment on the steep decline that has occurred since 1980 in the quality of government policy documents, whose level of argumentation and use of evidence is all too often inversely related to the quality of their presentation (in the style of corporate reports, complete with executive summaries and flashy graphics)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/19.25.02_THE%20CYNICAL%20STATE.doc "The cynical state"  by Colin Lays, Socialist Register 2006 p1-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerrit Jan Michaëlis''' (1775, [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; 1857, [[Haarlem]]), was an 18th-century painter from the Northern Netherlands.

'''Joseph Gilbert Fates''' (September 29, 1914, [[Newark, New Jersey]] - May 1, 2000, [[New York City]]) was an American [[television producer]].

Nicknamed "Gil", Fates was the executive producer of ''[[What's My Line?]].'' Fates produced the game show its entire quarter-century span of [[CBS]] and syndicated runs. Fates and panelist [[Arlene Francis]] (who debuted on the second week) were with the show from 1950 until it ended in 1975. Fates also hosted ''[[CBS Television Quiz]]'', the first television game show ever to be broadcast regularly; and was credited as a creative consultant on ''[[Play Your Cards Right]]'', the British version of Goodson-Todman's ''[[Card Sharks]]''. Before [[World War II]], he was a [[stage actor]]. He also wrote a book in 1978 called ''What's My Line? The History of America's Most Famous Panel Show''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Gray v M [1998] 2 NZLR 161 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the legal defence of [[absolute privilege]] of matters raised in judicial proceedings that were subsequently used to in defamation claims in tort.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=6th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=9781877511400|year=2010 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Mrs M lodge a complaint with the Methodist church about the "inappropriate behavior" of its Timaru Minister Robin J G Gray.

The matter was subsequently resolved via mediation between the parties, which amongst other things, Gray agreed to give the complainant a written apology, which he duly did.

However, the complaint later led to Gray being "removed from the list of Presbyters", culminating in Gray losing his job as Chaplin at the Nelson Hospital.

However, despite the fact that he had previously apologized in writing to M for his conduct, he nonetheless sued her for defamation.

Facing defending a potentially long and expensive defamation action, she applied, successfully in the District Court, that laying a complaint with the Complaints Committee was an absolute privilege under the Defamation Act, akin to making a similar statement in Court, and Grays action was struck out.

On appeal, the High Court agreed as well.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal, sitting as a bench, disagreed, saying the Complaints Committee was not judicial,  and Gray's defamation claim was reinstated.

'''Herbar Digital''' is a research project at the [[Fachhochschule]] [[Hannover]] (FHH) from 2006 to 2011 for rationalising the virtualization of botanical document material and their usage by process optimization and automation.

== Research project ==
Conservatively estimated, 500 millions of dried plants — so called herbar specimens — are stored in [[herbarium]]s at [[botanical garden|botanic gardens]] across the world under scientifically controlled conditions. The aim of the third-party-funds financed research project is to automate the process of virtualization of herbar specimens and their management to make them digitally accessible to botanists and biologists. An examplary solution for the example herbarium of the [[Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem|botanic Garden in Berlin-Dahlem]] (ca. 3,5 million plant specimens) will allow to generalize the applied structure, software and technique to a level from that general reference solutions for efficient high-resolution scanning of any object of [[museum]] quality can be derived.

== Workflow ==
Herbar specimens have been scanned for some time at different spaces. However, the degree of automation of these solutions is very low, so that only a small number of herbarium specimens can be scanned each day. The [[University of Applied Sciences and Arts]] in [[Hannover]] has analysed industrial production workflows and derived approaches for scanning herbarium specimens. Automation is divided into three development focus points:
[[Image:Herbar digital workflow.png|thumb|250px|Herbar Digital base table]]

# Scanner–workplace with control mode,
# Technology management for scanning,
# System solutions taking staff into account.

The herbar specimens get scanned to [[Raw image format|RAW data]] with a scanner camera attached to a standard personal computer and stored on a server using [[SilverFast]] Ai software. Image opimization{{clarify|dated=April 2015|date=April 2015}} (color, contrast, and brightness) is done on a second computer with SilverFast HDR software. The post processed RAW files get converted in a suitable image format, controlled at a [[ICC profile|profiled]] graphic screen and stored back on the server.

A base unit is suited for paper sizes from [[DIN A3]] to [[DIN A2]] and is equipped with panel lights, a standard camera column and a scanner camera. The use of a controlled rotary indexing table provides new possibilities to improve performance. The rotary indexing table allows a new herbarium specimen to be loaded while another one is scanned. Access is also much easier, as the herbarium specimens are not reloaded directly under the panel lights. Apart from the time needed for scanning and turning the table 180°, the user determines the timing of the machine (3–12 rpm). The rotary indexing table can be controlled with a standard PC connected through a [[USB port]]. The scanner software is also installed on this computer. The rotary indexing table can be accessed from this computer without any problems using Herbar Digital Control software (HDC).

[[Image:Lühhike öppetus.jpeg|right|The title page. Due to wear and tear, some underlying pages are seen in upper right corner.]]

'''''Lühhike öppetus''''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for ''Brief Instruction''), by modern orthography 'Lühike õpetus', was the first [[periodical publication]] in the [[Estonian language]].  Edited by Dr. [[Peter Ernst Wilde]] and printed for a short while in 1766–1767, it described various simple medical techniques intended to be usable in the field by peasants.

The full title of the newspaper was ''Lühhike öppetus mis sees moned head rohhud täeda antakse, ni hästi innimeste kui ka veiste haigusse ning viggaduste vasto'', and it can be translated as ''Brief instruction announcing some good medicine, both for human and bovine ailments and traumas''.  It was printed weekly, with each issue having four pages.  A total of 41 issues were printed.

[[August Wilhelm Hupel]] was responsible for translating the content to [[Estonian language]].

== Classification ==
''Lühhike öppetus'' did not deal with [[news]]; thus, it is not universally classified as a [[newspaper]] — despite its format.  Various sources refer to it as a [[magazine]], a journal, or even a [[book]] published in 41 volumes.  The first regular [[Estonian language]] publication unequivocally considered a newspaper, the ''[[Tarto maa rahva Näddali-Leht]]'', appeared in 1807.

'''''McDonald v Attorney-General''''' is a cited case in New Zealand regarding satisfying the requirement in [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel 2|promissory estoppel]] for reliance by the other party.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
McDonald was a Southland wheat farmer. The Wheat Board had advised wheat growers that wheat grown that had a baking score would be purchased by the Board, and that such graded wheat could only be sold to the Board. In knowledge of all this McDonald expected the Board to purchase his wheat. However, due to an outbreak of wheat mould in Southland, the board found it had little demand for such wheat, and as a consequence, the Board refused to purchase his wheat.

McDonald eventually sold his wheat to other parties, at a loss, and he sued the Board for compensation.

==Held==
The court ruled that promissory estoppel applied here, and awarded McDonald compensation, effectively turning promissory estoppel from a shield, into a sword. Holland J stated "In converting promissory estoppel from a "shield" to a "sword" care must be taken not to extend it further into a weapon of the nature of an atomic bomb that will destroy the existing framework of legal principle by way of provision for compensation in the fields of both contract and tort"

{{Islam|culture}}
A '''mosque''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|s|k}}; from {{lang-ar|مَـسْـجِـد|masjid}}) is a [[place of worship]] for [[Muslim]]s. There are strict and detailed requirements in [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] jurisprudence ({{lang-ar|فِـقْـه}}, ''[[fiqh]]'') for a place of worship to be considered a mosque, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as [[musalla]]s.&lt;ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=4347&amp;CATE=4 |title=Fiqh of Masjid &amp; Musalla |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2011-11-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019002051/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=4347&amp;CATE=4|archivedate=2011-10-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and in the [[Islam]]ic ''[[Sharia|Sharī‘ah]]'' ({{lang-ar|شَـرِيْـعَـة}}, Law), after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Last Day]].&lt;ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid" /&gt;

Many mosques have elaborate [[dome]]s, [[minaret]]s, and prayer halls, in varying styles of architecture. Mosques originated on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], but are now found in all inhabited continents.

==Etymology==
[[File:A nomad's mosque in the eastern desert of Jordan.jpg|thumb|A nomad's mosque orientated towards [[Mecca]], 2013]]

The word 'mosque' entered the [[English language]] from the [[French language|French]] word ''mosquée'' that was probably derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''moschea'', a variant of Italian ''moscheta'', from either [[Middle Armenian language|Middle Armenian]] [[wikt:մզկիթ|մզկիթ]] (''mzkit‘'') or [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] {{lang-el|μασγίδιον}} (''masgídion'') or Spanish ''mezquita'', from {{lang-ar|مَـسْـجِـد|masjid}} (meaning "site of prostration (in prayer)" and hence a place of worship), either from [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean]] ''masg&lt;sup&gt;ĕ&lt;/sup&gt;dhā́'' or from Arabic {{lang-ar|سَـجَـدَ|sajada}} (meaning "to bow down in prayer"), probably ultimately from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''s&lt;sup&gt;ĕ&lt;/sup&gt;ghēdh''.&lt;ref&gt;For the word's origin from French and probable origin from Italian ''moscheta'', see "mosque, n.". ''OED Online''. December 2011. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/122562]. For the derivation of ''moscheta'' from Arabic ''sajada'' see "mesquita, n.". ''OED Online''. December 2011. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/117089]. For the probable origin of "sajada" from Aramaic, and the meanings of ''sajada'' and ''masjid'' in Arabic, see "masjid, n.". ''OED Online''. December 2011. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/114605]. For the inclusion of Spanish ''mesquita'', possible derivation from Nabataean ''masg&lt;sup&gt;ĕ&lt;/sup&gt;dhā́'', and the Aramaic ''s&lt;sup&gt;ĕ&lt;/sup&gt;ghēdh'', see Klein, E., ''A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language'' (Elsevier Publishing, 1966), p. 1007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sheikh Lotfallah Esfahan.JPG|thumb|The [[Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque]] standing on the eastern side of Naghsh-i Jahan Square, [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]]]
The first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the ''[[Kaaba|Ka‘bah]]'' ({{lang-ar|كَـعْـبَـة}}, '[[Cube]]') in [[Mecca]], which is now known as ''Al-Masjid Al-Ḥarâm'' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْـمَـسْـجِـد الْـحَـرَام}}, the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuban|1974|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that the ''Kaaba'' was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the [[Temple of solomon|Temple in Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=55&amp;translator=1&amp;start=0&amp;number=585#585|title=55. Prophets - Sahih Al-Bukhari - 585|website=www.searchtruth.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since as early as 638 [[AD]], the Sacred Mosque has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as ''[[Hajj|Ḥajj]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـجّ}}) to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others regard the first mosque in history to be the [[Quba Mosque]] in present-day [[Medina]] since it was the first structure built by [[Muhammad]] upon his [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration from Mecca]] in 622,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tajuddin|1998|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Mosque of the Companions, Massawa|Mosque of the Companions]] in the [[Eritrea]]n city of [[Massawa]] may have been constructed at around the same time.&lt;ref name="Reid2012Massawa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Richard J. |title=A History of Modern Africa: 1800 to the Present |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |chapter=The Islamic Frontier in Eastern Africa |page=106 |isbn=978-0470658987 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6RQtYwasUC&amp;pg |date=12 January 2012 |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Prophet Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, which is now known as the [[Masjid an-Nabawi]], or the Prophet's Mosque. Built on the site of his home, Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city.&lt;ref name="chiu678"&gt;{{harvnb|Chiu|2010|pp=67–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today's mosques, including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the ''[[mihrab]]'' and the tiered pulpit called the ''[[minbar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cosman|Jones|2008|p=610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then.&lt;ref name="chiu678" /&gt;

===Diffusion and evolution===
[[File:1 great mosque xian 2011.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]] incorporates traditional elements of [[Chinese architecture]]]]

Mosques had been built in [[Iraq]] and [[North Africa]] by the end of the 7th century, as Islam spread outside the Arabian Peninsula with early [[caliphate]]s. The [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] in [[Karbala]] is reportedly one of the oldest mosques in [[Iraq]], although its present form{{spaced ndash}}typical of [[Persian architecture]]{{spaced ndash}}only goes back to the 11th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The shrine, while still operating as a mosque, remains one of the holiest sites for [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], as it honors the death of the third [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia imam]], and Prophet Muhammad's grandson, [[Hussein ibn Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellows|2008|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] was reportedly the first mosque in [[Egypt]], serving as a religious and social center for [[Fustat]] (present-day [[Cairo]]) during its prime. Like the Imam Husayn Shrine, though, nothing of its original structure remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Netton|1996|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the later Shia [[Fatimid Caliphate]], mosques throughout Egypt evolved to include schools (known as ''[[madrasa]]s''), hospitals, and tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budge|2001|pp=123–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in present-day [[Tunisia]] was reportedly the first mosque built in northwest Africa, with its present form (dating from the 9th century) serving as a model for other Islamic places of worship in the [[Maghreb]]. It was the first to incorporate a square [[minaret]] (as opposed to the more common circular minaret) and includes [[nave]]s akin to a [[basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1287&amp;lang=en |publisher=The Qantara Project |title=Minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan |year=2008 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511205253/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1287&amp;lang=en |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elleh114"&gt;{{harvnb|Elleh|2002|pp=114–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those features can also be found in [[Andalusia]]n mosques, including the [[Grand Mosque of Cordoba]], as they tended to reflect the architecture of the [[Moors]] instead of their [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] predecessors.&lt;ref name="elleh114" /&gt; Still, some elements of [[Visigothic architecture]], like [[horseshoe arch]]es, were infused into the mosque architecture of Spain and the Maghreb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruggles|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mosque in East Asia was reportedly established in the 8th century in [[Xi'an]]. However, the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], whose current building dates from the 18th century, does not replicate the features often associated with mosques elsewhere.&lt;ref name="cow30"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1985|pp=30–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, minarets were initially prohibited by the state.&lt;ref name="ahm109"&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmed|2002|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following traditional [[Chinese architecture]], the Great Mosque of Xi'an, like many other mosques in eastern China, resembles a [[pagoda]], with a green roof instead of the yellow roof common on imperial structures in China. Mosques in western China were more likely to incorporate elements, like domes and minarets, traditionally seen in mosques elsewhere.&lt;ref name="cow30" /&gt;


[[File:Masjid-Kampung-Hulu-2364.jpg|thumb|[[Kampung Hulu Mosque]], the oldest mosque in [[Malaysia]] influenced by the [[Malay architecture|Malay]], [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] and [[Hindu architecture]]]]

A similar integration of foreign and local influences could be seen on the [[Indonesia]]n islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]], where mosques, including the [[Demak Great Mosque]], were first established in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="blobla439"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Javanese mosques took design cues from [[Hindu temple architecture|Hindu]], [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist]], and Chinese architectural influences, with tall timber, multi-level roofs similar to the pagodas of [[Balinese temple|Balinese Hindu temples]]; the ubiquitous Islamic dome did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="ahm109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Javanese style influenced the styles of mosques in Indonesia's [[Austronesia]]n neighbors—[[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="blobla439" /&gt;

[[File:Jama Masjid, Delhi.jpg|thumb|The [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi is India's largest mosque, and a classic example of the [[Mughal architecture|Mughal style of architecture]]]]
Muslim empires were instrumental in the evolution and spread of mosques. Although mosques were first established in India during the 7th century, they were not commonplace across [[Indian subcontinent|the subcontinent]] until the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Reflecting their [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] origins, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal-style]] mosques included [[onion dome]]s, [[ogee|pointed arches]], and elaborate circular minarets, features common in the [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and [[Architecture of Central Asia|Central Asian styles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in [[Delhi]] and the [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]], built in a similar manner in the mid-17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the largest mosques on the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asher|1992|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] was particularly instrumental in spreading Islam and establishing mosques within the [[Levant]], as the Umayyads constructed among the most revered mosques in the region — [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuban|1985|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque were influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]], a trend that continued with the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|2001|pp=101–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the early mosques in the Ottoman Empire were originally churches or cathedrals from the [[Byzantine Empire]], with the [[Hagia Sophia]] (one of those converted cathedrals) informing the architecture of mosques from after the [[fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Essa|Ali|2010|pp=230–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the Ottomans developed [[Ottoman architecture|their own architectural style]] characterized by large central rotundas (sometimes surrounded by multiple smaller domes), pencil-shaped minarets, and open [[facade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Essa|Ali|2010|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosques from the Ottoman period are still scattered across Eastern Europe, but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques in Europe has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Many major European cities are home to mosques, like the [[Grand Mosque of Paris]], that incorporate domes, minarets, and other features often found with mosques in Muslim-majority countries.&lt;ref name="blobla193"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mosque in North America was founded by [[Albanian American]]s in 1915, but the continent's oldest surviving mosque, the [[Mother Mosque of America]], only dates back to the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nimer|2002|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Europe, the number of American mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as Muslim immigrants, particularly from South Asia, have come in the United States. Greater than forty percent of mosques in the United States were constructed after 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grossman |first=Cathy Lynn |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2012-02-29/islamic-worship-growth-us/53298792/1 |publisher=USA Today |title=Number of U.S. mosques up 74% since 2000 |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion of non-Muslim places of worship===
{{main|Conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques}}
[[File:Turkey-3019 - Hagia Sophia (2216460729).jpg|thumb|The [[Hagia Sophia]] was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453]]

According to early [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historians]], towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims were allowed to retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houtsma |first=M. Th. |title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopedia of Islam, 1913-1936 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&amp;pg=PA321 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-09791-9 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in [[Damascus]], Syria, where in 705 [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] bought the church of [[John the Baptist|St. John]] from the [[Christian]]s and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Houtsma p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of turning churches into mosques were especially intensive in the villages where most of the inhabitants [[Religious conversion|converted]] to Islam. The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] turned many churches into mosques. [[Ottoman Turks]] converted nearly all churches, monasteries, and chapels in [[Constantinople]], including the famous [[Hagia Sophia]], into mosques immediately after [[fall of Constantinople|capturing the city in 1453]]. In some instances mosques have been established on the places of [[Judaism|Jewish]] or Christian sanctuaries associated with [[Bible|Biblical]] personalities who were also recognized by Islam.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hillenbrand |first=R |editor=P. J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=[[Wolfhart Heinrichs|W. P. Heinrichs]] |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online |title=Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosques have also been converted for use by other religions, notably in southern Spain, following the conquest of the Moors in 1492.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Islam Plans to Change the World |last=Wagner |first=William |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=99 |quote=When the Moors were driven out of Spain in 1492, most of the mosques were converted into churches |isbn=978-0-8254-3965-0|year=2004 |origyear=2004-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent of them is the [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]], itself constructed on the site of a church demolished during the period of Muslim rule. Outside of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], such instances also occurred in southeastern Europe once regions were no longer under Muslim rule.

==Religious functions==
The ''masjid jāmi‘'' ({{lang-ar|مَـسـجِـد جَـامِـع}}), a central mosque, can play a role in religious activities such as teaching the [[Quran]] and educating future imams.

===Prayers===
[[File:Istiqlal Mosque Eid ul Fitr Jamaah 2.JPG|thumb|Inside the [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], during [[Eid ul-Fitr]]]]

There are two holidays (''Eids'') in the [[Islamic calendar]]: ''[[Eid al-Fitr|ʻĪd al-Fiṭr]]'' ({{lang-ar|عِـيـد الْـفِـطْـر}}) and ''[[Eid al-Adha|ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā]]'' ({{lang-ar|عِـيـد الْأَضْـحَى}}), during which there are special prayers held at mosques in the morning. These [[Salat al Eid|Eid prayers]] are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so, in the absence of an outdoor ''[[Eidgah]]'' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|عید گاہ}}}}), a large mosque will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent [[convention center]]s or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards, [[town square]]s or on the outskirts of town in an ''Eidgah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/Eid-Prayers_1.html |accessdate=April 8, 2006 |title='Id Prayers (Salatul 'Idain) |publisher=University of Southern California |website=Compendium of Muslim Texts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223214532/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/Eid-Prayers_1.html |archivedate=December 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/eidgah.htm|title=Performance of Eid Salah in Eidgah (Open Field)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramadan===
Islam's holiest month, ''[[Ramadan|Ramaḍān]]'' ({{lang-ar|رَمَـضَـان}}), is observed through many events. As Muslims must [[sawm|fast]] during the day during Ramadan, mosques will host ''[[Iftar|Ifṭār]]'' ({{lang-ar|إِفْـطَـار}}) dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, that is ''[[Maghrib]]'' ({{lang-ar|مَـغْـرِب}}). Food is provided, at least in part, by members of the community, thereby creating daily [[potluck]] dinners. Because of the community contribution necessary to serve ''iftar'' dinners, mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the ''iftar'' dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold ''[[Suhoor|Suḥūr]]'' ({{lang-ar|سُـحُـور}}) meals before [[dawn]] to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, ''[[Fajr]]'' ({{lang-ar|فَـجْـر}}). As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing [[Alms|charity]] during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_51.html |accessdate=April 17, 2006 |title=Charity |publisher=University of Southern California |website=Compendium of Muslim Texts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205112728/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_51.html |archivedate=February 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taipei Grand Mosque - Fast Break.JPG|thumb|[[Iftar]] at [[Taipei Grand Mosque]], [[Taiwan]] during [[Ramadan]]]]
Following the last obligatory daily prayer (''[[Isha'|‘Ishâ’]]'' ({{lang-ar|عِـشَـاء}})) special, optional ''[[Tarawih|Ṫarâwîḥ]]'' ({{lang-ar|تَـرَاوِيـح}}) prayers are offered in larger mosques. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours each night, usually one member of the community who has memorized the entire Quran (a [[Hafiz (Quran)|Hafiz]]) will recite a segment of the book.&lt;ref name="teach-islam"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Islam |last=Maqsood |first=Ruqaiyyah Waris |isbn=978-0-07-141963-5 |date=April 22, 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=57–8, 72–5, 112–120 |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe [[Laylat al-Qadr]], the night Muslims believe that Muhammad first received Quranic revelations.&lt;ref name="teach-islam" /&gt; On that night, between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night

During the last ten days of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], larger mosques within the Muslim community will host ''[[Iʿtikāf|I‘ṫikāf]]'' ({{lang-ar|إِعْـتِـكَـاف}}), a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate. Muslims performing itikaf are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about Islam. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay.&lt;ref name="teach-islam" /&gt;

===Charity===
The third of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as ''[[Zakat|Zakâṫ]]'' ({{lang-ar|زَكَـاة}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Matthew |title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIvHQc0-rwgC&amp;pg=PA156 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-0-85793-073-6 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give ''zakat'' and, if necessary, collect it. Before the holiday of ''Eid ul-Fitr'', mosques also collect a special ''zakat'' that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday.

===Frequency of attendance===

The frequency by which Muslims attend mosque services vary greatly around the world. In some countries, weekly attendance at religious services are common among Muslims while in others, attendance is rare.

In the United States in particular, it has been shown in a study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding that Muslim Americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely to work with their neighbors to solve community problems (49 vs. 30 percent), be registered to vote (74 vs. 49 percent), and plan to vote (92 vs. 81 percent). Overall, “there is no correlation between Muslim attitudes toward violence and their frequency of mosque attendance.” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ispu.org/american-muslim-poll-2017/|title=American Muslim Poll 2017 {{!}} ISPU|date=2017-03-21|work=Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to mosque attendance, data shows that American Muslim women and American Muslim men attend the mosque at similar rates (45% for men and 35% for women). Additionally, when compared to the general public looking at the attendance of religious services, young Muslim Americans attend the mosque at closer rates to older Muslim Americans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Contemporary civic roles==
{{see also|Political aspects of Islam}}
[[File:Aerial view of East London Mosque complex - Feb 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[East London Mosque]] was one of the first in Britain to be allowed to use [[Loudspeakers in mosques|loudspeakers]] to broadcast the [[adhan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eade|first1=John|editor1-last=Metcalf|editor1-first=Barbara Daly|title=Making Muslim Space in North America and Europe|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520204041|chapter-url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2s2004p0&amp;chunk.id=s1.12.69&amp;toc.id=ch12&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=19 April 2015|chapter=Nationalism, Community, and the Islamization of Space in London|quote=As one of the few mosques in Britain permitted to broadcast calls to prayer (azan), the mosque soon found itself at the center of a public debate about “noise pollution” when local non-Muslim residents began to protest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The late 20th century saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes. Today, civic participation is commonly promoted in mosques in the [[Western world]]. Because of the importance in the community, mosques are used for preaching peaceful coexistence with non-believers, even in times of adversity.

Large mosques sometimes play a political role as well. In Islamic countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, political subjects are preached by imams at Friday congregations on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,411903,00.html |title=What Muslims Hear at Friday Prayers |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |publisher=Der Spiegel |date=April 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other Islamic countries, imams are usually banned from mentioning political issues.

===Advocacy===
Countries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the [[Greater Middle East]] to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation.&lt;ref name="tc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.edu/muslim-nyc/research/projects/role%20of%20muslims.html |publisher=Teachers' College – Columbia University |title=The Role of Mosques in the Civic and Political Incorporation of Muslim American |last=Jamal |first=Amany |accessdate=April 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143701/http://www.tc.edu/muslim-nyc/research/projects/role%20of%20muslims.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American mosques host [[voter registration]] and civic participation drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process. As a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep Muslims informed about the issues facing the [[Ummah|Muslim community]], regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in [[protest]]s, sign [[petition]]s, and otherwise be involved in politics.&lt;ref name="tc" /&gt;

Nevertheless, a link between [[Ideology|political views]] and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Study: Islam devotion not linked to terror |url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0405/Jun13_05/03.shtml |publisher=The University Record Online |last=Swanbrow |first=Diane |date=June 23, 2005 |accessdate=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in February 2006, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] as vehicles to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4747886.stm |date=February 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |title=Friday prayer plea for Iraq calm |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social conflict===
{{see also|Islamophobia|Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
As they are considered important to the Muslim community, mosques, like other places of worship, can be at the heart of social conflicts. The [[Babri Mosque]] was the subject of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed on December 6, 1992 as the mosque was built by [[Babur]] allegedly on the site of a previous [[Hindu temple]] marking the birthplace of [[Rama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flashpoint Ayodhya |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0407/abstracts/ayodhya.html |date=July–August 2004 |publisher=Archaeology |last=Romey |first=Kristen M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to [[Bombay riots|rioting in Bombay]] (present-day [[Mumbai]]) as well as [[1993 Bombay bombings|bombings in 1993]] that killed 257 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rollins |first=John |title=International Terrorism and Transnational Crime: Security Threats, U. S. Policy, and Considerations for Congress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HApgi3eCLxoC&amp;pg=PA15 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=November 2010 |publisher=DIANE Publishing |isbn=978-1-4379-2756-6 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bombings in February 2006 and [[2007 al-Askari Mosque bombing|June 2007]] seriously damaged Iraq's [[al-Askari Mosque]] and exacerbated existing tensions. Other mosque bombings in Iraq, both before and after the February 2006 bombing, have been part of the conflict between the country's groups of Muslims. However, mosque bombings have not been exclusive to Iraq; in June 2005, a [[suicide attack|suicide bomber]] killed at least 19 people at an Afghan [[Shia Islam|Shia]] mosque near Jade Maivand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060100263.html |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |title=Suicide Bomber Kills 20 in Afghan Mosque |publisher=The Washington Post |page=A16 |last=Aizenman |first=N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, [[2006 Jama Masjid explosions|two explosions]] occurred at India's Jama Masjid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaur |first=Mahendra |title=Indian Affairs Annual 2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fo-LS2-nOZMC&amp;pg=PA146 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=1 June 2006 |publisher=Gyan Publishing House |isbn=978-81-7835-529-0 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darpan |first=Pratiyogita |title=Pratiyogita Darpan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trBMVnMmk6oC&amp;pg=PT175 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=February 2009 |publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan |page=1509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], several American mosques were targeted in attacks ranging from simple [[vandalism]] to [[arson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indypressny.org/article.php3?ArticleID=3113 |title=IPA NY Voices That Must Be Heard |publisher=Indypressny.org |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071011162515/http://www.indypressny.org/article.php3?ArticleID=3113 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Jewish Defense League]] was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,40693,00.html |title=JDL Chairman, Follower Accused of Plotting to Bomb Mosque, Congressman |publisher=Associated Press via FOX News |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar attacks occurred throughout the United Kingdom following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]. Outside the Western world, in June 2001, the [[Hassan Bek Mosque]] was the target of vandalism and attacks by hundreds of Israelis after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in a night club in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1366719.stm |title=Arafat orders immediate ceasefire |date=June 3, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=John |title=Paranoia, poverty and wild rumours – a journey through BNP country |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,,1758974,00.html |date=April 22, 2006 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=May 28, 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12927212/ |title=Italians fear mosque plans |last=Carlile |first=Jennifer |date=May 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 28, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mosquegoing is highly encouraged for men, it is permitted to stay at home when one feels at risk from Islamophobic persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rahman|first1=Fazlur|title=Major Themes of the Qur'an: Second Edition|date=2009|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi influence===
[[File:Faisal mosque2.jpg|thumb|Funded by King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], the [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]] is the largest mosque in [[Pakistan]]]]

Although the Saudi involvement in Sunni mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s, it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign Sunni mosques.&lt;ref name="money-trails"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A13266-2004Aug18 |title=U.S. Eyes Money Trails of Saudi-Backed Charities |date=August 19, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2007 |last=Ottoway |first=David B. |page=A1 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of Sunni mosques in countries around the world. An estimated [[United States dollar|US$]]45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Sunni Islamic schools in foreign countries. ''[[Ain al-Yaqeen]]'', a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031215/15terror.htm |title=The Saudi Connection |date=December 15, 2003 |accessdate=April 17, 2006 |last=Kaplan |first=David E. |publisher=U.S. News and World Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616161452/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031215/15terror.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1992, mosques in war-torn Afghanistan saw many contributions from Saudi citizens.&lt;ref name="money-trails" /&gt; The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in [[Rome]] represent two of Saudi Arabia's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud]] contributed US$8 million&lt;ref name="money-trails" /&gt; and US$50&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingfahdbinabdulaziz.com/main/m4506.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020108064304/http://www.kingfahdbinabdulaziz.com/main/m4506.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 8, 2002 |accessdate=April 17, 2006 |publisher=King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz |title=Islamic Center in Rome, Italy }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the two mosques, respectively.

''Arab-plan'' or [[hypostyle]] mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and [[Mediterranean climate]]s, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|supports]].&lt;ref name="Masdjid1" /&gt; One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name = "mit-handout"/&gt; Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1" /&gt;

The first departure within mosque design started in Persia (Iran). The [[Persian people|Persians]] had inherited a rich [[Iranian architecture|architectural legacy]] from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and the [[Sarvestan Palace]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/arc/ind/2_meisaku/55_shah/sha_eng.htm |title=THE ROYAL MOSQUE (MASJED-e-EMAM) in Isfahan, Iran |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Islamic architecture]] witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as ''[[iwan]]s''. During [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq rule]], as [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]] was on the rise, the [[Shah Mosque#Design – the four-iwan style|four-iwan]] arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]]s, firmly established the courtyard façade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as more important than the actual buildings themselves.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; They typically took the form of a square-shaped central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of gateways to the spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Stephen P. |title=Half the world: the social architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590-1722|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVAqAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 February 2013|year=1999|publisher=Mazda Pub.|isbn=978-1-56859-087-5|pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians also introduced [[Persian gardens]] into mosque designs. Soon, a distinctly [[Iranian architecture|Persian style]] of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]], and also [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]], mosque designs.

The Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060918221451/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |archivedate = September 18, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1" /&gt; Hajja Soad's mosque took a [[pyramid]] shape that is a creative style in Islamic architecture.

The [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan, in a relatively unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab [[Bedouin]]'s tent,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} with its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets. However, unlike traditional mosque design, it lacks a dome. The mosque's architecture is a departure from the long history of South Asian Islamic architecture.

Mosques built in Southeast Asia often represent the [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesian-Javanese style architecture]], which are different from the ones found throughout the Greater Middle East. The ones found in Europe and North America appear to have various styles but most are built on Western architectural designs, some are former churches or other buildings that were used by non-Muslims. In Africa, most mosques are old but the new ones are built in imitation of those of the Middle East. This can be seen in the [[Abuja National Mosque]] in Nigeria and others.

===Minarets===
[[File:Tower of the Great Mosque of Kairouan.JPG|thumb|left|The oldest standing minaret in the world at the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]]]
[[File:Mevlid-i Halil Mosque 17.jpg|thumb|Typical Ottoman minarets in Turkey]]

A common feature in mosques is the [[minaret]], the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The tallest minaret in the world is located at the [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]], Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Call to Prayer: My Travels in Spain, and Morocco |last=Walters |first=Brian |date=May 17, 2004 |publisher=Virtualbookworm Publishing |isbn=978-1-58939-592-3 |page=14 |chapter=The Prophet's People |quote=Its 210-meter minaret is the tallest in the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Kingfisher Geography encyclopedia. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}.

The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like [[Wahhabi]]s, avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and [[hazard]]ous in case of collapse. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}{{dubious|date=February 2015}}The first minaret was constructed in 665 in [[Basra]] during the reign of the Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with Christian churches with their [[bell tower]]s. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose—calling the faithful to prayer.&lt;ref name="Manara"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hillenbrand |first=R |editor=P.J.

Before the five required daily prayers, a ''[[Mu'adhin|Mu’adhdhin]]'' ({{lang-ar|مُـؤَذِّن}}) calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the ''[[Adhan|Adhān]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَذَان}}, Call to Prayer), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The ''adhan'' is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a ''muezzin'' for each prayer to say the ''adhan'' as it is a recommended practice or ''[[Sunnah]]'' ({{lang-ar|سُـنَّـة}}) of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. At mosques that do not have minarets, the ''adhan'' is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground.&lt;ref name="teach-islam" /&gt; The ''[[Iqama|Iqâmah]]'' ({{lang-ar|إِقَـامَـة}}), which is similar to the ''adhan'' and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.

===Mihrab===
[[File:Haga Sofia RB5.jpg|thumb|Mihrab in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]

A ''[[mihrab|miḥrāb]]'' ({{lang-ar|مِـحْـرَاب}}), also spelled as ''mehrab'' is a semicircular [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] in the wall of a mosque that indicates the ''[[qibla]]h'' ({{lang-ar|قِـبْـلَـة}}, the direction of the [[Kaaba]]) in [[Mecca]], and hence the direction that [[Muslim]]s should face when praying. The wall in which a ''mihrab'' appears is thus the "''qibla'' wall." ''Mihrab''s should not be confused with the ''[[minbar]]'' ({{lang-ar|مِـنـۢبَـر}}), which is the raised platform from which an Imam (leader of prayer) addresses the congregation.

===Domes===
[[File:Shat Gombuj Mosque (ষাট গম্বুজ মসজিদ) 005.jpg|Shait Gombuj Moshjid in Bangladesh built in the 1400s|right|thumb]]

The domes, often placed directly above the main prayer hall, may signify the vaults of the [[jannah|heaven]] and sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Symmetries of Nature: A Handbook for Philosophy of Nature and Science |last=Mainzer |first=Klaus |date=June 1, 1996 |isbn=978-3-11-012990-8 |page=124 |chapter=Art and Architecture |quote=the dome arching over the believers like the spherical dome of the sky |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time progressed, domes grew, from occupying a small part of the roof near the mihrab to encompassing the whole roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the Mughals in India popularized [[Onion dome|onion-shaped domes]] in South Asia which has gone on to become characteristic of the Arabic architectural style of dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date=September 24, 1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=256 |isbn=978-0-521-26728-1 |chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mosques have multiple, often smaller, domes in addition to the main large dome that resides at the center.

===Prayer hall===
The prayer hall, also known as the ''muṣallá'' ({{lang-ar|مُـصَـلَّى}}), rarely has furniture; chairs and pews are generally absent from the prayer hall so as to allow as many worshipers as possible to line the room.&lt;ref name="unitulsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |publisher=The University of Tulsa |title=Mosque FAQ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330202640/http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |archivedate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mosques have [[Islamic calligraphy]] and Quranic verses on the walls to assist worshippers in focusing on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book, the Quran, as well as for decoration.&lt;ref name="teach-islam" /&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan, prayer hall.jpg|thumbnail|The hypostyle prayer hall in the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]]]]
Often, a limited part of the prayer hall is sanctified formally as a masjid in the sharia sense (although the term masjid is also used for the larger mosque complex as well). Once designated, there are onerous limitations on the use of this formally designated masjid, and it may not be used for any purpose other than worship; restrictions that do not necessarily apply to the rest of the prayer area, and to the rest of the mosque complex (although such uses may be restricted by the conditions of the ''[[waqf]]'' that owns the mosque).&lt;ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid"/&gt;

In many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall is in the hypostyle form (the roof held up by a multitude of columns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kleiner |first=Fred S. |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA265 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-57355-5 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kleiner |first=Fred S. |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA267 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-57355-5 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the ''qiblah'' wall, the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The qiblah wall should, in a properly oriented mosque, be set perpendicular to a line leading to [[Mecca]], the location of the Kaaba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=December 16, 1998 |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |page=150 |isbn=978-0-520-20802-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregants pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the qiblah wall, usually at its center, is the mihrab, a niche or depression indicating the direction of Mecca. Usually the mihrab is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during Friday prayers, a raised ''minbar'' or pulpit is located to the side of the mihrab for a ''[[Khatib|Khaṭīb]]'' ({{lang-ar|خَـطِـيـب}}), or some other speaker to offer a ''[[Khuṭbah]]'' ({{lang-ar|خُـطْـبَـة}}, Sermon). The mihrab serves as the location where the imam leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ablution facilities===
[[File:Ablution area inside Eastern wall of Badshahi mosque.JPG|thumb|The ''[[wudu]]'' ("ablution") area, where Muslims wash their hands, forearm, face and feet before they pray. Example from the [[Badshahi Mosque]], [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]]]

As [[Ritual purification#Islam|ritual purification]] precedes all prayers, mosques often have [[Wudu|ablution]] fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire for cleanliness extends to the prayer halls where shoes are disallowed to be worn anywhere other than the cloakroom. Thus, foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques.&lt;ref name="unitulsa" /&gt;

===Contemporary features===
Modern mosques have a variety of amenities available to their congregants. As mosques are supposed to appeal to the community, they may also have additional facilities, from [[clinic|health clinics]] to [[library|libraries]] to [[gym]]nasiums, to serve the community.

===Symbols===
Certain symbols are represented in a mosque's architecture to allude to different aspects of the Islamic religion. One of these feature symbols is the spiral. The "cosmic spiral" found in designs and on minarets is a references to heaven as it has "no beginning and no end".&lt;ref&gt;ERZEN, JALE NEJDET. "Reading Mosques: Meaning and Architecture in Islam." The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 69, no. 1 (2011): 129. https://www.jstor.org/stable/42635843.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosques also often have floral patterns or images of fruit and vegetables. These are allusions to the paradise after death.&lt;ref&gt;ERZEN, JALE NEJDET. "Reading Mosques: Meaning and Architecture in Islam." The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 69, no. 1 (2011): 126. https://www.jstor.org/stable/42635843.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and etiquette==
Mosques, in accordance with Islamic practices, institute a number of rules intended to keep Muslims focused on worshiping [[God in Islam|God]]. While there are several rules, such as those regarding not allowing shoes in the prayer hall, that are universal, there are many other rules that are dealt with and enforced in a variety of ways from mosque to mosque.

===Prayer leader (Imam)===
Appointment of a prayer leader is considered desirable, but not always obligatory.&lt;ref name="mawardi112"&gt;{{cite book |last=Abu al-Hasankok Ibn Muhammad Ibn Habib |first=Al-Mawardi |authorlink=Al-Mawardi |title=The Ordinances of Government (''Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya w'al-Wilayat al-Diniyya'') |publisher=Garnet Publishing |location=Lebanon |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-85964-140-8 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent prayer leader (imam) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt; In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler;&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt; in private mosques, however, appointment is made by members of the congregation through [[majority rule|majority voting]]. According to the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab|school]] of Islamic jurisprudence, the individual who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt;

Leadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt; According to the Hanafi and [[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools, however, argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt; An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Muslim scholars]] agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt;

All Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt; Nevertheless, women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9WF1fRGOsQC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false |title=Karin van Nieuwkerk, "Women Embracing Islam" |page=63 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773769 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleanliness===
{{see also|Ritual purity in Islam}}
[[File:Zoetermeer Meerzicht Moskee Qibla (04).JPG|upright|thumb|Storage for shoes]]

All mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as ''wudu''. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0016.aspx |publisher=SunniPath |website=SunniPath Library |accessdate=July 12, 2006 |title=Chapter 16.

===Dress===
Islam requires that its adherents wear [[Islam and clothing|clothes]] that portray [[modesty]]. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Likewise, it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing that covers to the wrists and ankles, and cover their heads with a ''[[Hijab|Ḥijāb]]'' ({{lang-ar|حِـجَـاب}}), or other covering. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear Middle Eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.&lt;ref name="teach-islam" /&gt;

===Concentration===
As mosques are places of worship, those within the mosque are required to remain respectful to those in prayer. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |title=Building Cultural Competency: Understanding Islam, Muslims, and Arab Culture |publisher=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |url=http://www.maec.org/2004conferencepapers/ismail.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724145207/http://www.maec.org/2004conferencepapers/ismail.doc |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 24, 2006 |page=15 |format=Doc |accessdate=July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Islamic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ondWbP0sB-MC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John Renard (1996), ''Seven Doors to Islam: Spirituality and the Religious Life of Muslims''. University of California Press. p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting [[image]]s and [[symbol]]s so as not to divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.

===Gender separation===
{{further|Gender segregation and Islam}}
[[File:Sultan Abdul Majid mosque in Byblos, Lebanon (for women only).JPG|thumb|A women-only mosque in [[Byblos]], [[Lebanon]]]]

There is nothing written in the Qurʼan about the issue of space in mosques and gender separation. However, traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayer{{spaced ndash}}kneeling on the floor, head to the ground{{spaced ndash}}made mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a ''[[hadith|ḥadīth]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـدِيـث}}) in which Muhammad supposedly said: "The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses," although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in. The second Sunni caliph ʻ[[Umar]] at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be sexually harassed or assaulted by men, so he required them to pray at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html#mosque |accessdate=April 15, 2006 |title=Women in Society |publisher=University of Southern California |website=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Doi |first=Abdur Rahman I. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409200739/http://usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html |archivedate=April 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1" /&gt;

Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumuʻah, are mandatory for men but optional for women. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.columbiajournalist.org/rw1_dinges/2005/article.asp?subj=national&amp;course=rw1_dinges&amp;id=624 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527161519/http://www.columbiajournalist.org/rw1_dinges/2005/article.asp?subj=national&amp;course=rw1_dinges&amp;id=624 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 27, 2006 |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |date=January 26, 2006 |title=Muslim Women Seek More Equitable Role in Mosques |last=Rezk |first=Rawya |publisher=The Columbia Journalist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Muslims in mosques===
[[File:Bush Islamic Center Washington.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W. Bush]] inside the [[Islamic Center of Washington]], D.C.]]

Under most interpretations of ''sharia'', non-Muslims are permitted to enter mosques provided that they respect the place and the people inside it.{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} A dissenting opinion and minority view is presented by followers of the [[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence, who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="mawardi112" /&gt;

The Quran addresses the subject of non-Muslims, and particularly [[polytheism|polytheists]], in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter, [[At-Tawba|Sura At-Tawba]]. The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who ''join gods with Allah''—polytheists—from entering mosques:
{{Quote|It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.|Quran, ''[[Sura]]'' 9 (At-Tawba), ''[[Ayah]]'' 17&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|17|s=ns|t=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The twenty-eighth verse of the same chapter is more specific as it only considers polytheists in the Sacred Mosque, the [[Masjid al-Haram]] in Mecca:
{{Quote|O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.|Quran, Sura 9 (At-Tawba), ayah 28&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|28|s=ns|t=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], these verses were followed to the letter at the times of Muhammad, when [[Jews]] and Christians, considered [[monotheism|monotheists]], were still allowed to the Masjid al-Haram. However, the Umayyad caliph [[Umar II]] later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present-day Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1" /&gt; Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the [[Hassan II Mosque]] in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html |title=Morocco travel |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004112/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also many other places in the West as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques. Most mosques in the United States, for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month. Many mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takim |first=Liyakatali |date=July 2004 |title=From Conversion to Conversation: Interfaith Dialogue in Post 9–11 America |journal=The Muslim World |volume=94 |pages=343–355 |url=http://www.macdonald.hartsem.edu/articles/mw943f.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2004.00058.x |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618192654/http://macdonald.hartsem.edu/articles/mw943f.pdf |archivedate=June 18, 2006 |df= }} [http://www.ltakim.com/ Liyakatali Takim] is a professor at [[McMaster University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4511780.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |title=Laptop link-up: A day at the mosque |date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims. Likewise, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and the city of [[Medina]] that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Beliefs &amp; Religions |last=Goring |first=Rosemary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |date=May 1, 1997 |isbn=978-1-85326-354-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of [[List of religions and spiritual traditions|religious affiliation]] are expected to respect the rules and [[decorum]] for mosques.&lt;ref name="teach-islam" /&gt;

In modern Turkey, non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are some strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures, etc.) Similar rules apply to mosques in Malaysia, where larger mosques that are also tourist attractions (such as the [[National Mosque of Malaysia|Masjid Negara]]) provide robes and headscarves for visitors who are deemed inappropriately attired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Peter |title=Malaysia, Singapore &amp; Brunei |year=1996 |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=Hawthorn, Vic. |isbn=978-0-86442-393-1 |edition=6 |first2=Chris |last2=Taylor |first3=Hugh |last3=Finlay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain times and places, non-Muslims were expected to behave a certain way in the vicinity of a mosque: in some Moroccan cities, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Stillman |title=The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book |publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America |location=Philadelphia |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-8276-0116-1 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 18th-century Egypt, Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bat Ye'or |authorlink=Bat Ye'or |title=Islam and Dhimmitude.

The association of the mosque with education remained one of its main characteristics throughout history,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} and the school became an indispensable appendage to the mosque. From the earliest days of Islam, the mosque was the center of the Muslim community, a place for prayer, meditation, religious instruction, political discussion, and a school. Anywhere Islam took hold, mosques were established; and basic religious and educational instruction began.&lt;ref&gt;Qureshi, M. 1990. ''The Role of the Mosque in Islam''.

The '''muki''' ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] for [[asphyxia]], also for a [[goblin]] who lives in subterranean caves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Simi}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled ''muqui'' or ''mooqui'') is a [[goblin]]-like creature in the mythology of the Central [[Andes]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]]. He is known to be a [[miner]] and his existence is constrained to underground spaces: The ''muki'' lives inside the mines.

Despite the distance and the isolation of the mining camps, the belief and the description of the ''muki'' is consistent throughout Peru, from the highlands of [[Puno Region|Puno]] in the south to [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]] in the north. Nonetheless, the names differ: ''chinchiliku'' (Moquegua), ''[[anchanchu]]'' or ''janchanchu'' (Puno), ''jusshi'' (Cajamarca) and ''muki'' ([[Pasco Region|Pasco]] and Andean regions of Bolivia).

== Appearance ==
The ''muki'' is considered to be a [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]] due to its height, since it is no taller than 2 feet (0,61 meters). In the traditions of [[Cerro de Pasco]], the ''muki'' is a small brawny creature with a disproportionate body. His head is attached to his body, but he lacks a neck. His voice is deep and husky, not matching his appearance, his long hair is bright blonde, his face is hairy and reddish, with a long white beard. His look is deep, aggressive and hypnotic and his eye reflect the light as if they were made of metal. In some mining traditions, he has two horns that are used to break the rocks and point at the mineral veins. His skin is very pale and he carries a mining lantern. Sometimes he is described as having pointy ears.

As it is noted above, there is more than one type of ''muki'' in legend. Just like there is diversity in the mining [[Elf|elves]] at a universal level, there are many varieties of ''muki'' in the underground world of the Andes. They are known for the places where they became visible. The oral traditions of each mine help to identify them by region, thus a ''muki'' can be from Huacracocha, Goyllar, Morococha, El Diamante, Santender, La Mina Tentadora, La Mina Julcani, Excelsior.

Following the safety regulations of his work, the ''muki'' wears a helmet, a miner’s outfit and studded boots. In other traditions, he is described as a small elf with a green outfit, sometimes with a very fine [[vicuña]] cape or with the waterproof outfit proper of a miner. He usually carries a lantern or a flashlight, depending on the technological level of the mine. He also walks like a [[duck]] because his feet are of abnormal size, and sometimes his legs can take the shape of a [[goose]] or [[crow]]’s.

But the description of the ''muki'' changes with time. Around the 1930s, he was said to wander the mines while holding a gas lantern and wearing a vicuña [[poncho]]. He was described as having two small shiny horns and to speak with a soft voice. Nowadays he has a more updated look: mining outfit, rain boots and a battery flashlight. Sometimes he shape shifts into an animal or a blonde white man to appear to the miners and deceive them.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Muqui.jpg|thumbnail|550px|The ''muki'' inhabits the mines of the Andes.]]

The ''muki'' lives in lonely places and their attacks inspire fear in their victims and adversaries. They are known for stealing defenseless children. Elders advise that when dealing with the ''muki'', one should use his/her belt to battle him without succumbing to fear.

The fusion (syncretism) of the Andean and Christian cultures brought European beliefs into this myth, such that the main victims of these goblins were the morito ([[Baptism|unbaptized]]) children. Or as it is said in the southern regions of Peru, that these unbaptized children are the ones that become ''mukis'' themselves. In some tales, these unbaptized children are kidnapped by the goblins, who live in fig or banana trees, and kept until they turn into goblins too. The skin of the children who spend time with these creatures turns very pale and it is advised to take the victims to church at once so they can receive the sacrament.

The belief in the ''muki'' comes from old Andean traditions about [[demon]]s and small creatures who inhabit the [[Pacha (Inca mythology)#Ukhu Pacha|Ukhu Pacha]] (“world of below”) and the miners need to explain many of the extraordinary daily occurrences of their lives.

The ''muki'' can be by himself or in groups, but they are known to prefer living on their own. They live in a timeless world of eternal darkness and they don’t age, as if they were not affected by the pass of time. The ''muki'' likes to whistle loudly, and thus warn of danger to the miners of their liking.

The ''muki'' is a goblin with a lot of power: he can make the metal veins appear and disappear, sense the moods and emotions of the miners, help with the miner’s work by softening or hardening the metal veins, etc. He is known to help miners and sometimes to make pacts with them. He gravitates towards discreet and honest people, who will fulfill their promises and not share the details of their interaction with him.

Many stories coincide on the fact that it is possible to capture the Mooqui and make a pact with him. Very often he offers to do the miners’ work for some coca, alcohol or the company of a woman, as that helps him feel less lonely. Yet, the outcome tends to be tragic due to the miner rarely being able to do as promised. When this occurs, the ''muki'' takes the miner’s life.

{{Nanjing Massacre}}
{{History of the Republic of China}}

The '''Nanjing Massacre''', or '''Rape of Nanjing''', was an episode of [[mass murder]] and [[war rape|mass rape]] committed by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese troops against the residents of [[Nanjing]] (Nanking), then the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In the [[Chinese postal romanization|Postal]] [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] system used at the time, the city's name was [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as "Nanking", and the event called the '''Nanking Massacre''' or '''Rape of Nanking'''.

The massacre occurred over a period of six weeks starting on December 13, 1937, the day that the Japanese [[Battle of Nanking|captured Nanjing]]. During this period, soldiers of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] murdered Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants who numbered an estimated 40,000 to over 300,000,&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Mark and Roberts, Penny. ''The Massacre in History''. 1999, page 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tot&gt;Totten, Samuel. ''Dictionary of Genocide''. 2008, 298–299.&lt;/ref&gt; and perpetrated widespread [[wartime sexual violence|rape]] and [[looting]].&lt;ref&gt;Iris Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/03/31/as_film_japan_massacre_documentary|author=Lee, Min|title=New film has Japan vets confessing to Nanjing rape|publisher=Salon/Associated Press|date=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most Japanese military records on the killings were kept secret or destroyed shortly after the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, historians have been unable to accurately estimate the death toll of the massacre. The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] in Tokyo estimated in 1946 that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident.&lt;ref name="IMTFE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgement: International Military Tribunal for the Far East|work=Chapter VIII: Conventional War Crimes (Atrocities)|date=November 1948|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/IMTFE/IMTFE-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's official estimate is more than 300,000 dead based on the evaluation of the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]] in 1947. The death toll has been actively contested among scholars since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Berghahn Books" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=David B.|date=December 2005|title=Forgetting and Denying: Iris Chang, the Holocaust and the Challenge of Nanking|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v42/n4/full/8800111a.html|journal=International Politics|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|volume=42|issue=4|pages=403–27|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800111|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event remains a contentious political issue and a stumbling block in [[China-Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]]. The Chinese government has been accused of exaggerating aspects of the massacre such as the [[Death toll of the Nanjing Massacre|death toll]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html|title=The Nanjing Incident: Recent Research and Trends|first=David Askew, Associate Professor, Ristumeikan Asia Pacific University,|last=Japan|website=www.japanesestudies.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Historical negationism|historical negationists]] and [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]] go as far as claiming the massacre was fabricated for [[propaganda]] purposes.&lt;ref name=tot /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, Joshua A. ''The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography''. 2000, pp 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, Dana R.

Research Committee on the Nanking Incident (Tokyo: Kashiwa Shobo, 1999), pp. 74–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy surrounding the massacre remains a central issue in Japanese relations with other [[Asia-Pacific]] nations as well, such as [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=gall&gt;Gallicchio, Marc S. ''The Unpredictability of the Past''. 2007, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] has admitted to the killing of a large number of non-combatants, looting, and other violence committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of Nanjing,&lt;ref name="mofa_jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/q_a/faq16.html#q8|title=Q8: What is the view of the Government of Japan on the incident known as the "Nanjing Massacre"?|work=Foreign Policy Q&amp;A (page content changed to "Under construction following the Statement by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on August 14, 2015"|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="I'm Sorry"&gt;{{cite episode|title=I'm Sorry?|series=[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]] |airdate=December 1, 1998|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222005155/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |archivedate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japanese veterans who served there have confirmed that a massacre took place,&lt;ref name=Kingston /&gt; a small but vocal minority within both the Japanese government and society have argued that the death toll was military in nature and that no such crimes ever occurred. Denial of the massacre and revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of [[Japanese nationalism]].&lt;ref name=yoshida&gt;Yoshida, Takashi. ''The Making of the "Rape of Nanking"'' (2006), pp. 157–58.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, public opinion of the massacre varies, but few deny outright that the event occurred.&lt;ref name=yoshida /&gt;

== Military situation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
In August 1937, the Japanese army [[Battle of Shanghai|invaded Shanghai]] where they met strong resistance and suffered heavy casualties. The battle was bloody as both sides faced attrition in urban hand-to-hand combat. By mid-November the Japanese had captured Shanghai with the help of naval bombardment. The General Staff Headquarters in Tokyo initially decided not to expand the war due to heavy casualties and low troop morale. Nevertheless, on December 1, headquarters ordered the Central China Area Army and the 10th Army to capture [[Nanjing]], then-capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].

== Relocation of the capital ==
After losing the Battle of Shanghai, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] knew that the fall of Nanjing was a matter of time. He and his staff realized that they could not risk the annihilation of their elite troops in a symbolic but hopeless defense of the capital. To preserve the army for future battles, most of it was withdrawn. Chiang's strategy was to follow the suggestion of his German advisers to draw the Japanese army deep into China and use China's vast territory as a defensive strength. Chiang planned to fight a protracted [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] to wear down the Japanese in the hinterland of China.&lt;ref name="Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdh-fact.com/CL02_1/26_S4.pdf|format=PDF|year=2005|author1=Higashinakano Shudo|author2=Kobayashi Susumu|author3=Fukunaga Shainjiro|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Analyzing the "Photographic Evidence" of the Nanking Massacre (originally published as Nankin Jiken: "Shokoshashin" wo Kenshosuru)|publisher=Soshisha|location=Tokyo, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategy for the defense of Nanjing ===
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
In a press release to foreign reporters, [[Tang Shengzhi]] announced the city would not surrender and would fight to the death. Tang gathered about 100,000 soldiers, largely untrained, including Chinese troops who had participated in the [[Battle of Shanghai]]. To prevent civilians from fleeing the city, he ordered troops to guard the port, as instructed by Chiang Kai-shek. The defense force blocked roads, destroyed boats, and burnt nearby villages, preventing widespread evacuation. The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the president left on December 7, leaving the fate of Nanjing to an International Committee led by [[John Rabe]].

In an attempt to secure permission for this cease-fire from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, a German national by the name of John Rabe who was living in Nanjing and had been acting as the Chairman of the Nanjing International Safety Zone Committee, boarded the USS Panay on December 9. From this gunboat, Rabe sent two telegrams. The first was through an American ambassador in Hankow to Chiang, asking that Chinese forces "undertake no military operations" within Nanjing.

The second telegram was sent through Shanghai to Japanese military leaders, advocating for a three-day cease-fire so the Chinese could withdraw from the city. The following day, on December 10, Rabe got his answer from the Generalissimo. The American ambassador in Hankow replied that although he supported Rabe's proposal for a cease-fire, Chiang did not. Rabe says that the ambassador also "sent us a separate confidential telegram telling us that he has been officially informed by the Foreign Ministry in Hankow that our understanding that General Tang agreed to a three-day armistice and the withdrawal of his troops from Nanjing is mistaken, and moreover that Chiang Kai-shek has announced that he is not in a position to accept such an offer."

This rejection of the Committee's cease-fire plan, in Rabe's mind, sealed the fate of the city. Nanjing had been constantly bombed for days and the Chinese troops that remained there were disheartened and had taken to drinking before the city's inevitable fall. On December 11, Rabe found that Chinese soldiers were still residing in areas of the Safety Zone, meaning that it became an intended target for Japanese attack despite the majority were innocent civilians. Rabe commented on how efforts to remove these Chinese troops failed and Japanese soldiers began to lob grenades into the refugee zone.&lt;ref&gt;Rabe, John &amp; Erwin Wickert, ''The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe'' (New York: A.A. Knopf, 1998), pp. 56, 59, 60&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach of the Imperial Japanese Army ==

=== Japanese war crimes on the march to Nanjing ===
[[File:Contest To Cut Down 100 People.jpg|thumb|An article on the "[[Contest to kill 100 people using a sword]]" published in the ''[[Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun]]''.

[[File:Republic of China Armed Forces Museum Nanking.jpg|thumb|upright|Sword used in the "contest" on display at the [[Republic of China Armed Forces Museum]] in Taipei, Taiwan]]

Although the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period. Many atrocities were reported to have been committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing.

According to one Japanese journalist embedded with Imperial forces at the time, "The reason that the [10th Army] is advancing to Nanjing quite rapidly is due to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and rape as they wish."&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, Joseph. ''The World's Bloodiest History''. 2009, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Tatsuzō Ishikawa]] vividly described how the 16th Division of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force committed atrocities on the march between Shanghai and Nanjing in his novel ''Ikiteiru Heitai'' (Living Soldiers), which was based on interviews that Ishikawa conducted with troops in Nanjing in January 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Katsuichi Honda, Frank Gibney, The Nanjing massacre: a Japanese journalist confronts Japan's national shame, pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notorious atrocity was a [[Contest to kill 100 people using a sword|killing contest between two Japanese officers]] as reported in the ''Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun'' and the English language ''Japan Advertiser''. The contest&amp;nbsp;– a race between the two officers to see which could kill 100 people first using only a sword&amp;nbsp;– was covered much like a sporting event with regular updates on the score over a series of days.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Nichi Nichi, 13 December 1937 article on the killing contest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japan Advertiser, 7 December 1937 (an American owned and edited English-language daily paper in Tokyo)&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the veracity of the newspaper article about the contest was the subject of ferocious debate for several decades starting in 1967.&lt;ref name="Kingston_2008_9"&gt;{{harvnb|Kingston|2008|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, historian Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi concurred with certain Japanese scholars who had argued that the contest was a concocted story, with the collusion of the soldiers themselves for the purpose of raising the [[Yamato-damashii|national fighting spirit]].&lt;ref name="Wakabayashi Summer 2000 307"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bob Tadashi|last=Wakabayashi|title=The Nanking 100-Man Killing Contest Debate: War Guilt Amid Fabricated Illusions, 1971–75|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=26|issue=2|date=Summer 2000|page=307|jstor=133271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a Tokyo district judge dismissed a suit by the families of the lieutenants, stating that "the lieutenants admitted the fact that they raced to kill 100 people" and that the story cannot be proven to be clearly false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/08/japanese-court-rules-newspaper-didnt.php|title=Jurist – Paper Chase: Japanese court rules newspaper didn't fabricate 1937 Chinese killing game|publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu|date=2005-08-23|accessdate=2011-03-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225011506/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/08/japanese-court-rules-newspaper-didnt.php |archivedate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also ruled against the civil claim of the plaintiffs because the original article was more than 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andesfolklore.hp.infoseek.co.jp/intisol/hyakunin/hanketu4.htm|title=楽天が運営するポータルサイト ： 【インフォシーク】Infoseek|work=infoseek.co.jp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512091852/http://andesfolklore.hp.infoseek.co.jp/intisol/hyakunin/hanketu4.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of the event remains disputed in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-scars-of-nanking-memories-of-a-japanese-outrage-764827.html|location=London, UK|work=The Independent|title=The scars of Nanking: Memories of a Japanese outrage|date=December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flight of Chinese civilians ===
The Nanjing garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to Xiakuan to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates. Targets within and outside of the city walls – such as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages – were completely burnt down, at an estimated value of 20 to 30 million (1937) US dollars.&lt;ref name="doomed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Fall/fall_01.htm|title=Five Western Journalists in the Doomed City|accessdate = 2006-04-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325115933/http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Fall/fall_01.htm|archivedate=2005-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/1937-12-08-NewYorkTimesTillmanDurdin.html|title=Chinese Fight Foe Outside Nanking; See Seeks's Stand|accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/1937-12-09-NewYorkTimesHallettAbend.html|title=Japan Lays Gain to Massing of Foe|accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the Nanjing Safety Zone ===
{{Main|Nanking Safety Zone}}
Many Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips. As the Japanese army approached Nanjing, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners. Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16. Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the [[International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone]] in the western quarter of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Askew|title=The International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone: An Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany|German]] businessman [[John Rabe]] was elected as its leader, in part because of his status as a member of the [[Nazi Party]] and the existence of the German-Japanese bilateral [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]. The Japanese government had previously agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces, and the members of the Committee managed to persuade the Chinese government to move their troops out of the area.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Nanking Safety Zone was demarcated through the use of Red Cross Flags&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/nanking.htm|title=Genocide in the 20th Century: The Rape of Nanking 1937–1938 (300,000 Deaths)|website=History Place|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 1937, Nanjing Mayor [[Ma Chao-chun]] ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanjing to move into the "Safety Zone". Many fled the city on December 7, and the International Committee took over as the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Nanjing.

=== Prince Asaka appointed as commander ===
[[File:Asakanomiya yasuhiko.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]] in 1940]]
In a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito singled [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]] out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was "not good". He assigned Asaka to Nanjing as an opportunity to make amends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Bergamini|title=Japan's Imperial Conspiracy|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that Hirohito had never learned about, or had refused to admit, Asaka's role in the ensuing massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakabayashi|first=Bob Tadashi|title=Emperor Hirohito on Localized Aggression in China|journal=Sino-Japanese Studies|date=1991|volume=4|issue=1|page=6|url=http://chinajapan.org/articles/04.1/04.1wakabayashi4-27.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, Asaka left Tokyo by plane and arrived at the front three days later. He met with division commanders, lieutenant-generals [[Kesago Nakajima]] and [[Heisuke Yanagawa]], who informed him that the Japanese troops had almost completely surrounded 300,000 Chinese troops in the vicinity of Nanjing and that preliminary negotiations suggested that the Chinese were ready to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Bergamini|title=Japan's Imperial Conspiracy|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Asaka is alleged to have issued an order to "kill all captives", thus providing official sanction for the crimes which took place during and after the battle.&lt;ref name="Chen, World War II Database"&gt;Chen, World War II Database&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors record that Prince Asaka signed the order for Japanese soldiers in Nanjing to "kill all captives".&lt;ref&gt;David Bergamini, ''Japan's imperial Conspiracy'', 1971, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that lieutenant colonel [[Isamu Chō]], Asaka's [[aide-de-camp]], sent this order under the Prince's [[Royal sign-manual|sign-manual]] without the Prince's knowledge or assent.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', 1997, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even if Chō took the initiative, Asaka was nominally the officer in charge and gave no orders to stop the carnage.
While the extent of Prince Asaka's responsibility for the massacre remains a matter of debate, the ultimate sanction for the massacre and the crimes committed during the invasion of China were issued in Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s ratification of the Japanese army's proposition to remove the constraints of [[international law]] on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Akira Fujiwara, "Nitchū Sensō ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu2, ''Kikan Sensō Sekinin Kenkyū'' 9, 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

At noon on December 9, the Japanese military dropped leaflets into the city, urging the city of Nanjing to surrender within 24 hours, promising "no mercy" if the offer is refused.&lt;ref name="shanghai"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kajimoto|first=Masato|url=http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Introduction/introduction.htm|title=Battle of Shanghai|accessdate=2006-04-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205002859/http://www.geocities.com/nankingatrocities/Introduction/introduction.htm|archivedate=2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|

Quote: "The Japanese Army, one million strong, has already conquered [[Changshu]]. We have surrounded the city of Nanking... The Japanese Army shall show no mercy toward those who offer resistance, treating them with extreme severity, but shall harm neither innocent civilians nor Chinese military [personnel] who manifest no hostility. It is our earnest desire to preserve the East Asian culture. If your troops continue to fight, war in Nanking is inevitable. The culture that has endured for a millennium will be reduced to ashes, and the government that has lasted for a decade will vanish into thin air. This commander-in-chief issues [b]ills to your troops on behalf of the Japanese Army. Open the gates to Nanking in a peaceful manner, and obey the [f]ollowing instructions."|group="N"}}

In the meanwhile, members of the Committee contacted Tang and proposed a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position.

John Rabe boarded the U.S. gunboat {{USS|Panay|PR-5|2}} on December 9 and sent two telegrams, one to Chiang Kai-shek by way of the American ambassador in Hankow, and one to the Japanese military authority in Shanghai.

=== Assault and capture of Nanjing ===
[[File:Iwane Matsui rides into Nanjing.jpg|thumb|[[Iwane Matsui]] enters Nanjing.]]

The Japanese awaited an answer to their demand for surrender but no response was received from the Chinese by the deadline on December 10. General [[Iwane Matsui]] waited another hour before issuing the command to take Nanjing by force. The Japanese army mounted its assault on the Nanjing walls from multiple directions; the SEF's 16th Division attacked three gates on the eastern side, the 6th Division of the 10A launched its offensive on the western walls, and the SEF's 9th Division advanced into the area in-between.&lt;ref name="Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro" /&gt;

On December 12, under heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment, General Tang Sheng-chi ordered his men to retreat. What followed was nothing short of chaos. Some Chinese soldiers stripped civilians of their clothing in a desperate attempt to blend in, and many others were shot by the Chinese supervisory unit as they tried to flee.&lt;ref name="doomed" /&gt;

On 13 December, the 6th and the 116th Divisions of the Japanese Army were the first to enter the city, facing little military resistance. Simultaneously, the 9th Division entered nearby Guanghua Gate, and the 16th Division entered the Zhongshan and Taiping gates. That same afternoon, two small [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] fleets arrived on both sides of the Yangtze River.

=== Pursuit and mopping-up operations ===
Japanese troops pursued the retreating Chinese army units, primarily in the Xiakuan area to the north of the city walls and around the [[Zijin Mountain]] in the east. Although most sources suggest that the final phase of the battle consisted of a one-sided slaughter of Chinese troops by the Japanese, some Japanese historians maintain that the remaining Chinese military still posed a serious threat to the Japanese. Prince Yasuhiko Asaka told a war correspondent later that he was in a very perilous position when his headquarters was ambushed by Chinese forces that were in the midst of fleeing from Nanjing east of the city. On the other side of the city, the 11th Company of the 45th Regiment encountered some 20,000 Chinese soldiers who were making their way from Xiakuan.&lt;ref name="Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro" /&gt;

The Japanese army conducted its mopping-up operation both inside and outside the [[Nanjing Safety Zone]]. Since the area outside the safety zone had been almost completely evacuated, the mopping-up effort was concentrated in the safety zone. The safety zone, an area of 3.85 square kilometres, was packed with the remaining population of Nanjing. The Japanese army leadership assigned sections of the safety zone to some units to separate alleged plain-clothed soldiers from the civilians.&lt;ref name="Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro 2005 author=Higashinakano Shudo, Kobayashi Susumu &amp; Fukunaga Shainjiro" /&gt; The number of Chinese soldiers in plain clothes that were executed are estimated to be around 4,000.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Yoshiaki Itakura, ''本当はこうだった南京事件'' (Tokyo: Nihon Tosho Kankokai, 1999), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Massacre ==
Eyewitness accounts of Westerners and Chinese present at Nanjing in the weeks after the fall of the city say that, over the course of six weeks following the fall of Nanjing, Japanese troops engaged in mass rape, murder, theft, arson, and other war crimes. Some of these primary accounts, including the diaries of John Rabe and American [[Minnie Vautrin]], came from foreigners who opted to stay behind to protect the Chinese civilians from harm. Other accounts include first-person testimonies of Nanjing Massacre survivors, eyewitness reports of journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel. American missionary [[John Magee (priest)|John Magee]] stayed behind to provide a 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[film]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] and first-hand photographs of the Nanjing Massacre.

A group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed a 15-man International Committee on November 22 and mapped out the [[Nanjing Safety Zone]] in order to safeguard civilians in the city. The city population of Nanjing inflated drastically during the mid-1930s, as many refugees fled from the Japanese aggression in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BASIC FACTS ON THE NANKING MASSACRE and THE TOKYO WAR CRIMES TRIAL|url=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/NanjingMassacre/NMNJ.html#nm|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabe and American missionary [[Lewis S. C. Smythe]], secretary of the International Committee and a professor of sociology at the [[University of Nanking]], recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints with the Japanese embassy.

=== Massacre contest ===
{{Main|Contest to kill 100 people using a sword}}
In 1937, the ''[[Osaka Mainichi Shimbun]]'' and its sister newspaper, the ''[[Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun]]'', covered a contest between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division. The two men were described as vying to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanjing. From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangshu Province, China), Mukai had killed 89 people while Noda had killed 78 people. The contest continued because neither had killed 100 people. By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda had killed 105 people while Mukai had killed 106 people. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest. Therefore, according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the ''Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun'' of December 13, they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people.&lt;ref name="Wakabayashi_2000_319"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakabayashi|2000|p=319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Mukai and Noda were both arrested and tried as war criminals, and both of them were found guilty and executed by shooting.&lt;ref&gt;国防部审判战犯军事法庭对战犯向井敏明等人的判决书. 民国史档案资料丛书——侵华日军南京大屠杀档案. 1947年12月18日: pp. 616–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rape ===
[[File:Killednanjing.jpg|thumb|Photo taken in [[Xuzhou]], showing the body of a woman who was profaned in a way similar to the teenager described in case 5 of [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]]'s film]]
[[File:Horrible death, Nanking Massacre.jpg|thumb|Case 5 of [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]]'s film: on December 13, 1937, about 30 Japanese soldiers murdered all but two of 11 Chinese in the house at No. 5 Xinlukou. A woman and her two teenaged daughters were raped, and Japanese soldiers rammed a bottle and a cane into her vagina. An eight-year-old girl was stabbed, but she and her younger sister survived. They were found alive two weeks after the killings by the elderly woman shown in the photo. Bodies of the victims can also be seen in the photo.&lt;ref&gt;John G.

The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] estimated that, 20,000 women, including some children and the elderly, were raped during the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/IMTFE/IMTFE-8.html Paragraph 2, p. 1012, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East].&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://museums.cnd.org/njmassacre/njm-tran/ | title = Japanese Imperialism and the Massacre in Nanjing: Chapter X: Widespread Incidents of Rape | publisher = Museums.cnd.org | date = | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit [[mutilation]]&lt;ref&gt;"A Debt of Blood: An Eyewitness Account of the Barbarous Acts of the Japanese Invaders in Nanjing," 7 February 1938, Dagong Daily, Wuhan edition [http://museums.cnd.org/njmassacre/njm-tran/njm-ch10.htm Museums.cnd.org]&lt;/ref&gt; or by penetrating vaginas with bayonets, long sticks of bamboo, or other objects.

On 19 December 1937, the Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know not where to end. Never I have heard or read such brutality. Rape! Rape! Rape! We estimate at least 1,000 cases a night and many by day. In case of resistance or anything that seems like disapproval, there is a bayonet stab or a bullet&amp;nbsp;... People are hysterical&amp;nbsp;... Women are being carried off every morning, afternoon and evening. The whole Japanese army seems to be free to go and come as it pleases, and to do whatever it pleases.&lt;ref&gt;Hua-ling Hu, ''[[American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin]]'', 2000, p. 97&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 7, 1938, [[Robert O. Wilson]], a surgeon at the university hospital in the Safety Zone administrated by the United States, wrote in a letter to his family, "a conservative estimate of people slaughtered in cold blood is somewhere about 100,000, including of course thousands of soldiers that had thrown down their arms".&lt;ref&gt;Documents on the Rape of Nanking, pg. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are two excerpts from his letters of 15 and 18 December 1937 to his family:&lt;blockquote&gt;The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief. Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning or reason and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me recount some instances occurring in the last two days. Last night the house of one of the Chinese staff members of the university was broken into and two of the women, his relatives, were raped. Two girls, about 16, were raped to death in one of the refugee camps. In the University Middle School where there are 8,000 people the Japs came in ten times last night, over the wall, stole food, clothing, and raped until they were satisfied. They bayoneted one little boy of eight who [had] five bayonet wounds including one that penetrated his stomach, a portion of [[Greater omentum|omentum]] was outside the abdomen. I think he will live.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Kaiyuan. ''Eyewitness to Massacre: American Missionaries Bear Witness to Japanese Atrocities in Nanjing''. M. E. Sharpe, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his diary kept during the aggression against the city and its occupation by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], the leader of the Safety Zone, [[John Rabe]], wrote many comments about Japanese atrocities. For 17 December:&lt;blockquote&gt;Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital ... Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College ... alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E.|last=Woods|title=The Good Man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe|year=1998|page=77}}&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Massacre of civilians ===
[[File:Boy killed in Nanking massacre.jpg|thumb|upright|A boy killed by a Japanese soldier with the butt of a rifle because he did not take off his hat]]
Following the capture of Nanjing, a massacre, which was perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), led to the deaths of up to 60,000 residents in the city, a figure difficult to precisely calculate due to the many bodies deliberately burnt, buried in mass graves, or deposited in the Yangtze River by the IJA.&lt;ref name="ChristianScienceMonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMTftFE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hata" /&gt; Japanese ultra-nationalists have strongly disputed such death tolls, with some claiming that no more than several hundred civilians were killed during the massacre.&lt;ref name="Tanaka" /&gt; B. Campbell, in an article published in the journal ''[[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]]'', has described the Nanjing Massacre as a [[genocide]], given the fact that residents were still slaughtered ''en masse'' during the aftermath, despite the successful and certain outcome in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Bradley|title=Genocide as social control|journal=Sociological Theory|date=June 2009|volume=27|issue=2|page=154|jstor=40376129|quote=Also, genocide may occur in the aftermath of warfare when mass killings continue after the outcome of a battle or a war has been decided. For instance, after the Japanese occupied Nanjing in December 1937, Japanese soldiers massacred over 250,000 residents of the city.|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01341.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 1937, John Rabe wrote in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not until we tour the city that we learn the extent of destruction. We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind. The Japanese march through the city in groups of ten to twenty soldiers and loot the shops&amp;nbsp;... I watched with my own eyes as they looted the café of our German baker Herr Kiessling. Hempel's hotel was broken into as well, as [was] almost every shop on Chung Shang and Taiping Road.&lt;ref name="woods"&gt;{{cite book|first=John E.|last=Woods|title=The Good Man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe|year=1998|pages=67, 187, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 10 February 1938, Legation Secretary of the German Embassy, Rosen, wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]] to recommend its purchase.

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking – which, by the way, continues to this day to a considerable degree&amp;nbsp;– the Reverend John Magee, a member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost a quarter of a century, took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to the atrocities committed by the Japanese&amp;nbsp;... One will have to wait and see whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed, as they have indicated, in stopping the activities of their troops, which continue even today.&lt;ref name="woods" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On December 13, about 30 soldiers came to a Chinese house at No. 5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking, and demanded entrance. The door was open by the landlord, a [[Islam in China|Mohammedan]] named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha's death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14 [were]. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2–3 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7–8, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively. The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword.&lt;ref name="woods" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Shyudo Higashinakano and the publisher ''Tendensha'' to pay four million yen in damages to Mrs. Shuqin Xia, who claims to be the 7- or 8-year-old girl who appears in Magee's film. Higashinakano had claimed in his book, ''Thorough Review of Nanjing Massacre'', that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanjing massacre, but he was unable to prove this at trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6587967.html english.peopledaily.com.cn], ''Author on Nanjing loses libel appeal'', [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090207b2.html search.japantimes.co.jp]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodies of Chinese massacred by Japanese troops along a river in Nanjing (Murase Moriyasa's photo) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodies of Chinese massacred by Japanese troops along a river in Nanjing]]
Pregnant women were targeted for murder, as their stomachs were often bayoneted, sometimes after rape. Tang Junshan, survivor and witness to one of the Japanese army's systematic mass killings, testified:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The seventh and last person in the first row was a pregnant woman. The soldier thought he might as well rape her before killing her, so he pulled her out of the group to a spot about ten meters away. As he was trying to rape her, the woman resisted fiercely&amp;nbsp;... The soldier abruptly stabbed her in the belly with a bayonet. She gave a final scream as her intestines spilled out. Then the soldier stabbed the fetus, with its umbilical cord clearly visible, and tossed it aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0506/PWR-Yang.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Memorial Hall for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre: Rhetoric in the Face of Tragedy|page=310|first=Celia|last=Yang|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612003745/http://bootheprize.stanford.edu/0506/PWR-Yang.pdf|archivedate=2007-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Extrajudicial killing and cannibalism of Chinese prisoners of war ===
On 5 August 1937, the Deputy Minister of Military of Japan notified Japanese Troops in Shanghai that the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners ("Riku Shi Mitsu No.198"). The directive also advised staff officers to no longer to use the term [[Prisoner of War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ikuhiko Hata]] 2007 ''Nanking Jiken Gyakusatsu no Kozo'' {{ISBN|9784121907950}}  p. 197 Chuko-Shinsho Pub.,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese to be beheaded in Nanking Massacre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Chinese POW about to be beheaded by a Japanese officer using a [[shin-guntō]]]]

Soon after the fall of the city, Japanese troops made a thorough search for Chinese soldiers and summarily arrested thousands of young Chinese men. Many were taken to the [[Yangtze River]], where they were machine-gunned to death. What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops, the Straw String Gorge Massacre, occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18. For most of the morning, Japanese soldiers tied the POWs' hands together. At dusk, the soldiers divided POWs into four columns and opened fire. Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash desperately. It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual. The majority of the bodies were dumped directly into the Yangtze River.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at [[Taiping Gate]] and murdered them. The victims were blown up with [[landmine]]s, then doused with petrol and set on fire. The survivors were killed with bayonets.&lt;ref name="Taiping"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7140357.stm|title= Nanjing remembers massacre victims|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2007-12-13|first=Michael|last=Bristow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American news correspondents [[F. Tillman Durdin]] and [[Archibald Steele]] reported seeing corpses of massacred Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanjing Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who worked for ''[[The New York Times]]'', toured Nanjing before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. He would later state that he had seen tank guns used on bound soldiers.

Two days later, in his report to ''The New York Times'', Durdin stated that the alleys and street were filled with the dead, amongst them women and children. Durdin stated "[i]t should be said that certain Japanese units exercised restraint and that certain Japanese officers tempered power with generosity and commission," but continued "the conduct of the Japanese army as a whole in Nanjing was a blot on the reputation of their country"."&lt;ref&gt;Durdin, F.

=== Theft and arson ===
One-third of the city was destroyed as a result of arson. According to reports, Japanese troops torched newly built government buildings as well as the homes of many civilians. There was considerable destruction to areas outside the city walls. Soldiers pillaged from the poor and the wealthy alike. The lack of resistance from Chinese troops and civilians in Nanjing meant that the Japanese soldiers were free to divide up the city's valuables as they saw fit. This resulted in the widespread looting and burglary.&lt;ref name=RapeOfNankingP162&gt;Chang, Iris. ''The Rape of Nanking'', Penguin Books, 1997, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December, chairman John Rabe wrote a complaint to Kiyoshi Fukui, second secretary of the Japanese Embassy. The following is an excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, on the 13th when your troops entered the city, we had nearly all the civilian population gathered in a Zone in which there had been very little destruction by stray shells and no looting by Chinese soldiers even in full retreat&amp;nbsp;... All 27 Occidentals in the city at that time and our Chinese population were totally surprised by the reign of robbery, raping and killing initiated by your soldiers on the 14th. All we are asking in our protest is that you restore order among your troops and get the normal city life going as soon as possible. In the latter process we are glad to cooperate in any way we can. But even last night between 8 and 9 p.m. when five Occidental members of our staff and Committee toured the Zone to observe conditions, we did not find any single Japanese patrol either in the Zone or at the entrances!&lt;ref name=GoodMan(271-274)&gt;{{cite book|first=John E.|last=Woods|title=The Good Man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe|year=1998|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Nanjing Safety Zone and the role of foreigners ===
The Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; until the Japanese occupation, no shells entered that part of the city except a few stray shots. During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that occurred in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Iris, The Rape of Nanking: The forgotten holocaust of World War ll, Basic Books, A Subsidiary of Perseus Books, L.L.C., 1997 pp. 105-139, the chapter on the Safety Zone&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese soldiers committed actions in the Safety Zone that were part of the larger Nanjing Massacre. The International Committee appealed a number of times to the Japanese army, with Rabe using his credentials as a [[Nazi Party]] member, but to no avail. Rabe wrote that, from time to time, the Japanese would enter the Safety Zone at will, carry off a few hundred men and women, and either summarily execute them or rape and then kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John E.|last=Woods|title=The Good Man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe|year=1998|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 5, 1938, the [[International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone|International Committee]] had forwarded to the Japanese embassy a total of 450 cases of murder, rape, and general disorder by Japanese soldiers that had been reported after the American, British and German diplomats had returned to their embassies.&lt;ref name=Woods275-278&gt;{{cite book|first=John E.|last=Woods|title=The Good Man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe|year=1998|pages=275–78}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes ===
[[Jonathan Spence]] writes "there is no obvious explanation for this grim event, nor can one be found. The Japanese soldiers, who had expected easy victory, instead had been fighting hard for months and had taken infinitely higher casualties than anticipated. They were bored, angry, frustrated, tired. The Chinese women were undefended, their menfolk powerless or absent. The war, still undeclared, had no clear-cut goal or purpose. Perhaps all Chinese, regardless of sex or age, seemed marked out as victims."&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. (1999) ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. p. 424; {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matsui's reaction to the massacre ==
On December 18, 1937, as General [[Iwane Matsui]] began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed. He reportedly told one of his civilian aides: "I now realize that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed. I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory ... I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents. Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people."

On New Year's Day, over a toast he confided to a Japanese diplomat: "My men have done something very wrong and extremely regrettable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Iris|last=Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of the massacre ==
In late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have "restored order". After the establishment of the ''weixin zhengfu'' (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanjing and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably.

On 18 February 1938, the Nanjing Safety Zone International Committee was forcibly renamed &lt;!--not sure by whom, probably IJA--&gt;"''Nanking International Rescue Committee''", and the Safety Zone effectively ceased to function. The last refugee camps were closed in May 1938.

== Recall of Matsui and Asaka ==
In February 1938 both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan. Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945. He was promoted to the rank of [[general]] in August 1939, though he held no further military commands.&lt;ref name="Chen, World War II Database" /&gt;

== Death toll estimates ==
{{Main|Death toll of the Nanjing Massacre}}
Estimates of the number of victims vary based on the definitions of the geographical range and the duration of the event.

The extent of the atrocities is debated,&lt;ref name="Hata "&gt;A more complete account of what numbers are claimed by who, can be found in self-described "moderate" article by historian Ikuhiko Hata [http://www.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/China/Nanjing/nanjing2.html  ''The Nanking Atrocities: Fact and Fable''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228031202/http://www.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/China/Nanjing/nanjing2.html |date=February 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with numbers ranging from some Japanese claims of several hundred,&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;Masaaki Tanaka claims that very few citizens were killed, and that the massacre is in fact a fabrication in his book ''[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/whatreally/ "Nankin gyakusatsu" no kyokÙ] (The "Nanking Massacre" as Fabrication)''.&lt;/ref&gt; to the Chinese claim of a non-combatant death toll of 300,000.&lt;ref name="ChristianScienceMonitor"&gt;Marquand, Robert (August 20, 2001) [http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0820/p1s3-woap.html "Why the Past Still Separates China and Japan"], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' states an estimate of 300,000 dead.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Tokushi Kasahara states "more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more", referring to his own book.&lt;ref&gt;Iwanami Shinsho, Fujiwara Akira (editor). ''Nankin jiken O Dou Miruka'', 1998, Aoki shoten, {{ISBN|4-250-98016-2}}, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanjing, which is objected to by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p.&amp;nbsp;146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes "more than 200,000" in his book.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Hiroshi. ''Nankin jiken o dou miruka'' pg. 123, ''Tennou no guntai to Nankin jiken'' 1998, Aoki shoten, pg. 160; {{ISBN|4-250-98019-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomio Hora writes of 50,000–100,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka Masaaki [http://www.sdh-fact.com/ ''What Really Happened in Nanking''], Sekai Shuppan, Inc., 2000; {{ISBN|4-916079-07-8}}, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholars consider figures from 40,000 to over 300,000 to be an accurate estimate. According to the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], estimates made at a later date indicate that the total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanjing and its vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was up to 200,000. These estimates are borne out by the figures of burial societies and other organizations, which testify to over 155,000 buried bodies. These figures also do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning, drowning or other means, or whose bodies were interred in mass graves.&lt;ref name="IMTftFE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/PTO/IMTFE/IMTFE-8.html | title = HyperWar: International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Chapter 8) (Paragraph 2, p. 1015, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the verdict of the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]] on 10 March 1947, there are "more than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof. Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organizations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims."&lt;ref name="Kasahara"&gt;[[Tokushi Kasahara]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf_interventionsnankin-francais.pdf|title=Le massacre de Nankin et les mécanismes de sa négation par la classe politique dirigeante|last=|first=|date=|website=ihtp.cnrs.fr|publisher=|language=French|trans-title=The Nanjing Massacre and the mechanisms of its negation by the political ruling class|format=PDF|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this estimate includes an accusation that the Japanese Army murdered 57,418 Chinese POWs at Mufushan, though the latest research indicates that between 4,000 and 20,000 were massacred,&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ono Kenji, "Massacre Near Mufushan," in The Nanking Atrocity, 1937–38: Complicating the Picture, ed. Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and it also includes the 112,266 corpses allegedly buried by the Chongshantang, a charitable association, though today mainstream historians agree that the Chongshantang's records were at least greatly exaggerated if not entirely fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="consensus1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Askew, "The Scale of Japanese Atrocities in Nanjing: An Examination of the Burial Records," Ritsumeikan Journal of Asia Pacific Studies, June 2004, 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Wakabayashi concludes from this that estimates of over 200,000 are not credible.&lt;ref name="consensus1"&gt;Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, "Leftover Problems," in The Nanking Atrocity, 1937–38: Complicating the Picture, ed. Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008), 382–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Ikuhiko Hata considers the number 300,000 to be a "symbolic figure" representative of China's wartime suffering and not a figure to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Yamamoto, Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people were killed, which corresponds to the figures from three sources; one is the Red Army's official journal of the time, Hangdibao and another is that of Miner Searle Bates of the International Safety Zone Committee, and the third is the aforementioned figure written by John Rabe in a letter.&lt;ref name="Wellesley.edu" /&gt; [[John Rabe]], Chairman of the [[The International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone|International Committee]] and [[Nanjing Safety Zone]], estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 (civilians) were killed.&lt;ref name="nankingatrocities.net" /&gt; However, Erwin Wickert, the editor of ''The diaries of John Rabe'', points out that "It is likely that Rabe's estimate is too low, since he could not have had an overview of the entire municipal area during the period of the worst atrocities. Moreover, many troops of captured Chinese soldiers were led out of the city and down to the Yangtze, where they were summarily executed. But, as noted, no one actually counted the dead."

The casualty count of 300,000 was first promulgated in January 1938 by [[Harold Timperley]], a journalist in China during the Japanese invasion, based on reports from contemporary eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name="nankingatrocities.net" /&gt; Other sources, including [[Iris Chang]]'s ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', also conclude that the death toll reached 300,000. In December 2007, newly declassified [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] archive documents revealed that a telegraph by the U.S. ambassador to Germany in Berlin sent one day after the Japanese army occupied Nanjing, stated that he heard the Japanese Ambassador in Germany boasting that Japanese army killed 500,000 Chinese people as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing. According to the archives research "The telegrams sent by the U.S. diplomats [in Berlin] pointed to the massacre of an estimated half a million people in Shanghai, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Wuxi and Changzhou".&lt;ref name="December 2007"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/12/content_7236237.htm U.S. Archives Reveal War Massacre of 500,000 Chinese by Japanese Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213073944/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/12/content_7236237.htm |date=2007-12-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRUS1937v03_p806"&gt;{{cite book|editor=United States Department of State|title=Foreign relations of the United States diplomatic papers, 1937.

In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed.&lt;ref name="mainichi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese statement protesting UNESCO registration of Nanjing Massacre docs backfires|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20151106p2a00m0na006000c.html|accessdate=25 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126035804/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20151106p2a00m0na006000c.html|archivedate=26 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Range and duration ===
The most conservative viewpoint is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the city known as the Safety Zone, where the civilians gathered after the invasion. Many Japanese historians have insisted that during the Japanese invasion there were only 200,000–250,000 citizens in Nanjing as reported by John Rabe, to argue that the PRC's estimate of 300,000 deaths is an exaggeration.

Many historians include a much larger area around the city. Including the Xiaguan district (the [[suburb]]s north of Nanjing, about 31&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city, the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just before the Japanese occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Data Challenges Japanese Theory on Nanjing Population Size | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Dec/83437.htm | accessdate = 2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality.

The duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The [[Battle of Nanjing|Battle of Nanking]] ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanjing. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks. Historians who define the Nanjing Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered [[Jiangsu]] province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and stretch the end of the massacre to late March 1938.

To many Japanese scholars, [[post-war]] estimations were distorted by "[[victor's justice]]", when Japan was condemned as the sole aggressor. They believed the 300,000 toll typified a "Chinese-style exaggeration" with disregard for evidence. Yet, in China, this figure has come to symbolize the justice, legality, and authority of the post-war trials condemning Japan as the aggressor.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Daqing, "Convergence or Divergence? Recent Historical Writings on the Rape of Nanjing", ''The American Historical Review'' 104 (1999), p. 852.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Various estimates ===
Japanese historians, depending on their definition of the geographical and time duration of the killings, give wide-ranging estimates for the number of massacred civilians, from several thousand to upwards of 200,000.&lt;ref name=japanesestudies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html|title=Electronic journal of contemporary japanese studies (ejcjs): The Nanjing Incident: Recent Research and Trends|publisher=japanesestudies.org.uk|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest estimate by a Japanese historian is 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|year=2012|page=377|isbn=978-0-393-08192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese language sources tend to place the figure of massacred civilians upwards of 200,000.&lt;ref name=japanesestudies /&gt;

=== 200,000 Nanjing population debate ===
Japanese sources assert that there was a population of only 200,000 in Nanjing, thus making the 300,000 death toll impossible. In 2003, Zhang Lianhong, professor of Nanjing Massacre Research Center in Nanjing Normal University, published an article in the ''Beijing Daily'' in which he used historical facts to show that the population of Nanjing urban area was between 367,000 and 467,000, and the overall Nanjing population was between 535,000 and 635,000, to refute the assertion of a population of 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Data Challenges Japanese Theory on Nanjing Population Size | url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Dec/83437.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War crimes tribunals ==
Shortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanjing were put on trial. General Matsui was indicted before the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] for "deliberately and recklessly" ignoring his legal duty "to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches" of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]. [[Hisao Tani]], the lieutenant general of the 6th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army in Nanjing, was tried by the [[Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal]].

Other Japanese military leaders in charge at the time of the Nanjing Massacre were not tried. [[Prince Kan'in]], chief of staff of the Imperial Japanese Army during the massacre, had died before the end of the war in May 1945. Prince Asaka was granted immunity because of his status as a member of the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2000, p. 583&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, publisher needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John W.

=== Grant of immunity to Prince Asaka ===
On May 1, 1946, [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]] officials interrogated [[Prince Asaka]], who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal. Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops.&lt;ref&gt;Awaya Kentarô, Yoshida Yutaka, ''Kokusai kensatsukyoku jinmonchôsho'', dai 8 kan, Nihon Tosho Centâ, 1993., Case 44, pp. 358–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence and testimony ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Nanking telegram Harold John Timperley.gif|thumb|[[Harold John Timperley]]'s telegram of 17 January 1938 describing the atrocities]]
The prosecution began the Nanjing phase of its case in July 1946. Dr. [[Robert O. Wilson]], a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone, took the witness stand first. Other members of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone who took the witness stand included [[Miner Searle Bates]] and [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]]. [[George A. Fitch]], [[Lewis S. C. Smythe]], and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters.

Another piece of evidence that was submitted to the tribunal was Harold Timperley's telegram regarding the Nanjing Massacre which had been intercepted and decoded by the Americans on January 17, 1938. One of the books by Hsü, Documents of the Nanjing Safety Zone, was also adduced in court. According to Matsui's own diary, one day after he made the ceremonial triumphal entry into the city on December 17, 1937, he instructed the chiefs of staff from each division to tighten military discipline and try to eradicate the sense of disdain for Chinese people among their soldiers.

On February 7, 1938, Matsui delivered a speech at a memorial service for the Japanese officers and men of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force who were killed in action. In front of the high-ranking officers, Domei News Agency reported, he emphasized the necessity to "put an end to various reports affecting the prestige of the Japanese troops".

The entry for the same day in Matsui's diary read, "I could only feel sadness and responsibility today, which has been overwhelmingly piercing my heart. This is caused by the Army's misbehaviors after the fall of Nanjing and failure to proceed with the autonomous government and other political plans."

=== Matsui's defense ===
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
Matsui's defence varied between denying the mass-scale atrocities and evading his responsibility for what had happened. Eventually he ended up making numerous conflicting statements. In the interrogation in Sugamo prison preceding the trial Matsui admitted that he heard about the many outrages committed by his troops from Japanese diplomats when he entered Nanjing on December 17, 1937.

In court, he contradicted the earlier testimony and told the judges that he was not "officially" briefed at the consulate about the evildoings, presumably to avoid admitting any contact with the consulate officials such as Second Secretary (later Acting Consul-General) Fukui Kiyoshi and Attaché Fukuda Tokuyasu who received and dealt with the protests filed by the International Committee.

In the same interrogation session before the trial Matsui said one officer and three low-ranking soldiers were court-martialled because of their misbehavior in Nanjing and the officer was sentenced to death. In his affidavit Matsui said he ordered his officers to investigate the massacre and to take necessary action. In court, however, Matsui said that he did not have jurisdiction over the soldiers' misconduct since he was not in the position of supervising military discipline and morals.

Matsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]. He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives. At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect [[Prince Asaka]] by shifting blame to lower ranking division commanders.&lt;ref name=Bix&gt;{{cite journal|first=Herbert|last=Bix|title=Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan|journal=Perennial|year=2001|page=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verdict ===
[[Kōki Hirota]], who had been the Foreign Minister when Japan conquered Nanjing, was convicted of participating in "the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy" (count 1), waging "a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China" (count 27) and count 55. Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the "orgy of crime" at Nanjing because, "He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors."
&lt;blockquote&gt;Organized and wholesale murder of male civilians was conducted with the apparent sanction of the commanders on the pretext that Chinese soldiers had removed their uniforms and were mingling with the population. Groups of Chinese civilians were formed, bound with their hands behind their backs, and marched outside the walls of the city where they were killed in groups by machine gun fire and with bayonets. --- From Judgment of the International Military Tribunal&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sentence ===
On November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging. Eighteen others received lesser sentences. The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dower|first=John|authorlink=John W.

== Controversy ==
{{Further|Historiography of the Nanjing Massacre}}
China and Japan have both acknowledged the occurrence of wartime atrocities.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Disputes over the [[Historiography of the Nanjing Massacre|historical portrayal]] of these events continue to cause tensions between Japan on one side and China and other East Asian countries on the other side.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Cold War ===
Before [[reform and opening|the 1970s]], China did relatively little to draw attention to the Nanjing massacre. In her book ''Rape of Nanking,'' [[Iris Chang]] asserted that the politics of the [[Cold War]] encouraged [[Chairman Mao]] to stay relatively silent about Nanjing in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan.

=== Debate in Japan ===
The major waves of Japanese treatment of these events have ranged from total cover-up during the war, confessions and documentation by the Japanese soldiers during the 1950s and 1960s, minimization of the extent of the Nanjing Massacre during the 1970s and 1980s, official Japanese government distortion and rewriting of history during the 1980s, and total denial of the occurrence of the Nanjing Massacre by some government officials in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnd.org/mirror/nanjing/NMNJ.html|title=Basic facts on the Nanking Massacre and the Tokyo War Crimes Trial|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate concerning the massacre took place mainly in the 1970s. During this time, the Chinese government's statements about the event were attacked by the Japanese because they were said to rely too heavily on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence. Aspersions were cast regarding the authenticity and accuracy of burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court, which the Japanese government claimed were fabrications by the Chinese government, artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanjing Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/fiction/index.html|title=The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction|accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, [[Katsuichi Honda]] wrote a series of articles for the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' on war crimes committed by Japanese soldiers during [[World War II]] (such as the Nanjing Massacre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Katsuich|last=Honda|title=Chūgoku no Tabi" (中国の旅), "Travels in China"|journal=[[Asahi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from Japanese right-wingers regarding the Japanese treatment of the war crimes. In response, Shichihei Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reply to Katsuichi Honda|first=Shichihei|last=Yamamoto|journal=Every Gentlemen|date=March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Akira Suzuki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Phantom of The Nanjing Massacre|first=Akira|last=Suzuki|journal=Every Gentlemen|date=April 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote two controversial yet influential articles {{clarify|date=June 2016}} which sparked the negationist movement.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}

In 1984, in an attempt to refute the allegations of war crimes in Nanjing, the Japanese Army Veterans Association (Kaikosha) interviewed former Japanese soldiers who had served in the Nanjing area from 1937 to 1938. Instead of refuting the allegations, the interviewed veterans confirmed that a massacre had taken place and openly described and admitted to taking part in the atrocities. The results of the survey were published in the association's magazine, ''Kaiko'', in 1985 along with an admission and apology that read, "Whatever the severity of war or special circumstances of war psychology, we just lose words faced with this mass illegal killing. As those who are related to the prewar military, we simply apologize deeply to the people of China. It was truly a regrettable act of barbarity."&lt;ref name=Kingston&gt;Kingston, Jeff, [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/03/01/commentary/japans-reactionaries-waging-culture-war/#.UxMH8o1WF9A "Japan's reactionaries waging culture war"], ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apology and condolences by the Prime Minister and Emperor of Japan ===
{{See also|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}
On August 15, 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Surrender of Japan]], the Japanese prime minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] gave the first clear and formal apology for Japanese actions during the war. He apologized for Japan's aggression and the great suffering that it inflicted in Asia.

He offered his apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims. That day, the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor [[Akihito]] pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan]]. The emperor offered his condolences and expressed the hope that such atrocities would never be repeated. [[Iris Chang]], author of ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', criticized Murayama for not providing the written apology that had been expected. She said that the people of China "don't believe that an... unequivocal and sincere apology has ever been made by Japan to China" and that a written apology from Japan would send a better message to the international community.&lt;ref name="I'm Sorry" /&gt;

=== Denials of the massacre by public officials in Japan ===
{{Main|Nanjing Massacre denial}}
In May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanjing Massacre a "fabrication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120223a5.html| author= Jun Hongo| title=Nagoya mayor won't budge on Nanjing remark| publisher=Japan Times| date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers. They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a "political advertisement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T214128.htm |title=Japan ruling MPs call Nanjing massacre fabrication |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522051839/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T214128.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2012, [[Takashi Kawamura (politician)|Takashi Kawamura]], mayor of [[Nagoya]], told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre "probably never happened". Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, "Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577238802680649914|author1=Josh Chin  |author2=Yoree Koh |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Japanese Official Denies Nanjing Massacre| publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120223a5.html Nagoya mayor won't budge on Nanjing remark]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 February 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2013, Kawamura said his position remained unchanged when the issue came up during an election debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2013-04/01/content_16366753.htm| title=Nagoya mayor not to withdraw denial on Nanjing Massacre| publisher=China Daily| date=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2012, [[Tokyo]] governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] said that he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened.

== Legacy ==

=== Effect on international relations ===
The memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a stumbling block in [[Sino-Japanese relations]] since the early 1970s. Bilateral exchanges on trade, culture and education have increased greatly since the two countries normalized their bilateral relations and Japan became China's most important trading partner.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Trade between the two nations is worth over $200&amp;nbsp;billion annually. Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust and animosity toward Japan that originates from the memory of [[Japanese war crimes]] such as the Nanjing Massacre. This sense of mistrust is strengthened by the belief that Japan is unwilling to admit to and apologize for the atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|date=2005-09-30|last=Pu|first=Xiaoyu|title=The Nanking Massacre, Justice and Reconciliation: A Chinese Perspective|url=http://www.oycf.org/oycfold/httpdocs/Perspectives2/30_09302005/2c_Pu_NankingMassacre.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pxfMlhJa?url=http://www.oycf.org/oycfold/httpdocs/Perspectives2/30_09302005/2c_Pu_NankingMassacre.pdf|archivedate=2010-05-24|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takashi Yoshida described how changing political concerns and perceptions of the "national interest" in Japan, China, and the U.S. have shaped collective memory of the Nanjing massacre. Yoshida contended that over time the event has acquired different meanings to different people. People from mainland China saw themselves as the victims. For Japan, it was a question they needed to answer, but were reluctant to do so because they too identified themselves as victims after the A-bombs. The U.S., which served as the melting pot of cultures and is home to descendants of members of both of Chinese and Japanese cultures, took up the mantle of investigator for the victimized Chinese. Yoshida has argued that the Nanjing Massacre has figured in the attempts of all three nations as they work to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Takashi. The Making of the ''Rape of Nanking'': History and Memory in Japan, China, and the United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Japanese prime ministers have visited the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], a shrine for Japanese war deaths up until the end of the Second World War, which includes war criminals that were involved in the Nanjing Massacre. In the museum adjacent to the shrine, a panel informs visitors that there was no massacre in Nanjing, but that Chinese soldiers in plain clothes were "dealt with severely". In 2006 former Japanese prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made a pilgrimage to the shrine despite warnings from China and South Korea. His decision to visit the shrine regardless sparked international outrage. Although Koizumi denied that he was trying to glorify war or historical [[Japanese militarism]], the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Koizumi of "wrecking the political foundations of China-Japan relations". An official from South Korea said they would summon the Tokyo ambassador to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/fury-as-koizumi-honours-war-dead/2006/08/15/1155407790276.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Fury as Koizumi honours war dead|date=August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english1.people.com.cn/english/200106/01/eng20010601_71508.html |title=Japanese Leader's Decision to Visit Yasukuni Shrine Puzzling: FM Spokesman |publisher=English1.people.com.cn|date=2001-06-01|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1214/p04s01-woap.html|title=In Japan, denial over Nanjing still holds sway after 70 years|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/135371.htm|title=The 14 Class-A War Criminals Enshrined at Yasukuni|publisher=China.org.cn|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a component of national identity ===
Yoshida asserts that "Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies."&lt;ref name=Yoshida&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoshida|first=Takashi|title=The Making of the "Rape of Nanking"|year=2006|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Japanese history textbook controversies}}
In Japan, the Nanjing Massacre touches upon national identity and notions of "pride, honor and shame". Yoshida argues that "Nanking crystallizes a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or&amp;nbsp;... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoshida|first=Takashi|title=The Making of the 'Rape of Nanking'|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the Nanjing Massacre as such can be viewed in some circles in Japan as "Japan bashing" (in the case of foreigners) or "self-flagellation" (in the case of Japanese).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The government of Japan believe it can not be denied that the killing of a large number of noncombatants, looting and other acts by Japanese army occurred. However, the actual number of victims is hard to be determined according to government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF JAPAN|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/q_a/faq16.html#q8|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed.&lt;ref name="mainichi1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Japanese statement protesting UNESCO registration of Nanjing Massacre docs backfires|url= http://www.alpha-canada.org/historical-issues/japanese-statement-protesting-unesco-registration-of-nanjing-massacre-docs-backfires}}&lt;/ref&gt; Range of death toll estimated by Japanese historians are from tens of thousand to 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= China athletes unlikely to stay at controversy-linked Sapporo hotel

According to a brief reference to Nanjing at the [[Yūshūkan|Yasukuni museum]] in Tokyo, the Japanese general in charge gave his men maps showing foreign settlements and a civilian "safety zone", and ordered them to maintain strict military discipline. The visitor is left to assume they did. The museum notes only that "Chinese soldiers disguised in civilian clothes, which numbered around 4000&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; were severely prosecuted".

This nationalist view does not, however, represent a widely shared understanding of what happened at Nanjing, as illustrated by Japanese textbooks' rather different treatment of the atrocity. While the books' take on Nanjing is stilted and feels like the product of a committee, in various versions they acknowledge the deaths of thousands of Chinese including women and children, as well as looting, arson and assaults by Japanese soldiers. They do not mention sexual assaults.

"During this period, when the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing it killed a large number of Chinese and carried out looting, arson and assaults. In regard to the number of victims of this Nanjing Massacre&amp;nbsp;... the Tokyo (War Crime) Trials later found it in excess of 200,000, and prosecuted Japan's responsibility severely", reads one Japanese textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The spin in history textbooks

Another history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which had been approved by the government in 2001, attempts to whitewash Japan's war record during the 1930s and early 1940s. It referred to the Nanjing massacre as an "incident", and glossed over the issue of comfort women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21226068|title=What Japanese history lessons leave out|last=Oi|first=Mariko|date=14 March 2013|website=BBC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is only one sentence that refers to this event: "they [the Japanese troops] occupied that city in December."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/04/history-education-the-source-of-conflict-between-china-and-japan/|title=History Education: The Source of Conflict Between China and Japan|last=Wang|first=Zheng|date=23 April 2014|website=The Diplomat|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nanjing massacre has emerged as one fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity.&lt;ref name=Askew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html#_edn2 |title=The Nanjing Incident – Recent Research and Trends |first=David |last=Askew |date=2002-04-04 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Chinese (including citizens of the PRC, Taiwan, and overseas) will refer to the Nanjing Massacre to explain certain stances they hold or ideas they have; this 'national unifying event' holds true to middle-school educated peasants and to senior government officials alike.

The '''Neva Enfilade''' of the [[Winter Palace]], St Petersburg, is a series of three large halls arranged in an [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] along the palace's massive facade facing the [[River Neva]].

Originally designed as a series of five state rooms by the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Francesco Rastrelli]] in 1753, they were transformed into an enfilade of three vast halls in 1790 by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. Following a fire in 1837 they were rebuilt under the direction of [[Vasily Stasov]]. Frequently used as the palace ballrooms, they formed a processional route, and were the focus of the imperial court. In 1915, the last Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], had the enfilade transformed into a [[military hospital]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the enfilade, along with the remainder of the building, has been used as a series of exhibition halls of the [[State Hermitage Museum]].

==History==
[[File:NevaEnfilade.png|thumb|right|300px|The Winter Palace's Neva enfilade is shaded red. A: Concert Hall; B: The Nicholas Hall; C: Great [[Antechamber|anteroom]]. 1:[[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Drawing Room]]; 2: [[Arabian Hall of the Winter Palace|Arabian Hall]]; 3:[[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]]; 4: [[Field Marshals' Hall of the Winter Palace|Field Marshals' Hall]]; 5: [[Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace|Small Throne Room]]; 6: [[Armorial Hall of the Winter Palace|Armorial Hall]]; 7: [[Military Gallery of the Winter Palace|Military gallery]]; 8: [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Room of the Winter Palace|Great Throne Room]]; 9: [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]].]]

The Palace was originally built in 1732, as an official residence for the Tsaritsa [[Anna I of Russia]] and designed by the architect Francesco Rastrelli. The Tsaritsa found the small Winter palace of [[Peter the Great]] insufficiently grand, and had taken over the neighbouring, and grander, palace of Admiral General [[Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin]], this she had rebuilt to form her own Winter Palace.

During the reign of Anna's successor, [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]], Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale&amp;mdash;the present [[Baroque]] Winter Palace (externally the palace seen today); the Tsaritsa wanted the palace to exceed in beauty and size all other European royal palaces.{{r|Hermitage}} The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of national honour to the Empress, and to pay for it taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for Russia's wars. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles.{{sfnp|Orloff|Shvidkovsky|1996}} By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, an imperial Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion; at that time, the Neva enfilade contained five the principal state rooms. Work continued during the short reign of Elizabeth's nephew Peter III and on into the reign of Peter's widow [[Catherine the Great]].

During Catherine the Great's reign, Neoclassicism came into vogue, and the new Tsaritsa was a great admirer. Rastrelli was dismissed and new architects working in the new fashions were employed. During this period, the original ornate rococo decoration of the palace was replaced with the more simple and stark neoclassicism which is a hallmark of the Palace today. The Neva enfilade was completely redesigned between 1790–93 by the architect [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. Taking in the floor above, he transformed the original five rooms into three vast halls: the Concert Hall, the Great Hall and the Great Ante-Room. They were decorated in classical style with faux marbre and columns supporting life size statues.{{r|Hermitage}}

Following a disastrous fire which destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interiors in 1837, the halls were recreated in similar style by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]].{{r|Hermitage}}

==Court use of the enfilade==
[[File:Winter Palacebanquet1874..jpg|thumb|left|A banquet in the Nicholas Hall in 1874]]

Until 1905, during the winter months, the Tsar and Tsaritsa were traditionally resident in the palace; this was the period of the Saint Petersburg [[social season]] and the first floor  [[piano nobile]] would be in near constant use. The remainder of the year the imperial couple resided elsewhere, and the palace housed the staff and the officials of the monarchy, who occupied the ground and second floors. The halls of the enfilade were designed to form an important part in the ceremonial life of the court, not just as ballrooms for festivities but for processional use. From the entrance to the private apartments at the western end of the Concert Hall, Imperial processions would proceed in state through the enfilade to the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]] or turn and continue through the eastern state rooms.

Before 1917, during ceremonies and functions, access to the various hall of the enfilade was dictated by rank. Those who were most important were positioned closest to the beginning of an imperial procession in the Concert Hall, the lesser exalted in the Nicholas Hall and the least important in the Great Ante-Room.{{r|Sitwell}} The imperial court was very conscious of rank. This was particularly obvious amongst the ladies attached to the court. Etiquette dictated that all these ladies, regardless of age, wore white silk dresses with a low [[decolletage]] and a red or olive green velvet train with gold embroidery. On their heads they wore red or green [[kokoshnik]]s studded with jewels.{{r|Sitwell}} While other women present were allowed coloured dresses, the train and kokoshnik was mandatory court dress.

Further classification was given to the women's ranks by indication of whether they were "Dames a Portrait" or "Demoiselles d'Honneur." The former, higher ranking class wore the Tsaritsa's portrait mounted in diamonds on their left breast, while the latter wore the Tsaritsa's monogram surrounded by diamonds. In between these two ranks were the "Dames du Palais" who like the "Dames a portrait" wore olive green, the lower ranking "Demoiselles d'Honneur" wore red.{{r|Sitwell}}

[[File:Winterpalace1914hosp.jpg|thumb|right|1915, the Nicholas Hall transformed into a hospital ward]]
While red and green were the colours of the Tsar and Tsaritsa, further colour was added by the women attached to the numerous Grand Duchesses. Each Grand Duchess had her own colour, and all the ladies attached to the suite would wear it. Queen Victoria's foreign secretary, writing to her in 1894 of a state procession through the enfilade, recorded of the Grand Duchesses' colours that one "is a particularly hideous shade of orange." The Foreign Secretary then went on to describe the "8,000 to 10,000" people present in the Winter palace's "interminable halls", and a particular "Demoiselle d'Honneur" who was "so old that she was propped up against a wall." Overall, the splendour and size of the Winter Palace and its colourful and bejewelled ladies failed to impress the Foreign Secretary for he reported to the Queen that the Grand Church "was not very large" and that the assembled imperial court had "an absence of beauty as compared with that seen at one of Your Majesty's drawing rooms." He did, however, concede that the Queen's granddaughter looked "simply magnificent...the perfection of what one would imagine an Empress of Russia on her way to the altar would be."{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|Quoting [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]] to Queen Victoria; 14 November 1894.}} That wedding of Queen Victoria's granddaughter to the Tsar was to be one of the final huge gatherings at the Palace, however. The palace's state rooms had had their [[swan song]] during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] between 1855 and 1881.

Alexander II was the last Tsar to use the Winter Palace extensively not only for governing the empire but also entertaining. Of special note were the Bals des Palmiers given at the palace. On these occasions, 100 palm trees were brought from the hot houses at Tsarskoe Selo; these would be scattered throughout the enfilade, and around them supper tables seating 15 people would be constructed. During the course of the evening the Tsar would make the rounds of the tables, eating a piece of bread or fruit at each, in order that the guests may say that they had dined with the Tsar.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|pp=190–192|ps=}}

Following the assassination of Alexander II, the Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=216|ps=}} The Imperial family then moved to the seclusion of the [[Palace of Gatchina]], some 40 miles from St. Petersburg.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=216|ps=}} When in St. Petersburg, the Imperial family resided at the [[Anichkov Palace]], but the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Alexander III, however, was not a lover of society and, when using the Winter Palace, preferred playing bridge in an anteroom to dancing. While most St Petersburg balls did not conclude until 6am, at the Winter Palace, from 2am the Tsar would dismiss the musicians from the orchestra one by one, until only the pianist and a fiddler remained, by which time his guests had taken the hint and gone.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=221|ps=}}

The final imperial reception at the Winter Palace was a themed, fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei I]], which took place on 22 January 1903. The Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovitch]] recalled the occasion as "the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low."{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=226|ps=}} The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei I]] and the Tsaritsa as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], all dressed in rich 17th century attire posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=227|ps=}} for what was to be their final photograph together.{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=64}} The following year Russia was at war, and the Tsar and Tsaritsa abandoned St Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Tsaritsa to be decadent and immoral{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=246|ps=}}) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo.

==The Concert Hall==
[[File:ConcerthallWinter Palace.jpg|thumb|right|The Concert Hall, the Winter Palace, St Petersburg. Looking towards the doors of [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|The Nicholas Hall]]. This room, closest to the private apartments was reserved for the court's elite. Watercolor by [[Alexander Kolb (artist)|Alexander Kolb]] (1860s).]]

'''The Concert Hall''' has an [[architrave]] seemingly supported by paired Corinthian columns, the capitals of which serve as plinthes for life-size statues of the various [[muse]]s. It is decorated in a similar loose Baroque influenced neoclassical style as the Great Anteroom at the western end of the Enfilade. It is indicative of the size of the Winter Palace, that whereas most other royal palaces  such as [[Buckingham Palace]], [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz]] and [[Sanssouci]] all have [[music room]]s, the Winter Palace has a concert hall. This is because it was the intention of the builders of the Winter Palace that their palace should outshine all other royal palaces. In fact Catherine the Great, for whom the enfilade was designed, was delighted when she bought an art collection for the Winter palace that Frederick the Great, the creator of Sanssouci could not afford.

So it was, that from this vast double height hall that solemn Imperial processions began. On such occasions the Concert Hall would be reserved for  the highest ranking guest and members of the court.{{r|Sitwell}} At a given moment, four "massive Ethiopians", the Tsar's official bodyguards, fantastically dressed in scarlet trousers, gold jackets, white turbans and curved shoes, would ceremonially open the doors from the private [[Arabian Hall of the Winter Palace|Arabian Hall]] (''2 on plan above'') and the imperial procession would pass through the enfilade.{{sfnp|Massie|1967|p=129|ps=}}{{efn|Sitwell writes: "These are no mere Negroes: they are Christian Abyssinians."}} The procession through would be preceded by the Marshal of the Court carrying a gold staff seven [[foot (length)|feet]] high topped with a diamond crown.{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=110|ps=}} On less formal occasions, as the hall's name suggests, it was used for concerts, balls and grand receptions.

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], the room houses the silver reliquary of [[St Alexander Nevsky]], formerly at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]]. The reliquary was brought to the Palace in 1922, where it was set up to obscure the now blocked, grand doors from which the Imperial family used to enter from the private apartments.

==The Nicholas Hall==
[[File:Grand NicholasHall.jpg|thumb|The Nicholas Hall, by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]] (1879)]]
The '''Nicholas Hall''' is located in the centre of the enfilade. The largest room in the palace at {{convert|1103|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, it was originally simply known as the Great Hall, and was the setting for many imperial balls and receptions.  Following the death of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in 1855, a large equestrian portrait of the late tsar was hung from the wall, and the hall was renamed the Nicholas Hall.

While in the same architectural rhythm as the preceding Concert Hall, the architecture is more severe. Here, the architrave is immediately below the ceiling. The only ornamentation is the carving of the corinthian capitals and the [[entablature]].

Writing in 1902, the [[Millicent Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Duchess of Sutherland]] and the American-born [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], herself the chatelaine of one of [[Blenheim Palace|Britain's great palaces]], described their impressions of a court ball held in the Nicholas Hall.

::The Duchess of Sutherland wrote: "The stairs of the palace were guarded by [[cossack]]s, with hundreds of [[footman|footmen]] in scarlet [[livery|liveries]], I have never in my life seen so brilliant a sight - the light, the uniforms, the enormous rooms, the crowd, the music, making a spectacle that was almost Barbaric in splendour...They seat at supper nearly four thousand people"

::While the Duchess of Marlborough recorded that dinner (she sat beside the Tsar) was protracted and comprised "soups, caviar and monster sturgeons, meat and game, pates and primeurs, ices and fruits, all mounted on gold and silver plate fashioned by [[François-Thomas Germain|Germain]]"

Ironically, the Duchess of Sutherland then went on to describe the hungry peasants outside the gates - "... all the want of penury of the peasants and this strange show to keep up the prestige of the aristocracy and the autocracy of one gentle, quiet little man."{{sfnp|Stuart|1982|p=97|ps=}}

During [[World War I]], the hall was used as an infirmary.  It was restored in 1957, when the [[State Hermitage Museum]] was under the direction of [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]].{{sfnp|Norman|1998|p=283|ps=}}

==The Great Antechamber==
[[File:Avantsalle.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Ante-Chamber, the Winter Palace, St Petersburg, by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]] (1861)]]

The Great Ante-Chamber of the [[Winter Palace]] is the principal entrance hall to the [[State Apartments|state apartments]] of the palace. The first room of the [[piano nobile]] at the head of the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan staircase]], it formed the processional exit of the Neva enfilade, and presented a procession with a choice, either to descend the staircase and exit the palace, which happened once a year for the ceremony of blessing the waters of the Neva, or to turn right and continue through the next enfilade to the [[Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace|small throne room]] (''5'') or continue on through the [[Armorial Hall of the Winter Palace|Armorial Hall]] (''6'') and [[Military Gallery of the Winter Palace|Military Gallery]] (''7'') to the [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Room of the Winter Palace|Great Throne Room]] (''8'') or [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]] (''9'').

==Exhibition halls==
Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]] the halls of the Neva enfilade are preserved as "palace interiors" containing only minimal furniture they are used for exhibitions. Many of the mirrors which lined the interior walls opposite each window have been concealed behind exhibition boards which creates a utilitarian feel to the halls, and one has to look upwards to the carved [[captal]]s, statues, great chandeliers and moulded ceilings to gain an impression of the hall's glacial grandeur and classical architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2953">[[Image:Old Mole 25.jpg|right|thumb|''Old Mole'' #25 (1969)]]
'''''Old Mole''''' was a radical [[New Left]] oriented [[underground press|underground newspaper]] published in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] from September 1968 to September 1970. Printed biweekly in a 16-page tabloid format, it was based for most of its existence in a storefront and basement office on Brookline Street in [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]]. Selling for 15 cents (later raised to a quarter), 47 issues were published in all, with press runs averaging 8000 to 10,000 copies. Subscriptions were free to prisoners and soldiers.

''Old Mole'' was produced by a floating staff of 20 to 30 volunteers, with no more than 4 paid staffers. The staff was split evenly between men and women, almost all white, most of them college graduates and many connected with nearby [[Harvard University]]. About half of the paper's news coverage was local. One of its founders was Michael Ansara.&lt;!-- NOT [[Michael Ansara]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katharine L. Day, "Two Radicals Subpoenaed By a Senate Subcommittee", ''The Harvard Crimson'', [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1971/2/20/two-radicals-subpoenaed-by-a-senate/ February 20, 1971]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was more politically oriented than many of the more hippie, psychedelically oriented underground papers of the period, and its politics tended to reflect the positions of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] chapter at Harvard, supporting the Harvard student strike in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgehistory.org/Publications/Chronicle%20Summer%202010.pdf "Swimming in a countercultural sea"] by Dick Cluster, ''The Newetowne Chronicle'' (newsletter of the Cambridge Historical Society), Summer 2010, p. 1, 6. Retrieved Jan. 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The paper's name came from a quotation from [[Karl Marx]] which appeared in the masthead: ''"We recognize our old friend, our old mole, who knows so well how to work underground, suddenly to appear: the revolution."''

During the Harvard student strike of 1969, the ''Old Mole'' published daily "Strike Specials". In one of them, it published internal correspondence of Harvard administrators (the "Dear Nate" letter) that had apparently been stolen from [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]] during the student sit-in.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca L. Walkowitz, "The Inside Dirt On The Old ", Mole", ''The Harvard Crimson'' [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1989/4/7/the-inside-dirt-on-the-old/ April 7, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Packaging''' is the science, art and technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution, storage, sale, and use.  Packaging also refers to the process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages. Packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport, warehousing, logistics, sale, and end use. Packaging contains, protects, preserves, transports, informs, and sells.&lt;ref&gt;Soroka (2002) ''Fundamentals of Packaging Technology'', Institute of Packaging Professionals {{ISBN|1-930268-25-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries it is fully integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and personal use.

'''Package labeling''' ([[American English]]) or '''labelling''' ([[British English]]) is any written, electronic, or [[graphic communication]] on the package or on a separate but associated [[label]].

==History of packaging==

===Ancient era===
[[File:Ritual wine vessel - The Met.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Bronze wine container from the 9th century BCE.]]
The first packages used the natural materials available at the time: [[basket]]s of reeds, wineskins ([[bota bag]]s), [[wooden box]]es, pottery [[vase]]s, ceramic [[amphora]]e, wooden [[barrel]]s, woven bags, etc. Processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed: for example, early [[glass]] and [[bronze]] vessels.  The study of old packages is an important aspect of [[archaeology]].

The earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a [[Persian people|Persian]] traveler visiting markets in [[Cairo]] noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Origins of Paper Based Packaging|author=Diana Twede|journal=Conference on Historical Analysis &amp; Research in Marketing Proceedings|volume=12|year=2005|pages=288–300 [289]|url=http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf|accessdate=March 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716105826/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

====Tinning====
The use of [[tinning|tinplate]] for packaging dates back to the 18th century. The manufacture of tinplate was long a [[monopoly]] of [[Bohemia]]; in 1667 [[Andrew Yarranton]], an English [[engineer]], and [[Ambrose Crowley]] brought the method to England where it was improved by ironmasters including [[Philip Foley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=P.J.|last=Brown|title=Andrew Yarranton and the British tinplate industry|periodical=Historical Metallurgy|volume=22|year=1988|pages=42–48|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=P.W.|last=King|title=Wolverley Lower Mill and the beginnings of the tinplate industry|periodical=Historical Metallurgy|volume=22|year=1988|pages=104–113|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1697, [[John Hanbury (1664–1734)|John Hanbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|King|1988|p= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a rolling mill at [[Pontypool]] for making "Pontypoole Plates".&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Schubert, ''History of the British iron and steel industry ... to 1775'', 429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=W.W.|last=Minchinton|title=The British tinplate industry: a history|year=1957|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method pioneered there of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the former practice of [[hammer]]ing.

Tinplate boxes first began to be sold from ports in the [[Bristol Channel]] in 1725.  The tinplate was shipped from [[Newport, Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Data extracted from D.P. Hussey ''et al., Gloucester Port Books Database'' (CD-ROM, University of Wolverhampton 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1805, 80,000 boxes were made and 50,000 exported. [[Tobacco]]nists in London began packaging snuff in metal-plated canisters from the 1760s onwards.

====Canning====
[[Image:Canning stewpan advertisement.jpg|thumb|200x200px|left|1914 magazine advertisement for [[cookware]] with instructions for home canning.]]
With the discovery of the importance of airtight containers for [[food preservation]] by French inventor [[Nicholas Appert]], the tin canning process was patented by British merchant [[Peter Durand]] in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21689069 |title=BBC News - The story of how the tin can nearly wasn't |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=April 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, [[Bryan Donkin]] and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAA5M2eIWqwC|title=People and Industries|author=William H. Chaloner|publisher=Routledge|year=1963|isbn=0-7146-1284-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progressive improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 invention of the [[can opener]]. Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, [[Middlesex]], UK, devised a claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Kitchen History|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7IhN7lempUC|isbn=978-1-57958-380-4|date=September 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by [[Ezra Warner (inventor)|Ezra Warner]] of [[Waterbury, Connecticut]].

====Paper-based packaging====
[[File:Packing salt packages.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Packing folding cartons of salt.]]
Set-up boxes were first used in the 16th century and modern [[folding carton]]s date back to 1839.  The first [[corrugated box]] was produced commercially in 1817 in England. [[Corrugated paper|Corrugated (also called pleated) paper]] received a British patent in 1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats. Scottish-born [[Robert Gair]] invented the pre-cut [[paperboard]] box in 1890—flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about as a result of an accident: as a [[Brooklyn]] printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cartons, crates and corrugated board: handbook of paper and wood packaging technology|author1=Diana Twede  |author2=Susan E.M. Selke |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=DEStech Publications|year=2005|isbn=978-1-932078-42-8|pages=41–42, 55–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kc0MSzFvrH8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial paper bags were first manufactured in [[Bristol]], [[England]], in 1844, and the American [[Francis Wolle]] patented a machine for automated bag-making in 1852.

===20th century===
Packaging advancements in the early 20th century included [[Bakelite]] closures on [[bottle]]s, transparent [[cellophane]] overwraps and panels on [[carton]]s. These innovations increased processing efficiency and improved [[food safety]].  As additional materials such as [[aluminium|aluminum]] and several [[List of synthetic polymers|types of plastic]] were developed, they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brody|first=A. L|last2=Marsh|first2=K. S|title=Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology|year=1997|isbn=0-471-06397-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HeroinHarrisonActNOLA.JPG|thumb|left|170x170px|[[Heroin]] bottle and carton, early 20th century.]]
In 1952, [[Michigan State University]] became the first university in the world to offer a degree in [[Packaging Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://packaging.msu.edu|title=Michigan State School of Packaging|accessdate=February 11, 2012 |publisher=Michigan State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-plant recycling has long been common for producing packaging materials. Post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper-based products has been economical for many years:  since the 1980s, post-consumer recycling has increased due to [[curbside recycling]], consumer awareness, and regulatory pressure.

[[File:First polythene pillbox.JPG|thumb|right|170x170px|A pill box made from [[polyethylene]] in 1936.]]
Many prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military use.  Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport [[materiel]], supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage conditions. Packaging problems encountered in [[World War II]] led to [[United States Military Standard|Military Standard]] or "mil spec" regulations being applied to packaging, which was then designated "military specification packaging". As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to [[Iceland in World War II|operations in Iceland]] experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, [[field ration]]s, [[antistatic bag]]s, and various [[shipping crate]]s) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=J.C.|title=The History and Significance of Military Packaging|work=Defence Packaging Policy Group|publisher=Defence Logistics Agency|date=July 2003|url=http://www.dla.mil/Portals/104/Documents/LandAndMaritime/V/VS/Packaging/LM_pkghistory_151007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2003}}, the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the [[gross national product]] in [[developed countries]]. About half of this market was related to [[food packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technology of Cheesemaking: Second Edition|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8298-0|author=Y.

==The purposes of packaging and package labels==

Packaging and package labeling have several objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

* '''Physical protection''' – The objects enclosed in the package may require protection from, among other things, mechanical [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]], [[vibration]], [[electrostatic discharge]], compression, [[temperature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Choi |first= Seung-Jin|author2=Burgess |year=2007 |title=Practical mathematical model to predict the performance of insulating packages|journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=369–380 |doi=10.1002/pts.762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
* '''Barrier protection''' – A barrier to [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], dust, etc., is often required. [[Permeation]] is a critical factor in design. Some packages contain [[desiccant]]s or [[oxygen absorber]]s to help extend shelf life. [[Modified atmosphere]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun |author2=Kim |author3=An |author4=Lyu |author5=Lee |year=1998 |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |page= 417|doi=10.1002/pts.821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages. Keeping the contents clean, fresh, [[Asepsis|sterile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Severin |first=J|year=2007 |title=New Methodology for Whole-Package Microbial Challenge Testing for Medical Device Trays|doi=10.1520/JTE100869|journal=J. Testing and Evaluation|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safe for the duration of the intended [[shelf life]] is a primary function. A barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required, as in the case of special paints, glues, medical fluids, etc. At the consumer end, the packaging barrier is broken or measured amounts of material are removed for mixing and subsequent end use.
* '''Containment or agglomeration''' – Small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 pencils requires less physical handling than 1000 single pencils. [[Liquid]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], and [[granular material]]s need containment.
* '''Information transmission''' – Packages and [[label]]s communicate how to use, transport, [[recycling|recycle]], or dispose of the package or product. With [[Medication|pharmaceutical]]s, [[food]], [[medicine|medical]], and [[chemical substance|chemical]] products, some types of information are [[Mandatory labelling|required]] by government legislation. Some packages and labels also are used for [[track and trace]] purposes.  Most items include their [[Serial number|serial]] and [[lot number]]s on the packaging, and in the case of food products, medicine, and some chemicals the packaging often contains an [[Shelf life|expiry/best-before date]], usually in a shorthand form. Packages may indicate their construction material with a symbol.
* '''Marketing''' – Packaging and [[label]]s can be used by [[marketing|marketers]] to encourage potential buyers to purchase a product. Package [[graphic design]] and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomena for several decades. [[Marketing communications]] and [[graphic design]] are applied to the surface of the package and often to the [[point of sale display]]. Most packaging is designed to reflect the brand's message and identity.
[[File:Shampoo packet, single-serving.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A single-serving shampoo [[Sachet (package)|packet]]]]
* '''Security''' – Packaging can play an important role in reducing the [[security]] risks of shipment.  Packages can be made with improved [[tamper resistance]] to deter manipulation and they can also have [[tamper-evident]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first= R.G.|year=1997|title=Effective Vulnerability Assessment of Tamper-Indicating Seals|url=http://library.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00418792.pdf|doi=10.1520/JTE11883J|journal=J. Testing and Evaluation|volume=25 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of [[package pilferage]] or the theft and resale of products:  Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. [[Counterfeit consumer goods]], unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include [[authentication]] seals and use [[security printing]] to help indicate that the package and contents are not [[counterfeit]]. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work”], HowStuffWorks.com&lt;/ref&gt; tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate.  Using packaging in this way is a means of [[retail loss prevention]].
* '''Convenience''' – Packages can have features that add [[convenience]] in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of [[Waste disposal|disposal]]
* '''Portion control''' – Single serving or single [[drug delivery|dosage]] packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households.  It also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.

==Packaging types==
[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|right|thumb|Various types of household packaging for foods]]
Packaging may be of several different types. For example, a '''transport package''' or '''distribution package''' can be the [[shipping container]] used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages.  Some identify a '''consumer package''' as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.

Custom packaging is an evolutionary use of modern materials. Thermoforming and vacuum forming allow for expanded capabilities for large trays, displays, and specialty needs.  Thermoforming is a method which uses vacuum, heat, and pressure to form the desired material into a shape determined by its mold. This type of packaging is often used by the cosmetic and medical industry.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

Packaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: [[medical device]] packaging, bulk [[chemical substance|chemical]] packaging, [[over-the-counter drug]] packaging, retail [[food]] packaging, military [[materiel]] packaging, [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] packaging, etc.

It is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: "primary", "secondary", etc.
*Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.
*Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.
*Tertiary or transit packaging is used for [[logistics|bulk handling]], [[warehouse]] storage and [[transport]] shipping. The most common form is a [[pallet]]ized [[unit load]] that packs tightly into [[containerization|container]]s.

These broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary.  For example, depending on the use, a [[shrink wrap]] can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.

==Symbols used on packages and labels==
[[File:HK food drink Longevity brand Sweetened Milk Mar-2014 barcode a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[bar code]] on a tin of condensed milk]]
Many types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized.  For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the [[FCC Declaration of Conformity|FCC]] and [[TÜV]] marks), [[trademark]]s, [[proof of purchase]], etc.  Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the [[CE marking]] or the [[estimated sign]] that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the [[recycling symbol]], the [[Recycling codes|recycling code]] (which could be a [[resin identification code]]), and the [[Green Dot (symbol)|"Green Dot"]]. Food packaging may show [[Food contact materials|food contact material]] symbols. In the [[European Union]], products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped [[EC identification and health marks]] for food safety and quality insurance reasons.

[[Barcode|Bar codes]], [[Universal Product Code]]s, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels are common to allow automated information management in [[logistics]] and [[retailing]]. [[Country of Origin Labeling]] is often used. Some products might use [[QR code]]s or similar [[matrix barcode]]s. Packaging may have visible [[Printing registration|registration marks]] and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.

===Shipping container labeling===
[[File:Print n apply ucc.jpg|left|thumb|UCC Application|"Print &amp; Apply" corner wrap UCC ([[GS1-128]]) label application to a pallet load]]
Technologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, [[bar codes]], and electronic data interchange ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]).  These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel.  Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.

Elements of these core technologies include [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] and [[GS1|EAN]] item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated [[GS1-128]]) bar code [[Barcode symbology|symbologies]], and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.

Small parcel carriers often have their own formats.  For example, United Parcel Service has a [[MaxiCode]] 2-D code for parcel tracking.

[[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used.  A [[Wal-Mart]] division, [[Sam's Club]], has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Beth |last=Bacheldor |title=Sam's Club Tells Suppliers to Tag or Pay |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3845/1/1/ |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipments of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] or [[dangerous goods]] have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D5445 "Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods" and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 780 "Pictorial marking for handling of goods".

==Package development considerations==
Package design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the [[new product development]] process.  Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.
Package design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, [[marketing]], [[shelf life]], [[quality assurance]], [[logistics]], legal, regulatory, [[graphic design]], end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by [[package testing]]),  completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon.  Package design processes often employ [[rapid prototyping]], [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]]  and [[document automation]].

[[File:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Transport packaging needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]

An example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to [[logistics]].  When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized [[unit load]]s, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame.  A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.

With some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging.  For example, any package components that may contact [[food]]s are designated [[food contact materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
  | last = Sotomayor
  | first = R.E.

  | journal = Food Safety
   | year =2007 
  | url = http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFCS/ucm064166.htm#authors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Toxicologist]]s and [[food scientist]]s need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. [[Packaging engineer]]s need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended [[shelf life]] with normal usage.  Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be [[Verification and validation|validated]] to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.

Sometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory.  For example, regulations for an [[over-the-counter drug]] might require the package to be [[tamper-evident]] and [[Child-resistant packaging|child resistant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
  | last = Rodgers

  | doi = 10.1001/jama.275.21.1661
| pmid=8637140}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These intentionally make the package difficult to open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 |title=Openability: producing design limits for consumer packaging|journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=183–243 |doi=10.1002/pts.725 |last1=Yoxall |first1=A. |last2=Janson |first2=R. |last3=Bradbury |first3=S.R. |last4=Langley |first4=J. |last5=Wearn |first5=J. |last6=Hayes |first6=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended consumer, however, might be handicapped or elderly and unable to readily open the package. Meeting all goals is a challenge.

Package design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external [[packaging engineering]]: [[independent contractor]]s, [[consultant]]s, vendor evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total [[outsourcing]], etc.  Some sort of formal [[project planning]] and [[project management]] methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An effective [[quality management]] system and [[Verification and Validation]] protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.

===Environmental considerations===

Package development involves considerations of [[sustainability]], environmental responsibility, and applicable [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[recycling]] regulations. It may involve a [[life cycle assessment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zabaniotou|first=A|author2=Kassidi |year=2003 |title= Life cycle assessment applied to egg packaging made from polystyrene and recycled paper |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=549–559 |doi= 10.1016/S0959-6526(02)00076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The traditional “three R’s” of reduce, reuse, and recycle are part of a [[waste hierarchy]] which may be considered in product and package development.

*Prevention –  Waste prevention is a primary goal.  Packaging should be used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste. Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.
*Minimization (also "source reduction") – The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process. Usually “reduced” packaging also helps minimize costs. Packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |title=The Incredible Shrinking Package |accessdate=July 16, 2007 |last=DeRusha |first=Jason |date=July 16, 2007 |publisher=WCCO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717171902/http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Returnable packaging has long been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics systems. Inspection, cleaning, repair and recouperage are often needed. Some manufacturers re-use the packaging of the incoming parts for a product, either as packaging for the outgoing product&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/94feb/feb94a8.pdf "HP DeskJet 1200C Printer Architecture"]. (PDF) . Retrieved on June 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or as part of the product itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom-magazine.com/2009/critical-thinking/footprints-in-the-sand/ "Footprints In The Sand"].

*Recycling – [[Recycling]] is the reprocessing of materials (pre- and post-consumer) into new products.  Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc. Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling.
*[[Energy recovery]] – [[Waste-to-energy]] and [[Refuse-derived fuel]] in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components.
*Disposal – [[Incineration]], and placement in a sanitary [[landfill]] are undertaken for some materials.  Certain US states regulate packages for toxic contents, which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and [[leachate]] from landfill. Packages should not be [[litter]]ed.

Development of [[sustainable packaging]] is an area of considerable interest to [[standards organization]]s, governments, consumers, packagers, and retailers.

==Packaging machines==
[[File:Budweiser Plant.jpg|right|thumbnail|400px|Beer [[bottling line]]s]]
Choosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities, labor requirements, worker safety, [[maintainability]], serviceability, [[reliability engineering|reliability]], ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost, floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, multiple products, etc.), energy requirements, [[Quality control|quality]] of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, [[ergonomics]], [[return on investment]], etc.

Packaging machinery can be:
# purchased as standard, off-the-shelf equipment
# purchased custom-made or custom-tailored to specific operations
# manufactured or modified by in-house engineers and maintenance staff

Efforts at packaging line [[automation]] increasingly use [[programmable logic controller]]s and [[robotics]].

Packaging machines may be of the following general types:
*Accumulating and collating machines
* [[Blister pack]]s, [[skin pack]]s and vacuum packaging machines
* [[Bottle cap]]s equipment, over-capping, lidding, closing, seaming and sealing machines
* [[Box]], case, tray, and carrier forming, packing, unpacking, closing, and sealing machines
* [[Cartoning machines]]
* Cleaning, sterilizing, cooling and drying machines
* Coding, printing, marking, stamping, and imprinting machines
* [[Converting]] machines
* [[Conveyor belt]]s, accumulating and related machines
* Feeding, orienting, placing and related machines
* [[Filler (packaging)|Filling machines]]: handling dry, powdered, solid, liquid, gas, or viscous products
* [[Inspection|Inspecting]]: visual, sound, metal detecting, etc.
* [[Label dispenser]]
* Orienting, unscrambling machines
* Package filling and closing machines
* [[Pallet]]izing, depalletizing, [[unit load]] assembly
* Product identification: [[label]]ing, marking, etc.
* Sealing machines: [[heat sealer]] or glue units
* [[Slitter|Slitting machines]]
* Weighing machines: [[check weigher]], [[multihead weigher]]
* Wrapping machines: stretch wrapping, [[shrink wrap]], banding
* [[Vertical form fill sealing machine|Form, fill and seal machines]]
* Other specialty machinery: [[slitter]]s, [[perforate|perforating]], [[laser]] cutters, parts attachment, etc.

In '''''S v Tandwa''''' (2007), the seven appellants were convicted of a [[bank robbery]] and [[Appeal|appealed]] this.  The allegation was that it was an "inside job," as Tandwa was an employee of the [[bank]]. It looked like Tandwa was a victim, but he was actually working with the bank robbers.

The first appellant also contended that his [[right to a fair trial]] had been violated in that his counsel had been incompetent, had given him bad advice, and had conducted himself obstructively. In particular, he claimed that he had not been properly informed about the consequences of not [[Testimony|testifying]], and that his counsel had misled him on the legal position in this regard.

The court held that the [[Right to counsel|right to legal representation]] meant a right to representation that was competent and of a quality and nature that ensured that the trial was indeed fair.

It also followed that an accused had the right to represent himself, and if the unwanted or inept advice of counsel unfairly thwarted the exercise of that right, the accused's right to a fair trial would have been infringed.

The court held that the evidence in favour of the State was very strong and the accused's allegations were so weak, contradictory and inherently improbable that they could be rejected on [[affidavit]] without further enquiry.

Furthermore, it was held that it was inherently improbable that a well-educated accused with experience of testifying in previous proceedings would not either insist on testifying, as previously agreed, or complain at the first opportunity about having been unjustly thwarted in his wish to do so

Therefore the appeals were dismissed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4903">'''SeaChoice''' is a program of Sustainable Seafood Canada that uses the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch recommendations to raise consumer awareness about the importance of buying [[Sustainable seafood|seafood from sustainable sources]]. It is best known for publishing consumer guides for responsible seafood purchasing. SeaChoice evaluates fisheries based on habitat/ecosystem impacts, [[fish stock|stock status]], inherent vulnerability, [[bycatch]], and management regimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2009/2009-07-22-01.html Small Fisheries Cuts Could Conserve Large Coastal Ecosystems.] ''Environment News Service.'' July 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable Seafood Canada is a Canadian coalition of environmental organizations working together to raise awareness and deliver solutions for sustainable fisheries. The organization consists of the [[Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society]], the [[David Suzuki Foundation]], the [[Ecology Action Centre]], [[Living Oceans Society]] and British Columbia's chapter of the [[Sierra Club of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seachoice.org/page/seachoicelaunch SeaChoice Launch: New SeaChoice program provides Canadians sustainable seafood information from coast to coast to coast.] ''SeaChoice website.'' September 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; SeaChoice collaborates with the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]'s [[Seafood Watch]] program.

==Seafood list==
[[File:Hoplostethus atlanticus 02 Pengo.jpg|thumb|]]
The group gives Canada-centric lists of recommendations for the best seafood choices, fish which have "some concerns" and fish to avoid. The "avoid" category is reserved for seafood which is [[overfishing|overfished]] and/or fished or farmed in ways that harm other marine life or the environment. Health alerts for fish with high levels of contaminants (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s) are also noted, although they may appear in any category.

The SeaChoice website includes both regional and country-wide guides for Canada. The organization also produces a guide for [[sushi]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, Susan.

[[File:California spiny lobster.JPG|thumb|SeaChoice lists U.S. [[spiny lobster]] as one of the best seafood choices.]]
Recommended seafood from SeaChoice includes [[Alaska pollock]], longline [[Pacific cod]], land-based [[rainbow trout]], troll or pole-caught [[Albacore|albacore tuna]], United States [[spiny lobster]], farmed [[Arctic char]], [[Pacific herring]] and [[sardine]]s.

==Partnerships==
In March 2010, SeaChoice announced an agreement with [[Federated Co-operatives]], an organization representing over 250 [[co-operative]]s. The agreement includes a sustainability plan for seafood sales and procurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/Local+provide+SeaChoice+products/2725572/story.html Local Co-ops to provide SeaChoice products.] ''Westerly News.''

The '''Standard Time and Frequency Signal''' (STFS) is a [[Radiocommunication service]] providing the transmission of specified [[frequency]] and [[time]] signal, of [[Standardization|stated]] high precision, intended for general reception in the United States and beyond. The radio signals are broadcast on very precise [[Carrier signal|carrier]] frequencies by the [[United States Naval Observatory|U.S. Naval Observatory]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), formerly the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The technical specification of that particular service is in line to the provisions of the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union´s]] (ITU) [[ITU Radio Regulations|Radio Regulations]] (RR)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Eldridge Wayne Coleman'''&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; (born June 7, 1943) is an American retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[WWE]] under a Legends Contract. An iconic figure in professional wrestling, he worked under the [[ring name]] "'''Superstar'''" '''Billy Graham''' and gained recognition for his tenure as the [[WWE Championship|WWWF Heavyweight Champion]] in 1977–1978. As an award-winning bodybuilder, he was a training partner and close friend of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. He is most remembered for revolutionizing the interview and physique aspects of the professional wrestling industry, and for his charismatic performance style. Some of his wrestling protégés include [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Ric Flair]].

== Early life ==
Wayne Coleman was born into a working-class family in Phoenix, Arizona on June 7, 1943.&lt;ref name=dob&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Billy|title=Superstar Billy Graham: Tangled Ropes|year=2007|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=1416524401|pages=5–6|edition=Pocket Books trade pbk.|author2=Greenberg, Keith Elliot }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was from [[Mississippi]], and his mother, who also claimed [[Cherokee]] ancestry, was from [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; Coleman was attracted to [[weight training|weight lifting]] in the fifth grade.&lt;ref name=heels&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1554902843|pages=195–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager he was an avid reader of bodybuilding magazines, his idols being [[Steve Reeves]] and [[John Grimek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he became a devout Christian and traveled to religious revivals where he incorporated feats of strength into his sermons.&lt;ref name=heels/&gt;

Coleman was a [[shot put]] champion in high school.&lt;ref name=heels/&gt; He also dabbled in amateur and professional boxing, participating in the 1959 Golden Gloves.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 26, he tried out for the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Calgary Stampeders]] but was traded to the [[Montreal Alouettes]].&lt;ref name=heels/&gt; He played in only a couple of games.&lt;ref name=heels/&gt; In between football engagements, he worked as a bouncer in various nightclubs in Phoenix, New York and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=Canoe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingBiosG/graham_superstar.html |title=Superstar Billy Graham: Ring legend |author=Schramm, Chris |date=July 4, 2000 |website=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]] |publisher=SLAM! Wrestling |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After tearing his [[Achilles tendon]], he decided to pursue a career in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=heels/&gt;

== Bodybuilding career ==
In 1961 Coleman was the winner of the West Coast division of the Mr. Teenage America bodybuilding contest ([[Frank Zane]] winning in the East Coast division), and his photo appeared soon after in Bob Hoffman's ''Strength and Fitness'' magazine.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Coleman began to train intensively in 1968 at Gold's Gym in [[Santa Monica]], where he worked out with [[Dave Draper]], [[Franco Columbu]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. At this time he was able to bench press 605&amp;nbsp;lbs (the world record, held by his friend Pat Casey, was 616&amp;nbsp;lbs).&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Coleman's photo shoots with Schwarzenegger featured that year in [[Joe Weider]]'s ''Muscle Fitness'' magazine.

When Coleman decided to become a professional wrestler two years later, he had the inspiration of marrying wrestling to bodybuilding. As a wrestler he weight-trained continuously, and in 1975 prepared for the [[World Bodybuilding Guild]]'s [[Pro. Mr. America]] contest in [[New York City]], where his 22-inch biceps won first place in the Best Developed Arms division.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goodbadugly&gt;{{cite book|first=Bert Rudolph|last=Sugar|first2=George|last2=Napolitano|isbn=0-8317-3912-6|title=The Pictorial History of Wrestling: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|year=1984|publisher=Gallery Books|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of his wrestling career in 1977, Coleman weighed 275&amp;nbsp;lbs. From 1978 he gained more weight and in 1980, at 325&amp;nbsp;lbs, he took part in the [[World's Strongest Man]] competition in Great Gorge, New Jersey. He finished seventh in this contest in spite of injuring himself in one of the events.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; On December 6 of the same year Coleman hosted the U.S. Invitational Powerlifting Championship in Phoenix, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', pp. 231–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early years (1969–1972) ===
In 1969, Coleman was encouraged by professional wrestler Bob Lueck to train with [[Stu Hart]] for the latter's [[Stampede Wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].&lt;ref name=heels/&gt; He trained under Hart in Calgary before debuting on January 16, 1970 in a match with [[Dan Kroffat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://superstarbillygraham.com/Graham/results/Jan16_1970.html Superstar Billy Graham.com Record Book Debut.]&lt;/ref&gt; After wrestling briefly under his real name, Coleman traveled back to the United States in May, wrestling for a few months with [[Dr. Jerry Graham]], Brick Darrow, Rick Cahill and [[Ron Pritchard]] in Arizona before he and Jerry Graham joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[Los Angeles]] promotion (run by Mike LeBell) as a tag team the following August. He changed his ring name to Billy Graham, as a tribute to [[Billy Graham|the famous evangelist of the same name]].&lt;ref name=cpost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/retired-pro-wrestler-superstar-billy-graham-released-from-hospital-127884/|title=Retired Pro-Wrestler 'Superstar' Billy Graham Released From Hospital|publisher=Christian Post|author=Gryboski, Michael|accessdate=August 24, 2015|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Dave Meltzer|title=Huge Billy Graham Interview|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=January 10, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, while wrestling in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], the name would serve both as his ring name and to make him the ([[kayfabe]]) youngest brother of Jerry and the other Graham Brothers ([[Eddie Graham|Eddie]] and [[Grady Johnson|Luke]]).&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canoe/&gt;

In late December 1970 Graham went north to join Roy Shire's NWA San Francisco promotion, working with [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] (his tag-team partner), [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]], [[Cyclone Negro]], and [[Peter Maivia]]. Graham's nearly two-year run in central California included a stint wrestling in Hawaii in February and March 1972. It was during his Californian period that Graham developed a new aspect of his character; before a match he would stage an arm wrestling contest, encouraging public challenges to his title of "Arm Wrestling Champion of the World".&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Meltzer |last2=Hart |first2=Bret |authorlink2=Bret Hart |date=2004 |title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers |url= |location= |publisher=Sports Publishing LLC |page=20 |isbn=1582618178 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Wrestling Association (1972–1975) ===
On October 2, 1972, Graham premiered in [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) based in Minneapolis, where he took on the moniker "Superstar". As he toured the north-central states and adjacent areas of Canada, Graham [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with Gagne, [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]], [[Dick the Bruiser|The Bruiser]], [[Wahoo McDaniel]], [[Billy Robinson]], [[Ken Patera]] and [[Ivan Koloff]], the latter becoming his tag-team partner.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; By this time, Graham was integrating into his performances not only arm wrestling contests but also weightlifting challenges (mainly involving ex-Olympian Ken Patera) and posing routines.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', pp. 151–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September and October 1974 Graham took leave from the AWA to join the [[International Wrestling Alliance]]'s "Super Wide Series" tour of Japan, where he fought such local stars as Mighty Inoue, Animal Hamaguchi and [[Rusher Kimura]]. Following his return from Japan, Graham formed a tag team with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. He left the AWA and returned to the NWA in May 1975, signing up with [[Red Bastien]]'s Dallas-based promotion for five months and taking the local "Brass Knucks" title from [[Mad Dog Vachon]] on August 8. For most of October, Graham worked for the Mid Atlantic promotion in North Carolina, standing in for [[Ric Flair]], who had just been injured in a plane crash.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', pp. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation and return to NWA (1975–1976) ===
Graham made his in–ring debut in the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) on October 25, 1975, in a tag-team match at the Boston Garden in which he and [[Spiros Arion]] defeated [[WWE World Championship|WWWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Dominic De Nucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=176|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]] became the Graham's [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]].&lt;ref name=heels/&gt; Another major feud at this time was with Polish muscleman [[Ivan Putski]].

A brief contract with the NWA in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] followed from June to August 1976, after which Graham went on his second tour of Japan, this time accompanied by [[Ivan Koloff]]. He feuded with [[Antonio Inoki]] during this Japanese run. After returning to America, Graham and Koloff made an unsuccessful attempt to launch their own wrestling promotion in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', pp. 181–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1976, on the invitation of [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], Graham joined the NWA promotion in Florida, beating Rhodes for the Florida heavyweight title on November 22 at the West Palm Beach Auditorium. His work in this period included occasional visits to [[St Louis]], [[Missouri]], where he took on [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Harley Race]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', pp. 214-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WWWF (1977–1981) ===
Graham returned to the WWWF in April 1977 after an agreement with promoter [[Vincent J. McMahon]] (Senior). Graham defeated [[Bruno Sammartino]] for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on April 30, 1977, in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Graham held the title for nine and a half months.&lt;ref name=Cage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=2&amp;nr=612|title=Cagematch profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his reign, he wrestled across America and in [[Japan]] (February 1978), facing challengers such as former champion Bruno Sammartino, [[Jack Brisco]], [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Pedro Morales]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Mil Mascaras]], Strong Kobayashi and [[Riki Choshu]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; On 25 January 1978 in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] football stadium, Graham wrestled against then-[[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Harley Race]] in a WWWF World Heavyweight Championship vs. NWA World Heavyweight Championship unification match which ended in a one-hour time-limit draw.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/78.ht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=heels/&gt; Although a defeat by [[Bob Backlund]], who was to embody the virtuous junior "all-American" wrestler, had been written into Graham's current contract with the WWWF, Graham suggested another outcome to McMahon: that [[Ivan Koloff]] should turn on him, thus starting a feud that would make Graham a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]. McMahon refused because of the handshake deal to make Backlund the new fan favorite champion and he did not want to go back on his word. It was also unheard of for a counter-cultural character like Graham to be a fan favorite, because McMahon and many old promoters saw Graham as a confirmed heel and therefore a negative role model. Graham eventually "lost" the title to Backlund on February 20, 1978.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

Another feud Graham had as champion was with Dusty Rhodes, which culminated in a [[Strap match|Texas Bullrope match]]. His confrontations with Rhodes continued after Graham had been forced to drop the belt to Backlund.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Rhodes himself, a long-time friend of Graham's, recalled these matches with Graham in 1978 as among the most exciting and memorable of his career.&lt;ref&gt;interview in ''20 Years Too Soon: The Superstar Billy Graham Story'', WWE dvd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disillusioned by the premature loss of his belt, Graham left the WWWF in December 1978 and accepted an offer to join Paul Boesch's promotion in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], lending himself out for other NWA events in California and Florida as well.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; In April 1979 he embarked on his third IWA tour of Japan, where he wrestled the same men he had worked with in 1974. In March 1979, the new [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) named Graham as their World Champion. On November 8, 1979 Graham lost the belt to [[Jerry Lawler]] in Lexington, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kentucky Fried Rasslin|title=Jerry Lawler Defeats Superstar Graham for CWA World Title|date=2017-09-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5CINmEafIc|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His following NWA engagements in Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Texas became fewer and rarer until he stopped wrestling in April 1980. Graham wrestled only two matches (one in Canada and one in Los Angeles) in the whole of 1981. He spent some time competing in Japan, where he added some martial arts techniques to his repertoire.&lt;ref name=goodbadugly/&gt;

=== Second return to WWF (1982–1983) ===
Graham returned to the now renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in September 1982. He debuted in the promotion with entirely new look: lean, with a [[Head shaving|bald]] head and mustache, and sporting black karate pants. Graham later stated that he wanted to retire the "Superstar" character out of frustration with Vince McMahon Sr. for not letting him become a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/interviews/sbgraham/sbgraham_03.htm|title=Superstar Billy Graham|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Gateway|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217215217/http://midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/interviews/sbgraham/sbgraham_03.htm|archivedate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his return, he attacked Backlund, destroying his championship belt.&lt;ref name=goodbadugly/&gt; He challenged Backlund for the WWF Championship, but was unable to win the title.&lt;ref name=Canoe/&gt;&lt;ref name=goodbadugly/&gt; He left the promotion in April 1983.&lt;ref name=results83&gt;{{cite web|title=Ring Results: 1983|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/83.htm|accessdate=2015-08-25|first=Graham|last=Cawthon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to AWA and second return to NWA (1983–1986) ===
Graham signed up with the AWA again in October 1983, wrestling mainly in the Mid West. By the following year he had regained his earlier body weight and in April 1984 he began his NWA run with [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], first as a member of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]'s Army of Darkness and later as the group's opponent after he tired of Sullivan's abuse of his valet [[Nancy Benoit|Fallen Angel]] and stopped Sullivan from beating her at ringside. From November 1984 Graham joined [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (Mid-Atlantic Wrestling) in North Carolina, working for [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]] in his [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] against [[Jimmy Valiant]]. It was during this stint, in the summer of 1985, that Graham bulked up further, and returned to his tie-dyed look, growing a full goatee and dyeing the mustache blond.&lt;ref name=Canoe/&gt;

=== Third return to the WWF (1986–1989) ===
Graham returned to the WWF one more time in June 1986, now as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]. After a few appearances, it was diagnosed in August that he required a hip replacement. The footage of Graham's hip replacement surgery was shown on WWF TV on September 27 as a means of promoting his comeback. He returned in mid-1987 and worked a heavy schedule from mid July to late October, feuding with [[Harley Race]] and [[Butch Reed]]. However, the strain on his hip as well as his ankles also deteriorating proved to be too much. In Syracuse on October 27, the [[One Man Gang]] supposedly retired him from active competition permanently with a [[Body Splash|running splash]] on the concrete floor after Graham's win over Reed. In this incident, aired on the November 14, 1987 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', [[Don Muraco]] came to Graham's aid, and Graham subsequently became Muraco's manager. Graham's last wrestling match, also against [[Butch Reed]] and at 44 years of age, actually took place on November 7, 1987, in St Louis, Missouri. Over the next year, in between bouts of surgery, Graham worked for the WWF as a commentator.&lt;ref name=Canoe/&gt;

=== Fourth return to WWE (2004–2009) ===
On March 14, 2004, Graham was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]], the night before ''[[WrestleMania XX]]'', by then-[[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Triple H]], whom Graham had helped inspire to become a professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Graham later sold his WWE Hall of Fame ring to purchase anti-rejection medications to help treat his liver transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article1006867.shtml |title=WWE legend selling his Hall of Fame ring on eBay  |author= |date=July 15, 2009 |website=ProWrestling.net |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later, Graham joined WWE on a swing of nine televised events where he was interviewed by [[Jonathan Coachman]] (on December 28) before performing a skit which ended with Coachman getting knocked out.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; On February 25, 2005, Graham appeared at another live event and was again interviewed by Coachman before knocking him out.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Three days later, Graham appeared on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', where he encouraged [[Randy Orton]] to do something to make himself notable.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; On October 3 at ''[[WWE Homecoming]]'', Graham participated in a Legends Ceremony with 24 other WWE legends.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; On the January 23, 2006 episode of ''Raw'', he promoted his book and DVD.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Graham parted ways with WWE in 2009.&lt;ref name=olafo /&gt;

===Fifth return to WWE (2015–present)===
In November 2015, Graham announced that he had signed a legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) in a [[Facebook]] post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superstar Billy Graham returns to the WWE with Legends Contract|publisher=Digital Spy|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/wwe/news/a772945/superstar-billy-graham-returns-to-the-wwe-with-legends-contract/|accessdate=November 9, 2015|date=November 5, 2015|first=Justin|last=Harp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Roberta Morgan's 1979 kayfabe book ''Main Event'' wrote, "Although he is a rule bender, [Graham] has managed to stay very popular with the fans, probably because of his skill, strength, and colorful personality". As a headliner in [[Madison Square Garden]], which was the WWF's primary arena throughout his tenure, Graham sold out 19 of 20 shows.&lt;ref name=Cage/&gt;

Many wrestlers have based their looks and styles on Billy Graham. Some examples are [[Ric Flair]], [[Austin Idol]], [[Scott Steiner]], [[Triple H]], [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canoe/&gt; Graham was also famous for his characteristic use of the word "brother" in his promos, referring to either commentators or fellow wrestlers. This stems from his background attending [[evangelical]] [[revival meetings]], where everybody referred to each other as "brother" or "sister" (in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]). Graham's use of the word caught on, and since then countless wrestlers have also used "brother" in their own respective promos, most notably [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NetNewsledger|title=Who is Superstar Billy Graham?|first=Devon|last=Nicholson|url=http://www.netnewsledger.com/2013/01/19/who-is-superstar-billy-graham/|date=2013-01-19|accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham has often lectured young athletes on the dangers of steroids.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/1997/04/08/superstar-billy-graham-turned-life-around/|first=Mike|last=Mooneyham|publisher=The Wrestling Gospel According to Mike Mooneyham|title="Superstar" Billy Graham Turned Life Around|date=1997-04-08|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|title="Superstar" Billy Graham|first=Steve|last=Slagle|publisher=Professional Wrestling Online Museum|accessdate=2015-08-22|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/billygraham3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''Tangled Ropes'', was released by WWE on January 10, 2006.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; WWE also released a DVD about Graham's career, titled ''20 Years Too Soon: The "Superstar" Billy Graham Story''.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Graham had a new DVD released in 2013 through Hannibal Pro Wrestling and Seriocity Productions titled ''"Superstar" Billy Graham: Full Disclosure''.

== Disputes with the McMahons ==
In the early 1990s US federal agents were investigating Dr. George Zahorian, a Harrisburg, [[Pennsylvania]] physician who had been dispensing [[anabolic steroids]] and other drugs to [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) wrestlers at WWF events. In 1991 Dr. Zahorian was convicted under the US federal [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] of 1988 which prohibited the prescription of steroids for non-therapeutic purposes. This led to WWF owner [[Vince McMahon|Vince McMahon Jr.]], who admitted to being a steroid user himself, being put on trial on charges of steroid distribution in 1994. The trial concluded with McMahon's acquittal. During this time Graham personally sued Zahorian and the WWF, claiming that they had forced him to take steroids to maintain his position in the company. His lawsuit was unsuccessful, partly because he had been using steroids for a decade preceding his WWF debut.&lt;ref name=olafo /&gt;  Recalling the lawsuit on a 2003 episode of ''[[WWE Confidential]]'', he attributed the litigation to his bitterness and claimed that he was an innovator of steroid use in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news/1063637662.shtml| title= Full WWE Confidential Results – 9/13/03 – Superstar Billy Graham Part II|last=Sutton|first=David|date=September 15, 2003|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham went on a public awareness campaign regarding the dangers of steroids during this time, including an appearance with McMahon on ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'' in 1992. During the ''Donahue'' taping Graham claimed to have witnessed WWF officials [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abuse children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1992-03-30/news/2834529_1_mcmahons-wwf-superstar-billy-graham |title=Tv Guests Say Boy Molested At Pro-wrestling|date=March 30, 1992|last=Blangger|first=Tim|work= The Morning Call|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon claimed the abuse had never taken place, and Graham later admitted that he made up the allegations, hoping to extort "hush money" out of the WWF.&lt;ref name=olafo /&gt; In his autobiography, Graham describes making the allegations as being "my most shameful moment, not only in the wrestling profession, but in my life".&lt;ref name="dob"/&gt; Graham wrote an apology to McMahon but received no response until his 2002 liver transplant.&lt;ref name=olafo /&gt;

Five years after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, Graham was released from his consultancy position in [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]. He sold his Hall of Fame ring on [[eBay]] to help pay for medical bills and requested that he be entirely removed from the Hall of Fame after [[Abdullah the Butcher]] was inducted. Graham complained that Abdullah had never wrestled in the promotion.&lt;ref name="hofring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2536396/Superstar-Billy-Graham-sells-his-WWE-Hall-of-Fame-ring-on-eBay.html| title=You can shove your ring, Vince|last=Aldren|first=Mike|date=July 15, 2009|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|title=Superstar Graham would spit on Jericho's grave, wants out of WWE HOF|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2011/04/08/17929556.html|work=SLAM!

Graham spoke out against [[Linda McMahon]] during her [[Linda McMahon U.S. Senate campaign, 2010|2010 Senate campaign]], claiming that she was distancing herself from the racy programming that she profited from while acting as CEO for WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.courant.com/2009-11-18/news/09111812259617_1_vince-mcmahon-linda-mcmahon-wrestling |title=Former Wrestler Takes On Mcmahon |date=November 18, 2009 |last=Keating|first=Christopher|work= Hartford Courant|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning that his liver condition had worsened, Graham reached out to apologize to the McMahons, even offering to be a spokesman for Linda McMahon's campaign.&lt;ref name=olafo /&gt;

In July 2015, Graham sent a letter to Vince McMahon requesting to take the position of [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], who had recently died, at [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. Graham received criticism from fans due to his timing and opportunism. He defended himself, calling his critics "evil, sub humans", and compared a possible reconciliation with McMahon to that of long-time WWE critic [[Bruno Sammartino]], who reconciled with McMahon and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2013)|class of 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gryboski|first=Michael|title=Retired wrestler Superstar Graham seeking job with WWE|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/retired-pro-wrestler-superstar-billy-graham-seeking-job-with-wwe-141096/|work=Christian Post|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
As stated in his autobiography ''Tangled Ropes'', Graham and his wife Valerie, whom he married in 1978, were never able to have children. Graham has two children from a previous marriage to Madelyn Miluso.&lt;ref name=tr125/&gt; His daughter Capella was born on June 8, 1972.&lt;ref name=tr125&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after a star he read about in the ''Atlas of the Universe''.&lt;ref name=tr125/&gt; His son Joey was born on March 18, 1975.&lt;ref name=tr160&gt;''Tangled Ropes'', p. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt; Joey was born with double pneumonia and an enlarged heart, which was later surgically corrected.&lt;ref name=tr160/&gt; His godfather was wrestler [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=tr160/&gt;

=== Health ===
Graham received a liver transplant in 2002 from a 26-year-old female donor, who had died in a car crash.&lt;ref name="Mooneyham2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2010/dec/05/superstar-graham-says-end-near/ |title=Superstar Graham says end is near |date=December 5, 2010 |last=Mooneyham |first=Mike |work=[[The Post and Courier]] |accessdate=May 23, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527074151/http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2010/dec/05/superstar-graham-says-end-near/|archivedate=May 27, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham's liver was in the [[cirrhosis]] stage at the time of his transplant.

'''The Assassins''' were a masked professional wrestling [[tag team]] from the 1960s to the 1980s. [[Jody Hamilton]], the original Assassin, was a member throughout the various incarnations of the team, teaming with Tom Renesto, Roger Smith, [[Randy Colley]] and [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]] while donning the masks.

==Career==
The team had its origins in 1961 in the [[Georgia Championship Wrestling|Georgia territory]], when Hamilton, a five-year veteran, first began competing in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] as the Assassin. Shortly afterward, Tom Renesto arrived in the area and began teaming with Hamilton to form the original Assassins team.

Hamilton and Renesto became a well-traveled heel tandem through the 1960s, competing in the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic territory]], Georgia, [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Florida]], California, Arizona, the [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling|Pacific Northwest]], Canada, Japan and Australia among other areas, and winning championship gold along the way. They returned to Georgia in 1968 and competed in that state primarily until 1974; they spent most of their time competing in Georgia Championship Wrestling during that period, but they also went to work for an independent group called the All-South Wrestling Alliance, with Hamiilton going solo in the beginning while Renesto worked behind the scenes, then facing off in opposite corners from each other, then reuniting as babyfaces before All-South closed in late 1974.

After Renesto retired from the ring, Hamilton continued The Assassins with new partners in later years, teaming up with Roger Smith and then Randy Colley, before forming the 1980s version of the masked team with Hercules Hernandez in Jim Crockett Promotions, under the management of [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]], who used them as part of his feud with the popular [[Jimmy Valiant]]. That version of the team lasted until Hernandez was unmasked after losing to Valiant in a mask vs. hair match at a JCP/[[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] show in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] on April 15, 1984. Hamilton continued on solo after Hernandez left JCP, breaking his ties with Jones to turn babyface once again and feud with his former manager, which climaxed with Hamilton teaming with [[Buzz Tyler]] to beat Jones' Zambuie Express ([[Leroy Brown (wrestler)|Elijah Akeem]] and [[Ray Candy|Kareem Muhammed]]) at [[Starrcade#1984|Starrcade 1984]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].

==Post-wrestling==
Jody Hamilton wound down his in-ring career in the Alabama territory competing under a different identity as The Flame before starting up his own promotion in Georgia, [[Deep South Wrestling]], in 1986, which he ran for about two years before selling the promotion. He then opened up the [[WCW Power Plant|Power Plant]] as a training facility for [[World Championship Wrestling]] and was last seen reprising his Assassin role as the manager of Pretty Wonderful ([[Paul Orndorff]] and [[Paul Roma]]) in WCW in 1994. Hamilton reopened [[Deep South Wrestling]] in 2005 to serve as a developmental territory for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], but WWE severed its developmental deal with DSW on April 18, 2007, and Hamilton continued running the promotion on his own as an independent until he folded DSW shortly after its October 11, 2007 event.

Tom Renesto retired from wrestling in 1974. On April 25, 2000, Renesto died at 72 years old. 

Randy Colley went on to form [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]] tag team (as Moondog Rex), which competed in the then-WWF and in the [[Continental Wrestling Association|Memphis area]], and he was also the original [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] Smash. He also competed in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] as the masked Nightmare, wearing the same mask he had as one of the Assassins. He retired in 1996.

Roger Smith went on to fame in Memphis in the mid-1980s under the ring name Dirty Rhodes (for his resemblance to [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] in both appearance and mannerisms), both as a heel and a babyface. He has also since retired.

Hercules Hernandez went on to fame under that name in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], Florida, the WWF and Japan, as the masked Mr. Wrestling III in Mid-South, and as the masked Super Invader in WCW. He died in his sleep of a heart  attack in [[Tampa, Florida]] on March 6, 2004 at age 47.

Jim Ross stated that the Masked Assassins "were the greatest tag team that [he] ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Jimm |url=http://www.jrsbarbq.com/blog/heyman-msgmsg-memory-jrmichaelcolefav-tag-teambest-all-around-star-everwwe-hall-fameorder-jrs-p |title=Heyman in MSG..MSG Memory for JR..@MichaelCole..Fav Tag Team..Best All Around Star Ever..WWE Hall of Fame..Order JR's Products |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Crime Book (Big Ideas Simply Explained)''''' is a non-fiction volume co-authored by American crime writers [[Cathy Scott]], [[Shanna Hogan]], [[Rebecca Morris (author)|Rebecca Morris]], Canadian author and [[historian]] [[Lee Mellor]], and United Kingdom author Michael Kerrigan, with a foreword for the U.S. edition by Scott and the U.K. edition by crime-fiction author [[Peter James (writer)|Peter James]]. It was released by [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Books]] under its [[Big Ideas Learning]] imprint in May 2017.

==Synopsis==
The publisher describes ''The Crime Book'' as a guide to criminology that explores the most infamous cases of all time, from serial killers to mob hits to war crimes and more.

It includes a variety of crimes committed by more than 100 of the world's most notorious criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimetime.co.uk/mag/index.php/showarticle/4787|title=crimetime.co.uk - The Crime Book To Be Published By Dorling Kindersley|author=|date=|publisher=Crime Time News}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Jack the Ripper]] to [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], the book is a study of international true-crime history that covers shocking stories through infographics and research that lays out key facts and details. It examines the science, psychology and sociology of criminal behavior. It profiles of villains, victims and detectives. Each clue is listed for readers to follow investigations from start to finish, and studies the police and detective work for each case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgnradio.com/2017/05/02/cathy-scott-the-crime-book/|title=Cathy Scott: ‘The Crime Book’|author=|date=2 May 2017|website=wgnradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Q&amp;A article for CrimeCon's blog with Scott, the author described the crimes detailed in the book as having "such diversity that there is something for everyone. ...  I can’t think of one crime that’s not represented in The Crime Book. It runs the gamut—from nonviolent cons to gangland-style criminals, to white-collar offenders—with a complete representation starting with the first known homicide committed against a Neanderthal man. Simply put, you can’t make this stuff up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimecon.com/blog/2017/4/9/the-crime-book-qa-with-author-cathy-scott|title=The Crime Book Q&amp;A with Author Cathy Scott|author=|date=9 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's description, in an August 2017 interview with co-author Scott about the book, wrote that it is "an encyclopedic treatment of the topic (that) makes for excellent companion reading. A compelling compilation of human trickery and awfulness, it covers crimes from arson, art forgery and kidnapping to bank robbery, drug trafficking and, of course, murder, with many of the entries accompanied by helpful illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/crime-book-what-we-learned-from-giant-history-of-true-crime-w496295|title='The Crime Book': What We Learned from Giant History of True Crime|author=Phoebe Neidl
|date=August 22, 2017|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Reader's Digest]]'' listed it as one of its "Best New Books You Should Read This April," describing it as "everything you ever wanted to know about some of the most audacious, hideous, hilarious and mysterious acts of crime in one explosive book, filled with graphs, illustrations, quotes and timelines. This highly addictive encyclopedia of crime ... is a trivia goldmine and a helpful guide allowing you to put events into context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/books/book-lists/best-new-books-you-should-read-april|title=Best new books you should read this April|author=|date=|publisher=Reader's Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Culture Magazine]]'' in Germany had this to say: "The level of expertise is quite high," noting that the book "is lushly illustrated, readable and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturmag.de/rubriken/buecher/bloody-chops-april-2017/100665|title=Bloody Chops - April 2017 - CulturMag|author=|date=15 April 2017|publisher=Culture Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review, ''Crime Fiction Lover'' wrote that "a crack team of true-crime experts helped put it together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2017/03/first-look-the-crime-book-from-dorling-kindersley/|title=First look: The Crime Book from Dorling Kindersley » CRIME FICTION LOVER|author=|date=March 2017|website=www.crimefictionlover.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crimespree Magazine'' wrote, "The crimes covered are all over from serial killers to gangsters and outlaws to kidnappers and elderly Brit bank robbers. This is a great book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimespreemag.com/trio-non-fiction-crime-books/|title=A Trio Of Great Non-Fiction Crime Books|author=|date=12 April 2017|publisher=Crimespree Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trailblazer Travel Books''' a series of five recreational guides for the [[Hawaiian Islands]] plus one each for [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and [[San Francisco]]. They are published by California-based Diamond Valley Company and written by Janine and Jerry Sprout. In 2012, they published "No Worries Paris: A Photographic Walking Guide." Janine Sprout is of French heritage and has photographed the city over a period of decades. 

It should not be confused with the UK travel book publisher [[Trailblazer (travel)|Trailblazer]].

The guides are aimed at the independent, adventurous travelers. The Sprouts have spent years developing the content and publish revised or new editions yearly. Aside from being well-organized resources for travelers, Trailblazers seek to support the economy based around cultural sites and recreational resources, thereby helping to preserve them. 

The books are comprehensive when it comes to outdoor muscle-powered sports—hiking, biking, skiing, kayaking, snorkeling, and surfing. They also include historic town strolls, gardens, museums, popular tourist attractions, and archeological sites. Trailblazers also include standard guidebook fare, such as accommodations and restaurants, though they tend to limit this section to the top places. More than 200 photos and maps illustrate the text. They also publish, ''No Worries Hawaii'', a vacation planning guide for Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and the Big Island, which, among other things, includes a "self-test" that allows readers unfamiliar with the Islands to select the locale that works best for them. 

==Future Editions==
In 2013, they published "Lifeguide: How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be," the company's first venture into the self-help genre. Also in the works is "No Worries Portland: A Photographic Walking Guide." Jerry Sprout is an Oregon native.

==Authors==
The Sprouts have traveled the American West together for more than thirty years. Janine, of French descent, is an award-winning photographer and a graphic designer whose work has included [[Harry Potter]] licensed products. She studied at [[UC Davis]], California College of Arts and Crafts, Universita de Bella Arte ([[Perugia]]), and [[Oregon School of Arts &amp; Crafts]]. She also headed the Nevada State Museum's public information department. Jerry is a [[Stanford]] graduate (football scholarship) who worked as a newspaper reporter in [[San Rafael, California]]. He is a former licensed psychologist who evaluated youth programs for several California counties, and later was an administrator at the largest private program for high-risk male juvenile offenders.  His novel, ''American Boys Camp'', was purchased by [[Universal Studios]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">'''Universal Bibliographic Control''' (UBC) was a concept championed by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA). Under the theoretical UBC, any document would only be cataloged once in its country of origin, and that record would then be available for the use of any library in the world.

During the 1970s, IFLA established an office for Universal Bibliographic Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Statement on Universal Bibliographic Control|url=http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/bibliography/Documents/IFLA%20Professional%20Statement%20on%20UBC.pdf|website=IFLA|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunsire, Hillman, Phipps, and Willer have suggested that [[Semantic Web]] technologies, including [[BIBFRAME]] may allow UBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunsire|first1=Gordon|last2=Hillmann|first2=Diane|last3=Phipps|first3=Jon|title=Reconsidering Universal Bibliographic Control in Light of the Semantic Web|journal=Journal of Library Metadata|date=April 2012|volume=12|issue=2-3|pages=164–176|doi=10.1080/19386389.2012.699831|url=https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/36288/JLMPaperPrePub.pdf?sequence=2|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunsire|first1=Gordon|last2=Willer|first2=Mirna|title=The local in the global: universal bibliographic control from the bottom up|date=June 2014|url=http://library.ifla.org/817/1/086-dunsire-en.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
