'''Professor A. Dakshinamurthy''' (born 10 April 1938 in Neduvakkottai, [[Mannargudi Taluk]], [[Thiruvarur district]], Tamil Nadu, [[India]])  is 
an eminent [[Tamil language|Tamil]] scholar, writer, and an English translator of classical, medieval and modern Tamil literature. He is a pioneer in the field of translation of Classical Tamil works. He is best known for his complete and faithful English translations of 19 ancient classical Tamil literature for the very first time in history between the period of 1999-2012. The Government of India honored him with the Presidential Award for lifetime achievement in Classical Tamil, 'The Tolkappiyar Award' for the year 2015.

== Career ==
Dr. A. Dakshinamurthy became interested in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] studies under Tamil luminaries such as Dr.T.P. Meenakshisundaran and Mahavidwan S. Dhandapani Desikar. 

He started his career in 1962 at V. S. Boys High school, Thiruvarur. Since then, he has served in many institutions like the [[A. V. C. College|A. V. C College]], [[Mayiladuthurai]], A. V. V. M Sri Pushpam college, Poondi and the [[Madurai Tamil Sangam]], Madurai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ATatcina%CC%84mu%CC%84rtti%2C+A.&amp;qt=hot_author|title=Results for 'au:Tatcināmūrtti, A.' [WorldCat.org]|publisher=orldcat.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in [[Thanjavur]], Tamil Nadu.

His first publication was a scholarly book in the Tamil language entitled, ''Tamilar Nagarikamum Panpadum'' ({{lang-ta|தமிழர் நாகரிகமும் பண்பாடும்}}). It pointed out all aspects of Tamil culture, civilization and development from the ancient Sangam period to the contemporary age. The work has remained popular since its publication in 1973 and has been reprinted several times.

His Ph. D dissertation '''Sanga Ilakkiyangal Unarthum Manitha Uravugal'(1997)'', which was published as a book in 2001 deals elaborately with all the kinships between men and women, rulers and the ruled, parents and children, masters and servants, crowned kings and the chiefs, patrons and bards including poets, individuals and the society, based on cultural anthropology.

His first translation work, "The Poems of [[Bharathidasan]] – A Translation", was recognized and honored by the [[government of Tamil Nadu]] during the centenary celebrations of the poet in 1991 and inspired him to start working in the field of translation. His first major translation work was the Sangam literature [[Akanaṉūṟu|Akananuru]] in 1999, which is the first full translation of all the 400 poems of the literature.

His translation of the Sangam anthology Natrinai (2001), is the first faithful translation of the classic. He gave the second complete translation of the Sangam work Kuruntokai in 2007, after 31 years since the first work by the duo ''M. Shanmugham Pillai'' and ''David Luden'' appeared in 1976. He gave the second complete translation of all the ten books belonging to the Pattuppaattu collection in 2012, after a wide gap of 66 years since the first translation by J. V. Chellaih appeared in 1946. Six books from the Patinenkilkanakku division published in 2010, are the first and the only complete translations of the classics available. 

He has written several scholarly research articles on language, literature, history, culture, place names, personal names and the art of translation. He has established in his research that among the early Tamil society, cross cousin marriage was the order and love between a girl and a boy drawn from two different geographical regions was not treated in the Sangam classics; he has proved that the word “நும் (Num)” was derived from “நிம் (Nim)”, an idea which is in contrast to Tholkappiyam which says "நும் (Num)" is the source for the word “நீயிர் (Neeyir)”; he has established that the one lettered words, ‘ஆ (Aa), மா (Maa), பா (Paa), நீ (Nee), etc., were once two lettered and in course of time had lost the final nasal consonant which are a few noteworthy findings.

Having served as a teacher for 33 years in various institutions in [[Tamil Nadu]], he retired in 1996 as the principal of the Senthamizh Arts College, [[Madurai Tamil Sangam]], Madurai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciil-classicaltamil.org/pdfs/nc-2ndmeet.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705153711/http://www.ciil-classicaltamil.org/pdfs/nc-2ndmeet.pdf |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==

'''Agnes Ravatn''' (born 8 February 1983 in [[Ølen]]) is a Norwegian novelist, columnist and journalist.

She debuted in 2007 with the novel ''Veke 53'' ('Week 53').
Ravatn is a columnist and journalist for [[Nynorsk]] newspaper ''[[Dag og Tid]]''. A series of essays for the publication were released in 2009 as ''Stillstand'' ('Standstill'). In 2011 came her second books of essays, "Folkelesnad", on Norwegian magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/node/89187|title=Hverdagsheltinne|last=Kleppo|first=Kristine|date=22 May 2009|work=ABC Nyheter|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 she published the highly acclaimed novel "Fugletribunalet" ("The Bird Tribunal"), which has been released in eleven countries, including Great Britain, Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/no/samlaget/pressreleases/stor-interesse-for-agnes-ravatn-i-utlandet-2324745|title=Stor interesse for Agnes Ravatn|work=Mynewsdesk.com|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel has been adapted for theatre, and played for over two years at [[Det norske teatret]]. It is currently being made into a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://framtida.no/2016/10/19/agnes-ravatn-fugletribunalet-blir-film|title=Agnes Ravatn: - "Fugletribunalet blir film"|work=Framtida.no|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation, by Rosie Hedger, was the first translated novel to be part of the «Fresh Talent»-program of booksellers [[WHSmith]], and is nominated for the [[International Dublin Literary Award]] for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dublinliteraryaward.ie/nominees/the-bird-tribunal/|title=The Bird Tribunal||work=The DUBLIN Literary Award|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[Valevåg]] in [[Sunnhordland]], western Norway, Ravatn wrote the autobiographical "Verda er ein skandale" ("The World Is a Scandal") in 2017. The book is both a depiction of her family moving to a small, derelict farm in the countryside, and an interview with neighbour and fellow author [[Einar Økland]]. The chapters of the book were originally published as articles in [[Dag og Tid]]

In 2003 Syidah Mateen (a computer analyst for radiology clinics, born in 1964) was a witness set to testify in a domestic violence protective order hearing, before Guilford District Judge Tom Jarrell.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news| title=Quran-in-court case can advance, state panel rules|author=Gary D.

North Carolina's state law "allows witnesses preparing to testify in court to take their oath in three ways: by laying a hand over 'the Holy Scriptures', by saying 'so help me God' without the use of a religious book, or by an affirmation using no religious symbols".&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; 

When told that there was no Qur'an in the courthouse Mateen's testimony was allowed after she agreed to affirm that she would be truthful.&lt;ref name="Yonat"/&gt;

While Mateen claims that Judge Jarrell told her that "all the courtrooms needed copies of the Quran", Jarrell maintains he told her only that "he would look into the legality of such oaths if she wanted to bring a Quran in the future".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;

==Attempted donation rebuffed==
Mateen's parents had converted to Islam in the early 1960s while living in [[Flint, Michigan]]. After moving to North Carolina, her father, L'Fatihah Mateen, established the Al-Ummil Ummat Islamic Center in Greensboro and served as its prayer leader (he died in 1997). In 2005 Syidah Mateen, not realizing that the lack of a Qur'an for oaths at the courthouse might be mandated by law, joined with other Muslim-American's at the Al-Ummil Ummat Islamic Center "to donate copies of the Qur'an to [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford County's]] two courthouses".&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; The Center's [[imam]], Charles Abdullah "working through a judicial assistant, was prepared to hand over the Qurans",&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; but two Guilford judges declined to accept the texts, saying "an oath on the Qur'an is not a legal oath under state law".&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt;
 
In [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], the lawyer for North Carolina's Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) issued a preliminary opinion that said "that state law allows people to be sworn in using a Quran rather than a Bible".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; This was refuted by Guilford County's Senior Resident Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright who sets policy for the county's nine Superior Court courtrooms. Judge Albright stated flatly "An oath on the Quran is not a lawful oath under our law."&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; He maintained that the statute means the Bible and that if that is to be changed it is up to the North Carolina Legislature, "It's gotten way out there: They've got everything from the [[Book of Mormon]] to the Book of [[Wicca]] on the list. Our position is that the statute governs not only the type of oath, but the manner and administration of the oath, and that it's now a legislative matter to straighten out."&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0720/p02s02-usju.html|title= Raise your right hand and swear to tell the truth ... on the Koran?|date= 2005-07-20 | author= Patrik Jonsson |publisher= The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=January 22, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070121074749/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0720/p02s02-usju.html| archivedate= 21 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Guilford Chief District Judge Joseph E. Turner "told [Imam] Abdullah that he could not accept the Qurans for the courtrooms".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; After the Judges' statements the AOC's spokesman Dick Ellis said "We are not aware of any courtroom that has ever allowed anybody to swear on anything but the Bible."&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; Judge Jarrell the presiding officer in the case where Mateen testified did not make any comment but "deferred any decision to the judges that set courtroom policy".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; Judge Turner did ask Imam Abdullah to "donate a copy of the Quran to the law libraries in the county's two courthouses" which the imam did.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; 

In an interview with reporters on the matter Mateen stated "This is a diverse world, and everybody does not worship or believe the same. We'll just have to get in touch with the right people and determine our next move."&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; It was added that Mateen "worries that people might consider her testimony less credible if they see her unwilling to swear on a holy text".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;

==State law at issue==
North Carolina's oath-taking practices "date to 1777 but have evolved over the years".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; North Carolina's legislature first passed the oath-taking statutes in 1777. At that time, the title of the statute was "Administration of oath upon the Gospels". In 1985 the word "Gospels" was replaced by the term "Holy Scriptures".&lt;ref name="Yonat"/&gt; 

Currently the North Carolina General statute on oath taking (§11-2) states: (emphasis added) "Judges and other persons who may be empowered to administer oaths, shall (except in the cases in this Chapter excepted) '''require the party to be sworn to lay his hand upon the Holy Scriptures''', in token of his engagement to speak the truth and in further token that, if he should swerve from the truth, he may be justly deprived of all the blessings of the holy book and made liable to that vengeance which he has imprecated on his own head."&lt;ref name="ACLU Comp"&gt;{{cite web|title= Complaint and Request for Declarative Judgement| url= https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/nc_complaint.pdf|format=PDF|author=ACLU|date=July 2005 |accessdate=January 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1985 amendments to N.C.G.S. § 11-2, the statutory section read that Judges shall "require the party sworn to lay his hand upon the Holy [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]] of Almighty God".&lt;ref name="ACLU Comp"/&gt;

==CAIR's comments==
When it was announced that the Qur'an was not to be allowed for swearing before testimony, the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) issued a press statement, "By stating that only one book qualifies as 'Holy Scriptures', the court may be making an inappropriate endorsement of a single set of religious beliefs. Eliminating the opportunity to swear an oath on one's own holy text may also have the effect of diminishing the credibility of that person's testimony." CAIR's Legal Director [[Arsalan Iftikhar]] said "CAIR will offer a free copy of the Quran to any judge in North Carolina or throughout the United States for use in oaths or for personal awareness of the holy text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2005-06-21|title=CAIR asks N.C.

==Interfaith support for allowing Qur'an oaths==
On July 6, 2005, a group of more than 20 religious leaders from the Guilford  County area, "including those of [[Christian]], [[Jewish]] and [[Buddhist]] faiths", sent a letter to Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright, who said an oath on the Quran is not lawful. The letter noted that "North Carolina is an increasingly diverse place and says that religious differences need to be respected." It went on to say "In North Carolina, we continue to be people who take our religious beliefs and practices very seriously. But we no longer live in the [[Bible Belt]]. Today, we live in the [[Bible]]-[[Talmud]]-[[Qur'an]]-[[Veda]]-[[Dhammapada]]-[[Guru Granth Sahib]]-[[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Kitabi Iqan]] Belt. It is imperative for our civic leaders, school teachers, judges, and law enforcers to appreciate and respect the religious differences found in our population."&lt;ref name="Hardin"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://archives2005.ghazali.net/html/faith_leaders_support.html|title= North Carolina faith leaders supporting Quran oath|author= Jason Hardin|publisher= News &amp; Record North Carolina|date= 2005-07-06|access-date= 2007-01-23|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722173617/http://archives2005.ghazali.net/html/faith_leaders_support.html|archive-date= 2011-07-22|dead-url= yes|df= }} Reprinted by ''American Muslim Perspective'', Retrieved on January 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case "struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted". He asked Christians to imagine what it would be like to live in a place where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying "That just feels like a slap in the face."&lt;ref name="Hardin"/&gt; Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said "I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro."&lt;ref name="Hardin"/&gt; The superintendent of the Greensboro District of the United Methodist Church, Rev. Frank Stith, said "it makes sense for people to be able to use a book that means something to them", explaining "The point is to have something that stands behind someone's word."&lt;ref name="Hardin"/&gt;

==ACLU involvement==
The North Carolina chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] became involved when on June 28, 2005 they called on the AOC to "adopt a policy allowing the use of the Quran and other religious texts for the swearing of oaths in court proceedings".&lt;ref name="ACLU-Dec16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/breakingnews.html|title=ACLU-NC Wins North Carolina Court of Appeals Ruling Allowing Religious Discrimination Challenge to Be Heard|date=2007-01-16|publisher=ACLU |accessdate=January 22, 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; When on July 14, 2005 the state Administrative Office of the Courts declined to intervene (indicating "that either the legislature or a court ruling would have to decide this question"&lt;ref name="ACLU-Dec16"/&gt;) the ACLU took the issue to court.&lt;ref name="Dec 2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051209/NEWSREC0101/512080330 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711214534/http://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051209%2FNEWSREC0101%2F512080330 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-11 |title=Judge throws out Quran suit |author=Eric Collins |date=2005-12-09 |publisher=News-Record |accessdate=January 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005 they argued in court that "the term 'Holy Scriptures' appearing in the statute refers not only to the Christian Bible, but also to other religious texts including, but not limited to, the Quran, the [[Old Testament]], and the [[Bhagavad-Gita]]".&lt;ref name="Yonat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACLU Comp"/&gt; The ACLU argued that since in 1985 "the term 'Gospels' was eliminated from the section [on oaths] and the term 'Holy Evangelists of Almighty God' was changed to 'Holy Scriptures', the message sent by the Legislature was clear: no longer would the Christian Bible be the only religious text which could be used in a swearing ceremony.

Erik Stanley, a lawyer for the Christian law group ''[[Liberty Counsel]]'' claimed the suit "was not simply intended to include other faiths". He went on to say: "The ACLU is not attempting to bring accommodation. That already exists. They're trying to erase history. Courtroom oaths have always been done on the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scriptures Lawsuit Places Focus on Pluralism in America |last=Helguero |first=Francis |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/scriptures-lawsuit-places-focus-on-pluralism-in-america-21222/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731140914/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050729/21222.htm |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=May 31, 2018 |dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==December 2005 ruling==
On December 5, 2005, Superior Court Judge Donald L. Smith (serving as an emergency judge) heard arguments on the case in a hearing that lasted less than half an hour.  Lawyers on both sides were given seven and one-half minutes to make their case and no witnesses were heard.&lt;ref name="Dec. 6"/&gt; Assistant Attorney General Grady L. Balentine Jr.  argued "that state oath-taking law is constitutional because it allows people to affirm if they don't wish to swear on the Christian Bible. No one is required to do that, that's our only position in this case."&lt;ref name="Dec. 6"/&gt; The ACLU's attorney Seth Cohen argued that if "Holy Scriptures" is interpreted to not include non-Christian texts, then the law is unconstitutional, as "the exclusive use of the Christian Bible for courtroom oaths violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause in the U.S. Constitution".&lt;ref name="Dec. 6"/&gt; Both lawyers answered one of the Judge's questions by agreeing to "a longstanding legal tradition: When a law is susceptible to multiple interpretations, a judge should always rely on the interpretation that makes the law constitutional."&lt;ref name="Dec. 6"/&gt;

In his ruling Judge Smith dismissed Mateen's case, in part "because Mateen was able to testify that day, no legal controversy remained".&lt;ref name="Yonat"/&gt; Judge Smith "did not address whether state law allows people to use non-Christian texts for oath-taking, the main issue the ACLU wanted resolved".&lt;ref name="Dec 2005"/&gt; The executive director of the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU, Jennifer Rudinger, said "it would be very difficult for a person wishing to swear on a non-Christian text to halt a courtroom proceeding to pursue a legal challenge on the issue".&lt;ref name="Dec 2005"/&gt; Mateen said "Had I known that it would be taken to this point, I wouldn't have affirmed. I could have postponed everything until they got some Qurans."&lt;ref name="Dec 2005"/&gt; The ACLU was also surprised that Judge Smith cited "lack of an actual controversy" as a reason for dismissal because Grady Balentine, the lawyer for the state attorney general's office, did not make that argument. Balentine had only argued "that the law gives people another option if they don't wish to swear on the Christian Bible".&lt;ref name="Dec 2005"/&gt;

On December 15, 2005, a week after Smith's ruling,  the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU announced they would appeal the decision. Their lawyer Seth Cohen told reporters "that the organization disagrees with the judge's finding" and that he was "confident they will win in the N.C. Court of Appeals".&lt;ref name="Dec. 16"/&gt; Cohen went on to say: "It's a shame that this matter cannot be resolved sooner. All we have ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It's that simple. We don't understand why this is such a big deal."&lt;ref name="Dec. 16"/&gt; Cohen also said that members of Judaism have thrown their support behind the case as they would like to be able to swear on the [[Tanakh]], and that this joining over the issue was one of the things "that's gotten lost in this case".&lt;ref name="Dec. 16"/&gt;

==Appeals Court ruling==
On January 16, 2007, a three-judge panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled unanimously to reverse the trial court decision that had dismissed the case.&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; The appeals court found that the issue was not moot.&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt; The Court's ruling also mentioned it received "affidavits from eight Jewish members of ACLU-NC who were residents of Guilford County and eligible for jury duty, stating they would prefer to swear on the Hebrew Bible rather than the Christian Bible if selected as jurors or asked to testify in court".&lt;ref name="AOC 12-07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/coa/opinions/2007/060062-1.htm |title=NO.

The Court reviewed the history of the case, noting that "When Ms. Mateen appeared as a witness, she requested that her oath to tell the truth be sworn on the holy text of her religious faith, the Quran. When her request was denied and because she would not swear on the Christian Bible, her options were to affirm without the use of a religious text or be denied the opportunity to testify. ... Ms. Mateen chose to affirm to tell the truth, and she now seeks a declaratory judgment determining whether, under N.C.G.S. § 11-2, she has the right to swear on her holy text, the Quran."&lt;ref name="AOC 12-07"/&gt; 

The Court held that the case should go forward, because without a court decision on the matter a conflict was unavoidable, saying "Under these circumstances, Ms. Mateen clearly demonstrated her intent to avail herself of her asserted right to swear on her religious text and her intent to litigate that right. The State has clearly demonstrated, by its refusal to permit witnesses to swear on any text other than the Christian Bible, its intent to continue the course of action; thus, its actions are not speculative [which would not merit allowing the case to go forward]. ... ACLU-NC argues that it is not a matter of 'if' one of its [8,000] members who would prefer to swear on a different religious text will be called to serve as a juror or witness, but rather it is a matter of 'when'. We agree."&lt;ref name="AOC 12-07"/&gt;

The court stressed that it was only calling for the case to go forward, and was not itself judging the cases merits, saying "The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether either plaintiff has presented a justiciable controversy in their complaint. We conclude the complaint is sufficient to entitle both plaintiffs to litigate their claims under the Declaratory Judgment Act, though we are careful to express no opinion on the merits of those claims."&lt;ref name="AOC 12-07"/&gt;

Seth Cohen, General Counsel for the N.C. ACLU stated: "We are very happy with the Court of Appeals' decision today. This is an important issue that affects thousands of people of faith across North Carolina who are not of the Christian faith, and we look forward to a hearing on the Constitutional questions raised by this case."&lt;ref name="ACLU-Dec16"/&gt;

Mateen repeated her position in an interview after the Appeals Court allowed the case to go forward, saying she always "felt like, in this day and time, that they would at least have the three major religious texts in the courtroom. If it was a Quran in the courtroom and a Christian was in there, would they want to testify on a holy Quran?"&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt;

==Attorney General's review==
The ACLU reports on its website that "The state Attorney General has 30 days [from the January 16, 2007 ruling] to decide whether to seek discretionary review by the North Carolina Supreme Court. If the North Carolina Supreme Court does not review the ruling by the Court of Appeals, then the case will go back to the superior court for a review of the Constitutional challenge to the statute."&lt;ref name="ACLU-Dec16"/&gt;

Noelle Talley spokeswoman for the state Attorney General confirmed that the office is "reviewing the ruling but hasn't decided about an appeal".&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt;

==Superior Court==
On May 24, 2007,  Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway ruled that people of non-Christian faiths must be allowed to use religious texts other than the Christian Bible when being sworn in as jurors or witnesses in state court proceedings.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-north-carolina-applauds-court-ruling-preventing-religious-discrimination-courtroom|title = ACLU of North Carolina Applauds Court Ruling Preventing Religious Discrimination in the Courtroom|date = 2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the state had 30 days to decide to appeal the ruling, it took no action.

==Views on the case==
Some have seen this matter "as the latest case of religious liberty to arise in North Carolina. In other cases, employers have been challenged to allow [[Sikhs]] to keep their beards and Muslim women to wear veils."&lt;ref name="Yonat"/&gt; [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]'s Professor of Religion, Thomas Tweed said "This North Carolina case is another example of the ways America's expanding religious diversity is coming into conflict with established practices in the public arena."&lt;ref name="Yonat"/&gt;

[[New York University]] law professor [[Noah Feldman]] said "This case is a cousin to [[Roy Moore#Early prayer.2FTen Commandments controversy|the Ten Commandments case in Alabama]], where a judge does something that's pretty obviously unconstitutional, with a goal of sending a message ... that he's for fundamental religious values."&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;

The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' noted that in contrast to Judge Albright most American judges in recent history "have apparently given other oaths wide latitude. In [[World Trade Center bombing#Impact and prosecutions|a federal terrorism case in 1997]] in [[Washington D.C.]], for instance, the judge allowed Muslim witnesses to swear to [[Allah]]. And the practice isn't new: [[Mochitsura Hashimoto]], the Japanese submarine commander who [[Charles B. McVay III#Controversy: a scapegoat|testified in the court martial of a US Navy captain]] in 1945, was allowed by a military tribunal to swear on his beliefs of [[Shinto]], the ancient religion of [[Japan]]."&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;

The ''Christian Science Monitor'' also quoted Manish Vij, a New York blogger for [[Sepia Mutiny]] who said, "The only thing more compelling [to] ... South Asian Muslims is to literally swear upon your mother's head, and mothers aren't as convenient to drag around in court as a copy of the Koran."&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;

Both of the main figures taking issue with Ellison, [[Dennis Prager]] and US Representative [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia, made sure to clarify that they were not asking for him to be banned from serving if he insisted on using a Qur'an instead of a Bible at his reenactment photo-op. In this regard the Matten case is far more significant.

One commentator laid out the likely outcome should the Matteen case not be judged on its merits, saying one day a non-Christian would appear before a North Carolina judge and would "create an impasse in court when he refuses to swear on the Bible and declines to affirm an oath, insisting he should be allowed to place his hand on the Quran or some other holy book and promise before his God to tell the truth". The judge could then "hold the uncooperative witness in contempt, in effect punishing a person who simply asks that his religious beliefs be granted the same respect as those of a Christian. ... [and] While holding the witness in contempt, the judge also could bar the testimony that would have been offered—thereby jeopardizing the case of one party or the other. ...Or the judge could let the witness testify without swearing or affirming to tell the truth. But that would invite a challenge to the validity of the testimony—another legal controversy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Other sacred texts merit place in court |url=http://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051210/NEWSREC010201/512100302/1014/NEWSREC020201 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010406/http://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051210%2FNEWSREC010201%2F512100302%2F1014%2FNEWSREC020201 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-28 |date=2005-12-10 |publisher=News-Record |access-date=2018-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18898">{{Millennium Problems}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture''' describes the set of rational solutions to equations defining an [[elliptic curve]]. It is an open problem in the field of [[number theory]] and is widely recognized as one of the most challenging mathematical problems. The conjecture was chosen as one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] listed by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]], which has offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/birch-and-swinnerton-dyer-conjecture Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture] at Clay Mathematics Institute&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after mathematicians [[Bryan Birch]] and [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]] who developed the conjecture during the first half of the 1960s with the help of machine computation. {{As of|2017}}, only special cases of the conjecture have been proved.

The modern formulation of the conjecture relates arithmetic data associated with an elliptic curve ''E'' over a [[number field]] ''K'' to the behaviour of the [[Hasse–Weil L-function|Hasse–Weil ''L''-function]] ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') of ''E'' at ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. More specifically, it is conjectured that the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the [[abelian group]] ''E''(''K'') of points of ''E'' is the order of the zero of ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') at ''s'' = 1, and the first non-zero coefficient in the [[Taylor expansion]] of ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') at ''s'' = 1 is given by more refined arithmetic data attached to ''E'' over ''K'' {{harv|Wiles|2006}}.

== Background ==
{{Harvtxt|Mordell|1922}} proved [[Mordell's theorem]]: the group of [[rational point]]s on an elliptic curve has a finite [[Generating set of a group|basis]]. This means that for any elliptic curve there is a finite sub-set of the rational points on the curve, from which all further rational points may be generated.

If the number of rational points on a curve is [[Infinite set|infinite]] then some point in a finite basis must have infinite order. The number of ''independent'' basis points with infinite order is called the [[rank of an abelian group|rank]] of the curve, and is an important [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] property of an elliptic curve.

If the rank of an elliptic curve is 0, then the curve has only a finite number of rational points. On the other hand, if the rank of the curve is greater than 0, then the curve has an infinite number of rational points.

Although Mordell's theorem shows that the rank of an elliptic curve is always finite, it does not give an effective method for calculating the rank of every curve. The rank of certain elliptic curves can be calculated using numerical methods but (in the current state of knowledge) it is unknown if these methods handle all curves.

An ''L''-function '''''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'')''' can be defined for an elliptic curve ''E'' by constructing an [[Euler product]] from the number of points on the curve modulo each [[prime number|prime]] ''p''. This ''L''-function is analogous to the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the [[Dirichlet L-series]] that is defined for a binary [[quadratic form]]. It is a special case of a [[Hasse–Weil L-function]].

The natural definition of ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') only converges for values of ''s'' in the complex plane with Re(''s'') &gt; 3/2. [[Helmut Hasse]] conjectured that ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') could be extended by [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane. This conjecture was first proved by {{Harvtxt|Deuring|1941}} for elliptic curves with [[complex multiplication]]. It was subsequently shown to be true for all elliptic curves over '''Q''', as a consequence of the [[modularity theorem]].

Finding rational points on a general elliptic curve is a difficult problem. Finding the points on an elliptic curve modulo a given prime ''p'' is conceptually straightforward, as there are only a finite number of possibilities to check. However, for large primes it is computationally intensive.

== History ==

In the early 1960s [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]] used the [[EDSAC 2|EDSAC-2]] computer at the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] to calculate the number of points modulo ''p'' (denoted by ''N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'') for a large number of primes ''p'' on elliptic curves whose rank was known. From these numerical results {{harvtxt|Birch|Swinnerton-Dyer|1965}} conjectured that ''N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a curve ''E'' with rank ''r'' obeys an asymptotic law

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\leq x} \frac{N_p}{p} \approx C\log (x)^r \mbox{ as } x \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is a constant.

Initially this was based on somewhat tenuous trends in graphical plots; this induced a measure of skepticism in [[J. W. S. Cassels]] (Birch's Ph.D. advisor).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Visions of Infinity: The Great Mathematical Problems|first=Ian|last=Stewart|authorlink=Ian Stewart (mathematician)|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn=9780465022403|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzdSy3diraUC&amp;pg=PA253|quote=Cassels was highly skeptical at first}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the numerical evidence stacked up.

This in turn led them to make a general conjecture about the behaviour of a curve's L-function ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') at ''s'' = 1, namely that it would have a zero of order ''r'' at this point. This was a far-sighted conjecture for the time, given that the analytic continuation of ''L''(''E'',&amp;nbsp;''s'') there was only established for curves with complex multiplication, which were also the main source of numerical examples. (NB that the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the L-function is from some points of view a more natural object of study; on occasion this means that one should consider poles rather than zeroes.)

The conjecture was subsequently extended to include the prediction of the precise leading [[Taylor coefficient]] of the L-function at ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. It is conjecturally given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L^{(r)}(E,1)}{r!} = \frac{\#\mathrm{Sha}(E)\Omega_E R_E \prod_{p|N}c_p}{(\#E_{\mathrm{Tor}})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where the quantities on the right hand side are invariants of the curve, studied by Cassels, [[John Tate|Tate]], [[Igor Shafarevich|Shafarevich]] and others: these include the order of the [[torsion group]], the order of the [[Tate–Shafarevich group]], and the [[canonical height]]s of a basis of rational points {{harv|Wiles|2006}}.

== Current status ==

[[File:BSD data plot for elliptic curve 800h1.svg|350px|right|thumb|A plot of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{p\leq X} \frac{N_p}{p}&lt;/math&gt; for the curve ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5''x'' as ''X'' varies over the first 100000 primes. The ''X''-axis is log(log(''X'')) and ''Y''-axis is in a logarithmic scale so the conjecture predicts that the data should form a line of slope equal to the rank of the curve, which is 1 in this case. For comparison, a line of slope 1 is drawn in red on the graph.]]

The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture has been proved only in special cases:

# {{harvtxt|Coates|Wiles|1977}} proved that if ''E'' is a curve over a number field ''F'' with complex multiplication by an [[imaginary quadratic field]] ''K'' of [[class number (number theory)|class number]] 1, ''F'' = ''K'' or '''Q''', and ''L''(''E'', 1) is not 0 then  ''E''(''F'') is a finite group. This was extended to the case where ''F'' is any finite [[abelian extension]] of ''K'' by {{harvtxt|Arthaud|1978}}.
# {{Harvtxt|Gross|Zagier|1986}} showed that if a [[modular elliptic curve]] has a first-order zero at ''s'' = 1 then it has a rational point of infinite order; see [[Gross–Zagier theorem]].
#{{harvtxt|Kolyvagin|1989}} showed that a modular elliptic curve ''E'' for which ''L''(''E'', 1) is not zero has rank 0, and a modular elliptic curve ''E'' for which ''L''(''E'', 1) has a first-order zero at ''s'' = 1 has rank 1.
# {{harvtxt|Rubin|1991}} showed that for elliptic curves defined over an imaginary quadratic field ''K'' with complex multiplication by ''K'', if the ''L''-series of the elliptic curve was not zero at ''s'' = 1, then the ''p''-part of the Tate–Shafarevich group had the order predicted by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, for all primes ''p'' &gt; 7.
# {{harvtxt|Breuil|Conrad|Diamond|Taylor|2001}}, extending work of {{harvtxt|Wiles|1995}}, proved that [[Modularity theorem|all elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers are modular]], which extends results #2 and #3 to all elliptic curves over the rationals, and shows that the ''L''-functions of all elliptic curves over '''Q''' are defined at ''s'' = 1.
# {{harvtxt|Bhargava|Shankar|2015}} proved that the average rank of the Mordell–Weil group of an elliptic curve over '''Q''' is bounded above by 7/6. Combining this with the [[p-parity theorem]] of {{harvtxt|Nekovář|2009}} and {{harvtxt|Dokchitser|Dokchitser|2010}} and with the proof of the [[main conjecture of Iwasawa theory]] for GL(2) by {{harvtxt|Skinner|Urban|2014}}, they conclude that a positive proportion of elliptic curves over '''Q''' have analytic rank zero, and hence, by {{harvtxt|Kolyvagin|1989}}, satisfy the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

Nothing has been proved for curves with rank greater than 1, although there is extensive numerical evidence for the truth of the conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/papers/bsd50.pdf |title=Numerical evidence for the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture |first=John |last=Cremona |year=2011 |work=Talk at the BSD 50th anniversary conference, May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Much like the [[Riemann hypothesis]], this conjecture has multiple consequences, including the following two:
* Let {{mvar|n}} be an odd [[square-free]] integer. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, {{mvar|n}} is the area of a right triangle with rational side lengths (a [[congruent number]]) if and only if the number of triplets of integers ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}}) satisfying {{math|2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 8''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''n''}} is twice the number of triplets satisfying {{math|2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 32''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''n''}}. This statement, due to [[Tunnell's theorem]] {{harv|Tunnell|1983}}, is related to the fact that ''n'' is a congruent number if and only if the elliptic curve {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''}} has a rational point of infinite order (thus, under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, its {{mvar|L}}-function has a zero at {{math|1}}). The interest in this statement is that the condition is easily verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

*In a different direction, certain analytic methods allow for an estimation of the order of zero in the center of the [[critical strip]] of families of ''L''-functions. Admitting the BSD conjecture, these estimations correspond to information about the rank of families of elliptic curves in question. For example: suppose the [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] and the BSD conjecture, the average rank of curves given by {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ax''+ ''b''}} is smaller than {{math|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

'''Bisexual erasure''' or '''bisexual invisibility''' is the tendency to ignore, remove, falsify, or reexplain evidence of [[bisexuality]] in [[history]], [[academia]], the [[news media]], and other [[primary source]]s.&lt;ref name="Stange"&gt;{{cite book |title = Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn = 1-4129-7685-5|id={{ISBN|9781412976855}}|publisher=Sage Pubns|year=2011|pages=158–161|accessdate=23 June 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;f=falsee|author1=Mary Zeiss Stange |author2=Carol K.

Bisexual erasure may include the assertion that all bisexual individuals are in a phase and will soon choose a side, either [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]]. One reason for this is the belief that bisexual individuals are distinctively indecisive.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klesse|first=Christian|date=2011|title=Shady Characters, Untrustworthy Partners, and Promiscuous Sluts: Creating Bisexual Intimacies in the Face of Heteronormativity and Biphobia|url=|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=11|pages=227–244|doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.571987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gross misrepresentations of bisexual individuals as [[hypersexual]] erases the sexual agency of bisexuals, effectively erasing their true identities as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=JM|date=2016-01-01|title=Queer Politics, Bisexual Erasure: Sexuality at the Nexus of Race, Gender, and Statistics|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8hv987pn|journal=Lambda Nordica|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual erasure is also often a manifestation of [[biphobia]],&lt;ref name="Stange" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dworkin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchins" /&gt; although it does not necessarily involve overt antagonism.

There is increasing inclusion and visibility of bisexuals, particularly in the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name="Queers United"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/pages/bisexual/|title=Queers United }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the task force"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/bisexuality |title=Task Force Report On Bisexuality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216071740/http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/bisexuality |archivedate=2014-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
===General===
According to scholar [[Kenji Yoshino]], there are three main investments that motivate both self-identified [[homosexuals]] and [[heterosexuals]] to seek to culturally erase bisexuality. These motivations are firstly [[sexual orientation]] stabilization. This relieves people of the anxiety of having sexual orientation questioned, an untenable position since it is in fact unprovable. There is a belief that bisexuals are simply undecided, and that they are fundamentally homosexual or heterosexual. This isolates, marginalises and makes bisexuals invisible within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roffee|first1=James A.|last2=Waling|first2=Andrea|title=Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ youth|journal=Safer Communities|date=October 2016|volume=15|issue=4|pages=190–201|doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the maintenance of the importance of [[gender]], which is seen as erotically essential to [[monosexual]]s while this notion is challenged by the existence of bisexuality. Thirdly, the maintenance of [[monogamy]] since for mainstream Americans, a pair bond is preferred. However,  bisexuals are generally assumed by monosexuals to be "intrinsically" non-monogamous.&lt;ref name="Yoshino"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoshino |first=Kenji |authorlink=Kenji Yoshino |title=The Epistemic Contract of Bisexual Erasure |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=353–461 |publisher=[[Stanford Law School]] |date=January 2000 |url=http://www.kenjiyoshino.com/articles/epistemiccontract.pdf |doi=10.2307/1229482 |jstor=1229482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juana Maria Rodriguez adds to Yoshino's argument and posits that bisexuality breaks down traditional understandings of sexuality and the gender binary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, individuals both in the dominant culture and in the queer community resist bisexuality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In an article written for the 10th anniversary of Yoshino's piece, Heron Greenesmith argues that bisexuality is in fact inherently invisible in the law, beyond the reach of deliberate erasure. Firstly, she says it is because bisexuality is legally irrelevant with plaintiffs presumed to be monosexual unless [[outing|outed]] and secondly, that when bisexuality is legally relevant it is erased within the legal culture since it complicates legal arguments that depend on a [[gender binary]] nature of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenesmith|first=Heron|title=Drawing Bisexuality Back into the Picture: How Bisexuality Fits Into the LGBT Strategy Ten Years After Bisexual Erasure|journal=Cardozo Journal of Law and Gender|year=2010|volume=17|pages=65–80|url=http://www.cardozolawandgender.com/uploads/2/7/7/6/2776881/greenesmith_formatted_final_upload.pdf|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American psychologist Beth Firestone writes that since she wrote her first book on bisexuality, in 1996, "bisexuality has gained visibility, although progress is uneven and awareness of bisexuality is still minimal or absent in many of the more remote regions of our country and internationally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Firestein|first=Beth A.|title=Becoming Visible: Counselling Bisexuals Across the Lifespan|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-13724-9|pages=xvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pCKkZmBU1EC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;ei=KqEbUfC-IMnK0QXDkoCICA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA&amp;q=visibility%20bisexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Male motivations ===

[[Richard C. Friedman]], an academic psychiatrist who specializes in the psychodynamics of homosexuality, writes in his essay "Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men" that many [[gay]] men have experienced [[sexual fantasies]] about women or engaged in sex with women and that many straight men have experienced sexual fantasies about men or [[Gay sexual practices|engaged in sex with men]]. Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as "gay" or "straight" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's [[sexual identity]] and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a "gay man" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in [[heteronormative]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-0737-2_14 |title=Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men |publisher=[[SpringerLink]] |accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for [[Bisexual.org]], author and columnist Zachary Zane cites a study showing that 20.7% of straight-identified men watched [[gay pornography]] and 7.5% reported having sex with a man in the past six months, while 55% of gay-identified men had watched heterosexual pornography and 0.7% reported having sex with a woman in the past six months. He argues that some of the straight-identified men are actually gay or bisexual but are erasing their bisexuality due to internalized biphobia and denial in order to claim a straight identity label. Pointing out that the majority of gay-identified men watched heterosexual pornography but few had recent heterosexual sex, he suggests that many self-identified gay men have sexual fantasies about women and in an ideal world would be openly bisexual and freely explore sex with women, but society pressures gay men to "pick a side" so those men "subsequently have picked being gay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zane|first1=Zachary|title=1 in 5 Straight-Identifying Men Watch Same-sex Porn: Are They All Closeted|url=https://bisexual.org/1-in-5-straight-identifying-men-watch-same-sex-porn-are-they-all-closeted/|website=Bisexual.org|publisher=The American Institute of Bisexuality|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual author and activist [[Robyn Ochs]] has argued that gay men are less possessive of their "gay" label than [[lesbians]] are of their label. She argues that there is less hostility to bisexual men who identify as gay than bisexual women who identify as lesbian, that there is a great deal of [[sexual fluidity]] between gay men and bisexual men, and that consequently more gay-identified men openly admit to being attracted to and having sex with women. However, Ochs also argues that many bisexual men identify as gay in order to politically align themselves with the gay community. She says that since coming out is so difficult for gay men, many do not want to come out a second time as bisexual; the existence of male bisexuality can be threatening to some gay men because it raises the possibility that they themselves might be bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://robynochs.com/biphobia-it-goes-more-than-two-ways/ |title=BIPHOBIA: IT GOES MORE THAN TWO WAYS |publisher=[[Robyn Ochs|robynochs.com]] |accessdate=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay male activist [[Carl Wittman]], writing in his "Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto", argued that gay men should identify as "gay" rather than as "bisexual", even if they sleep with women. Stating that gay men should only become bisexual once society accepts homosexuality, he wrote that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Bisexuality is good; it is the capacity to love people of either sex. The reason so few of us are bisexual is because society made such a big stink about homosexuality that we got forced into seeing ourselves as either straight or non-straight. Also, many gays go turned off to the ways men are supposed to act with women and vice-versa, which is pretty f---ed-up. Gays will begin to turn on to women when 1) it's something that we do because we want to, and not because we should, and 2) when women's liberation changes the nature of heterosexual relationships. We continue to call ourselves homosexual, not bisexual, even if we do make it with the opposite sex also, because saying "Oh, I'm Bi" is a copout for a gay. We get told it's OK to sleep with guys as long as we sleep with women, too, and that's still putting homosexuality down. We'll be gay until everyone has forgotten that it's an issue. Then we'll begin to be complete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;- Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto I.3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifeso|last=Wittman|first=Carl|publisher=San Francisco Free Press|year=1969|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Deterring accusations of homophobia from psychologists===
While there have been reports from bisexual men and women about feeling unwelcome in the gay and lesbian communities due to accusations of [[homophobia]] for a long time, there is a recent increase in reports from bisexual men (more so than from bisexual women) about accusations of being predisposed towards homophobia that cite psychology and statistics. One example is biphobia that cite [[penile plethysmograph]] statistics that appear to show a concentration of bisexual genital responses specifically in homophobic men. Members of the bisexual community as well as some scholars argue that this skews the studies towards a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] in which non-homophobic men with genital responses to both men and women (both truly bisexual men and merely nonconcordant men) are deterred from taking part in the studies out of a fear of being accused of having a predisposition towards homophobia. This is argued to be a cause of bisexual male erasure that gives an appearance of bisexuality being rarer in men, especially in non-homophobic men. These open bisexuals and scholars reply to the objection that the theory of a link between male bisexuality and homophobia is population level and not to every individual by pointing out that ethics informed by population level statistics do affect individuals who are told to live by the ethics, arguing that just as statistics that appear to show a link between theories of immutable sexuality and acceptance of homosexuality are used to declare criticism of such immutability theories to be unethical, statistics that appear to show a link between bisexual orientation and homophobia can just as well be used to declare the condition of simply having a bisexual orientation unethical, resulting in biphobia. It is argued that similar self-fulfilling prophecies apply there (non-homophobes who do not think that sexuality is immutable being pressured by social [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]] and few-choice polls to falsely claim either that they believe in immutable sexuality or that they have something against homosexuality which may [[unintended consequences|increase the number of members in homophobic groups by forcing non-homophobes to claim homophobia]]), citing that many past attempts to "cure" homosexuality relied on hormonal medication which is incompatible with the claim that those who tried such conversion believed in social environmental determinism. It is also cited that bisexual men report even more fear than gay men due to not being accepted in either heteronormative or gay communities and argued that waiting for a purported "society as a whole" to accept homosexuality is futile due to dichotomous societies being inherently polarized.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Harrad (2018) "Claiming the B in LGBT: Illuminating the Bisexual Narrative"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro (2015) "Bisexuality: Identities, Politics, and Theories"&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexual (straight) and gay people who engage in bisexual erasure may claim that bisexuals are either exclusively homosexual (gay/lesbian) or exclusively heterosexual,&lt;ref name="Stange" /&gt; [[closeted]] gay or lesbian people who wish to appear heterosexual,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Musto, April 7, 2009.

== In the LGBT community ==
Bisexual erasure may stem from a belief that the [[bisexual community]] does not deserve equal status or inclusion within gay and lesbian communities.&lt;ref name="BT archaeology"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss |first=Jillian Todd |title=GL vs. BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community |journal=[[Journal of Bisexuality]] |volume=3 |issue=3–4 |pages=25–55 |publisher=[[Haworth Press]] |year=2004 |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/glvsbt.htm |doi=10.1300/J159v03n03_02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329150447/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/glvsbt.htm |archivedate=2016-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can take the form of omitting the word ''bisexual'' in the name of an organization or event that serves the whole [[LGBT community]], including it as "bi-sexual", implying that there are only two authentic sexual orientations,&lt;ref name="Bisexuals are not Bi-Sexuals"&gt;http://www.bisexualindex.org.uk/index.php/Main/Bisexuality#hyphen&lt;/ref&gt; or treating the subject of bisexuality in a derogatory way.&lt;ref name="Savage Biphobia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andeatit2.wordpress.com/2008/07/04/dan-savage-stop-with-the-biphobia-already |title=Dan Savage-Stop with the Biphobia Already! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, bisexual women have had their sexuality labeled by lesbian feminist circles as an "apolitical cop-out".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bisexual women have been seen as "not radical enough" because of their attraction to [[cisgender]] men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rodriguez asserts that bisexuality was regarded as anti-feminist by many lesbians because of the implied "desires for penetration, sexual dominance, and submission," and gender roles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bisexual vilification and erasure by the community may not be as open and prevalent today, but identifying as bisexual can still lead to exclusion and erasure in many lesbian spaces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2013, a study published in the ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]'' surveyed thirty people who identified as part of the lesbian, gay, queer or bisexual communities and their individual experiences with coming out.  Ten of these people reported that they claimed the label of bisexuality first, and later came out again as lesbian, gay, or queer.  The theory that emerged in this study introduced the concept of the "queer apologetic", in which one attempts to reconcile their same-gender attraction with the social norm of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guittar|first1=Nicholas A.|title=The Queer Apologetic: Explaining the Use of Bisexuality as a Transitional Identity|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|date=2013|volume=13|issue=2|page=166|doi=10.1080/15299716.2013.781975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexuals have been overlooked in the [[same-sex marriage]] debate: Where same-sex marriage is illegal, those campaigning for it have failed to highlight the inconsistencies of marriage laws in relation to bisexuals, whose right to marry depends solely on the gender of their partner. Secondly, when same-sex marriage is available, a bisexual partner will generally be referred to as lesbian or gay. For example, one of the first people to take part in a same-sex marriage in America, [[Robyn Ochs]], was widely referred to in the media as a lesbian, despite identifying herself in interviews as bisexual.&lt;ref name="bisexual marriage"&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.thetaskforce.org/press/releases/pr736_092104 |title=  Bisexuals Overlooked in the Debate on Equal Marriage Rights |access-date=  2009-11-02 |archive-url=  https://web.archive.org/web/20140720082629/http://www.thetaskforce.org/press/releases/pr736_092104 |archive-date=  2014-07-20 |dead-url=  yes |df=   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the [[Lambda Literary Awards]] did not have a category for bisexual literary works, which was finally established in 2006 after lobbying by [[BiNet USA]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Theoretical analyses and literature ==

=== Theoretical frameworks ===
Alternative approaches to the concept of bisexuality have been developed that expand the definition of sexual identity outward from a "this ''or'' that" mentality to a "this ''and'' that" mentality. Jenée Wilde presents the idea of what she calls "dimensional sexuality" in an article for ''[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]]'', a theoretical framework in which gender is not the primary factor in sexual attraction, rather it is one of many axes. These other axes of attraction can include the desire for either monogamy or polyamory, and the fluidity of desire for the various gender(s) in a partner over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilde|first=Jenée|year=2014|title=Dimensional sexuality: exploring new frameworks for bisexual desires|journal=Sexual &amp; Relationship Therapy|volume=29|issue=3|pages=320–338|issn=1468-1994|doi=10.1080/14681994.2014.919377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde uses her framework to broaden the scale of sexual identity from a simple binary spectrum from "mono-sexual" to "bisexual", and to establish relationships between these identities; these relationships would not alienate individuals without a single "fixed object" of attraction.

Viewpoints like Wilde's have been applied by scholars such as Laura Erickson-Schroth and Jennifer Mitchell&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson-Schroth|first=Laura|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jennifer|year=2009|title=Queering Queer Theory, or Why Bisexuality matters|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=9|issue=3|pages=297–315|doi=10.1080/15299710903316596}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pieces of pop-culture and literature; Steven Angelides also produced a book on the place of bisexuality in research and societal awareness throughout history, using a similar framework.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Bisexuality|last=Angelides|first=Steven|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|isbn=0-226-02089-4|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both pieces aim to achieve more inclusive readings of sexuality and allow for the re-designation of literary figures and real people as bisexual, rather than continuing with the assumption that any same-gender activity, explicit or implied, is homosexual, and any opposite-gender activity heterosexual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Examples ====
An example of a viewpoint similar to Wilde's is D.S. Neff's reading of Lord Byron's [[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|''Childe'' ''Harold's Pilgrimage'']], which finds that the poem is ambiguous in its mentioning of "concubines and carnal companie" as well as later parts of the work; Neff finds these ambiguities to be implications that both male and female lovers were had by the protagonist. This bisexual portrayal is supported through Byron's real-world interactions with lovers of multiple genders, and the culture of his literary affiliates at Cambridge condoning those interactions in the midst of the 19th century's moral panic around same-gender desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=D.S.|year=2002|title=Bitches, mollies, and tommies: Byron, masculinity, and the history of sexualities|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=11|issue=3|pages=395–438|issn=1043-4070|doi=10.1353/sex.2003.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erickson-Schroth and Mitchell's 2009 article in the ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]'' performs a similar analysis of ''[[Written on the Body]]'' by [[Jeanette Winterson]] and ''[[Well of Loneliness]]'' by [[Radclyffe Hall]]; the assertion behind these scholars' work is that bisexual experience has existed all throughout the history of humanity, and while it has only recently been acknowledged even in queer and LGBT circles, it is in no way an exclusively modern phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also interpretations of literature that focus on the symbolic expressions of bisexuality rather than its explicit mention.  Linda K. Hughes' analysis of [[Alexander Smith (poet)|Alexander Smith]]'s ''A Life-Drama'' contends the atypical nature of the heterosexual courtship in the poem stands in place of the romance between the main character's "intimate friendship" with another man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Linda K.|year=2004|title=Alexander Smith and the Bisexual Poetics of A Life-Drama|journal=Victorian Poetry|volume=42|issue=4|pages=491–508|doi=10.1353/vp.2005.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other analyses use the subtextual practices and common allusions of the Victorian period/19th century that referenced bisexuality or homosexuality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Löftström|first=Jan|year=1997|title=The birth of the queen/the modern homosexual: historical explanations revisited|journal=The Sociological Review|volume=45|issue=1|pages=24–41|doi=10.1111/1467-954X.ep9710072419}}&lt;/ref&gt; to show the presence of bisexual themes in Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howes|first=Marjorie|year=1988|title=The Mediation of the Feminine: Bisexuality, Homoerotic Desire, and Self-Expression in Bram Stoker's Dracula|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=30|issue=1|pages=104–119|issn=0040-4691|jstor=40754849}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry James' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killoran|first=Helen|year=1993|title=The Governess, Mrs. Grose, and 'the Poison of an Influence' in The Turn of the Screw|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=13–24|doi=10.2307/3195031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Erasure in academic literature ===
Bisexual individuals have largely been overlooked in academic literature. Hemmings posits that bisexual erasure is essential in queer studies to keep lesbians and gay men as the main subjects of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmings|first=Clare|date=2007|title=What's in a Name{{?}}: Bisexuality, Transnational Sexuality Studies and Western Colonial Legacies|url=|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=11.1-2|pages=13–32|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexuals are often included under the umbrella of LGBT+ in academic studies. However, data specific to bisexuals is lacking.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Historically, academics began to study bisexuals in relation to HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These studies contributed to the mythology that bisexuals have a higher chance of transmitting HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media depictions ==
Some media outlets have portrayed bisexual behaviors in ancient and non-Western cultures, such as ancient Greek [[pederasty]] or Native American [[Two-Spirit]]s, as proof that homosexuality has been widely accepted in other times and cultures,&lt;ref name="Alexander the Great"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gayheroes.com/alex.htm  |title=Alexander the Great }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Donald E.  [http://www.glbtq.com/literature/bisex_lit.html Bisexual Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106225852/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/bisex_lit.html |date=2012-11-06 }} [[glbtq.com|glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, &amp; Queer Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt; even though it can also be seen as proof of the existence and acceptance of bisexuality.

In both the gay and straight media, individuals who have kept their sexual identity unknown have been portrayed as either gay or straight, even when they engaged in romantic or sexual relationships with both men and women.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;{{cite web |last=Summers |first=Claude J. |title=BiNet USA |work=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture |publisher=glbtq, Inc. |date=2009-10-20 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/binet_usa.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220100127/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/binet_usa.html |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same has occurred even with people who identify themselves as bisexual. [[Ani DiFranco]]'s 1998 marriage to Andrew Gilchrist was portrayed in both gay and mainstream media as renouncing lesbianism, even though she had been out as bisexual since the very beginning of her career.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Baumgardner]], ''Look Both Ways: Bisexual Politics''. [[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]], 2008. {{ISBN|0-374-53108-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cynthia Nixon]] faced public criticism in 2012 when an awkwardly-worded interview quote about her bisexuality led many to believe she was saying she had chosen to become a lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2094099/Cynthia-Nixon-gay-choice-Actress-seeks-clarify-comments-causing-outrage.html "'Bisexuality is a fact': Cynthia Nixon seeks to clarify her comments after causing outrage by saying she is 'gay by choice'"]. ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', January 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has called herself bisexual in interviews and has frequently engaged in public acts of same-sex intimacy with other female celebrities, but is typically portrayed by media as a heterosexual woman who dabbles in lesbian imagery for pure [[shock value]], with any possibility that she might be genuinely bisexual being discounted entirely.&lt;ref&gt;J. Randy Taraborrelli, ''[[Madonna: An Intimate Biography]]''. [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-8346-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Gaga]] is sometimes labelled as either "gay" or "straight" in the media even though she has publicly identified as bisexual.&lt;ref name="The Rise of Lady GaGa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/27/the-new-issue-of-rolling-stone-the-rise-of-lady-gaga |title=The Rise of Lady Gaga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Admitting bisexuality"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/lady-gaga-admits-shes-bisexual_100197849.html|title=Lady Gaga admits she’s bisexual}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freddie Mercury]], who according to his obituary was a "self-confessed bisexual," is often depicted as gay by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/24/newsid_2546000/2546945.stm|title=1991: Giant of rock dies|date=1991-11-24|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Freddie_Mercury_-_11-25-1991_-_The_Star_-_AIDS_Kills_The_King_of_Rock|title=Queen Interviews - Freddie Mercury - 11-25-1991 - The Star - AIDS Kills The King of Rock - Queen Archives: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, Interviews, Articles, Reviews|website=www.queenarchives.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media in both communities also often refers to the "gay and lesbian" community, ignoring bisexual and/or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Gay and Lesbian CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/category/gay-lesbian-issues |title=Anderson Cooper's Blog about "Gay and Lesbian" Issues | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual women specifically are subject to both hypervisibility and erasure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bisexual women are over-represented in pornography, reality television, and music videos as part of the [[male gaze]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, representations of bisexual women as agents in their own sexuality are lacking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Erasure of sexual agency for bisexual [[women of color]] is prevalent within the media as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bisexuality stereotypically implies a sense of uncontrolled sexual desire; this is then intensified for women of color who are already hypersexualized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Television ===
On December 30, 2009, [[MTV]] premiered their 23rd season of the show ''[[The Real World]]'',&lt;ref name="Real World DC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/real_world/Washingtondc/series.jhtml |title=Real World DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring two bisexual participants,&lt;ref name="Real World Bisexuals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queerty.com/forget-the-token-gay-tonights-real-world-dc-premiere-has-2-bisexuals-20091230/ |title=Real World Bisexuals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Show me your bisexuals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autostraddle.com/real-world-washington-dc-recap-26581 |title=Show me your bisexuals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Schromm,&lt;ref name="Emily Schromm talks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/12/28/real_world_d_c_star_emily_schromm_talks_ |title=Emily Schromm talks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mike Manning.&lt;ref name="Mike Manning Metro Weekly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=4765 |title=Mike Manning Metro Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Manning himself identifies as bisexual,&lt;ref name="Mike Manning Metro Weekly" /&gt; many bloggers and commenters on blogs claimed that he was in fact gay.&lt;ref name="Mike Manning Bi history and controversy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queerty.com/the-entire-bi-sexual-history-of-real-world-d-c-s-mike-manning-20091231/ |title=Mike Manning Bi history and controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Now, Gay Later"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artwingny.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/bi-now-gay-later-real-world-d-c-s-mike-manning/ |title=Bi Now, Gay Later}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while a behind-the-scenes MTV Aftershow and subsequent interview revealed that both Manning and Schromm had had encounters with both men and women while on the show, the show was edited to make it seem as though they had only been with men.&lt;ref name="Emily Schromm AfterEllen interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/2010/3/emily-schromm-interview/ |title=Emily Schromm AfterEllen interview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401073231/http://www.afterellen.com/people/2010/3/emily-schromm-interview |archivedate=2010-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aftershow Real World Episode 8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-washington-dc-ep-8-aftershow/1632075/playlist.jhtml|title=Aftershow Real World Episode 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erasure from LGBT rights and litigation ==
Individuals identifying as bisexual have been absent from dialogue during discourse about LGBT-rights and litigation. Examples include the early use of the term "gay marriage" as opposed to "same-sex marriage" or "marriage equality," as well as the lack of mention of bisexuality in briefs or in opinions handed down by the courts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Nancy|date=2015|title=Bridging Bisexual Erasure in LGBT-Rights Discourse and Litigation|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?public=false&amp;handle=hein.journals/mjgl22&amp;page=291&amp;collection=journals#|journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law|volume=22|pages=291–344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of relevant terminology in LBGT-rights cases found that, minus a brief period in U.S. Supreme Court history when bisexuals were mentioned alongside gays and lesbians&lt;ref&gt;"Hurley et al. v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., et al.," 515 (1995): p. 557-581. ''HeinOnline'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.usreports/usrep515&amp;i=603&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; bisexuality has not been mentioned in Supreme Court opinions or briefs in major LGBT rights cases, which too often describe gays and lesbians as exclusively affected by sexual orientation discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Nancy|date=2015|title=Bridging Bisexual Erasure in LGBT-Rights Discourse and Litigation|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?public=false&amp;handle=hein.journals/mjgl22&amp;page=291&amp;collection=journals#|journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law|volume=22|pages=291–344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While courts have begun to more frequently used the term ''same-sex'' in litigation involving sexual minority groups, this term is still often used interchangeably with ''gay'', ''lesbian'', and ''homosexual'', therefore erasing the bisexual contingent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Nancy Marcus uses the monumental [[Obergefell v. Hodges]] case that granted same-sex marriage rights as an example of nearly complete erasure of bisexuality despite efforts by legal organizations such as BiLaw, including an amicus brief to the Supreme Court and outreach to the plaintiffs' legal team.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is important in the U.S. legal system when law is developed through case law, since not mentioning bisexual identities in legal decisions implies a "secondary" status of bisexuals within the LGBT community, with the judiciary appearing to give the imprimatur to the relegation of bisexuality to a lesser, or completely ignored, status. 

Marcus states that misunderstanding and erasure of bisexuality within the US legal system results in tangible harm to bisexual litigants, including the increased likelihood of losing parental rights and the probability of being denied asylum from anti-LGBT countries.  Custody issues arise due to the belief that bisexual people are too unstable to be parents, while bisexuals seeking asylum from countries hostile to LGBT individuals are viewed with suspicion, including not being "gay enough." This is due to a common assumption within the legal community that a person can only be legitimately attracted to one gender; therefore a bisexual asylum-seeker is more likely to be considered a fraud.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29456">In [[linguistics]], '''comparative illusions''' ('''CIs''') or '''Escher sentences'''{{efn|These sentences have also been called '''dead ends''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Christensen|2010|p=42}}; {{harvtxt|Christensen|2016|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Russia sentences''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pullum|2012}}; {{harvtxt|Kelley|2018|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Montalbetti sentences'''.{{sfnp|Piattelli Palmarini|2010|p=136}}}} are certain [[comparison (grammar)|comparative]] sentences which initially seem to be [[Grammaticality|acceptable]] but upon closer reflection have no well-formed meaning. The typical [[List of linguistic example sentences|example sentence]] used to typify this phenomenon is ''More people have been to Russia than I have''.{{sfnp|Hurford|2012|pp=214–215}} The effect has also been observed in other languages. Some studies have suggested that, at least in English, the effect is stronger for sentences whose predicate is repeatable. The effect has also been found to be stronger in some cases when there is a plural subject in the second clause.

==Overview of ungrammaticality==
Escher sentences are [[ungrammatical]] because a matrix clause subject like ''more people'' is making a comparison between two sets of individuals, but there is no such set of individuals in the second clause.{{sfnp|Phillips|Wagers|Lau|2011|p=165}} For the sentence to be grammatical, the subject of the second clause must be a [[bare noun|bare]] plural.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|p=3}} Linguists have marked that it is "striking" that despite the grammar of these sentences not possibly having a meaningful interpretation that people so often report that they sound acceptable,{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|p=4}} and that it is "remarkable" that people seldom notice any error.{{sfnp|Phillips|Wagers|Lau|2011|p=165}}

==History==
[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]]: "As this object is examined by following its surfaces, reappraisal has to be made very frequently."{{sfnp|Penrose|Penrose|1958|p=32}}]]
[[Mario Montalbetti]]'s 1984 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] dissertation has been credited as being the first to note these sorts of sentences;{{sfnp|Phillips|Wagers|Lau|2011|p=165}} in his prologue he gives acknowledgements to Hermann Schultze "for uttering the most amazing [[Asterisk#Ungrammaticality|*/?]] sentence I've ever heard: ''More people have been to Berlin than I have''",{{sfnp|Montalbetti|1984|p=6}} although the dissertation itself does not discuss such sentences.{{sfnp|Phillips|Lewis|2013|p=23}} Parallel examples with ''Russia'' instead of ''Berlin'' were briefly discussed in psycholinguistic work in the 1990s and 2000s by [[Thomas Bever]] and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bever|Sanz|Townsend|1998|p=275}}; {{harvtxt|Bever|Townsend|2001|p=153}}; {{harvtxt|Townsend|Bever|2001|p=184}}; {{harvtxt|Bever|2009|pp=287–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey K. Pullum]] wrote about this phenomenon in a 2004 post on ''[[Language Log]]'' after Jim McCloskey brought it to his attention.{{sfnp|Pullum|2004}} In a post the following day, [[Mark Liberman]] gave the name "Escher sentences" to such sentences in reference to [[M. C. Escher]]'s 1960 lithograph ''[[Ascending and Descending]]''.{{sfnp|O'Connor|Pancheva|Kaiser|2013|p=544}} He wrote:{{sfnp|Liberman|2004}}
{{quote|All these stimuli [i.e., these sentences, [[Penrose stairs]], and the [[Shepard tone]]]  involve familiar and coherent local cues whose global integration is contradictory or impossible. These stimuli also all seem OK in the absence of scrutiny. Casual, unreflective uptake has no real problem with them; you need to pay attention and think about them a bit before you notice that something is going seriously wrong.}}

Although rare, actual attestations of this construction have appeared in natural speech. ''Language Log'' has noted examples such as:
:(a) In Michigan and Minnesota, more people found Mr Bush's ads negative than they did Mr Kerry's.{{sfnp|Pullum|2009}}
:(b) With him breathing down my neck, I was still able to focus on what I was doing [...] More people have analyzed it than I have, but it's a nice notion that Tiger was up near the lead and I outplayed him.{{sfnp|Beaver|2004}}
:(c) I admit that more people have been to Iraq than I have, so I don't know everything.{{sfnp|Pullum|2004}}

==Research==
Experiments on the acceptability of comparative illusion sentences has found results which are "highly variable both within and across studies".{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|p=34}} While the illusion of acceptability for comparative illusions has also informally reported for speakers of Faroese, German,{{efn|German does not allow the same sort of VP-ellipsis in comparative sentences, so the sorts of examples examined such as {{lang|de|In Paris sind mehr Leute gewesen als ich war}} are not quite parallel.{{sfnp|Meinunger|2014|p=261}}}} Icelandic, Polish, and Swedish,{{sfnp|Christensen|2011|p=113}} systematic investigation has mostly centered on English, although [[Aarhus University]] neurolinguist Ken Ramshøj Christensen has run several experiments on comparative illusions in Danish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Christensen|2010}}; {{harvtxt|Christensen|2011}}; {{harvtxt|Christensen|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived meanings===
When Danish {{small|(da)}} and Swedish {{small|(sv)}} speakers were asked what (1) means, their responses fell into one of the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Christensen|2011|pp=120–122}}; {{harvtxt|Christensen|2016|pp=144–145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{fs interlinear|number=(1)|lang=da
|Flere folk har været i Paris end jeg har.
|More people have been in Paris than I have.
|'More people have been to Paris than I have.'}}
::(a) Some people have been to Paris [except me]. {{small|(da: 28.9%; sv: 12.0%)}}
::(b) More people have been to Paris [than (just) me]. {{small|(da: 21.1%; sv: 28.0%)}}
::(c) Some people have been to Paris [more (often) than I have]. {{small|(da: 15.8%; sv: 4.0%)}}
::(d) More people have been to Paris [than I own]. {{small|(da: 13.2%; sv: 16.0%)}}
::(e) Other (e.g., repeating the original sentence). {{small|(da: 13.2%; 12.0%)}}
::(f) It does not make sense. {{small|(da: 7.9%; sv: 28.0%)}}
Paraphrase (d) is in fact the only possible interpretation of (1); this is possible due to the [[lexical ambiguity]] of {{lang|da|har}} "have" between an [[auxiliary verb]] and a [[lexical verb]] just as the English ''have''; however the majority of participants (da: 78.9%; sv: 56%) gave a paraphrase which does not follow from the grammar.{{sfnp|Christensen|2016|p=145}} Another study where Danish participants had to pick from a set of paraphrases, say it meant something else, or say it was meaningless found that people selected "It does not make sense" for comparative illusions 63% of the time and selected it meant something 37% of the time.{{sfnp|Christensen|2011|pp=122–125}}

===Ellipsis===
The first study examining what affects acceptability of these sentences was presented at the 2004 [[CUNY]] Conference on Human Sentencing Processing.{{sfnp|Kelley|2018|pp=40, 57–58}} Scott Fults and Collin Phillips found that Escher sentences with [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] (a) were found to be more acceptable than the same sentences without ellipsis (b).{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=6–7}}
: (a) More people have been to Russia than I have. 
: (b) More people have been to Russia than I have been to Russia. 
Responses to this study noted that it only compared elided material to nothing, and that that even in grammatical comparatives, ellipsis of repeated phrases is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=6–7}}; {{harvtxt|Kelley|2018|pp=40, 57–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to control for the awkwardness of identical predicates, Alexis Wellwood and colleagues compared comparative illusions with ellipsis to those with a different predicate.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=12–13}}
: (a) More girls ate pizza than the boy {did} / {ate yogurt}.
They found that both CI-type and control sentences were found to be slightly more acceptable with ellipsis, which led them to reject the hypothesis that ellipsis was responsible for the acceptability of CIs. Rather, it's possible people just prefer shorter sentences in general.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=14–16}} Patrick Kelley's [[Michigan State University]] dissertation found similar results.{{sfnp|Kelley|2018|pp=144–171}}

===Repeatability===
Alexis Wellwood and colleagues have found in experiments that the illusion of grammaticality is greater when the sentence's [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wellwood|Pancheva|Fults|Phillips|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018a}}; {{harvtxt|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, (a) is experimentally found to be more acceptable than (b).{{sfnp|Phillips|2013|pp=166–167}}

: (a) More undergrads call their families during the week than I do.
: (b) More New Yorkers began law school this semester than I did.

The comparative must be in the subject position for the illusion to work; sentences like (a) which also have [[verb phrase ellipsis]] are viewed as unacceptable without any illusion of acceptability:{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2017|p=41}}

: (a) *I have been to more countries than Russia I have.

A pilot study by Iria de Dios-Flores also found that repeatability of the predicate had an effect on the acceptability of CIs in English.{{sfnp|de Dios-Flores|2016|p=226}} However, Christensen's study on comparative illusions in Danish did not find a significant difference in acceptability for sentences with repeatable predicates (a) and those without (b).{{sfnp|Christensen|2016|p=141}}
{{fs interlinear|number=(a)|lang=da
|Flere mænd har spist kød end kvinder har ifølge rapporten.
|More men have eaten meat than women have according.to report-the
|'More men have eaten meat than women have according to the report.'}}
{{fs interlinear|number=(b)|lang=da
|Flere drenge har mistet hørelsen end piger har i Danmark.
|More boys have lost hearing-the than girls has in Denmark
|'More boys have lost the sense of hearing than girls have in Denmark.'}}

===Quantifier choice===
The [[lexical ambiguity]] of the English quantifier ''more'' has led to a hypothesis where the acceptability of CIs is due to people reinterpreting a "comparative" ''more'' as an "additive" ''more''. As ''fewer'' does not have such an ambiguity, Wellwood and colleagues tested to see if there was any difference in acceptability judgements depending on whether the sentences used ''fewer'' or ''more''. In general, their study found significantly higher acceptability for sentences with ''more'' than with ''fewer'' but the difference did not disproportionately affect the comparative illusion sentences compared to the controls.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=14–16}}

Christensen found no significant difference in acceptability for Danish CIs with {{lang|da|flere}} ("more") compared to those with {{lang|da|færre}} ("fewer").{{sfnp|Christensen|2016|p=141}}

===Subject choice===
Experiments have also investigated the effects different kinds of subjects in the ''than''-clause have on CIs' acceptability. Wellwood and colleagues found that sentences with first person singular pronoun ''I'' to be more acceptable than those with the third person singular pronoun ''he'', though they note this might be due to discourse effects and the lack of a prior antecedent for ''he''. They found no significant difference for sentences with a singular third person pronoun (''he'') and those with a singular definite description (''the boy''). There was no difference in number for the first person pronominal subject (''I'' vs. ''we''), but plural definite descriptions (''the boys'') were significantly more acceptable than singular definite descriptions (''the boy'').{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|p=20}} Christensen found that plural subjects ({{lang|da|kvinder}}, "women") in the ''than''-clause led to significantly higher acceptability ratings than singular subjects ({{lang|da|frisøren}} "the hairdresser").{{sfnp|Christensen|2016|p=141}}

De Dios-Flores examined if there was an effect depending on whether or not the ''than''-clause subject could be a subset of the matrix subject as in (a) compared to those where it could not be due to a gender mismatch as in (b). No significant differences were found.{{sfnp|de Dios-Flores|2016|pp=225–226}}
:(a) More PhD students presented in conferences than she did.
:(b) More policewomen visited the headquarters than he did.

===Other grammatical factors===
In a study of Danish speakers, CIs with prepositional sentential adverbials like {{da|om aftenen}} "in the evening" were found to be less acceptable than those without.{{sfnp|Christensen|2011|pp=125–128}}

Comparatives in Bulgarian can optionally have the degree operator {{lang|bul|колкото}} ({{transl|bul|kolkoto}}); sentences with this morpheme (a) are immediately found unacceptable but those without it (b) produce the same illusion of acceptability.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=35–36}}

{{fs interlinear|number=(a)|lang=bul
|Повече хора са били в Русия от-'''колкото''' аз.
|Poveche hora sa bili v Rusiya ot-'''kolkoto''' az.
|more people are been in Russia from-how.many I
|'More people have been to Russia than me.'}}

{{fs interlinear|number=(b)|lang=bul
|Повече хора са били в Русия от мен.
|Poveche hora sa bili v Rusiya ot men.
|more people are been in Russia than me
|'More people have been to Russia than me.'}}

===Neurolinguistics===
A [[neuroimaging]] study of Danish speakers found less activation in the left inferior [[frontal gyrus]], left [[premotor cortex]] (BA [[Brodmann area 4|4]], [[Brodmann area 6|6]]), and left posterior [[temporal cortex]] (BA [[Brodmann area 21|21]], [[Brodmann area 22|22]]) when processing CIs like (a) than when processing grammatical clausal comparatives like (b). Christensen has suggested this shows CIs are easy to process but as they are nonsensical, processing is "shallow". Low LIFG activation levels also suggest that people do not perceive CIs as being semantically anomalous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Christensen|2010|p=48}}; {{harvtxt|Christensen|2016|pp=135–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{fs interlinear|number=(a)|lang=da

==Explanations==
Townsend and Bever have posited that Escher sentences get perceived as acceptable because they are an apparent blend of two grammatical templates.{{sfnp|Townsend|Bever|2001|p=184}}
:(a) More people have gone to Russia than I ... (could believe).
:(b) ... people have gone to Russia [more] than I have... 
Wellwood and colleagues have noted in response that the possibility of each clause being grammatical in a different sentence (a, b) does not guarantee a blend (c) would be acceptable.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=5–6}}
:(a) '''Mary is too tall''' to get on this ride.
:(b) Mary has ridden some ride as many times '''as Bill has'''.
:(c) →*Mary is too tall as Bill has.
Wellwood and colleagues also interpret Townsend and Bever's theory as requiring a shared lexical element in each template. If this version is right, they predict (c) would be viewed as less acceptable due to the ungrammaticality of (b):{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|pp=5–6}}
:(a) '''Fewer people have been to Russia''' than I would have thought.
:(b) *People have been to Russia fewer '''than I have'''.
:(c) →?Fewer people have been to Russia than I have.
Wellwood and colleagues, based on their experimental results, have rejected Townsend and Bever's hypothesis and instead support their event comparison hypothesis, which states that comparative illusions are due to speakers reinterpreting these sentences as discussing a comparison of events.{{sfnp|Wellwood|Pancheva|Hacquard|Phillips|2018b|p=34}}

==Similar constructions==
The term "comparative illusion" has sometimes been used as an umbrella term which also encompasses "depth charge" sentences like "No head injury is too trivial to be ignored."{{sfnp|O'Connor|2015|p=3}} This example, first discussed by [[Peter Cathcart Wason]] and Shuli Reich in 1979, is very often initially perceived as having the meaning "No head injury should be ignored—even if it's trivial", even though upon careful consideration the sentence actually says "All head injuries should be ignored—even trivial ones."{{sfnp|Wason|Reich|1979}}

Phillips and colleagues have discussed other ''grammatical illusions'' with respect to [[attraction (grammar)|attraction]], [[Grammatical case|case]] in German, [[binding (linguistics)|binding]], and [[negative polarity items]]; speakers initially find such sentences acceptable, but later realize are ungrammatical.{{sfnp|Phillips|Wagers|Lau|2011|pp=156–164}}

* [[Center embedding]], which can produce sentences which are grammatical but are often viewed as unacceptable due to difficulty in parsing

In [[medicine]], a '''differential diagnosis''' is the distinguishing of a particular [[disease]] or condition from others that present similar clinical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=differential diagnosis|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/differential+diagnosis?show=0&amp;t=1419934834|website=Merriam-Webster (Medical dictionary)|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differential diagnostic procedures are used by [[physician]]s and other trained medical professionals to [[Medical diagnosis|diagnose]] the specific disease in a [[patient]], or, at least, to eliminate any imminently life-threatening conditions. Often, each individual option of a possible disease is called a differential diagnosis (e.g. acute [[bronchitis]] could be a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of a cough, even if the final diagnosis is [[common cold]]).

More generally, a '''differential diagnostic procedure''' is a systematic [[diagnostic method]] used to identify the presence of a [[disease entity]] where multiple alternatives are possible. This method is essentially a [[process of elimination]] or at least a process of obtaining information that shrinks the "probabilities" of candidate conditions to negligible levels, by using evidence such as symptoms, patient history, and medical knowledge to adjust [[Epistemology|epistemic]] confidences in the mind of the diagnostician (or, for computerized or computer-assisted diagnosis, the software of the system).

Differential diagnosis can be regarded as implementing aspects of the [[hypothetico-deductive method]], in the sense that the potential presence of candidate diseases or conditions can be viewed as hypotheses that physicians further determine as being true or false.

Common abbreviations of the term "differential diagnosis" include '''DDx''', '''ddx''', '''DD''', '''D/Dx''', '''ΔΔ''', or '''ΔΔ𝛘'''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A differential diagnosis is also commonly used within the field of psychiatry/psychology, where two different diagnoses can be attached to a patient who is exhibiting symptoms which could fit into either diagnosis. For example, a patient who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder may also be given a differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, given the similarity in the symptoms of both conditions. 

Strategies used in preparing a differential diagnosis list vary with experience of the healthcare provider. While novice providers may work systemically to assess all possible explanations for a patients concerns, those with more experience often draw on clinical experience and pattern recognition to protect the patient from delays, risks, and cost of inefficient strategies or tests. Effective providers utilize an evidence-based approach, complementing their clinical experience with knowledge from clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=MC |title=The Patient History: Evidence-Based Approach To Differential Diagnosis |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780071804202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard of care differential diagnosis has four steps. Patient safety requires that the physician: 
# Gathers all information about the patient and creates a symptoms list. The list can be in writing or in the physician's head, as long as they make a list.
# Lists all possible causes (''candidate conditions'') for the symptoms. Again, this can be in writing or in the physician's head but it must be done.
# Prioritizes the list by placing the most urgently dangerous possible causes at the top of the list.
# Rules out or treats possible causes, beginning with the most urgently dangerous condition and working down the list. ''Rule out''—practically—means use tests and other scientific methods to determine that a candidate condition has a clinically negligible probability of being the cause.

If no diagnosis remains, it means either that the physician made an error, or that the condition is undocumented. The physician removes diagnoses from the list by observing and applying tests that produce different results, depending on which diagnosis is correct.

==Specific methods==
There are several methods for differential diagnostic procedures, and several variants among those. Furthermore, a differential diagnostic procedure can be used concomitantly or alternately with protocols, guidelines, or other diagnostic procedures (such as pattern-recognition or using [[medical algorithm]]s).

For example, in case of [[medical emergency]], there may not be enough time to do any detailed calculations or estimations of different probabilities, in which case the [[ABC (medicine)|ABC protocol]] (''Airway, Breathing and Circulation'') may be more appropriate. Later, when the situation is less acute, a more comprehensive differential diagnostic procedure may be adopted.

The differential diagnostic procedure may be simplified if a "[[pathognomonic]]" sign or symptom is found (in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is present) or in the absence of a ''[[sine qua non]]'' sign or symptom (in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is absent).

A diagnostician can be selective, considering first those disorders that are more likely (a probabilistic approach), more serious if left undiagnosed and untreated (a prognostic approach), or more responsive to treatment if offered (a pragmatic approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Richardson | first1 = WS. | title = Users' Guides to the Medical Literature: XV. How to use an article about disease probability for differential diagnosis. | journal = JAMA| volume = 281| issue = 13 | pages = 1214–1219 |date=Mar 1999 | doi =  10.1001/jama.281.13.1214| PMID = 10199432 }} [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=189277]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the subjective probability of the presence of a condition is never exactly 100% or 0%, the differential diagnostic procedure may aim at specifying these various probabilities to form [[indication (medicine)|indications]] for further action.

The following are two methods of differential diagnosis, being based on epidemiology and likelihood ratios, respectively.

===Epidemiology-based method===
One method of performing a differential diagnosis by epidemiology aims to estimate the probability of each candidate condition by comparing their probabilities to have occurred in the first place in the individual. It is based on probabilities related both to the presentation (such as pain) and probabilities of the various candidate conditions (such as diseases).

====Theory====
The statistical basis for differential diagnosis is [[Bayes' theorem]]. As an analogy, when a [[dice|die]] has landed the outcome is certain by 100%, but the probability that it Would Have Occurred In the First Place (hereafter abbreviated WHOIFP) is still 1/6. In the same way, the probability that a presentation or condition would have occurred in the first place in an individual (WHOIFPI) is not same as the probability that the presentation or condition ''has'' occurred in the individual, because the presentation ''has'' occurred by 100% certainty in the individual. Yet, the contributive probability fractions of each condition are assumed the same, relatively:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\Pr(\text{Presentation is caused by condition in individual})}{\Pr(\text{Presentation has occurred in individual})} 
= \frac {\Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI by condition})}{\Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI})}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Pr(Presentation is caused by condition in individual) is the probability that the presentation is caused by condition in the individual ''condition'' without further specification refers to any candidate condition
* Pr(Presentation has occurred in individual) is the probability that the presentation has occurred in the individual, which can be perceived and thereby set at 100%
* Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition) is the probability that the presentation Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual by condition
* Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI) is the probability that the presentation Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual

When an individual presents with a symptom or sign, Pr(Presentation has occurred in individual) is 100% and can therefore be replaced by 1, and can be ignored since division by 1 does not make any difference:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{Presentation is caused by condition in individual}) = \frac {\Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI by condition})}{\Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI})}&lt;/math&gt;

The total probability of the presentation to have occurred in the individual can be approximated as the sum of the individual candidate conditions:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI}) &amp; = \Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI by condition 1}) \\
&amp; {} + \Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI by condition 2}) \\
&amp; {} + \Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI by condition 3}) + \text{etc.} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the probability of the presentation to have been caused by any candidate condition is proportional to the probability of the condition, depending on what rate it causes the presentation:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{Presentation WHOIFPI by condition}) = \Pr(\text{Condition WHOIFPI}) \cdot r_{\text{condition} \rightarrow \text{presentation}},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition) is the probability that the presentation Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual by condition
* Pr(Condition WHOIFPI) is the probability that the condition Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual
* ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Condition → presentation&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate for which a condition causes the presentation, that is, the fraction of people with condition that manifest with the presentation.

The probability that a condition would have occurred in the first place in an individual is approximately equal to that of a population that is as similar to the individual as possible except for the current presentation, compensated where possible by [[relative risk]]s given by known [[risk factor]] that distinguish the individual from the population:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{Condition WHOIFPI}) \approx RR_\text{condition} \cdot \Pr(\text{Condition in population}),&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Pr(Condition WHOIFPI) is the probability that the condition Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual
* ''RR''&lt;sub&gt;condition&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative risk]] for condition conferred by known [[risk factor]]s in the individual that are not present in the population
* Pr(Condition in population) is the probability that the condition occurs in a population that is as similar to the individual as possible except for the presentation

The following table demonstrates how these relations can be made for a series of candidate conditions:

{| class="wikitable"
|  || Candidate condition 1 || Candidate condition 2 || Candidate condition 3
|-
| Pr(Condition in population) || Pr(Condition 1 in population) || Pr(Condition 2 in population) || Pr(Condition 3 in population)
|-
| ''RR''&lt;sub&gt;condition&lt;/sub&gt; || ''RR''&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''RR''&lt;sub&gt; 2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''RR''&lt;sub&gt; 3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Pr(Condition WHOIFPI) || Pr(Condition 1 WHOIFPI) || Pr(Condition 2 WHOIFPI) || ''P(Condition 3 WHOIFPI)'' 
|-
| ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Condition &amp;rarr; presentation&lt;/sub&gt; || ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Condition 1 &amp;rarr; presentation&lt;/sub&gt; || ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Condition 2 &amp;rarr; presentation&lt;/sub&gt; || ''r''&lt;sub&gt;Condition 3 &amp;rarr; presentation&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition) || Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition 1) || Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition 2) || Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition 3)

|-
| Pr(Presentation is caused by condition in individual) || Pr(Presentation is caused by condition 1 in individual) || Pr(Presentation is caused by condition 2 in individual) || Pr(Presentation is caused by condition 3 in individual)
|}

One additional "candidate condition" is the instance of there being no abnormality, and the presentation is only a (usually relatively unlikely) appearance of a basically normal state. Its probability in the population (''P(No abnormality in population)'') is complementary to the sum of probabilities of "abnormal" candidate conditions.

====Example====
This example case demonstrates how this method is applied, but does not represent a guideline for handling similar real-world cases. Also, the example uses relatively specified numbers with sometimes several [[decimal]]s, while in reality, there are often simply rough estimations, such as of likelihoods being  ''very high'', ''high'', ''low'' or ''very low'', but still using the general principles of the method.

For an individual (who becomes the "patient" in this example), a [[blood test]] of, for example, [[serum calcium]] shows a result above the [[standard reference range]], which, by most definitions, classifies as [[hypercalcemia]], which becomes the "presentation" in this case. A physician (who becomes the "diagnostician" in this example), who does not currently see the patient, gets to know about his finding.

By practical reasons, the physician considers that there is enough [[Indications of medical tests|test indication]] to have a look at the patient’s [[medical record]]s. For simplicity, let’s say that the only information given in the medical records is a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of [[primary hyperparathyroidism]] (here abbreviated as PH), which may explain the finding of hypercalcemia. For this patient, let’s say that the resultant hereditary [[risk factor]] is estimated to confer a [[relative risk]] of 10 (RR&lt;sub&gt;PH&lt;/sub&gt; = 10).

The physician considers that there is enough motivation to perform a differential diagnostic procedure for the finding of hypercalcemia. The main causes of hypercalcemia are [[primary hyperparathyroidism]] (PH) and [[cancer]], so for simplicity, the list of candidate conditions that the physician could think of can be given as:
* Primary hyperparathyroidism (PH)
* Cancer
* Other diseases that the physician could think of (which is simply termed "other conditions" for the rest of this example)
* No disease (or no abnormality), and the finding is caused entirely by [[statistical variability]]

The probability that 'primary hyperparathyroidism' (PH) would have occurred in the first place in the individual (''P(PH WHOIFPI)'') can be calculated as follows:

Let’s say that the last blood test taken by the patient was half a year ago and was normal, and that the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in a general population that appropriately matches the individual (except for the presentation and mentioned heredity) is 1 in 4000 per year. Ignoring more detailed retrospective analyses (such as including speed of disease progress and [[lag time of medical diagnosis]]), the [[time-at-risk]] for having developed primary hyperparathyroidism can roughly be regarded as being the last half-year, because a previously developed hypercalcemia would probably have been caught up by the previous blood test. This corresponds to a probability of primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) in the population of:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{PH in population}) = 0.5\text{ years} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{4000 per year}} = \frac{1}{8000}&lt;/math&gt;

With the relative risk conferred from the family history, the probability that primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) would have occurred in the first place in the individual given from the currently available information becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{PH WHOIFPI}) \approx RR_{PH}\cdot \Pr(\text{PH in population}) = 10 \cdot \frac {1}{8000} = \frac {1}{800} = 0.00125 &lt;/math&gt;

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be assumed to cause hypercalcemia essentially 100% of the time (r&lt;sub&gt;PH &amp;rarr; hypercalcemia&lt;/sub&gt; = 1), so this independently calculated probability of primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) can be assumed to be the same as the probability of being a cause of the presentation:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \Pr(\text{Hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by PH}) &amp; = \Pr(\text{PH WHOIFPI}) \cdot r_{\text{PH} \rightarrow \text{hypercalcemia}} \\
&amp; = 0.00125 \cdot 1 = 0.00125 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For '''cancer''', the same time-at-risk is assumed for simplicity, and let’s say that the incidence of cancer in the area is estimated at 1 in 250 per year, giving a population probability of cancer of:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{cancer in population}) = 0.5\text{ years} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{250 per year}} = \frac{1}{500}&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, let’s say that any association between a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism and risk of cancer is ignored, so the relative risk for the individual to have contracted cancer in the first place is similar to that of the population (RR&lt;sub&gt;cancer&lt;/sub&gt; = 1):

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{cancer WHOIFPI}) \approx RR_\text{cancer} \cdot \Pr(\text{cancer in population}) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{500} = \frac{1}{500} = 0.002.  &lt;/math&gt;

However, hypercalcemia only occurs in, very approximately, 10% of cancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Seccareccia | first1 = D. | title = Cancer-related hypercalcemia. | journal = Can Fam Physician | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–6, e90-2 |date=Mar 2010 | doi =  | PMID = 20228307 | pmc=2837688}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837688/] [http://www.cfp.ca/content/56/3/244.full]&lt;/ref&gt; (r&lt;sub&gt;cancer &amp;rarr; hypercalcemia&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1), so:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \Pr(\text{Hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by cancer}) \\
= &amp; \Pr(\text{cancer WHOIFPI}) \cdot r_{\text{cancer} \rightarrow \text{hypercalcemia}} \\ = &amp; 0.002 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0002. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The probabilities that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place by other candidate conditions can be calculated in a similar manner. However, for simplicity, let’s say that the probability that any of these would have occurred in the first place is calculated at 0.0005 in this example.

For the instance of there being '''no disease''', the corresponding probability in the population is complementary to the sum of probabilities for other conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr(\text{no disease in population}) &amp; = 1 - \Pr(\text{PH in population}) - \Pr(\text{cancer in population}) \\
&amp; {} \quad - \Pr(\text{other conditions in population}) \\
&amp; {} = 0.997.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability that the individual would be healthy in the first place can be assumed to be the same:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{no disease WHOIFPI}) = 0.997. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The rate at which the case of no abnormal condition still ends up in a measurement of serum calcium of being above the [[standard reference range]] (thereby classifying as hypercalcemia) is, by the definition of standard reference range, less than 2.5%. However, this probability can be further specified by considering how much the measurement deviates from the mean in the standard reference range. Let’s say that the serum calcium measurement was 1.30&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, which, with a standard reference range established at 1.05 to 1.25&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, corresponds to a standard score of 3 and a corresponding probability of 0.14% that such degree of hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the case of no abnormality:

: &lt;math&gt; r_{\text{no disease} \rightarrow \text{hypercalcemia}}  = 0.0014 &lt;/math&gt;

Subsequently, the probability that hypercalcemia would have resulted from no disease can be calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} &amp; \Pr(\text{Hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by no disease}) \\
= &amp; \Pr(\text{no disease WHOIFPI}) \cdot r_{\text{no disease} \rightarrow \text{hypercalcemia}} \\
= &amp; 0.997 \cdot 0.0014 \approx 0.0014 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the individual can thus be calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI}) \\
= &amp; \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by PH}) + \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by cancer}) \\
&amp; {} + \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by other conditions}) + \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by no disease}) \\
= &amp; 0.00125 + 0.0002 + 0.0005 + 0.0014 = 0.00335 \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Subsequently, the probability that hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) in the individual can be calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia is caused by PH in individual}) \\
= &amp; \frac {\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by PH})}{\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI})} \\
= &amp; \frac {0.00125}{0.00335} = 0.373 = 37.3\% \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the probability that hypercalcemia is caused by cancer in the individual can be calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} &amp; \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia is caused by cancer in individual}) \\
= &amp; \frac {\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by cancer})}{\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI})} \\
= &amp; \frac {0.0002}{0.00335} = 0.060 = 6.0\%, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and for other candidate conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia is caused by other conditions in individual}) \\
= &amp; \frac {\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by other conditions})}{\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI})} \\
= &amp; \frac {0.0005}{0.00335} = 0.149 = 14.9\%, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the probability that there actually is no disease:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; \Pr(\text{hypercalcemia is present despite no disease in individual}) \\
= &amp; \frac {\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI by no disease})}{\Pr(\text{hypercalcemia WHOIFPI})} \\
= &amp; \frac {0.0014}{0.00335} = 0.418= 41.8\% \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For clarification, these calculations are given as the table in the method description:

{| class="wikitable"
|  || PH || Cancer || Other conditions || No disease
|-
| ''P(Condition in population)''  || 0.000125 || 0.002 || - || 0.997
|-
| RR&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; || 10 || 1 || - || - 
|-

|-
| P(hypercalcemia is caused by condition in individual) || 37.3% || 6.0% || 14.9% || 41.8%
|}

Thus, this method estimates that the probabilities that the hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions or no disease at all are 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, which may be used in estimating further test indications.

This case is continued in the example of the method described in the next section.
{{anchor|profile-relative probability}}

===Likelihood ratio-based method===
The procedure of differential diagnosis can become extremely complex when fully taking additional tests and treatments into consideration. One method that is somewhat a tradeoff between being clinically perfect and being relatively simple to calculate is one that uses [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratios]] to derive subsequent post-test likelihoods.

====Theory====
The initial likelihoods for each candidate condition can be estimated by various methods, such as:
*By epidemiology as described in previous section. 
*By clinic-specific [[pattern recognition]], such as statistically knowing that patients coming into a particular clinic with a particular complaint statistically has a particular likelihood of each candidate condition.

One method of estimating likelihoods even after further tests uses [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratios]] (which is derived from [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivities and specificities]]) as a multiplication factor after each test or procedure. In an ideal world, sensitivities and specificities would be established for all tests for all possible pathological conditions. In reality, however, these parameters may only be established for one of the candidate conditions. Multiplying with likelihood ratios necessitates conversion of likelihoods from [[probabilities]] to ''[[odds in favor]]'' (hereafter simply termed “odds”) by:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{odds} = \frac{\text{probability}}{1-\text{probability}}&lt;/math&gt;

However, only the candidate conditions with known likelihood ratio need this conversion. After multiplication, conversion back to probability is calculated by:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{probability} = \frac{\text{odds}}{\text{odds}+1} &lt;/math&gt;

The rest of the candidate conditions (for which there is no established likelihood ratio for the test at hand) can, for simplicity, be adjusted by subsequently multiplying all candidate conditions with a common factor to again yield a sum of 100%.

The resulting probabilities are used for estimating the [[Indication (medicine)|indications]] for further [[medical test]]s, treatments or other actions. If there is an indication for an additional test, and it returns with a result, then the procedure is repeated using the likelihood ratio of the additional test. With updated probabilities for each of the candidate conditions, the indications for further tests, treatments or other actions changes as well, and so the procedure can be repeated until an ''end point'' where there no longer is any indication for currently performing further actions. Such an end point mainly occurs when one candidate condition becomes so certain that no test can be found that is powerful enough to change the relative probability-profile enough to motivate any change in further actions. Tactics for reaching such an end point with as few tests as possible includes making tests with high [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] for conditions of already outstandingly high-profile-relative probability, because the high [[likelihood ratio positive]] for such tests is very high, bringing all less likely conditions to relatively lower probabilities. Alternatively, tests with high [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] for competing candidate conditions have a high [[likelihood ratio negative]], potentially bringing the probabilities for competing candidate conditions to negligible levels. If such negligible probabilities are achieved, the physician can rule out these conditions, and continue the differential diagnostic procedure with only the remaining candidate conditions.

====Example====
This example continues for the same patient as in the example for the epidemiology-based method. As with the previous example of epidemiology-based method, this example case is made to demonstrate how this method is applied, but does not represent a guideline for handling similar real-world cases. Also, the example uses relatively specified numbers, while in reality, there are often just rough estimations. In this example, the probabilities for each candidate condition were established by an epidemiology-based method to be as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|  || [[primary hyperparathyroidism|PH]] || Cancer || Other conditions || No disease
|-
| Probability || 37.3% || 6.0% || 14.9% || 41.8%
|}

These percentages could also have been established by experience at the particular clinic by knowing that these are the percentages for final diagnosis for people presenting to the clinic with hypercalcemia and having a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The condition of highest profile-relative probability (except “no disease”) is [[primary hyperparathyroidism]] (PH), but cancer is still of major concern, because if it is the actual causative condition for the hypercalcemia, then the choice of whether to treat or not likely means life or death for the patient, in effect potentially putting the [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] at a similar level for further tests for both of these conditions.

Here, let’s say that the physician considers the profile-relative probabilities of being of enough concern to indicate sending the patient a call for a [[doctor's visit]], with an additional visit to the [[medical laboratory]] for an additional blood test complemented with further analyses, including [[parathyroid hormone]] for the suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism.

For simplicity, let’s say that the doctor first receives the blood test (in formulas abbreviated as “BT”) result for the parathyroid hormone analysis, and that it showed a parathyroid hormone level that is elevated relatively to what would be expected by the calcium level.

Such a constellation can be estimated to have a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of approximately 70% and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of approximately 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/34/12/2439.pdf] {{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confers a [[likelihood ratio positive]] of 7 for primary hyperparathyroidism.

The probability of primary hyperparathyroidism is now termed ''Pre-BT&lt;sub&gt;PH&lt;/sub&gt;'' because it corresponds to before the blood test (Latin preposition ''prae'' means before). It was estimated at 37.3%, corresponding to an odds of 0.595. With the likelihood ratio positive of 7 for the blood test, the [[wiktionary:post-|post-]]&lt;nowiki&gt;test&lt;/nowiki&gt; odds is calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Odds}(\text{PostBT}_{PH}) = \operatorname{Odds}(\text{PreBT}_{PH}) \cdot LH(BT) = 0.595 \cdot 7 = 4.16,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''Odds(PostBT&lt;sub&gt;PH&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is the odds for primary hyperparathyroidism after the blood test for parathyroid hormone
*''Odds(PreBT&lt;sub&gt;PH&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the odds in favor of primary hyperparathyroidism before the blood test for parathyroid hormone 
*''LH(BT)'' is the [[likelihood ratio positive]] for the blood test for parathyroid hormone

An Odds(PostBT&lt;sub&gt;PH&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4.16 is again converted to the corresponding probability by:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{PostBT}_{PH}) = \frac{\operatorname{Odds}(\text{PostBT}_{PH})}{ \operatorname{Odds}(\text{PostBT}_{PH}) + 1} = \frac{4.16}{4.16+1} = 0.806 = 80.6\%&lt;/math&gt;

The sum of the probabilities for the rest of the candidate conditions should therefore be:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{PostBT}_{rest}) = 100\% - 80.6\% = 19.4\%&lt;/math&gt;

Before the blood test for parathyroid hormone, the sum of their probabilities were:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{PreBT}_\text{rest}) = 6.0\% + 14.9\% + 41.8\% = 62.7\% &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, to conform to a sum of 100% for all candidate conditions, each of the other candidates must be multiplied by a correcting factor:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Correcting factor} = \frac{\Pr(\text{PostBT}_\text{rest})}{\Pr(\text{PreBT}_\text{rest})} = \frac{19.4}{62.7} = 0.309&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the probability of cancer after the test is calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pr(\text{PostBT}_\text{cancer}) = \Pr(\text{PreBT}_\text{cancer}) \cdot \text{Correcting factor} = 6.0\% \cdot 0.309 = 1.9\%&lt;/math&gt;

The probabilities for each candidate conditions before and after the blood test are given in following table:
{| class="wikitable"
|  || [[primary hyperparathyroidism|PH]] || Cancer || Other conditions || No disease
|-
| P(PreBT) || 37.3% || 6.0% || 14.9% || 41.8%
|-
| P(PostBT) || 80.6% || 1.9% || 4.6% || 12.9%
|}

These “new” percentages, including a profile-relative probability of 80% for primary hyperparathyroidism, underlie any indications for further tests, treatments or other actions. In this case, let's say that the physician continues the plan for the patient to attend a [[doctor's visit]] for further checkup, especially focused at primary hyperparathyroidism.

A doctor's visit can, theoretically, be regarded as a series of tests, including both questions in a [[medical history]] as well as components of a [[physical examination]], where the [[post-test probability]] of a previous test can be used as the [[pre-test probability]] of the next. The indications for choosing the next test is dynamically influenced by the results of previous tests.

Let's say that the patient in this example is revealed to have at least some of the symptoms and signs of depression, bone pain, joint pain or constipation of more severerity than what would be expected by the hypercalcemia itself, supporting the suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and let's say that the likelihood ratios for the tests, when multiplied together, roughly results in a product of 6 for primary hyperparathyroidism.

The presence of unspecific pathologic symptoms and signs in the history and examination are often concurrently indicative of cancer as well, and let's say that the tests gave an overall likelihood ratio estimated at 1.5 for cancer. For other conditions, as well as the instance of not having any disease at all, let’s say that it’s unknown how they are affected by the tests at hand, as often happens in reality. This gives the following results for the history and physical examination (abbreviated as P&amp;E):

{| class="wikitable"
|  || [[primary hyperparathyroidism|PH]] || Cancer || Other conditions || No disease
|-
| P(PreH&amp;E) || 80.6% || 1.9% || 4.6% || 12.9%

|}

These probabilities after the history and examination may make the physician confident enough to plan the patient for surgery for a [[parathyroidectomy]] to resect the affected tissue.

At this point, the probability of "other conditions" is so low that the physician cannot think of any test for them that could make a difference that would be substantial enough to form an [[indication of medical tests|indication for such a test]], and the physician thereby practically regards "other conditions" as ruled out, in this case not primarily by any specific test for such other conditions that were negative, but rather by the absence of positive tests so far.

For "cancer", the cutoff at which to confidently regard it as ruled out may be more stringent because of severe consequences of missing it, so the physician may consider that at least a [[Histopathology|histopathologic examination]] of the resected tissue is indicated.

This case is continued in the example of ''Combinations'' in corresponding section below.

==Coverage of candidate conditions==
The validity of both the initial estimation of probabilities by epidemiology and further workup by likelihood ratios are dependent of inclusion of candidate conditions that are responsible for as large part as possible of the probability of having developed the condition, and it is clinically important to include those where relatively fast initiation of therapy is most likely to result in greatest benefit. If an important candidate condition is missed, no method of differential diagnosis will supply the correct conclusion. The need to find more candidate conditions for inclusion increases with increasing severity of the presentation itself. For example, if the only presentation is a deviating laboratory parameter and all common harmful underlying conditions have been ruled out, then it may be acceptable to stop finding more candidate conditions, but this would much more likely be unacceptable if the presentation would have been severe pain.

==Combinations==
If two conditions get high post-test probabilities, especially if the sum of the probabilities for conditions with known likelihood ratios become higher than 100%, then the actual condition is a combination of the two. In such cases, that combined condition can be added to the list of candidate conditions, and the calculations should start over from the beginning.

To continue the example used above, let's say that the history and physical examination was indicative of cancer as well, with a likelihood ratio of 3, giving an Odds(PostH&amp;E) of 0.057, corresponding to a P(PostH&amp;E) of 5.4%. This would correspond to a “Sum of known P(PostH&amp;E)” of 101.5%. This is an indication for considering a combination of primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer, such as, in this case, a parathyroid hormone-producing [[parathyroid carcinoma]]. A recalculation may therefore be needed, with the first two conditions being separated into “primary hyperparathyroidism without cancer”, “cancer without primary hyperparathyroidism” as well as “combined primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer”, and likelihood ratios being applied to each condition separately. In this case, however, tissue has already been resected, wherein a [[Histopathology|histopathologic examination]] can be performed that includes the possibility of parathyroid carcinoma in the examination (which may entail appropriate sample [[staining]]). 
Let’s say that the histopathologic examination confirms primary hyperparathyroidism, but also showed a malignant pattern. By an initial method by epidemiology, the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma is estimated at about 1 in 6 million people per year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/parathyroid/HealthProfessional/page1 Parathyroid Cancer Treatment] at National Cancer Institute. Last Modified: 03/11/2009&lt;/ref&gt; giving a very low probability before taking any tests into consideration. In comparison, the probability that a non-malignant primary hyperparathyroidism would have occurred at the same time as an unrelated non-carcinoma cancer that presents with malignant cells in the parathyroid gland is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the two. The resultant probability is, however, much smaller than the 1 in 6 million. Therefore, the probability of parathyroid carcinoma may still be close to 100% after histopathologic examination despite the low probability of occurring in the first place.

==Machine differential diagnosis==
{{Further information|Clinical decision support system}}
Machine differential diagnosis is the use of [[computer software]] to partly or fully make a differential diagnosis. It may be regarded as an [[application of artificial intelligence]].

Many studies demonstrate improvement of quality of care and reduction of medical errors by using such decision support systems. Some of these systems are designed for a specific medical problem such as schizophrenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Razzouk, D. |author2=Mari, J.

However, these tools all still require advanced medical skills to rate symptoms and choose additional tests to deduce the probabilities of different diagnoses. Machine differential diagnosis is also currently unable to diagnose multiple concurrent disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wadhwa, R.R.|author2=Park, D.Y.|author3=Natowicz, M.R.|title=The accuracy of computer‐based diagnostic tools for the identification of concurrent genetic disorders|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|pages=1-6|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.40651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-professionals should still see a [[health care provider]] for a proper diagnosis.

==History==
The method of differential diagnosis was first suggested for use in the diagnosis of mental disorders by [[Emil Kraepelin]]. It is more systematic than the old-fashioned method of diagnosis by ''[[Gestalt therapy|gestalt]]'' (impression).{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Alternative medical meanings==
'Differential diagnosis' is also used more loosely, to refer simply to a list of the most common causes of a given symptom, to a list of disorders similar to a given disorder, or to such lists when they are annotated with advice on how to narrow the list down (the book 'French's Index of Differential Diagnosis', {{ISBN|0-340-81047-5}}, is an example). Thus, a differential diagnosis in this sense is medical information specially organized to aid in diagnosis.

==Usage apart from in medicine==
Methods similar to those of differential diagnostic processes in medicine are also used by biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] to identify and classify organisms, living and extinct. For example, after finding an unknown species, there can first be a listing of all potential species, followed by ruling out of one by one until, optimally, only one potential choice remains.
Similar procedures may be used by plant and maintenance engineers, automotive mechanics, and used to be used in diagnosing faulty electronic circuitry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">'''Eiliv Skard''' (19 October 1898 &amp;ndash; 30 September 1978) was a Norwegian [[classical philology|classical philologist]].

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Levanger]] as a son of educators [[Matias Skard]] (1846–1927) and Gyda Christensen (1868–1916). The family moved to [[Kristiansand]] in 1901. He was a nephew of [[Johannes Skar]] and [[Christopher Bruun]], a brother of [[Bjarne Skard|Bjarne]] and [[Sigmund Skard]] and a half-brother of [[Olav Skard|Olav]] and [[Torfinn Skard]]. When Sigmund Skard married [[Åse Gruda Skard]], Åsa became Eiliv's sister-in-law.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Eiliv Skard|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Egil|last=Kraggerud|authorlink=Egil Kraggerud|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Eiliv_Skard/utdypning|language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 he married teacher Sigrid Nordang (1903–1988). They had met in Gudbrandsdalen in the same year.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Career==
He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education at [[Kristiansand Cathedral School]] in 1916, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in 1922. He worked at the secondary schools in [[Hornnes]] from 1922 to 1924 and [[Orkdal]] 1925 to 1929. He was a [[Latin language|Latin]] teacher at the university from 1929, having specialized in [[classical philology]] during studies in Germany, Italy and Greece. He took the [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1931 on the thesis ''Zwei religiös-politische Begriffe. Euergetes. Concordia''. When writing in Norwegian, he used the [[Nynorsk]] form. In 1934 he was promoted to professor of classical philology at the Royal Frederick University (from 1939: the University of Oslo).&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In the [[interwar period]] Skard marked himself as an [[anti-fascism|opponent of Fascism]], first and foremost as a follower of the [[Oxford Group]]. When [[Operation Weserübung|Nazi Germany invaded Norway]] in 1940, Skard participated in the [[Norwegian Campaign|fighting]] in [[Gudbrandsdalen]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Germany won, but one of many civil protests ensued when the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Nøkleby |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Nøkleby |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=Universitetet |language=Norwegian |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit Nøkleby|Nøkleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[Øystein Sørensen|Sørensen]] |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/u/u1.html#universitetet |accessdate=3 January 2010 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn= |page= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810224816/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/u/u1.html#universitetet |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff [[Johannes Andenæs]], [[Bjørn Føyn]], [[Johan Christian Schreiner]], [[Harald Krabbe Schjelderup]], [[Anatol Heintz]], [[Odd Hassel]], [[Ragnar Frisch]], [[Carl Jacob Arnholm]], [[Endre Berner]] and Eiliv Skard were sent to [[Grini concentration camp]]. Skard was first incarcerated at [[Bredtvet concentration camp|Bredtveit]] from 15 October to 22 November, then at [[Berg concentration camp|Berg]] until 8 December, then at Grini until 5 May 1945.&lt;ref name=fangeleks&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Norsk fangeleksikon.

After the war Skard returned as professor, and was dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1947 to 1952. On 1 February 1948 he became professor of the [[history of ideas]] with emphasis on the [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]]. He edited the journal ''Symbolae Osloenses'', and his most notable books were ''Filosofien i oldtiden'' (1951) and the three-volume anthology ''Vestens tenkere'' (1962) which he edited together with [[Andreas Hofgaard Winsnes]]. He died in September 1978 in Oslo.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2882">The '''Financial Modelers' Manifesto''' was a proposal for more responsibility in [[risk management]] and [[quantitative finance]] written by [[quantitative finance|financial engineers]] [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Paul Wilmott]]. The manifesto includes a Modelers' [[Hippocratic Oath]]. The structure of the Financial Modelers' Manifesto mirrors that of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' of 1848.

The Manifesto and Oath were written in response to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] with the collapse of [[subprime mortgage]]s. A shortened version was published in [[Business Week]]&lt;ref&gt;"Financial Models Must Be Clean and Simple", Business Week, December 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2008 with the complete version &lt;ref&gt;"Financial-Modelers-Manifesto", wilmott.com, January 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; appearing shortly afterwards; the full text is available here[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/oekonomi/ECON4135/h09/undervisningsmateriale/FinancialModelersManifesto.pdf].

Note that both authors had written extensively about the risks related to [[financial modeling|financial models]] for several years before the crisis; for example:

Emanuel Derman in 1996:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/gs-model_risk.pdf ''Model Risk'']&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There are always implicit assumptions behind a model and its solution method. But human beings have limited foresight and great imagination, so that, inevitably, a model will be used in ways its creator never intended. This is especially true in trading environments… but it’s also a matter of principle: you just cannot foresee everything. So, even a “correct” model, “correctly” solved, can lead to problems. The more complex the model, the greater this possibility."

Paul Wilmott in 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/358/1765/63.full.pdf+html ''The Use, Misuse and Abuse of Mathematics in Finance'']&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Unfortunately, as the mathematics of finance reaches higher levels so the level of common sense seems to drop. There have been some well publicised cases of large losses sustained by companies because of their lack of understanding of financial instruments…. It is clear that a major rethink is desperately required if the world is to avoid a mathematician-led market meltdown."

In psychology, '''graphorrhea''' or '''graphorrhoea''' is a communication disorder, expressed by excessive wordiness with minor or sometimes incoherent rambling, specifically in written work. Graphorrhea is sometimes classified as a mental illness, resulting in a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders including [[aphasia]], localized cortical lesions in the thalamus, mania, or most typically in catatonic schizophrenia. Some ramblings may follow all/any grammatical rule(s) but still leave the reader confused and unsure about what the piece is about.

In [[Internet slang]], a '''troll''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|oʊ|l|,_|t|r|ɒ|l}}) is a person who starts quarrels or upsets people on the [[Internet]] to distract and sow discord
by posting inflammatory and digressive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Definition of troll | work=Collins English Dictionary | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/troll | accessdate=17 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikt:extraneous#Adjective|extraneous]], or [[off-topic]] messages in an [[online community]] (such as a [[newsgroup]], [[internet forum|forum]], [[chat room]], or blog) with the [[Bullying culture|intent of provoking]] readers into displaying [[emotion]]al responses&lt;ref name="PCMAG_def"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.

Both the noun and the verb form of "troll" is associated with Internet discourse. However, the word has also been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with [[online harassment]]. For example, the mass media have used "troll" to mean "a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trolling:TheTodayShowExplorestheDarkSideoftheInternet /&gt; In addition, depictions of trolling have been included in popular fictional works, such as the [[HBO]] [[television program]] ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]'', in which a main character encounters harassing persons online and tries to infiltrate their circles by posting negative sexual comments.

== Usage ==
[[File:DoNotFeedTroll.svg|thumb|The advice to [[:wikt:ignore|ignore]] rather than engage with a troll is sometimes phrased as "Please do not feed the trolls."]]

Application of the term ''troll'' is [[Subjectivity|subjective]]. Some readers may characterize a post as ''trolling'', while others may regard the same post as a legitimate contribution to the discussion, even if controversial. Like any [[pejorative]] term, it can be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack, suggesting a negative motivation.

As noted in an ''OS News'' article titled "Why People Troll and How to Stop Them" (25 January 2012), "The traditional definition of trolling includes intent. That is, trolls purposely disrupt forums. This definition is too narrow. Whether someone intends to disrupt a thread or not, the results are the same if they do."&lt;ref name="Howard Fosdick"&gt;{{cite news|journal=OS News|title=Why People Troll and How to Stop Them|first= Howard |last=Fosdick|date=25 January 2012 &lt;!-- 06:58 UTC--&gt;|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/25540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tastam90, Message # 369489"&gt;{{cite news|journal=CollegeNET|title=Terminology: Trolling in CNet?!?|author= Tastam90, Message # 369489 |date= 9 June 2013 &lt;!-- at 8:32 AM PDT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have addressed the same issue, e.g., Claire Hardaker, in her Ph.D. thesis&lt;ref name="Tastam90, Message # 369489" /&gt; "Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hardaker | first1 = C. | doi = 10.1515/JPLR.2010.011 | title = Trolling in asynchronous computer-mediated communication: From user discussions to academic definitions | journal = Journal of Politeness Research.

Regardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical, communities. Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore it,{{citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=It is commonly said to be the most effective way, but are there any studies, or only anecdotes?}} because responding tends to encourage trolls to continue disruptive posts{{spaced ndash}}hence the often-seen warning: "Please do not feed the trolls".

The "trollface" is an image occasionally used to indicate trolling in Internet culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/a019344/Trollface-hack-strikes-PlayStation-3-PSU-community-member-reports-XMB-weirdness|title=Trollface hack strikes PlayStation 3?

At times the word can be abused to refer to anyone with controversial opinions they disagree with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/12/i_m_not_a_troll_why_does_everyone_on_the_internet_keep_calling_me_one.html|title = Stop Calling Me a Troll|last = Manjoo|first = Farhad|date = 5 December 2012|work = Slate|access-date = 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such usage goes against the ordinary meaning of troll in multiple ways. While psychologists have determined that the [[dark triad]] traits are common among Internet trolls, some observers claim trolls don't actually believe the controversial views they claim. [[Farhad Manjoo]] criticises this view, noting that if the person really is trolling, they are more intelligent than their critics would believe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
There are competing theories of where and when "troll" was first used in Internet slang, with numerous unattested accounts of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] and [[UseNet]] origins in the early 1980s or before.

The English noun "troll" in the standard sense of ugly dwarf or giant dates to 1610 and comes from the [[Old Norse]] word "[[troll]]" meaning [[giant (mythology)|giant]] or [[demon]].&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{OEtymD|troll||accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word evokes the trolls of [[Scandinavian folklore]] and children's tales: antisocial, quarrelsome and slow-witted creatures which make life difficult for travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ln|title=Trollmother|url=http://trollmother.com/index.php/trollhistory|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trolls. Who are they?|url=http://csis.pace.edu/grendel/projs991a/troll.html|publisher=unknown|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English usage, "[[Trolling (fishing)|trolling]]" may describe the [[Fishing techniques|fishing technique]] of slowly dragging a lure or baited hook from a moving boat&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/troll|title=troll|year=2010|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''[[trawling]]'' describes the generally commercial act of dragging a fishing net. Early non-Internet slang use of "trolling" can be found in the military: by 1972 the term "trolling for [[Mikoyan|MiGs]]" was documented in use by [[US Navy]] pilots in [[Vietnam]].

The context of the quote cited in the ''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;ref name="ChanAFU" /&gt; sets the origin in [[Usenet]] in the early 1990s as in the phrase "trolling for newbies", as used in ''alt.folklore.urban'' (AFU).&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book| last=Tepper| first=Michele| title=Internet culture| editor=Porter, David| publisher=Routledge Inc| location=New York, New York, United States| year=1997| chapter=Usenet Communities and the Cultural Politics of Information| page=48| quote=...&amp;nbsp;the two most notorious trollers in AFU, Ted Frank and Snopes, are also two of the most consistent posters of serious research.| isbn=978-0-415-91683-7| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5d2stzIbkqMC| accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CromarAFU"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.urban/9gXNdotYPVc/TaD3xbBv-IAJ| title=Trolling for Newbies| newsgroup=alt.folklore.urban|message-id=Oct.9.10.26.26.1992.22869@math.rutgers.edu| date=9 October 1992| author=Cromar, Scott| quote=Some people call this game trolling for newbies| accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, what is meant is a relatively gentle inside joke by veteran users, presenting questions or topics that had been so overdone that only a new user would respond to them earnestly. For example, a veteran of the group might make a post on the [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] that [[Glass#Behavior of antique glass|glass flows over time]]. Long-time readers would both recognize the poster's name and know that the topic had been discussed repeatedly, but new subscribers to the group would not realize, and would thus respond. These types of trolls served as a practice to identify group insiders. This definition of trolling, considerably narrower than the modern understanding of the term, was considered a positive contribution.&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDope"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1764/what-is-a-troll| title=What is a troll?|last=Zotti|first=Ed| date=14 April 2000| publisher=The Straight Dope| accessdate=24 March 2009| quote=To be fair, not all trolls are slimeballs.

By the late 1990s, ''alt.folklore.urban'' had such heavy traffic and participation that trolling of this sort was frowned upon. Others expanded the term to include the practice of playing a seriously misinformed or deluded user, even in [[newsgroup]]s where one was not a regular; these were often attempts at humor rather than provocation. The noun ''troll'' usually referred to an act of trolling – or to the resulting discussion – rather than to the author, though some posts punned on the dual meaning of ''troll.''&lt;ref name="WilburAFU"&gt;{{cite newsgroup| url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.folklore.urban/DjYm8Usd4TQ/oEDd8GixmQAJ| title=AFU REALLY REALLY WAY SOUTH| newsgroup=alt.folklore.urban|message-id=1993Feb8.010006.1589@Csli.Stanford.EDU| date=8 February 1993| author=Wilbur, Tom| quote=Tom "nice troll, by the way" Wilbur| accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other languages ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], trolling is referred to as ''bái mù'' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:白目|白目]]|l=white eye}}), which can be straightforwardly explained as "eyes without pupils", in the sense that whilst the [[pupil]] of the eye is used for vision, the white section of the eye cannot see, and trolling involves blindly talking nonsense over the Internet, having total disregard to sensitivities or being oblivious to the situation at hand, akin to having eyes without pupils. An alternative term is ''bái làn'' ({{zh|c=白爛|l=white rot}}), which describes a post completely nonsensical and full of folly made to upset others, and derives from a Taiwanese slang term for the [[Human male genitalia|male genitalia]], where genitalia that is pale white in colour represents that someone is young, and thus foolish. Both terms originate from [[Taiwan]], and are also used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[mainland China]]. Another term, ''xiǎo bái'' ({{zh|c=小白|l=little white}}) is a derogatory term for both ''bái mù'' and ''bái làn'' that is used on anonymous posting Internet forums. Another common term for a troll used in mainland China is ''pēn zi'' ({{zh|c=噴子|l=sprayer, spurter}}).

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{nihongo|''[[wikt:en:tsuri#Japanese|tsuri]]''|[[wikt:en:釣り#Japanese|釣り]]}} means "fishing" and refers to intentionally misleading posts whose only purpose is to get the readers to react, i.e. get trolled. {{nihongo|''[[wikt:en:arashi#Japanese|arashi]]''|[[wikt:en:荒らし#Japanese|荒らし]]}} means "laying waste" and can also be used to refer to simple [[spam (electronic)|spamming]].

In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], ''[[wikt:en:þurs#Icelandic|þurs]]'' (a [[Jötunn|thurs]]) or ''[[wikt:en:tröll#Icelandic|tröll]]'' (a [[troll]]) may refer to trolls, the verbs ''þursa'' (to troll) or ''þursast'' (to be trolling, to troll about) may be used.

In [[Korean language|Korean]], ''nak-si'' (낚시) means "fishing", refers to Internet trolling attempts, as well as purposefully misleading post titles. A person who recognizes the troll after having responded (or, in case of a post title ''nak-si'', having read the actual post) would often refer to himself as a caught fish.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], more commonly in its [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian]] variant, [[:pt:Troll|troll]] (produced {{IPA-pt|ˈtɾɔw|}} in most of Brazil as [[spelling pronunciation]]) is the usual term to denote Internet trolls (examples of common derivate terms are ''trollismo'' or ''trollagem'', "trolling", and the verb ''trollar'', "to troll", which entered popular use), but an older expression, used by those which want to avoid [[anglicism]]s or [[slang]]s, is ''[[:pt:Complexo do pombo enxadrista|complexo do pombo enxadrista]]'' to denote trolling behavior, and ''pombos enxadristas'' (literally, "chessplayer pigeons") or simply ''pombos'' are the terms used to name the trolls. The terms are explained by an [[adage]] or popular saying: "Arguing with ''[[Placeholder names in different languages#Portuguese|fulano]]'' (i.e., [[John Doe]]) is the same as playing [[chess]] with a [[pigeon]]: it defecates on the table, drops the pieces and simply flies off, claiming victory."

In [[Thai language|Thai]], the term ''krian'' ([[:wikt:เกรียน|เกรียน]]) has been adopted to address Internet trolls. According to the [[Royal Institute of Thailand]], the term, which literally refers to a closely cropped hairstyle worn by schoolboys in Thailand, is from the behaviour of these schoolboys who usually gather to play online games and, during which, make annoying, disruptive, impolite, or unreasonable expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Photchananukrom Kham Mai Lem Song Chabap Ratchabandittayasathan|last = Royal Institute of Thailand|publisher = Royal Institute of Thailand|year = 2009|isbn = 9786167073040|location = Bangkok|pages = 11|script-title = พจนานุกรมคำใหม่ เล่ม ๒ ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน|trans-title = Royal Institute Dictionary of New Words, Volume 2|language = Thai|author-link = Royal Society of Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''top krian'' (ตบเกรียน; "slap a cropped head") refers to the act of posting intellectual replies to refute and cause the messages of Internet trolls to be perceived as unintelligent.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

== Trolling, identity, and anonymity ==

Early incidents of trolling&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad]] (1987/2011) "[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/sky-writing-or-when-man-first-met-troll/239420/ Sky-Writing, Or, When Man First Met Troll]" ''The Atlantic''&lt;/ref&gt; were considered to be the same as [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]], but this has changed with modern usage by the news media to refer to the creation of any content that targets another person. The Internet dictionary NetLingo suggests there are four grades of trolling: playtime trolling, tactical trolling, strategic trolling, and domination trolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The relationship between trolling and flaming was observed in open-access forums in California, on a series of modem-linked computers. ''CommuniTree'' was begun in 1978 but was closed in 1982 when accessed by high school teenagers, becoming a ground for trashing and abuse.&lt;ref name=guar&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Internet created an age of rage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jul/24/internet-anonymity-trolling-tim-adams |publisher=The Guardian (The Observer)|date= 24 July 2011 |location=London |first=Tim |last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists have suggested that flaming would be caused by [[deindividuation]] or decreased self-evaluation: [[Online disinhibition effect|the anonymity of online postings would lead to disinhibition]] amongst individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.

According to Tom Postmes, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the universities of Exeter, England, and Groningen, The Netherlands, and the author of ''Individuality and the Group'', who has studied online behavior for 20 years, "Trolls aspire to violence, to the level of trouble they can cause in an environment. They want it to kick off. They want to promote antipathetic emotions of disgust and outrage, which morbidly gives them a sense of pleasure."&lt;ref name=guar /&gt;

The practice of trolling has been documented by a number of academics as early as the 1990s. This included Steven Johnson in 1997 in the book ''Interface Culture'', and a paper by [[Judith Donath]] in 1999. Donath's paper outlines the ambiguity of identity in a disembodied "[[virtual community]]" such as [[Usenet]]:

{{quote|In the physical world there is an inherent unity to the self, for the body provides a compelling and convenient definition of identity. The norm is: one body, one identity&amp;nbsp;... The virtual world is different. It is composed of information rather than matter.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{Cite book

Donath provides a concise overview of [[identity deception]] games which trade on the confusion between physical and [[epistemic community]]:

{{quote|Trolling is a game about identity deception, albeit one that is played without the consent of most of the players. The troll attempts to pass as a legitimate participant, sharing the group's common interests and concerns; the newsgroups members, if they are cognizant of trolls and other identity deceptions, attempt to both distinguish real from trolling postings, and upon judging a poster a troll, make the offending poster leave the group. Their success at the former depends on how well they{{spaced ndash}}and the troll{{spaced ndash}}understand identity cues; their success at the latter depends on whether the troll's enjoyment is sufficiently diminished or outweighed by the costs imposed by the group.}}

Trolls can be costly in several ways. A troll can disrupt the discussion on a newsgroup, disseminate bad advice, and damage the feeling of trust in the newsgroup community. Furthermore, in a group that has become sensitized to trolling{{spaced ndash}}where the rate of deception is high{{spaced ndash}}many honestly naïve questions may be quickly rejected as trollings. This can be quite off-putting to the new user who upon venturing a first posting is immediately bombarded with angry accusations. Even if the accusation is unfounded, being branded a troll is quite damaging to one's online reputation.&lt;ref name="mit" /&gt;

Susan Herring and colleagues in "Searching for Safety Online: Managing 'Trolling' in a Feminist Forum" point out the difficulty inherent in monitoring trolling and maintaining freedom of speech in online communities: "harassment often arises in spaces known for their freedom, lack of censure, and experimental nature".&lt;ref name="IUinformatics"&gt;{{cite web

Free speech may lead to tolerance of trolling behavior, complicating the members' efforts to maintain an open, yet supportive discussion area, especially for sensitive topics such as race, gender, and sexuality.&lt;ref name="IUinformatics" /&gt;

In an effort to reduce uncivil behavior by increasing accountability, many web sites (e.g. [[Reuters]], [[Facebook]], and [[Gizmodo]]) now require commenters to register their names and e-mail addresses.&lt;ref name="zhao.2010"&gt;J.

A 2016 study for the [[NATO]] Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence on [[hybrid warfare]] notes that the [[Ukrainian crisis]] "demonstrated how fake identities and accounts were used to disseminate narratives through social media, blogs, and web commentaries in order to manipulate, harass, or deceive opponents."&lt;ref name="NATO2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spruds|first1=Andris|last2=Rožukalne|first2=Anda|last3=Sedlenieks|first3=Klāvs|last4=Daugulis|first4=Mārtiņš|last5=Potjomkina|first5=Diāna|last6=Tölgyesi|first6=Beatrix|last7=Bruģe|first7=Ilvija|display-authors=2|date=n.d.|title=Internet Trolling as a hybrid warfare tool: the case of Latvia|website=stratcomcoe.org|location=Riga, LV|publisher=NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence|publication-date=28 January 2016|url=http://www.stratcomcoe.org/internet-trolling-hybrid-warfare-tool-case-latvia-0|access-date=28 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128210911/http://www.stratcomcoe.org/internet-trolling-hybrid-warfare-tool-case-latvia-0|archivedate=28 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=3}} The NATO report describes that a "Wikipedia troll" uses a type of message design where a troll does not add "emotional value" to reliable "essentially true" information in re-posts, but presents it "in the wrong context, intending the audience to draw false conclusions." For example, information, without context, from Wikipedia about the [[military history of the United States]] "becomes value-laden if it is posted in the comment section of an article criticizing Russia for its military actions and interests in Ukraine. The Wikipedia troll is 'tricky', because in terms of actual text, the information is true, but the way it is expressed gives it a completely different meaning to its readers."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=62}}

Unlike "classic trolls," Wikipedia trolls "have no emotional input, they just supply [[misinformation]]" and are one of "the most dangerous" as well as one of "the most effective trolling message designs."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|pages=70, 76}} Even among people who are "emotionally immune to aggressive messages" and apolitical, "training in [[critical thinking]]" is needed, according to the NATO report, because "they have relatively blind trust in Wikipedia sources and are not able to filter information that comes from platforms they consider authoritative."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=72}} While Russian-language hybrid trolls use the Wikipedia troll message design to promote [[anti-Western sentiment]] in comments, they "mostly attack aggressively to maintain [[emotional attachment]] to issues covered in articles."&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=75}} Discussions about topics other than [[international sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis]] "attracted very aggressive trolling" and became polarized according to the NATO report, which "suggests that in subjects in which there is little potential for re-educating audiences, emotional harm is considered more effective" for pro-Russian Latvian-language trolls.&lt;ref name="NATO2016" /&gt;{{rp|page=76}}

== Psychological characteristics ==
Researcher [[Ben Radford]] wrote about the phenomenon of [[clown]]s in history and modern day in his book ''Bad Clowns'' and found that bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They do not dress up as traditional clowns but, for their own amusement, they tease and exploit "human foibles" in order to speak the "truth" and gain a reaction. Like clowns in make-up, Internet trolls hide behind "anonymous accounts and fake usernames." In their eyes they are the trickster and are performing for a nameless audience via the Internet.&lt;ref name="Bad Clowns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Bad Clowns|date=2016|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5666-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concern troll ==
A ''concern troll'' is a [[false flag]] [[pseudonym]] created by a user whose actual [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] is opposed to the one that the troll claims to hold. The concern troll posts in Web forums devoted to its declared point of view and attempts to sway the group's actions or opinions while claiming to [[ingroup bias|share their goals]], but with professed "concerns". The goal is to sow [[fear, uncertainty and doubt]] within the group.&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{Cite journal

Although the term "concern troll" originated in discussions of online behavior, it now sees increasing use to describe similar behaviors that take place offline. For example, James Wolcott of ''Vanity Fair'' accused a conservative ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist of "concern troll" behavior in his efforts to downplay the [[Mark Foley scandal]]. Wolcott links what he calls concern trolls to what [[Saul Alinsky]] calls "Do-Nothings", giving a long quote from Alinsky on the Do-Nothings' method and effects:

{{quote|These Do-Nothings profess a commitment to social change for ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity, and then abstain from and discourage all effective action for change. They are known by their brand, 'I agree with your ends but not your means'.&lt;ref name="vanfair"&gt;{{cite web

''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' published an op-ed piece by [[Markos Moulitsas]] of the liberal blog [[Daily Kos]] titled "Dems: Ignore 'Concern Trolls'". The concern trolls in question were not Internet participants but rather Republicans offering public advice and warnings to the Democrats. The author defines "concern trolling" as "offering a poisoned apple in the form of advice to political opponents that, if taken, would harm the recipient".&lt;ref name="thehill"&gt;{{cite web

== Troll sites ==
{{Expand section||date=November 2015}}

While many webmasters and forum administrators consider trolls a scourge on their sites,{{According to whom|date=February 2015}} some websites welcome them. For example, a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article discussed troll activity at [[4chan]] and at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], which it described as "an online compendium of troll humor and troll lore".&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 4chan's /b/ board is recognized as "one of the Internet's most infamous and active trolling hotspots."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Internet Troll Sub-Culture's Savage Spoofing of Mainstream Media [Excerpt]|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/internet-troll-sub-culture-s-savage-spoofing-of-mainstream-media-excerpt/|website = Scientific American|access-date = 24 February 2016|first = Whitney|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site and others are often used as a base to troll against sites that their members can not normally post on.

== Media coverage and controversy ==
{{Globalize|section|date=October 2015}}
Mainstream media outlets have focused their attention on the willingness of some Internet users to go to extreme lengths to participate in organized [[psychological harassment]].

=== Australia ===
In February 2010, the Australian government became involved after users defaced the Facebook tribute pages of murdered children Trinity Bates and Elliott Fletcher. Australian communications minister [[Stephen Conroy]] decried the attacks, committed mainly by 4chan users, as evidence of the need for greater Internet regulation, stating, "This argument that the Internet is some mystical creation that no laws should apply to, that is a recipe for anarchy and the wild west."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/1034842/internet-without-laws-a-recipe-for-anarchy "Internet without laws a 'recipe for anarchy'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404062645/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/1034842/internet-without-laws-a-recipe-for-anarchy |date=4 April 2010 }}, News.ninemsn.com.au, 1 April 2010.

Retrieved 5 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' started a campaign to take action against "Twitter trolls", who abuse and threaten users. Several high-profile Australians including [[Charlotte Dawson]], [[Robbie Farah]], [[Laura Dundovic]], and [[Ray Hadley]] have been victims of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Gemma |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/time-is-up-for-twitter-trolls-and-bulllies/story-e6frfro0-1226472133504 |title=Time is up for Twitter trolls and bullies |work=News.com.au |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/farah-subjected-to-vile-twitter-abuse/story-fndo48ca-1226468559816|title=Twitter trolls attack radio host Ray Hadley, NRL star Robbie Farah|newspaper=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/twitter-moves-on-trolls/story-fndo317g-1226474468650|title=Twitter makes moves to prevent online trolls|newspaper=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newslaundry covered the phenomenon of "Twitter trolling" in its "Criticles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newslaundry.com/2013/02/18/taking-on-the-trolls/|title=Taking On The Trolls|author=Ashoka Prasad|work=Newslaundry}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been characterising Twitter trolls in its weekly podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newslaundry.com/2015/07/17/nl-hafta-episode-24/|title=NL Hafta – Episode 24|date=17 July 2015|work=Newslaundry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, contributions made to the Internet are covered by the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] as well as Section 127 of the [[Communications Act 2003]], under which jail sentences were, until 2015, limited to a maximum of six months.&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29678989|title=Internet trolls face up to two years in jail under new laws|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 October 2014|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2014, the UK's Justice Secretary, [[Chris Grayling]], said that "Internet trolls" would face up to two years in jail, under measures in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill that extend the maximum sentence and time limits for bringing prosecutions.&lt;ref name=BBCNews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/Internet-trolls-to-face-2-years-in-prison|title=Internet trolls to face 2 years in prison|author=UK Ministry of Justice|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The House of Lords Select Committee on Communications had earlier recommended against creating a specific offence of trolling. Sending messages which are "grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character" is an offence whether they are received by the intended recipient or not. Several people have been imprisoned in the UK for [[online harassment]].&lt;ref name="Tom de Castella and Virginia Brown"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14898564 |title=Trolling: Who does it and why? |author1=Tom de Castella |author2=Virginia Brown |date=14 September 2011 |work=BBC News Magazine |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
On 31 March 2010, NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' ran a segment detailing the deaths of three separate adolescent girls and trolls' subsequent reactions to their deaths. Shortly after the suicide of high school student Alexis Pilkington, anonymous posters began performing organized psychological harassment across various message boards, referring to Pilkington as a "suicidal slut", and posting graphic images on her [[Facebook]] memorial page. The segment also included an exposé of a 2006 accident, in which an eighteen-year-old fatally crashed her father's car into a highway pylon; trolls emailed her grieving family the leaked pictures of her mutilated corpse (see [[Nikki Catsouras photographs controversy]]).&lt;ref name=Trolling:TheTodayShowExplorestheDarkSideoftheInternet&gt;[http://gawker.com/5506453/trolling-the-today-show-explores-the-dark-side-of-the-internet "Trolling: ''The Today Show'' Explores the Dark Side of the Internet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102001807/http://gawker.com/5506453/trolling-the-today-show-explores-the-dark-side-of-the-internet |date=2 November 2013 }}, 31 March 2010.

In 2007, the media was fooled by trollers into believing that students were consuming a drug called [[Jenkem]], purportedly made of human waste. A user named Pickwick on [[TOTSE]] posted pictures implying that he was inhaling this drug. Major news corporations such as [[Fox News Channel]] reported the story and urged parents to warn their children about this drug. Pickwick's pictures of [[Jenkem]] were fake and the pictures did not actually feature human waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/internet-troll-sub-culture-s-savage-spoofing-of-mainstream-media-excerpt/|title=Internet Troll Sub-Culture's Savage Spoofing of Mainstream Media [Excerpt]|author= Whitney Phillips |date=15 May 2015|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the subject of trolling was featured on the [[HBO]] [[television series]] ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]''. The character of [[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)#Main cast|Neal Sampat]] encounters harassing individuals online, particularly looking at [[4chan]], and he ends up choosing to post negative comments himself on an economics-related forum. The attempt by the character to infiltrate trolls' inner circles attracted debate from media reviewers critiquing the series.&lt;ref name=hitfix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-the-newsroom-the-blackout-part-2-mock-debate-help-me-rhonda#|title=Review: The Newsroom – The Blackout Part 2: Mock Debate: Help me, Rhonda|work=HitFix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indiewire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/the-newsroom-episode-9-review-and-recap-the-blackout-part-2-whither-the-mock-debate|title='The Newsroom' Episode 9 Review and Recap: 'The Blackout  – Thompson on Hollywood|author=Beth Hanna|date=20 August 2012|work=Thompson on Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the 2015 non-fiction book ''The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld'' by [[Jamie Bartlett (journalist)|Jamie Bartlett]], a journalist and a representative of the British [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]], attracted some attention for its depiction of misunderstood sections of the Internet, describing interactions on encrypted sites such as those accessible with the software [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Detailing trolling-related groups and the harassment created by them, Bartlett advocated for greater awareness of them and monitoring of their activities. Professor Matthew Wisnioski wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that a "league of trolls, anarchists, perverts and drug dealers is at work building a digital world beyond the Silicon Valley offices where our era's best and brightest have designed a Facebook-friendly" surface and agreed with Bartlett that the activities of trolls go back decades to the [[Usenet]] "flame wars" of the 1990s and even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-tour-of-the-webs-other-dark-side/2015/06/25/19a5ee2e-0e11-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html|title=Inside the online world not indexed by search engines|date=26 June 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please only add examples for which there was 'significant' independent media coverage, which resulted in a conviction or

As reported on 8 April 1999, investors became victims of trolling via an online financial discussion regarding PairGain, a telephone equipment company based in California. Trolls operating in the stock's [[Yahoo!|Yahoo Finance]] chat room posted a fabricated [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]] News article stating that an Israeli telecom company could potentially acquire PairGain. As a result, PairGain's stock jumped by 31%. However, the stock promptly crashed after the reports were identified as false.&lt;ref name="Bond"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Links, Frames, Meta-tags and Trolls|last=Bond|first=Robert|year=1999|work=International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 13|pages=317–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called Gold Membership trolling originated in 2007 on [[4chan]] boards, when users posted fake images claiming to offer upgraded 4chan account privileges; without a "Gold" account, one could not view certain content. This turned out to be a hoax designed to fool board members, especially newcomers. It was copied and became an [[Internet meme]]. In some cases, this type of troll has been used as a scam, most notably on Facebook, where fake Facebook Gold Account upgrade ads have proliferated in order to link users to dubious websites and other content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countermeasures.trendmicro.eu/all-that-glisters-is-not-facebook-gold/ "All that glisters is not (Facebook) gold"], CounterMeasures: Security, Privacy &amp; Trust (A TrendMicro Blog). Retrieved 6 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of ''[[Zeran v. America Online, Inc.]]'' resulted primarily from trolling. Six days after the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], anonymous users posted advertisements for shirts celebrating the bombing on AOL message boards, claiming that the shirts could be obtained by contacting Mr. Kenneth Zeran. The posts listed Zeran's address and home phone number. Zeran was subsequently harassed.&lt;ref name="Bond" /&gt;

[[Criticism of Scientology|Anti-Scientology]] protests by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], commonly known as [[Project Chanology]], are sometimes labeled as "trolling" by media such as ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=5 October 2010|title=The Assclown Offensive: How to Enrage the Church of Scientology|first=Julian|last=Dibbell|date=21 September 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-10/mf_chanology|publisher=''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the participants sometimes explicitly self-identify as "trolls".

[[Neo-Nazi]] website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' orchestrates what it calls a "Troll Army", and has encouraged trolling of Jewish MP [[Luciana Berger]] and Muslim activist [[Mariam Veiszadeh]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whiteman|first1=Hilary|title=I will not be silenced: Australian Muslim fights Twitter 'troll army'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/27/asia/australia-muslim-twitter-campaign/|accessdate=4 March 2015|publisher=CNN|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jafar Gafar oglu Jabbarli''', ({{lang-az|Cəfər Cabbarlı}}, 20 March 1899, [[Xızı]] – 31 December 1934, [[Baku]]) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i playwright, poet, director and screenwriter.

==Life==
After his father's death in 1902, Jabbarli's mother moved to [[Baku]] with her four children. In 1915, Jabbarli graduated from high school and studied [[electromechanics]] at [[Baku Polytechnicum]] for the next 5 years. In 1920 he was admitted to [[Baku State University|Azerbaijan State University]] to study applied [[medicine]] but due to his lack of interest soon switched to [[Oriental studies]]. In 1923, he started attending lectures at a local theatre to fulfill his interest in [[drama]].&lt;ref name="hayat"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070429063356/http://www.cafarcabbarli.com/en/hayati_e.html Jafar Jabbarli: Life and First Years of Education] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jafar Jabbarli died at the age of 35 of [[heart failure]] and was buried at the [[Alley of Honor]]. The national film studio, ''[[Azerbaijanfilm]]'', a street and a [[Cəfər Cabbarlı (Baku Metro)|subway station]] in Baku are named after him.

On 22 May 1985 the museum "Jafar Jabbarli memorial house" was opened. It is located in the house on I. Gutgashinli steet 44 (former G. Sultanov street), where Jafar Jabbarli used to live.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070429070625/http://www.cafarcabbarli.com/en/muzey_e.html Jafar Jabbarly: Museum] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, theatre and film==
Jafar Jabbarli started writing poems in his early teenage years and was reported to have had his first poems published in the [[Azeri language|Azeri]] newspaper ''Hagigat-i Afkar'' in 1911.&lt;ref name="hayat"/&gt; In the following years, he wrote more than 20 plays, as well as poems, essays, short stories, and articles. His works were very much influenced by the 1920s propaganda of [[Communist]] glory and celebrated appropriate themes such as equality, labour, education, cosmopolitanism, emancipation of women, cultural shifts, etc. Jabbarli's major accomplishment in introducing [[Europe]]an plays to average Azerbaijanis was translating [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' into Azeri in 1925 and directing it at the [[Azerbaijan Drama Theatre]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070429172002/http://www.cafarcabbarli.com/en/tarcuma_e.html Jafar Jabbarli: Translations] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jafar Jabbarli is considered the founder of screenwriting in Azerbaijan. Two of his plays, ''[[Sevil (1928 play)|Sevil]]'' and ''Almaz'', both written in 1928, were made into films in 1929 and 1936 respectively. Both focused on the theme of the role of women, their oppression, struggle, and ultimately, victory over dated [[patriarchal]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyat|first=Farideh |title=Azeri Women in Transition: Women in Soviet and Post-Soviet Azerbaijan|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, UK|isbn=1136871705|pages=98–102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kp0AAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070501154759/http://www.cafarcabbarli.com/en/ucuncu_e.html Jafar Jabbarly: Third period of the writer's creative activity (1928-1934)] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070429185733/http://www.cafarcabbarli.com/en/kino_e.html Jafar Jabbarly: Film Activity] (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her career of some three decades, she has produced on average, a book a year (which is no indication of quality).

==Konkani folklore==

Dr Jayanti Naik takes care of the folklore section of the [[Goa Konkani Akademi]], the aim of which is to "conserve and preserve (the) rich folklore of Goa".&lt;ref name="GKA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://goakonkaniakademi.org/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017124644/http://goakonkaniakademi.org/# |archive-date=2017-10-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her work includes ''Ratha Tujeo Ghudio'', ''Kanner Khunti Naari'',  ''Tlloi Ukhalli Kelliani'', ''Manalim Gitam'', ''Pednecho Dosro'', and ''Lokbimb''.&lt;ref name="GKA" /&gt;

Naik has written 16 books on folklore. Her book on Konkani folklore, entitled ''Konkani Lokved'', has several folk tales current among the Konkani-speaking emigrants who made their permanent home in the southern Indian States of [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] in their original form with regional slant, as they were graphically recounted to her.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=113957|title=Bangalore: Award to Goan Konkani Folklore Reseacher Dr Jayanti Naik|publisher=|access-date=2018-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118122916/https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=113957#|archive-date=2018-11-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naik's ''Amonnem  Yek Lokjinn'' ([[Goa Konkani Akademi]], 1993) focuses on the village of [[Amona, Goa|Amona]] and its surrounding regions. It covers its history religion, social practices, festivals and folklore, among other topics.

==Folk tales==

She had also compiled and edited, ''Venchik Lok Kannio'', a collection of Konkani [[Folklore|folk tales]] in the Roman (Romi) script, which was published by the Goa Konkani Akademi, in 2008. 
It has been transliterated by [[Felicio Cardozo]].&lt;ref name="Award" /&gt;

'Lokrang' (2008) is a collection of essays on Goan and Konkani folklore.

==Konkani writing==

In ''A History of Konkani Literature: From 1500 to 1992'', the linguist and Konkani writer [[Manohararāya Saradesāya]] (also Dr [[Manohar Rai Sardesai]]) says of the 1962-born Naik's collection of short stories, ''Garjan'': "''Garjan'' means ''The Roar'' and in fact here the woman conscious of her strength and her social rights "roars." It is a roar of revolt against the mightily and the rich in favour of the poor, the weak, the oppressed. There is vigour in her style but at times her expression lags behind her thoughts." He also comments on Jayanti Naik's ''Nimnnem Bondd'' (''The Last Revolt'') which "expresses dissatisfaction against the idea of God's justice" and adds: "It is true that the women writers are prone to a certain sentimentality but this sentimentality is hardly overdone."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1YILeUD_oZUC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=jayanti+naik+konkani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIlMe4i8y9xwIVBhemCh1IyApo#v=onepage&amp;q=jayanti%20naik%20konkani&amp;f=false p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women-centric==

[[Jyoti Kunkolienkar]] rates Jayanti Naik (along with [[Hema Naik]]) as the authors writing on women-centric themes in Konkani from Goa today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/My-stories-are-about-women-Jyoti-Kunkolienkar/articleshow/27858328.cms|title=My stories are about women: Jyoti Kunkolienkar - Times of India|publisher=|access-date=2015-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518165747/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/My-stories-are-about-women-Jyoti-Kunkolienkar/articleshow/27858328.cms#|archive-date=2014-05-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jivaroan''' (also '''Hívaro''', '''Jívaro''', '''Jibaroana''', '''Jibaro''') is a small [[language family]] of northern [[Peru]] and eastern [[Ecuador]].

==Family division==

Jivaroan consists of 4 languages:

: 1. '''[[Shuar language|Shuar]]'''
: 2. '''[[Achuar language|Achuar]]
: 3. '''[[Aguaruna language|Awajun]]'''
: 4. '''[[Huambisa language|Huambisa]]'''

This language family is spoken in [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]], Cajamarca, [[Loreto Region|Loreto]], and San Martin, Peru and the [[Geography of Ecuador#El Oriente (the East)|Oriente region]] of Ecuador.

==Genetic relations==
The extinct [[Palta language]] was classified as Jivaroan by [[Jacinto Jijón y Caamaño]] about 1940 and was followed by [[Čestmír Loukotka]]. However, only a few words are known, and Kaufman (1994) states that there is "little resemblance".

The most promising external connections are with the [[Cahuapanan languages]] and perhaps a few other language isolates in proposals variously called ''Jívaro-Cahuapana (Hívaro-Kawapánan)'' ([[Jorge Suárez (linguist)|Jorge Suárez]] and others) or ''[[Macro-Jibaro languages|Macro-Jibaro]]'' or ''Macro-Andean'' ([[Morris Swadesh]] and others, with Cahuapanan, [[Urarina language|Urarina]], [[Puelche language|Puelche]], and maybe [[Huarpe language|Huarpe]]).

The [[unclassified language|unclassified]] language [[Candoshi language|Candoshi]] has also been linked to Jivaroan, as David Payne (1981) provides reconstructions for Proto-Shuar as well as Proto-Shuar-Candoshi. However, more recently, linguists have searched elsewhere for Candoshi's relatives.

'''Kove''' is one of the [[Austronesian languages]] of [[New Britain]] which is spoken by the people of Papua New Guinea. The language is found in 18 villages with their populations totaling 9,000 people; however, most of the people are unfamiliar with the language. Instead of using the Kove language, many of them are using [[Tok Pisin]] as their daily language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiroko|first1=Sato,|title=Grammar of Kove : an Austronesian language of the West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/100749|publisher=[Honolulu] : [University of Hawaii at Manoa], [December 2013]|page=1-3|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Changing Kove to Tok Pisin==
Although in the past the Kove people had contact with foreign languages as a result of trading, the location where they lived was isolated enough that they maintained Kove as their daily language.  This is caused by interacting with more people than they used to because of the increase in the transportation. However, the younger generation, people who are below fifty, started to use Tok Pisin as their daily language.  In addition, the education language that are used in the schools is not Kove, except one school just recently changed to Kove, but this does not mean that the student will use Kove outside of the class. Also, some Kove people are married to non-Kove speaker and they use other language in their daily life rather than Kove. As a result, their child will learn the other language as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiroko|first1=Sato,|title=Grammar of Kove : an Austronesian language of the West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/100749|publisher=[Honolulu] : [University of Hawaii at Manoa], [December 2013]|page=20-23|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Dialects==
There are three dialects where Kove is spoken. These three dialects are called East Kove, Central Kove, and West Kove. The dialect that are used by the Central Kove is to be considered as the standard Kove. This is because the central of the Kove area is the place where the ancestor have first arrived. Additionally, it is the dialect that is closest to the original Kove language. In fact, the other two dialects, East Kove and West Kove, has been changed slightly due to the languages around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiroko|first1=Sato,|title=Grammar of Kove : an Austronesian language of the West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/100749|publisher=[Honolulu] : [University of Hawaii at Manoa], [December 2013]|page=9-11|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Morphology==
===Pronoun===
The Kove independent pronouns are given in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;Sato, Hiroko. 2013. Grammar of Kove: an Austronesian language of the West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea. University of Hawai'i Ph.D. dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! 1 incl !! 1 excl !! 2 !! 3

|-
| Plural || taita || yai || amiu || asiri
|-
| Dual || tahua || yahua || amihua || asihua
|-
| Group || tangera || yangera || angera || asingera
|}
The pronominal system for Kove is somewhat different from the other [[Oceanic languages]]. The similarities that Kove and other oceanic languages have been using first person, second person, and third person. They also separate the inclusive and the exclusive. Also, "gender is not encoded" stated by Hiroko.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiroko|first1=Sato,|title=Grammar of Kove : an Austronesian language of the West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/100749|publisher=[Honolulu] : [University of Hawaii at Manoa], [December 2013]|date=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the other language of the Oceanic, Kove only uses singular and plural for numbers. The pronominal system for Kove is separated into four functions. These four functions are independent, subject marker, object, and possessive.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;
===Morphosyntactic Patterns===
The order of the grammar pattern that is used in Kove is SV and AYO, "where S represents an intransitive subject, A a transitive subject, V a verb, and O a direct object", stated by Hiroko.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;
==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Kove consonant may be changed anytime due to the interaction with the language of Tok Pisin and English. You can also combine all the consonants with the vowels that they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiroko|first1=Sato,|title=Grammar of Kove : an Austronesian language of the West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/100749|publisher=[Honolulu] : [University of Hawaii at Manoa], [December 2013]|page=33|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
===Vowels===
In Kove there are five vowels. The lips will round to produce the vowels /u/ and /o/. For vowels /i/, /e/, and /a/ the lips will not be rounded. Vowels can be at the beginning of the word or at the end of the word. Also, the same two vowels cannot be used together.  For example, using the vowels /ii/ together is not allowed; however, there is one word that is uses the same two vowels which is /ee/ "yes."  This example is the only case where two of the same vowels can appear next to each other.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Front !! Central !! Back
|-
| High || i ||  || u

|-
| Low ||  || a || 
|}
Furthermore, if the vowels are followed by a velar nasal ng, then it will become a negative tense, except the vowel a.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;
===Orthography===
Some of the elementary schools in Kove just recently used an orthography "that was established by elementary school teachers who were neither native speakers of Kove nor trained in linguistics" as stated by Hiroko. However, these teachers are unfamiliar with the system.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;

|-
| Grapheme || nd || m || n || ng || β || s || gh || h || r || l || w || y
|}
===Stress patterns===
There are two different types of stress in Kove, one is primary and the other is secondary. "Primary stress always falls on the penultimate syllable" and " secondary stress falls on every second syllable to the left of the syllable receiving primary stress," claimed Hiroko.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;
===Reduplication===
Just like the other language in Oceanic, Kove has many word that are reduplicated. There are three type of reduplication in Kove. The first one which is full reduplication. The examples for this type of duplication is tama "father" is reduplicated to tamatama "father" in Kove. Also, ani "eat" reduplicated to aniani "be eating". The second type of reduplication is leftward. For examples, pau "new" is reduplicated to papau "new" and tari "younger parallel sibling and cousin" reduplicated to tatari "younger parallel siblings and cousins". The third type of reduplication is rightward but, this type of reduplication is rarely used in Kove.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;    
===Borrowing and adaptive phonology===
The language Kove have also borrow words from other languages, for example, the language of Austronesian like Anem, Papuan. This is because when they are trading with other people, they will apparently saw new things. In this case, they will borrow the other language word and combine with their own language to named it. Some examples that the language of Kove have borrowed the words from other languages are "tavila "large wooden bowl for pounding taro", amouru "rain tree", ahila "small-leafed rattan originating in the bush", rodya "short and light yellow tapioca", said Hiroko. And as the time passes, these words will be known as Kove language.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt; This type of situation is getting more commonly in today's live. Due to the increasing of interaction with the outside world and easier of transportation, Kove people will eventually know more things. This means that they have to borrow the word from other language to name it. In fact, due to the language of [[Tok Pisin]] that the Kove people has used as their daily language, many new things are named using [[Tok Pisin]]. For examples, car, airplane, paper, money, and many more are named using the [[Tok Pisin]] language instead of Kove language.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt; 
==Word Classes==
The language of Kove has three word classes: open lexical classes, closed lexical classes, and grammatical classes. Lexical class is also known as the part of speech and "grammatical words or morphemes are elements shared in the grammatical structure of clauses," claimed Hiroko.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt; Which includes the nouns and the verbs. On the other hand, closed lexical classes includes adjectives, adverbs, and cardinal numerals. The grammatical classes includes adpositions, articles, causative marker, serialed verb unifier, conjunctions, demonstratives, intransitive marker, locative demonstratives, nominalizers, particles, possessive markers, pronouns, reciprocal marker, tense, aspect, mood markers, and all other element that are not included in the other two classes.&lt;ref name="Hiroko (1 December 2013)" /&gt;

'''Kubu''' is a [[Malayan language]] spoken in the southern swamps of the island of [[Sumatra]] in Indonesia by the [[Kubu people]] ''(Orang Rimba)'', many of whom are nomadic. There is a degree of dialectal diversity.

In Bukit Duabelas (Jambi), the Rimba language is very glottal, which initially makes it difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Sager, Steven (2008). The Sky is our Roof, the Earth our Floor: Orang Rimba Customs and Religion in the Bukit Duabelas Region of Jambi, Sumatra [http://hdl.handle.net/1885/49351]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the variations in Kubu isolects have been presented by Dunggio &lt;ref&gt;Dunggio (1995).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19521">'''Language power''' ('''LP''') is a measure of one’s ability to communicate effectively in a given language, specifically one that is not native to the speaker.

Current instructional programs throughout the world continue to attempt to teach enrollees how to communicate in a second language – yet they struggle. They struggle because existing methodologies do not typically result in the learner being able to communicate effectively in the new language. The root cause of this global problem is that learners do not reach a sufficient level of “native-ness” in their speech which hurts the learner’s career achievements - despite numerous attempts at language instruction policy and practice reform.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, R. (1996).  An examination of English as a Second Language assessment tools utilized by adult literacy providers in Pennsylvania. ''PAACE Journal of Lifelong Learning, 5,'' 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Language Power consists of two key components: 1) an ability to speak and be understood, and 2) an ability to listen and understand. Individuals with strong language power possess the ability to communicate effectively in a social environment. When non-native speakers engage in oral communication, native speakers of that language recognize sufficiently well-formed speech, in that it is satisfactorily ‘native’ or sufficiently close to what they know as ‘their language’ in order to be completely understood. When non-native speakers listen to a econdary language, they need to be capable of interpreting and processing words that are spoken at real world rates of speech in the manner spoken by native speakers of that language.

==Overview==
Each year in the [[United States]], many students are required to learn a language other than English in their educational careers. Often, after years of study and quite likely earning passing grades on final and college entrance exams such as the [[ACTFL]] (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language) Oral Proficiency Interview, most students cannot speak at a level that will be understood or can they understand basic everyday exchanges at conversational speed in the language’s native country, as one would encounter when watching television or listening to the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Salaberry, R. (2000).  Revising the revised format of the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview. ''Language Testing, 17(3),'' 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language is taught to a level of certain academic competencies, further referred to as academic knowledge (AK): 1) grammatical competence to include proper use of grammar, extensive vocabulary knowledge, and appropriate pronunciation, 2) sociolinguistic competence, which is the proper use of words and grammar depending on social situations and knowledge of cultural [[politeness]], 3) discourse competence – the ability to use the language in various settings, such as a [[debate]] or neighborhood gathering, and 4) strategic competence, the ability to use verbal and non-verbal means to communicate, especially during challenging situations.&lt;ref name="celce"&gt;Celce-Murcia, M., Z. Dornyei, and S. Thurrell. (1995). Communicative compentence: A pedagogically motivated model with content specifications. ''. Issues in Applied Linguistics, 6(2),'' 5-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belcher"&gt;Belcher, D. (2006). English for Specific Purposes: Teaching to Perceived Needs and Imagined Futures in Worlds of Work, Study, and Everyday Life. ''TESOL Quarterly, 40(1),'' 133-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic knowledge measures are far more prevalent and comprise the majority items we see in formal language assessment. Also known as ''[[drill and kill]]'', typical instructional programs continue to focus on rote memorization of vocabulary and grammatical structure instead of practical use of a language – a deficiency in ''humanization'' of course material.&lt;ref&gt;Kramsch, C. (2006). From communicative competence to symbolic competence. ''Modern Language, 90,'' 249-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is a lack of appropriate materials in an academic setting, driving teachers to create home-made course materials for class.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, B. (2012). Material development for language learning and teaching ''Language Teaching, 45(2),'' 143-179.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Houston (2005) demonstrated that students learning Spanish valued “survival-skills” learning (ability to function in a social environment) more than ''[[academic]]'' knowledge of a language.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, T. (2005). Outcomes assessment for beginning and intermediate Spanish: One program's process and results. ''Foreign Language Annals, 38(3)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, teachers report lack of time and resources to practice a language within the classroom to strengthen competency.&lt;ref&gt;Latha, V. and P. Rajan. (2012). Non-native Student’s Communication is Affected Due to the Lack of Pragmatic Competence. '' English Language Teaching, 5(2)''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roca"&gt;Roca-Varela, M. and I. Palacios. (2013). How are spoken skills assessed in proficiency tests of general English as a Foreign Language? A preliminary survey ''International Journal of English Studies, 13(2),'' 53-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roever"&gt;Roever, C. and T. McNamara. (2006). Language testing: the social dimension. ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 16(2),'' 242-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocabulary items are quite common and take many forms. From simple flash card type exercises to more complex matching games and standard multiple choice, over the years test makers have employed a variety of ways to test the student’s understanding of the meaning of a single word. This item type may be useful to increase the total number of words a student understands, however, it is not an indicator of communication competency unless the item combines either identification of real world audio or oral production that connects the speaker to the real world.
Second only to vocabulary items in number are grammar items. These items are typically found in written form, on paper or on the computer screen, and typically present the student with a multiple choice selection to fill-in-the-blank or complete/replace language items in a sentence with the response that is grammatically correct. 

==Barriers==
===Occupational barriers for adults===
The decision to hire someone for a company position may be, to some degree, dependent on the individual’s ability to speak a language effectively. In the majority of cases, similar standardized tests are used as a screening mechanism with adults who are ESL learners.&lt;ref name="roca"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One such test, Speaking Proficient English Assessment Kit (SPEAK) has been used to place ESL learners in appropriate classes and support curriculum improvements. SPEAK, through research and examination of the test, does not realistically measure oral communication competency, leading to invalid results of language fluency and capability to use English in an occupational situation.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, N. (2006). Multicultural communication: assessing, facilitating, and evaluating compentency-based oral interactions. '' Annual Meeting of the Speech Communication Association1992: Chicago, IL''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union (EU) recognizes the importance of a multilingual and diverse work force; proficiency testing programs, such as the Common European Framework of Reference used in the United Kingdom, gauge potential employees not only on luency of a second language, but competency.&lt;ref&gt;Chetty, D. (2006). Speaking the language. ''Training Journal 2009,'' 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Many potential employees may arrive for an interview and, although have scored high on English proficiency tests, are unable to communicate at a level that gains them a job in an English-speaking nation.

===Cultural barriers of language===
Approximately 18% of the US population speak a language other than English, with 11% representing foreign-born individuals. Culture plays a role in how a person learns a language and communicates what they have learned and is substantially social in context.&lt;ref name="roever"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;Huang, J., E. Dotterweich, and A. Bowers (2012). Intercultural miscommunications: impact on ESOL students and implications for ESOL teachers. ''. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 39(1)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, lexical and grammatical pieces of language are strongly cultural, leading to a level of language complexity.&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three paradigms can be considered when examining non-native speakers in a US culture: 1) communication apprehension, 2) self-perceived communication competency, and 3) social inclination to communicate. Insufficiencies in oral communication courses for English as a second language learners and appropriate curriculum contribute to the lack of oral communication competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, N. (2008). Raising the Question #10 Non-Native Speakers of English: What More Can We Do?. '' Communication Education, 57(2),'' 289-295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ozdener, N. and H. Satar (2008). Computer-mediated communication in foreign language education:use of target language and learner perceptions. ''Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 9(2)''.&lt;/ref&gt; These apprehensions contribute to the failure of some foreign students. In a qualitative study among Chinese graduate students, 94% of students reported their academic experience was negative and not enjoyable due to ''tremendous'' language barriers.&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang, J. and V. Rinaldo (2009).  Factors affecting Chinese graduate students' cross-cultural learning. ''. International Journal of Applied Educational Studies, 4(1)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, study abroad programs were thought to be a ''cure all'' for language and cultural barriers. However, students often arrive to their host countries linguistically underprepared.&lt;ref&gt;Kinginger, C. (2011). Enhancing Language Learning in Study Abroad. ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 31,'' 58-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language power theory==
Language Power, further referred to as Language Power Theory (LPT) is the study of actual communication ability. Communication ability is the competence to speaking to be understood and listening to understand. LPT draws from and supports ideas from language knowledge, understanding there is a pragmatic and social structure that needs to be in place for successful language learning …since conversation is the most fundamental means of conducting human affairs.&lt;ref name="celce"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic knowledge vs. language power===
Academic Knowledge is what students obtain in traditional language programs in traditional educational institutions. For largely historical, political and commercial reasons these traditional programs center on the course’s book. This can be considered book learning because the lack of available, cost-effective technology leaves no other option but to begin learning a language by reading it.&lt;ref&gt;Eskenazi, M. (2009). An overview of spoken language technology for education. ''Speech Communication, 51,'' 832-844.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guarda, M (2012). ''Computer-mediated communication and foreign language education Journal of eLearning and Knowledge Society, 8(3),'' 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conversely, Language Power traditionally develops with no book at all, nor any presumption of an ability to read. This is how we all learn our native language. Infants learn to speak their native language because they learn it ‘through their ears’ as a cognitive process, not through a book.&lt;ref&gt;Maftoon, P., H. Hamidi, and S. Sarem (2012). The Effects of CALL on Vocabulary Learning: A Case of Iranian Intermediate EFL Learners. ''BRAIN: Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence &amp; Neuroscience, 3(4),'' 19-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vandergrift, L (2006).  Second language listening: Listening ability or language proficiency?. ''The Modern Language Journal, 90(1),'' 6-18.&lt;/ref&gt; To compare the efficacy of these two methods is revealing, in most cases, individuals come fully to master their native language resulting in high degrees of LP while only a fortunate small percentage of learners are able to obtain high levels of language power when learning a second language via traditional methods.

===Speaking to be understood===
LPT considers speaking to be understood, a simple transmit and receive process in which the speaker produces oral language that will be understood by a native speaker of that language. Research has shown that among Chinese students, even though the Chinese learners can construct grammatically correct English, it sounds awkward to a native ear. LPT advocates learning language to support the speaker’s ability to produce oral language to a certain level of ''native-ness''. Native-ness is the result of sufficient quality of pronunciation, fluency, rhythm and intonation.&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maftoon, P., H. Hamidi, and S. Sarem. (2012). The Effects of CALL on Vocabulary Learning: A Case of Iranian Intermediate EFL Learners ''BRAIN: Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence &amp; Neuroscience, 3(4),'' 19-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Y. (2013). The usage patterns of formulaic sequences in Chinese EFL learners oral production ''Foreign Language and Their Teaching, 3,'' 60-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Research demonstrates that intonation of speech (i.e., pitch, speed, volume, etc.) is an important factor in learning conversational language.&lt;ref name="arias"&gt;Arias, J., N. Yoma, and H. Vivanco. (2010).  Automatic intonation assessment for computer aided language learning. ''Speech Communication, 52,'' 254-267.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the primary measures of LP because it assesses the speaker’s ability to get his message across in a way that is completely understood by the native speaker. Key among these elements is a subset of fluency known as Rate of Speech (ROS) that is often measured in words per minute or more recently in phonemes per second. 

Measuring one’s ability to speak and be understood has always been challenging since it is usually measured orally during a ''live interaction'' - a teacher works one on one with a student, perhaps asking questions and grading oral responses.&lt;ref name="roca"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roever"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, C. (2010). Language proficiency and academic achievement. Multilingual matters. '' Multilingual Matters, xxi,'' 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, due to budget and time constraints, these types of measurements cannot be done nearly as often as desired. Furthermore, the subjective nature of these types of tests severely dilutes their validity and reliability. Yet, until recently, oral tests have been the only measure used to determine if what the student is saying will be understood by a native speaker of that language. In recent years, several countries have begun to employ computer-aided language learning (CALL) systems to assist their students in learning English.&lt;ref name="zaho"&gt;Zhao, S., S. Koh, and K. Luke. (2012). Accent reduction for computer-aided language learning. ''20th European Signal Processing Conference''  335-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown in primary and secondary education, CALL programs are more engaging, assist students in cognitive abilities, and can be tailored to meet the needs of the learner.&lt;ref&gt;van Doremalen, J., C. Cucchiarini, and H. Strik. (2009).  Optimizing automatic speech recognition for lowproficient non-native speakers. ''Journal on Audio, Speech and Music Processing, 2010(1),'' 1687-4722.&lt;/ref&gt;

CALL has been employed to improve speech of ESL learners - however, there is a need to improve software to incorporate different levels of learning, specifically around oral communication. Recent tests of oral language systems show that they would be feasible to use in tangible applications.&lt;ref name="arias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zaho"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wet"&gt;de Wet, F., C. Van der Walt, and T. Niesler (2009).  Automatic assessment of oral language proficiency and listening comprehension. ''. Speech Communication, 51,''  864-874.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Awidi, H. and S. Ismail  (2012).  Teachers’ Perceptions of the Use of Computer Assisted Language Learning to Develop Children’s Reading Skills in English as a Second Language in the United Arab Emirates. ''. Early Childhood Education, 42,''  29-37&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, qualitative studies of computer-based programs proved to be a potent motivator in language learning; the outcome measures positively impacted by CALL were worker participation in union-based activities, such as negotiations, meetings, and a variety of services.&lt;ref name="belcher"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Listening to understand===
LPT considers listening to understand the ability of a person to listen and understand a nonnative language at real world rates of speech with all the attributes of pronunciation, fluency rhythm and intonation.&lt;ref name="finn"&gt;Huang, J. and A. Finn (2009).  Academic listening tests for ESOL students: availability, concerns, and solutions. ''International Journal of Applied Educational Studies, 6(1)''.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of data by Endress and Hauser (2010) demonstrates that adults listen and interpret language based on prosodic cues and these cues vary from language to language. The authors explain that listening to a native language has segmentations, similar to beads on a string, which differentiate words allowing the context to be fully understood. However, for non-native listeners, even if they have studied the particular second language, they have a difficult time segmenting words causing them to simply run together.&lt;ref&gt;Endress, A. and M. Hauser (2010).  Word segmentation with universal prosodic cues. ''Cognitative Psychology, 61,'' 177-199.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the authors explain stress (loudness, pitch, and duration) on certain syllables is different between English and French and although listeners can discern some prosodic cues of a foreign language, lack of language power hampers competent understanding. adult learners of a non-native language depend on lexical information that is already ingrained in their native language. Non-native speech may have different sets of language
processing during parsing, which may impact comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Clahsen, H. and C. Felser (2006).  Grammatical processing in language learners. ''Applied Psycholinguistics, 27'', 3-42.&lt;/ref&gt; These differences can be highly situational, such as in academic listening.&lt;ref name="finn"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of listening ability often require at least enough technology to broadcast recordings or require teachers to produce oral language.&lt;ref name="wet"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The biases of oral tests for listening and language comprehension is regrettably apparent when the tests involve a variable amount of teachers’ partisanship on what defines listening comprehension of a language.

Computer Language systems have now come to the forefront and now have the ability to broadcast or playback audio for use in the assessment of listening skills.&lt;ref name="arias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zaho"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, for this type of measurement to effectively measure LP as opposed to AK, the test items must be formed in a way that emulates real world listening. Specifically, the Rate of Speech (ROS) must be that of the real-world. Non-native speakers, when they attempt to use a second language conversationally in a real-time environment, must be able to process and interpret what they hear – at the rate at which the native speaker is speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vandergrift, L. (2006).   Second language listening: Listening ability or language proficiency? ''The Modern Language Journal, 90(1),'' 6-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lezgian''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|z|ɡ|i|ən}},&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''Lezgi''' or '''Lezgin''', is a language that belongs to the [[Lezgic languages]]. It is spoken by the [[Lezgins]], who live in southern [[Dagestan]], northern [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkey]], [[Germany]] and etc. Lezgian is a literary language and an [[official language]] of [[Dagestan]]. It is classified as "vulnerable" by [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217175902/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=February 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNESCO Endangered Language Criteria: 1. Vulnerable, 2. Definitely Endangered, 3. Severely Endangered, 4. Critically Endangered, 5. Extinct--&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
In 2002, Lezgian was spoken by about 397,000 people in Russia, mainly Southern Dagestan, and in 1999 by 178,400 people in mainly the [[Qusar Rayon|Qusar]], [[Quba Rayon|Quba]], [[Qabala Rayon|Qabala]], [[Oghuz Rayon|Oghuz]], [[Ismailli Rayon|Ismailli]] and [[Khachmaz Rayon|Khachmaz ''(Xaçmaz)'']] provinces of northeastern Azerbaijan. Lezgian is also spoken in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], [[Germany]] and [[Uzbekistan]] by immigrants from [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Dagestan]].

There are also small populations in the [[Balikesir]], [[Yalova]], [[Izmir]], [[Bursa]] regions in Turkey. The Lezgian people are concentrated mainly in Kirne (Ortaca) village of the [[Balikesir]] region.

The total number of speakers is about 800,000.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lez |title=Enthnologue report for Lezgi |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related languages==
There are nine languages in the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic language family]], namely: '''Lezgian''', [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]], [[Rutul language|Rutul]], [[Aghul language|Aghul]], [[Tsakhur language|Tsakhur]], [[Budukh language|Budukh]], [[Kryts language|Kryts]], [[Udi language|Udi]] and [[Archi language|Archi]]. These languages have the same names as their ethnic groups.

Some of its dialects are considered very different from the standard form, including the [[Quba dialect]] spoken in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

*{{IPA|/a/}} has two main allophones: {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[ʌ]}}; the former prevails in closed syllables (especially before uvulars and {{IPA|/r/}}), the latter in open syllables.
*{{IPA|/a/}} is very often rounded after labialized consonants, which may then lose their labialization.
*{{IPA|/e/}} is open ({{IPA|[ɛ]}}) in stressed syllables
*if a vowel plus {{IPA|/n/}} sequence is not followed by a vowel, the {{IPA|/n/}} may be deleted and the vowel nasalized. Thus {{IPA|/zun/}} ('I') can be pronounced {{IPA|[zũ]}}.

===Consonants===
There are 54 consonants in Lezgian. Characters to the right are the letters of the Lezgian Cyrillic Alphabet. Note that aspiration is not normally indicated in the orthography, despite the fact that it is phonemic.

{{main article|Lezgin alphabets}}
Lezgian has been written in several different alphabets over the course of its history.  These alphabets have been based on three scripts: [[Arabic script|Arabic]] (before 1928), [[Latin script|Latin]] (1928–38), and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] (1938–present).

The Lezgian Cyrillic alphabet is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Талибов Б. Б., Гаджиев М. М. Лезгинско-русский словарь. [[Moscow]], 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Lezgian is unusual for a Northeast Caucasian language in not having [[noun class]]es (also called "grammatical gender"). Standard Lezgian grammar features 18 [[grammatical case]]s,&lt;ref&gt;p. 74. [[Martin Haspelmath|Haspelmath, Martin]]. 1993. ''A Grammar of Lezgian''. Walter de Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt; produced by agglutinating suffixes, of which 12 are still used in spoken conversation.

===Cases===
The four grammatical cases are:
* [[Absolutive case]] (basic form of the word, no ending): marks the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive sentence. It is also used to mark a nominal predicate (who or what something turns into/becomes) and as a [[vocative case|vocative]].
* [[Ergative case]] (various endings; the most common are: -ди, -a or -е; [-di, -a or e], which are added to the Absolutive): marks the subject of transitive verbs, and the subject of some compound intransitive verbs.
* [[Genitive case]] (ending -н [-n]; added to the Ergative): marks possession. It is also used with the meaning 'of'. The genitive case precedes the noun that it modifies.
* [[Dative case]] (ending -з [-z]; added to the Ergative): usually marks the indirect object of sentences, that is the recipient of an action. It is also used to mark the subject of some verbs (mainly about emotions) and to express a point of time and direction.
*There are fourteen [[Locative case]]s:
** [[Adessive case]] (ending -в [-v]; added to the Ergative): marks the object of some verbs to mean 'near by'.
** [[Adelative case]] (ending -вай [-vaj]; added to the Ergative): expresses movement from somewhere. It is also used with the verb 'to be able' and to express an accidental action.
** [[Addirective case]] (ending -вди [-vdi]; added to the Ergative): used as an [[instrumental case]], but also sometimes used with its original meaning, 'in the direction of', and more rarely 'near by'.
** The [[Postessive case]] (ending -хъ [-qh]; added to the Ergative): means 'behind', 'in exchange for', and 'with.' In a construction with the verb ава (ava), it means 'there is'.
** [[Postelative case]] (ending -хъай [-qhaj]; added to the Ergative): can either mean 'from' or 'who is feared'.
** [[Postdirective case]] (ending -хъди [-qhdi]; added to the Ergative): rarely used case, meaning 'toward(s)'.
** [[Subessive case]] (ending -к [-k]; added to the Ergative): means either 'below' or 'participates'.
** [[Subelative case]] (ending -кай [-kaj]; added to the Ergative): means either 'from below', 'from', '(from) against', 'with' or 'out of'. It is also used to mark Y in the construction 'X becomes out-of-Y' and can express the topic of a sentence or the cause of emotions.
** [[Subdirective case]] (ending -кди [-kdi]; added to the Ergative): expresses cause, and can mean 'because' or 'of' (when in sentences such as 'the man died ''of'' a disease'.
** [[Inessive case]] (endings -а or -е [-a or -e]; added to Absolutive): means 'at', 'in' or 'during/whilst'.
** [[Inelative case]] (endings -ай or -ей [-aj or -ej]; added to Inessive): means 'out of' or 'in return for'.
** [[Superessive case]] (ending -л [-l]; added to the Inessive): means 'on', and also to express the cause of some emotions.
** [[Superelative case]] (ending -лай [-laj]; added to the Inessive): means 'off', 'after' or 'than'.
** [[Superdirective case]] (ending -лди [-ldi]; added to the Inessive): means 'onto', 'until', 'in' (when followed by an adjective) and to mark the language being used.

|}
Nouns following a number are always in the singular. Numbers precede the noun. "Сад" and "кьвед" lose their final "-д" before a noun.

Lezgian numerals work in a similar fashion to the French ones, and are based on the vigesimal system in which "20", not "10", is the base number. "Twenty" in Lezgian is "къад", and higher numbers are formed by adding the suffix -ни to the word (which becomes "къанни" - the same change occurs in пудкъад and кьудкъад) and putting the remaining number afterwards. This way 24 for instance is къанни кьуд ("20 and 4"), and 37 is къанни цӏерид ("20 and 17"). Numbers over 40 are formed similarly (яхцӏур becomes яхцӏурни). 60 and 80 are treated likewise. For numbers over 100 just put a number of hundreds, then (if need be) the word with a suffix, then the remaining number. 659 is thus ругуд вишни яхцӏурни цӏекӏуьд. The same procedure follows for 1000. 1989 is агьзурни кӏуьд вишни кьудкъанни кӏуьд in Lezgi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3483">A '''locale''' (translated as "local" or "place"), is the main local organizational unit of the [['Ndrangheta]] with [[jurisdiction]] over criminal activities in an entire town or an area in a large urban center.&lt;ref name=paoli29&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qX5NfHTWzS0C&amp;pg=PA29 pp. 29-30]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nicaso1&gt;Nicaso &amp; Danesi, ''Made Men'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fEQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''locale'' is usually made up by one ''[['ndrina]]'' (in the case of a small town) or several '' 'ndrine'', if more than one '' 'ndrina'' operates in the same town. In the case of larger cities a local may rule over a certain area or neighbourhood of the city.&lt;ref name=nicaso1/&gt; In some contexts a '' 'ndrina'' is more powerful than the ''locale'' on which they formally depend.&lt;ref name=paoli29/&gt;

Each ''locale'' has a boss with authority over members' life and death, a ''capo locale'', usually the [[capobastone]] of a 'ndrina.&lt;ref name=nicaso1/&gt; It has at least 49 members and besides the ''capo locale'', there is the ''contabile '' (accountant) who handles the finances - commonly called ''la bacinella'' or ''la valigetta'' (briefcase) - and a ''crimine'' that oversees the illegal activity. All three form a [[triumvirate]] called the ''Copiata''.&lt;ref name=rep&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/07/14/news/la_cupola_della_ndrangheta-5572170/ Il Crimine, i mastri, le 'ndrine; ecco la Cupola modello Cosa nostra], La Repubblica, July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A ''locale'' is often subdivided into two divisions: the ''società minore'' (the "minor" or lower society) and the ''società maggiore'' ("major" or higher society). The minor is submissive to the major.&lt;ref name=nicaso1/&gt;&lt;ref name=paoli47&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qX5NfHTWzS0C&amp;pg=PA47 pp. 47-48]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''locale'' of [[San Luca]] has a historical preeminence. Every new group or ''locale'' must obtain its authorization to operate and every group belonging to the 'Ndrangheta "still has to deposit a small percentage of illicit proceeds to the ''principale'' of San Luca in recognition of the latter's primordial supremacy."&lt;ref name=paoli29/&gt;

'''Milind Gadhavi''' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: મિલિન્દ ગઢવી b. 1 May 1985) is a [[Gujarati language]] poet and lyricist from [[Gujarat]], [[India]]. He has penned songs for several [[Gujarati cinema|Gujarati movies]].

&lt;ref name="RJ Aditi 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Transmedia Awards 2015 | website=RJ Aditi | date=2016-02-29 | url=http://www.rjaditi.com/transmediaawards2015/ | accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Gadhavi was born in Datrana, a village in [[Mendarda]] taluka of [[Junagadh district]] to Bharatkumar Gadhavi and Chandanbahen Gadhavi. He was educated in schools and institutions including Roopayatan, Good Samaritan English Medium High School ([[Amreli]]), Gurukul ([[Savarkundla]]), Carmel Convent High School (Junagadh), St. Xavier's High School ([[Jamnagar]]), St. Mary's School ([[Porbandar]]), Swami Vivekanand Vinay Mandir (Junagadh). He completed his [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in 2009 from [[Saurashtra University]] and [[M.B.A]] in 2011 from the Faculty of Management Studies, [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda|M.S University]], [[Vadodara]].&lt;ref name="મોરપીંછ 2016"/&gt;

He wrote his first poem in 6th standard at the age of 11, and wrote his first ghazal in 8th standard. In 12th standard, he learned the [[Arabic prosody|metres of ghazal]] and ventured in metrical form.

== Career ==
[[File:Poet Milind Gadhavi with Morari Bapu.jpg|thumb|Milind Gadhavi with [[Morari Bapu]] at Asmita Parva, Mahuva on April 2015|left]]
Gadhavi is an Assistant Manager at Saurashtra Gramin Bank, Junagadh since 2013. His poems have been published in many eminent Gujarati literary magazines including [[Shabdasrishti]], [[Gazalvishwa]], [[Dhabak]], Kumar, Kavita, Navneet Samarpan, Uddesh, Akhand Anand, Shabdalay and Tamanna.&lt;ref name="મોરપીંછ 2016"/&gt; He has recited his poems at [[Doordarshan]], [[All India Radio|Akashvani]], Asmitaparva and other places of Gujarat. In July 2015, he recited his poems in Maanas Dharmrath Mushayra at [[Nyeri]], [[Kenya]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Works ==
Although Gadhavi has written in many different genres of poetry including [[ghazal]], nazm, [[Geet (song)|geet]], [[sonnet]], [[free verse]], muktak, tripadi, anjani, [[triolet]] and [[villanelle]], his main contribution is ghazal. The tender feelings of a young lover's heart and the disappointment from a lover's absence are the two sides of his ghazals.&lt;ref name="મોરપીંછ 2016"/&gt; He penned 1 song, ''"''Me to suraj ne ropyo chhe aangne''"'', for the Gujarati movie [[Premji: Rise of a Warrior|''Premji: Rise of a Warrior'']] and started his career as a [[lyricist]]. He has penned two songs for the film ''[[Thai Jashe!]]'' (both sung by [[Parthiv Gohil]]) and one song for "''I Wish"'', an upcoming [[Gujarati cinema|Gujarati movie]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''National Poetry Writing Month''' (also known as '''NaPoWriMo''') is a [[creative writing]] project held annually in April in which participants attempt to write a [[poem]] each day for one month. NaPoWriMo coincides with the [[National Poetry Month]] in the United States of America and Canada.

== History ==
[[Maureen Thorson]], a poet and publisher of [[Big Game Books]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reenhead.com/biggame/biggame.html&lt;/ref&gt; announced the project March 17, 2003 as an online project on her blog.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reenhead.com/varchives/2003_03_16_varchives.php#90858622#90858622&lt;/ref&gt;  She invited other poets with blogs to join her in the project and listed the participating poets.  Thorson has continued to run the project each year on her blog with more poets participating as the word has spread about the project.

In 2009 the [[American Academy of Poets]] tied the project to a fund-raising drive for the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/540&lt;/ref&gt;  The Academy had announced the fund-raising drive in honor of NaPoWriMo's "fifth anniversary" when it was actually the project's sixth year of existence.

Other sites fostering the project include the following:

== Products ==

The NetOwl suite includes, among others, the following text and entity analytics products:

=== Text Analytics ===

NetOwl Extractor performs [[entity extraction]] from unstructured texts using [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]].  Extractor also performs [[semantic relationship]] and [[event extraction]] as well as [[geotagging]] of text.&lt;ref name="maybury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="geoint"/&gt; It is used for a variety of data sources including both traditional sources (e.g., news, reports, web pages, email) and social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, chats, blogs).&lt;ref name="assentor"/&gt; It runs on Big Data analytics platforms such as [[Apache Hadoop]] and LexisNexis’s High-Performance Computer Cluster ([[HPCC]]) technology.&lt;ref name="lexisnexis"/&gt; It has been integrated with a number of 3rd party analytical tools such as Google Earth/Maps.&lt;ref name="geoint"/&gt;

=== Entity Analytics ===

NetOwl NameMatcher and EntityMatcher perform name matching and identity resolution for large multicultural and multilingual entity databases using machine learning and computational linguistic approaches.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="transliteration"/&gt;  They are used for applications such as watch lists, compliance, fraud detection, etc.

== History ==

The first NetOwl product was NetOwl Extractor, which was initially released in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins-Bonafield, Christine. [http://www.networkcomputing.com/709/709hreportb.html “Filtering Knowledge On The Net Just Got Simpler.”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030330031828/http://www.networkcomputing.com/709/709hreportb.html# |date=2003-03-30 }}  NetWork Computing (1996-05-31). Retrieved 2013-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, Extractor has added several new capabilities, including link and event extraction, geotagging, and sentiment analysis, as well as entity extraction in other languages and name translation.  Other products were added later to the NetOwl suite, namely DocMatcher, TextMiner, NameMatcher, and EntityMatcher.

NetOwl has participated in several 3rd party-sponsored text and entity analytics software benchmarking events. NetOwl Extractor was the top-scoring named entity extraction system at the [[DARPA]]-sponsored [[Message Understanding Conference]] MUC-6 and the top-scoring link and event extraction system in MUC-7.&lt;ref&gt;Sundheim, Beth M. [http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/M/M95/M95-1002.pdf "Overview of Results of the MUC-6 Evaluation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212164701/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/M/M95/M95-1002.pdf# |date=2006-12-12 }} In Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Message Understanding (1995), pp. 13-31.

'''Projected area''' is two-dimensional [[area]] measurement of a three-dimensional object by projecting its shape on to an arbitrary plane. This is often used in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[architectural engineering]] related fields, specifically [[hardness]] testing, [[axial stress]], wind pressures, and [[terminal velocity]].

The geometrical definition of a projected area is: "the rectilinear [[parallel projection]] of a surface of any shape onto a plane". This translates into the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{projected} = \int_{A} \cos{\beta} \, dA&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the original area, and &lt;math&gt;\beta \,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the normal to the surface A and the normal to the arbitrary plane onto which we project. For basic shapes the results are listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="rpfaq"&gt;[https://employeepages.scad.edu/~kwitte/documents/Photometry_FAQ.PDF]{{Citation|last = Palmer|first = James M.|title = Radiometry and photometry FAQ|date = 1999-07-08|url = https://employeepages.scad.edu/~kwitte/documents/Photometry_FAQ.PDF|accessdate = 2011-04-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5725">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''reaction formation''' ({{lang-de|Reaktionsbildung}}) is a [[defense mechanism]] in which emotions and impulses which are [[anxiety]]-producing or perceived to be unacceptable are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency.&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/counseling/defenses.html
|title=Defenses

|accessdate=2008-03-11

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London, 2nd Edn, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
The reaction formations belong to [[Defence_mechanisms#Level_3:_Neurotic|Level III]] of neurotic [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]], which also include intellectualization, dissociation, displacement and repression.

== Theory ==
Reaction formation depends on the hypothesis that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he instincts and their derivatives may be arranged as pairs of opposites: life versus death, construction versus destruction, action versus passivity, dominance versus submission, and so forth. When one of the instincts produces anxiety by exerting pressure on the ego either directly or by way of the superego, the ego may try to sidetrack the offending impulse by concentrating upon its opposite. For example, if feelings of hate towards another person make one anxious, the ego can facilitate the flow of love to conceal the hostility."&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"&gt;Calvin S. Hall, ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology'' (New York, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form.&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"/&gt; Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely ''masks'' the hate to hide it from awareness.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;

In a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a 'simple' emotion would be suspected where ''[[exaggeration]]'', ''compulsiveness'' and ''inflexibility'' were observed. For example,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[r]eactive love [[The lady doth protest too much, methinks|protests too much]]; it is overdone, extravagant, showy, and affected. It is counterfeit, and [...] is usually easily detected. Another feature of a reaction formation is its compulsiveness. A person who is defending himself against anxiety cannot deviate from expressing the opposite of what he really feels. His love, for instance, is not flexible. It cannot adapt itself to changing circumstances as genuine emotions do; rather it must be constantly on display as if any failure to exhibit it would cause the contrary feeling to come to the surface.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Reaction formation is sometimes described as one of the most difficult defenses for lay people to understand;&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"/&gt; this testifies not merely to its effectiveness as a disguise, but also to its ubiquity and flexibility as a defense that can be utilized in many forms. For example, &lt;blockquote&gt;"solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against coprophilia",&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and it is not unknown for an analyst to explain a client's unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, &lt;blockquote&gt;"[h]igh ideals of virtue and goodness may be reaction formations against primitive object [[cathexis|cathexes]] rather than realistic values that are capable of being lived up to. Romantic notions of chastity and purity may mask crude sexual desires, altruism may hide selfishness, and piety may conceal sinfulness."&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even more counter-intuitively, according to this model
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[a] [[phobia]] is an example of a reaction formation. The person wants what he fears. He is not afraid of the object; he is afraid of the wish for the object. The reactive fear prevents the dreaded wish from being fulfilled.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as [[Stockholm Syndrome]], a hostage or kidnap victim 'falls in love' with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating 'favourites' among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.

In the [[framing (construction)|framing]] of a deck or floor system, a '''rim joist''' is attached perpendicular to the [[joist]]s, and provides lateral support for the ends of the joists while capping off the end of the floor or deck system. Rim joists are not to be confused with end joists, which are the first and last joists at the ends of a row of joists that make up a floor or deck frame. 

A rim joist's relationship to the joists is similar to what the top or bottom [[wall plate]] is to the studs.  It is also confusingly called a header ([[Framing_(construction)#Lintels_(headers)|header]] also refers to other framing components) or rim board.  Collectively, the end joists and rim joists are called band joists, especially in regard to deck construction. In dimensioned lumber construction, the rim joists are the same depth, thickness and material as the joists themselves; in engineered wood construction, the rim joists may be OSB, plywood or an engineered wood material varying in thickness from 1" to as much as 1.75", though they are usually LVL 1.125" or LSL 1.25" thick. In flooring construction, the rim joists sit on the sill plates; in deck construction, they are parallel to the support beams and sit on the beams or in some cases, cantilever away from the beams.

A double thickness board in the position of a rim joist is called a ''flush [[beam (structure)|beam]]'' and serves a dual purpose, providing primary support for the joist ends as well as capping the joists.

'''Sakshi''' or Sākṣī ([[Sanskrit]]: साक्षी) means – 'observer', 'eyewitness' or the 'Supreme Being' the one that lends its shine - " Chitchhaya"- to the "ego" part of the subtle body - which consists of the everchanging Mind, the decision making Intellect, the Memory &amp; the Illusory Ego ! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit – English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.6.apte.742017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], the word, ''Sākṣī'' or 'witness' refers to the 'Pure Awareness' that witnesses the world but does not get affected or involved. ''Sakshi'' is beyond time, space and the triad of experiencer, experiencing and experienced; ''sakshi'' witnesses all thoughts, words and deeds without interfering with them or being affected by them, other than ''sakshi'' there is nothing else in the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02ANh3NTm6sC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the word, साक्षी (''sākṣī''), used in the following verse from [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],

:एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः सर्वव्यापी सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा |
:कर्माध्यक्षः सर्वभूताधिवासः साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च ||

:"The same Deity remains hidden in all beings, and is all-pervasive and the indwelling Self of all beings. He is the supervisor of actions, lives in all beings, (He is) the Witness, the bestower of intelligence, the Absolute and devoid of the (three) gunas." ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Sl. VI.11)
[[Pāṇini|Panini]] states that the same indicates a direct seer or eyewitness (Panini Sutras V.ii.91),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Śvetāśvatatra Upanisad 1986 Ed.|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=190–191|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/svetasvatara-upanishad-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakshi means [[Ishvara]], the चेता (cetā), the sole Self-consciousness, who is the witness of all, who gives consciousness to every human being, thereby making each rational and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriya Yoga|author=Paramahamsa Hariharananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G11HR9B4io8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vedanta]] speaks of mind (''chitta'') or ''antahkarana'' ('internal instrument'), and matter as the subtle and gross forms of one and the same reality; being the subtle aspect of matter, mind is not a tangible reality. The field of mind (''Chittakasha'') involves the duality of the seer and the seen, the observer (''drg'') and the observed (''drshya''), which duality is overcome in the field of pure Consciousness. ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka|Drg-drshya-Viveka]]'' tells us:-

:"When form is the object of observation or drshyam, then the eye is the observer or drk; when the eye is the object of observation, then the mind is the observer; when the pulsations of the mind are the objects of observation, then Sakshi or the Witnessing-Self is the real observer; and it is always the observer, and, being self-luminous, can never be the object of observation. When the notion and the attachment that one is the physical body is dissolved, and the Supreme Self is realized, wherever one goes, there one experiences [[Samadhi]]. "

''Sakshi'', the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the unchangeable eternal Reality, is the Pure Consciousness and knowledge, in which regard [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that knowledge does not destroy or create, it only illumines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Being in Depth|author=Swami Ranganathananda|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=86–87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJGFP__WXX0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oyExU7uCHs-GrAemvoCQBg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the senses (''indriyas'') are not the mind, the mind uses them as an implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Pschology: Its Meaning for the West|author=Swami Akhilananda|publisher=Routledge|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSVvzCC4mVYC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viIxU4rkNYLOrQfwzIAI&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Varaha Upanishad (IV) refers to the ''Bhumika'' ('stage of development of wisdom') which is of the form of ''pranava'' (''Aum'' or ''[[Om]]'') as formed of or divided into – ''akāra'', ''ukāra'', ''makāra'' and ''ardhmātra'', which is on account of the difference of ''sthula'' ('gross'), ''sukshama'' ('subtle'), ''bija'' ('seed' or 'causal') and ''sakshi'' ('witness') whose ''avasthas'' ('states') are – 'waking', 'dreaming', 'dream-less sleep' and 'turiya'. ''Sakshi'' which is '[[turiya]]' is the essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JCUxU9rTCsWKrQflmICgAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty which perceives the individual personality is ''Sakshi'' or 'Witness' or the higher 'Ego'. Mind (''manas''), Ego (''ahankara'') and ''Sakshi'', all perform different functions but that difference of functions does not mean difference in nature or essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rambles in Vedanta|author=B.R.Rajam Iyer|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=280, 289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89doofWiWJIC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iAxU9W8FIiFrAfQz4HQDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Philosophy discovered the concept of ''Sakshi'', the ultimate Observer, or Witness behind the sense of individuality, or the ego; the ''Sakshi'' is the timeless Being which witnesses all this ceaseless flow and change in the world of thought and things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manoniyantran|author=T.N.Achuta Rao|publisher=Gyan Books|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okUjWme6MF8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=sakshi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BB0xU-DbOI6FrgeLuYD4Dw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Puzzles}}
A '''self-reference puzzle''' is a type of [[logic]]al [[puzzle]] where the question in the puzzle refers to the attributes of the puzzle itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddewey.net/puzzle/ Base 3 self-reference puzzles]&lt;/ref&gt;
A common example is that a "fill in the blanks" style sentence is given, but what is filled in the blanks can contribute to the sentence itself. An example is "There are _____ e's in this sentence.", for which a solution is "eight" (since including the "eight", there are 8 e's in the sentence).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7764">{{confusing|date=March 2016}}'''Shm-reduplication''' is a form of [[reduplication]] in which the original word or its first syllable (the '''base''') is repeated with the copy (the '''reduplicant''') beginning with '''shm-''' (sometimes '''schm-'''), pronounced {{IPAc-en|ʃ|m}}. The construction is generally used to indicate irony, [[sarcasm]], derision, skepticism, or lack of interest with respect to comments about the discussed object:
:He's just a baby!
::"Baby-shmaby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Holly R |publisher=[[Jews for Jesus]] |title=The Baby |url=http://jewsforjesus.org/publications/newsletter/1986_12/baby |date=December 1, 1986|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He's already 5 years old!
The speaker is being skeptical. They do not think their kid is a baby or babyish.
:What a sale!
::"Sale, schmale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shoppers say 'ho-hum' not 'ho-ho-ho' to sales |author=Christina Rexrode and Sarah Skidmore |url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/12/07/shoppers_say_ho_hum_not_ho_ho_ho_to_sales/ |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]|date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; I'm waiting for a larger discount.
The speaker is showing lack of interest. They do not care about the sale.

The original word can be a [[noun]], but also an [[adjective]]:
:"Whenever we go to a fancy-schmancy restaurant, we feel like James Bond."
In this case, it is being used to intensify the meaning of "fancy", implying that it's really fancy.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Penn &amp; Teller's how to play with your food |author=Penn Jillette and Teller |authorlink=Penn &amp; Teller |publisher=Villard Books |year=1992 |page=35 |isbn=0-679-74311-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, the new combination is used as an interjection. In the case of adjectives, the reduplicated combination can belong to the same syntactical category as the original.

== Phonological properties ==
* Words beginning with a single consonant typically replace that consonant with shm- (table shmable).
* Words beginning with a consonant cluster are more variable: some speakers replace only the first consonant if possible (breakfast shmreakfast), others replace the entire cluster (breakfast shmeakfast).
* Vowel-initial words prepend the shm- directly to the beginning of the reduplicant (apple shmapple). Although this is conventionally accepted by English speakers as an addition of a new element to a whole word, from a strictly phonetic point of view this, too, is a replacement of the initial [[glottal stop]] by the shm- morpheme.
* Some speakers target the stressed syllable rather than the first syllable (incredible inshmedible); a subset of these do not copy base material preceding the stressed syllable (incredible shmedible; cf. Spitzer 1952).
* When speaking two words, usually only the second word is shm-reduplicated ([[Led Zeppelin]] Led Shmeppelin).
* Shm-reduplication is generally avoided or altered with words that already begin with shm-; for instance, schmuck does not yield the expected *schmuck schmuck, but rather total avoidance or mutation of the shm- (giving forms like schmuck shluck, schmuck fluck, and so on).
* Many speakers use sm- instead of shm- with words that contain a sh (Ashmont Smashmont, not shmashmont).
Bert Vaux and Andrew Nevins' online survey of shm-reduplication revealed further phonological details.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2003|last1=Nevins|first1=Andrew|last2=Vaux|first2=Bert|title=Metalinguistic, shmetalinguistic: the phonology of shm-reduplication|work=Proceedings of CLS 39|url=https://www.academia.edu/209796/Metalinguistic_shmetalinguistic_The_phonology_of_shm-reduplication|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and sociolinguistic distribution ==
The construction originated in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and was subsequently transferred to [[English language|English]], especially urban northeastern [[American English]], by Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrations from Central and Eastern Europe. It is now known and used by many non-Jewish English speakers, particularly American English. 
The construction was also adopted in [[Modern Hebrew]] usage as a prefix resulting in a derogatory echoic expressive.  For example, March 29, 1955 [[David Ben-Gurion]] dismissed a [[United Nations]] resolution as "''[[Um-Shmum]]''", (U.M. being its Hebrew acronym, pronounced ''oom-schmoom'').

Zuckerman wrote: "When an Israeli speaker would like to express his impatience with or disdain for philosophy, s/he can say ''filosófya-'''shm'''ilosófya''".&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2: 40–67, p. 49, where he also refers to Haig (2001) and Lewis (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; In German Yiddish the same construction is possible, too, for example: ''Visum-Schmisum'' (i.e.: visa permits that have been somehow obtained, possibly below the level of legality).
Zuckermann (2009) mentions in this context the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] initial m-segment conveying a sense of "and so on" as in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] sentence '''''dergi mergi''' okumuyor'', literally "magazine 'shmagazine' read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd person singular", i.e. "(He) doesn’t read magazines, journals or anything like that".&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"/&gt;

A similar phenomenon is present in most of the languages of the [[Balkan sprachbund]], especially in colloquial [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] where not only "sh(m)-" and "m-", but also other consonants and consonant clusters are used in this way, and its usage has its particularities that differ from what the English 'shm' indicates.&lt;ref&gt;P. Asenova. ''Main problems of the Balkan sprachbund. Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria''. 2002. ({{lang-bg|Асенова, П., Балканско езикознание. Основни проблеми на балканския езиков съюз. Велико Търново. 2002 г.}})&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2015}}

== As a counterexample in linguistics ==

Shm-reduplication has been advanced as an example of a natural-language phenomenon that cannot be captured by a [[context-free grammar]].&lt;ref name=underbelly&gt;{{cite paper | journal = Proceedings of the Chicago Linguistics Society | title = The soft formal underbelly of theoretical syntax | last1 = Manaster-Ramer | first1 = Alexis | authorlink = Alexis Manaster-Ramer | volume = 19 | pages = 256–262 | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential argument was that the reduplication can be repeated indefinitely, producing a sequence of phrases of geometrically{{clarify|date=October 2018}} increasing length, which cannot occur in a context-free language.&lt;ref name="underbelly"/&gt;

'''Tiberian Hebrew''' is the canonical pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible or [[Tanakh]] committed to writing by [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] scholars living in the [[Jew]]ish community of [[Tiberias]] in ancient [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] {{circa|750–950 CE}}. They wrote in the form of [[Tiberian vocalization]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6upai6--QhMC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6 Tiberian Hebrew Phonology: Focussing on Consonant Clusters, Andries W. Coetzee]&lt;/ref&gt; which employed diacritics added to the Hebrew letters: vowel signs and consonant diacritics ([[Niqqud|nequdot]]) and the so-called accents (two related systems of [[cantillation]] signs or te'amim). These together with the marginal notes masora magna and masora parva make up the Tiberian apparatus.

Though the written vowels and accents came into use only c. 750 CE, the oral tradition they reflect is many centuries older, with ancient roots. Although not in common use today, the Tiberian pronunciation of Hebrew is considered by textual scholars{{which|date=April 2014}} to be the most accurate reproduction of the original Semitic consonantal and vowel sounds of ancient Hebrew.

== Sources ==
[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Page from Aleppo Codex, Deuteronomy]]

Today's Hebrew grammar books do not teach the Tiberian Hebrew that was described by the early grammarians. The prevailing view is that of [[David Qimchi]]'s system of dividing the graphic signs into "short" and "long" vowels. The values assigned to the Tiberian vowel signs reveals a [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi tradition]] of pronunciation (the dual quality of qames ({{lang|he|אָ}}) as {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}; the pronunciation of simple ''sheva'' ({{lang|he|אְ}}) as {{IPA|/ɛ̆/}}).

The [[phonology]] of Tiberian Hebrew can be gleaned from the collation of various sources:
* The [[Aleppo Codex]] of the Hebrew Bible and ancient manuscripts of the [[Tanakh]] cited in the margins of early codices, all which preserve direct evidence in a graphic manner of the application of vocalization rules such as the widespread use of chateph vowels where one would expect simple ''sheva'', thus clarifying the color of the vowel pronounced under certain circumstances. Most prominent are the use of chateph chireq in five words under a consonant that follows a guttural vocalized with regular chireq (as described by [[Israel Yeivin]]) as well as the anomalous use of the raphe sign over letters that do not belong to {{lang|he|בגדכפ"ת}} or {{lang|he|א"ה}}.
* The explicit statements found in grammars of the 10th and 11th centuries, including the ''Sefer haQoloth'' {{lang|he|ספר הקולות}} of [[Moshe ben Asher]] (published by N. Allony); the ''Sefer Dikdukei ha-Te'amim'' ({{lang|he|ספר דקדוקי הטעמים}} Grammar or Analysis of the Accents) of [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]]; the anonymous works entitled ''Horayath haQoré'' {{lang|he|הורית הקורא}} (G. Khan and Ilan Eldar attribute it to the Karaite Abu Alfaraj Harun); the ''Treatise on the Schwa'' (published by Kurt Levy from a [[Genizah]] fragment in 1936), and ''Ma'amar haschewa'' {{lang|he|מאמר השוא}} (published from Genizah material by Allony); the works of medieval Sephardi grammarians including [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] and [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]].
In the last two, it is evident that the chain of transmission is breaking down or that their interpretations are influenced by local tradition.
* Ancient manuscripts that preserve similar dialects of [[Hebrew]] or Palestinian [[Aramaic]] but are vocalized in Tiberian signs in a "vulgar" manner and so reveal a [[phonetic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|phonetic spelling]] rather than a [[phonemic spelling]]. These include the so-called "pseudo-Ben Naphtali" or "Palestinian-Sephardi" vocalized manuscripts, which generally conform to the rules enumerated below, such as pronouncing ''sheva'' as {{IPA|/ĭ/}} before consonantal yod, as in {{IPA|/bĭji/}} {{lang|he|בְּיִ}}.
* Other traditions such as the vocalization of the [[Land of Israel]] and (to a lesser extent) the [[Babylon]]ian vocalization. Each community (Palestinian, Tiberian, Babylonian) developed systems of notation for pronunciation in each dialect, some of which are common among the traditions.
* Transcriptions of Biblical text into Arabic characters and then vocalized with Tiberian signs (by members of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] community); they provide an aid to pronouncing Tiberian Hebrew, especially for syllable structure and vowel length (which is marked in Arabic by [[matres lectionis]] and the sign [[sukun]]).
* Various oral traditions, especially that of [[Yemenite Hebrew]] pronunciation and the Karaite tradition; both have preserved old features that correspond to Tiberian tradition, such as the pronunciation of schwa according to its proximity to gutturals or yod.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Tiberian Hebrew has 29 consonantal phonemes, represented by 22 letters. The [[sin dot]] distinguishes between the two values of {{Hebrew|ש}}, with a dot on the left ({{Hebrew|שׂ}}) being pronounced the same as the letter Samekh. The letters {{Hebrew|בגדכפת}} ([[begadkefat]]) had two values each: [[plosive]] and [[fricative]].

The following are the most salient characteristics of the Tiberian Hebrew consonantal pronunciation:

* [[Waw/Vav (letter)|Waw]] {{lang|he|ו}} conjunctive was read, before the labial vowels ({{lang|he|בומ״ף}}) and shva ({{lang|he|אְ}}), as {{lang|he|אוּ}} {{IPA|/ʔu/}}, rather than {{lang|he|וֻ}} {{IPA|/wu/}} (as is the case in some eastern reading traditions).
&lt;!--- In segolates of II Yod, the point under such consonant is not a chireq but a mappiq to indicate that it should be pronounced as a diphthong and as one syllable, not two syllables.--&gt;
* The threefold pronunciation of [[Resh]] {{lang|he|ר}}. Even though there is no agreement as to how it was pronounced, the rules of distribution of such pronunciation is given in {{lang|he|הורית הקורא}} ''Horayath haQoré'':

: '''a)''' "Normal" Resh {{IPA|/ʀ/}} pronounced thus (according to Eldar, as a uvular sound {{IPA|[ʀ]}}) in all other instances (except for the circumstances described below): {{lang|he|אוֹר}} {{IPA|[ʔoːʀ]}}

: '''b)''' The "peculiar" resh {{IPA|[r]}} before or after Lamed or Nun, any of the three being vocalized with simple ''sheva'' and Resh after Zayin {{lang|he|ז}}, Daleth {{lang|he|ד}}, Samekh {{lang|he|ס}}, Sin {{lang|he|שׂ}}, Taw {{lang|he|ת}}, Tzadi {{lang|he|צ}}, Teth {{lang|he|ט}}, any of them punctuated with simple ''sheva'': {{lang|he|יִשְׂרָאֵל}} {{IPA|[jisrɔːˈʔeːl]}}, {{lang|he|עָרְלָה}} {{IPA|[ʕɔrˈlɔː]}}. Because of the proximity of a [[dental consonant]], it is likely that Resh was  then pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]], as it still is in [[Sephardi Hebrew]].

: '''c)''' There is still another pronunciation, affected by the addition of a dagesh in the Resh in certain words in the Bible, which indicates it was doubled {{IPA|[ʀː]}}: {{lang|he|הַרְּאִיתֶם}} {{IPA|[haʀːĭʔiːˈθɛːm]}}. As can be seen, this pronunciation has to do with the progressive increase in length of this consonant ({{lang|he|הָרְאִיתֶם}}). It was preserved only by the population of Ma'azya (מעזיה), which is in Tiberias.

* A possible threefold pronunciation of Taw ת. There are three words in the Torah, Prophets and Writings of which is said that "the Taw is pronounced harder than usual". It is said that this pronunciation was halfway between the soft Taw ת {{IPA|/θ/}} and the hard Taw תּ {{IPA|/t/}}: {{lang|he|וַיְשִׂימֶהָ תֵּל}} {{IPA|[wajsiːˈmɛːhɔθ teːl]}}

The vowel qualities {{IPA|/a e i ɔ o u/}} have phonemic status: {{lang|he|אָשָׁם הוּא אָשֹׁם אָשַׁם}} (Lev. 5:19) and {{lang|he|אָשֵׁם}} 'guilty', {{lang|he|אִם}} 'when' and {{lang|he|אֵם}} 'mother'.&lt;ref name="b111-112"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} has phonemic value in final stressed position {{lang|he|רְעֶה רְעִי רָעָה, מִקְנֶה מְקַנֵּה, קָנֶה קָנָה קָנֹה}}, but in other positions, it may reflect loss of the opposition {{IPA|/a/}}: {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;ref name="b111-112" /&gt; By the Tiberian period, all short vowels in stressed syllables had lengthened, making vowel length allophonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Steiner|1997|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In fact, all stressed vowels were first lengthened in pause, see {{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=58–59}}, as can be seen by forms like Tiberian {{lang|he|כַּף}} {{IPA|/kaf/}} &lt; *{{IPA|/kaf/}}, pausal {{lang|he|כָּף}} {{IPA|/kɔf/}} &lt; *{{IPA|/kɔːf/}} &lt; *{{IPA|/kaːf/}} &lt; *{{IPA|/kaf/}}. The shift in Tiberian Hebrew of *{{IPA|/aː/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/ɔː/}} occurred after that lengthening but before the loss of phonemicity of length (since words like {{lang|he|ירחם}} with allophonically long {{IPA|[aː]}} show no such shift).&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels in open or stressed syllables had allophonic length (such as {{IPA|/a/}} in {{lang|he|יְרַחֵם}}, which was previously short).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=82, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;That is attested to by the testimony of Rabbi [[Joseph Qimḥi]] (12th century) and by medieval Arabic transcriptions: {{Harvcoltxt|Janssens|1982|pp=54–56}}. There is also possible evidence from the cantillation marks' behaviour and Babylonian pataḥ: {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tiberian tradition possesses three [[vowel reduction|reduced]] (ultrashort, ''hatuf'') vowels {{IPA|/ă ɔ̆ ɛ̆/}} of which {{IPA|/ɛ̆/|}} has questionable phonemicity.&lt;ref name="b117-118"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See {{lang|he|אֳנִי}} {{IPA|/ʔɔ̆ˈni/}} 'ships' {{lang|he|אֲנִי}} {{IPA|/ʔăˈni/}} 'I', {{lang|he|חֳלִי}} {{IPA|/ħɔ̆ˈli/}} 'sickness' {{lang|he|חֲלִי}} {{IPA|/ħăˈli/}} 'ornament', {{lang|he|עֲלִי}} {{IPA|/ʕăˈli/}} 'ascend!' (Num 21:17) and {{lang|he|בַּעֱלִי}} {{IPA|/baʕɛ̆ˈli/}} '(with the) pestle' (Prov 27:22). {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=117–118}} {{IPA|/ɛ̆/}} alternates with {{IPA|/ă/}} frequently and rarely contrasts with it: {{lang|he|אֱדוֹם}} {{IPA|/ʔɛ̆ˈðom/}} '[[Edom]]' versus {{lang|he|אֲדֹמִי}} {{IPA|/ʔăðoˈmi/}} 'Edomite'. {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=117–118}} {{IPA|/ɔ̆/}} is clearly phonemic but bears minimal [[functional load]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Sáenz-Badillos|1993|p=110}} {{IPA|/ă/}} is written both with ''mobile šwa'' {{angbr|{{lang|he|ְ}}}} and ''hataf patah'' {{angbr|{{lang|he|ֲ}}}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/ă/}}, under a non-guttural letter, was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel before a guttural ({{lang|he|וּבָקְעָה}} {{IPA|[uvɔqɔ̆ˈʕɔ]}}) and as {{IPA|[ĭ]}} preceding {{IPA|/j/}}, ({{lang|he|תְדַמְּיוּנִי}} {{IPA|[θăðammĭˈjuːni]}}). However, it was always pronounced as {{IPA|[ă]}} under gutturals: {{lang|he|חֲיִי}} {{IPA|[ħăˈji]}}.&lt;ref name="y281-282"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yeivin|1980|pp=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b105-106"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stress ===
Tiberian Hebrew has phonemic stress ({{lang|he|בָּנוּ֫}} {{IPA|/bɔˈnu/}} 'they built' vs. {{lang|he|בָּ֫נוּ}} {{IPA|/ˈbɔnu/}} 'in us'). Stress is most commonly ultimate, less commonly penultimate and rarely antipenultimate stress: {{lang|he|הָאֹ֫הֱלָה}} {{IPA|/hɔˈʔohɛ̆lɔ/}} 'into the tent'.&lt;ref name="b143-144"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;

In fact, it is not clear that a reduced vowel should be considered as comprising a whole syllable. For example, a word's stress shifts to a preceding open syllable to avoid it from being adjacent to another stressed syllable skips over ultrashort vowels: {{lang|he|עִם־יוֹ֫רְדֵי בוֹר}} {{IPA|/ʕimˈjorăðe vor/}} 'with those who go down into the pit' {{lang|he|מְטֹ֫עֲנֵי חָ֫רֶב}} {{IPA|/măˈtˤoʕăne ˈħɔrɛv/}} 'pierced with a sword'. See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonotactics ===
As described above, vowel length was dependent on syllable structure. Open syllables must take long or ultrashort vowels; stressed closed syllables take long vowels; unstressed closed syllables take short vowels. Traditional Hebrew philology considers ultrashort vowels not to be syllable nuclei.

The simple [[shva|''sheva'' sign]] changes its pronunciation depending on its position in the word (mobile/vocal or quiescent/[[Zero (linguistics)|zero]]), as well as due to its proximity to certain consonants.

In the examples given below, it has been preferred to show one found precisely in the Bible which represents each phenomenon in a graphic manner (i.e. a [[Shva#Tnuʿá ẖatufá ("fleeting" or "furtive" vowel)|chateph vowel]]), although these rules still apply when there is only simple ''sheva'' (depending on the manuscript or edition used).

When the simple ''sheva'' appears in any of the following positions, it is regarded as mobile (na):

* At the beginning of a word. This includes the ''sheva'' (originally the first of the word) following the attached particles bi-,ki-,li- and u- and preceded by ''metheg'' (the vertical line placed to the left of the vowel sign, which stands for either secondary stress, or its lengthening). Examples: {{lang|he|וּזֲהַב}} {{IPA|/ˌʔuːzăˈhaːv/}} Genesis 2:12; {{lang|he|בִּסֲבָךְ}} {{IPA|/ˈbiːsăvɔx/}} Psalms 74:5. But is not pronounced if there is no ''metheg''; that is, they form a closed syllable.
* The ''sheva'' following these three vowels {{IPA|/e/, /ɔ/, /o/}}, except for known types of closed syllables (and preceded or not, by metheg). Examples: {{lang|he|נֵלֲכָה-נָּא}} {{IPA|/ˌneːlăxɔˈnːɔː/}} Exodus 3:18; {{lang|he|אֵלֲכָה נָּא}} {{IPA|/ˈʔeːlăxɔː ˈnɔː/}} Exodus 4:18.
* The second of two adjacent ''sheva''s, when both appear under different consonants. Examples: {{lang|he|אֶכְתֲּבֶנּוּ}} {{IPA|/ʔɛxtăˈvɛːnːuː/}} Jeremiah 31:33; {{lang|he|וָאֶשְׁקֲלָה-לֹּו}} {{IPA|/wɔːʔɛʃqălɔˈlːoː/}} Jeremiah 32:9 (except for at the end of a word, {{lang|he|אָמַרְתְּ}} {{IPA|/ʔɔːˈmaːrt/}}).
* The ''sheva'' under the first of two identical consonants, preceded by metheg. Examples: {{lang|he|בְּחַצֲצֹן}} {{IPA|/băˌћaːsˤăˈsˤoːn/}} Gen. 14:7; {{lang|he|צָלֲלוּ}} {{IPA|/sˤɔːlăˈluː/}} Exodus: 15:10.
* The ''sheva'' under a consonant with [[dagesh]] forte or lene. Examples: {{lang|he|סֻבֳּלוֹ}} {{IPA|/suɓbɔ̆ˈloː/}} Isaiah 9:3; {{lang|he|אֶשְׁתֳּלֶנּוּ}} {{IPA|/ʔɛʃtăˈlɛːnːuː/}} Ezekiel 17:23.
* The ''sheva'' under a consonant which expects gemination, but is not marked thus, for example, the one found under {{lang|he|ר}}. And sometimes even {{lang|he|מ}} when preceded by the article. Examples: {{lang|he|מְבָרֲכֶיךָ}} {{IPA|/măvɔːʀăˈxɛːxɔː/}} Genesis 12:3; {{lang|he|הַמֲדַבְּרִים}} {{IPA|/haːmăðaɓbăˈʀiːm/}} 2 Chronicles 33:18.
* In case a quiescent ''sheva'' was followed either by a guttural or [[yodh]], it would turn into mobile according to the rules given below, if preceded by a metheg. Ancient manuscripts support this view. Examples: {{lang|he|נִבֳהָל}} {{IPA|/niːvɔ̆ˈhɔːl/}} Proverbs 28:22; {{lang|he|שִׁבֲעַת}} {{IPA|/ʃiːvăˈʕaːθ/}} Job 1:3.
* Any ''sheva'' with the sign metheg attached to it, would change an ultrashort vowel to a short, or normal length vowel. For this, only ancient, reliable manuscripts can give us a clear picture, since, with time, later vocalizers added to the number of methegs found in the Bible.

The gutturals ({{lang|he|אהח"ע}}), and yodh ({{lang|he|י}}), affect the pronunciation of the ''sheva'' preceding them. The allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/ă/}} follow these two rules:

* It would change its sound to imitate that of the following guttural. {{lang|he|וּקֳהָת}} {{IPA|/ˌʔuːqɔ̆ˈhɔːθ/}} Numbers 3:17; {{lang|he|וְנִזְרֳעָה}} {{IPA|/wănizrɔ̆ˈʕɔː/}} Numbers 5:28.
* It would be pronounced as ''ḥireq'' before consonantal ''yodh''. Examples: {{lang|he|יִרְמִיָהוּ}} {{IPA|/jiʀmĭˈjɔːhuː/}} Jeremiah 21:1; {{lang|he|עִנִייָן}} {{IPA|/ʕiːnĭˈjɔːn/}} in [[Maimonides]]' autograph in his commentary to the Mishnah.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;These two rules, as well as the rule that ''metheg'' changes ''sheva'' from an ultrashort to a normal vowel, are recorded by [[Solomon Almoli]] in his ''Halichot Sheva'' (Constantinople 1519), though he states that these differences are dying out and that in most places vocal ''sheva'' is pronounced like ''segol''. In [[Mizrahi Jews|Oriental]] communities such as the [[Syrian Jews|Syrians]], these rules continued to be recorded by grammarians into the 1900s (e.g. Sethon, Menasheh, ''Kelale Diqduq ha-qeriah'', Aleppo 1914), though they were not normally reflected in actual pronunciation. The rules about ''yodh'' and ''metheg'', though not the rule about gutturals, is still observed by the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] of Amsterdam: Rodrigues Pereira, Martin,'' 'Hochmat Shelomoh''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be said that, even though there are no special signs apart {{IPA|/ɛ̆/, /ă/, /ɔ̆/}} to denote the full range of furtive vowels, these remaining four ({{IPA|/u/, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, /o/}}) are represented by simple ''sheva'' (chateph chireq ({{lang|he|אְִ}}) in the Aleppo Codex is a scribal oddity, and certainly not regular in Hebrew manuscripts with Tiberian vocalization).

All other cases should be treated as zero vowel (quiescent, nah), including the double final ''sheva'' (double initial ''sheva'' does not exist in this Hebrew dialect), and the ''sheva'' in the words {{lang|he|שְׁתַּיִם}} {{IPA|/ˈʃtaːjim/}} and {{lang|he|שְׁנַיִם}} {{IPA|/ˈʃnaːjim/}}, read by the Tiberian Masoretes as {{lang|he|אֶשְׁתַּיִם}} {{IPA|/ʔɛʃˈtaːjim/}} and {{lang|he|אֶשְׁנַיִם}} {{IPA|/ʔɛʃˈnaːjim/}} respectively. This last case has similarities with phenomena occurring in the [[Samaritan Hebrew language|Samaritan pronunciation]] and the [[Phoenician language]].

Depending on the school of pronunciation (and relying on musical grounds, perhaps), the [[metheg]] sign served to change some closed syllables into open ones, and therefore, changing the vowel from short to long, and the quiescent ''sheva'', into a mobile one.

That is referenced specifically by medieval grammarians:
{{Quote | text=If one argues that the ''dalet'' of 'Mordecai' (and other letters in other words) has hatef qames, tell him, 'but this sign is only a device used by some scribes to warn that the consonants should be pronounced fully, and not slurred over'.|sign=[[Abu al-Faraj Harun]]|source=''Hidāyat al-Qāri'' (''Horayat Ha-Qore''), quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Yeivin|1980|pp=283–284}}}}

The names of the vowel diacritics are iconic and show some variation:
{{Quote |text=The names of the vowels are mostly taken from the form and action of the mouth in producing the various sounds, as {{Hebrew|פַּתַ֫ח}} opening; {{Hebrew|צֵרֵ֫י}} a wide parting (of the mouth), also {{Hebrew|שֶׁ֫בֶר}}) breaking, parting (cf. the Arab, kasr); {{Hebrew|חִ֫ירֶק}} (also {{Hebrew|חִרֶק}}) narrow opening; {{Hebrew|ח֫וֹלֶם}} closing, according to others fullness, i.e. of the mouth (also {{Hebrew|מְלֹא פּוּם}} fullness of the mouth). {{Hebrew|קָ֫מֶץ}} also denotes a slighter, as {{Hebrew|שׁוּרֶק}} and {{Hebrew|קִבּוּץ}} (also {{Hebrew|קבוץ פּוּם}}) a firmer, compression or contraction of the mouth. Segôl ({{Hebrew|סְגוֹל}} bunch of grapes) takes its name from its form. So {{Hebrew|שָׁלֹשׁ נְקֻדּוֹת}} (three points) is another name for Qibbúṣ. Moreover the names were mostly so formed (but only later), that the sound of each vowel is heard in the first syllable ({{Hebrew|קָמֶץ}} for {{Hebrew|קֹמֶץ}},&amp;lrm; {{Hebrew|פַּתַח}} for {{Hebrew|פֶּתַח}},&amp;lrm; {{Hebrew|צֵרִי}} for {{Hebrew|צְרִי}}); in order to carry this out consistently some even write Sägôl, Qomeṣ-ḥatûf, Qûbbûṣ.|sign=[[Wilhelm Gesenius]]|source={{Cite GHG|8|d|nologo=1}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9663">'''Victor Llona Gastañeta''' was a writer and translator, born in [[Lima]] ([[Peru]]) in 1886, who died in [[San Francisco]] in 1953.

==Early years==
The Peruvian Victor Marie Llona grew up in [[Paris]] where he attended the lycée Janson de Sailly and also a Jesuit college. At sixteen, he started visiting the literary cafés, where he met an international company, so diverse that they spoke [[Latin]] to be understood by all. The eldest of the group was an Irishman, named [[James Joyce]] (1882–1941).

In 1906, with his parents, Llona moved to the US and lived in [[Chicago]]. He remained in touch with Europe and through [[André Gide]] he had two of his short stories published in the ''Nouvelle revue française'' (1911 and 1913). Llona came back to Paris in 1913 but when the war broke out he returned to the US and lived in [[New York City]], where he made the acquaintance of several novelists of the new generation. He decided that he would make them known in France.

==Important translator==
Returning to France and having gained the confidence of Parisian publishers ([[Payot]], [[Stock (publishing house)|Stock]], [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]], [[Fayard]], [[Albin Michel]], [[La Renaissance du Livre]], [[Gallimard]]), he was going to translate some forty books into French, between 1920 and 1939, amongst them [[Scott Fitzgerald]] ([[The Great Gatsby]]), [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Theodore Dreiser]] ([[An American Tragedy]]), [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Edna Ferber]], [[Willa Cather]] and also several works by the Argentinian- English writer [[William Henry Hudson]] (1841–1922). With the help of a native Russian he was also able to translate several Russian works, from [[Aleksei Nikolaevich Tolstoi|Alexis Tolstoï]], [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ilf and Petrov|Elie Ilf]].

Llona also wrote in magazines, especially about James Joyce and [[Samuel Beckett]]. He also wrote two novels in French, one about the [[Ku Klux Klan]], one about [[prohibition]] in the States. He also co-authored a biography of [[Peter the Great]], with the Russian émigré [[Dimitri Novik]].

==Part of the French literary scene==
A few pages of Llona's Memoirs have been published, in which he speaks about his friendship with French writers, such as [[Pierre Benoît (novelist)|Pierre Benoit]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Francis Carco]], [[Henri Poulaille]], [[Jean Galtier-Boissière]], [[Jules Supervielle]], [[Paul Morand]], [[Pierre Mac Orlan]], [[Jacques de Lacretelle]], [[Julien Green]] and [[Roger Martin du Gard]]. He remained also a friend of the major NRF figures, like [[André Gide]], [[Jean Schlumberger]], [[Valéry Larbaud]], [[André Ruyters]] and [[Jacques Rivière]]. Llona also had great friendship with the Belgian poet and designer [[Jean de Bosschère]] (1878–1953), who made a lithographed portrait of him. He also wrote an essay on the French writer [[Louis Thomas (writer)|Louis Thomas]] and befriended him and his opera singing wife [[Raymonde Delaunois]].

Llona remained also in contact with American writers of the '[[Lost Generation]]', amongst them [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Nathalie Clifford Barney]], [[Paul Bowles]], [[Thornton Wilder]] and [[Scott Fitzgerald]]. He met them in the apartments of [[Gertrude Stein]] (1874–1946) and [[Peggy Guggenheim]] (1898–1979) or at the English library of [[Sylvia Beach]] (1887–1962), the first publisher in 1922 of James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

In 1929 [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], the library of Sylvia Beach, published a book with twelve articles, brought together by [[Eugene Jolas]] (1894–1952), the editor of [[Transition (literary journal)|transition]], defending '[[Work in progress]]', the book by Joyce that would be published only ten years later under the title '[[Finnegans wake]]'. In this book titled [[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]], Llona was one of the twelve authors and wrote under a very much 'Joycian' title: ‘I Dont Know What to Call It but Its Mighty Unlike Prose’ .

In 1939 With the war approaching, Llona, remarried, left France and established himself in Lima. In 1946 he returned to the US and became a translator for the [[UN]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] ([[FAO]]). When having heart problems, he settled in [[San Francisco]], where he died.

'''Waterlogging''' refers to the saturation of [[soil]] with [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/waterlog|title=waterlog - definition of waterlog in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil may be regarded as waterlogged when it is nearly saturated with water much of the time such that its air phase is restricted and anaerobic conditions prevail. In extreme cases of prolonged waterlogging, anaerobiosis occurs, the roots of [[mesophyte]]s suffer, and the subsurface [[reducing atmosphere]] leads to such processes as [[denitrification]], [[methanogenesis]], and the reduction of iron and manganese oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Environmental Soil Physics|last=Hillel|first=Daniel|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2004|isbn=0-12-348655-6|location=United States of America|pages=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In agriculture, various [[crop]]s need [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] (specifically, [[oxygen]]) to a greater or lesser depth in the soil. Waterlogging of the soil stops air getting in. How near the water table must be to the surface for the ground to be classed as waterlogged, varies with the purpose in view. A crop's demand for freedom from waterlogging may vary between seasons of the year, as with the growing of [[rice]] (''Oryza sativa'').

In [[irrigation|irrigated]] agricultural land, waterlogging is often accompanied by [[soil salinity]] as waterlogged soils prevent [[soil salinity control|leaching]] of the [[Sodium chloride|salt]]s imported by the irrigation water.

From a [[gardening]] point of view, waterlogging is the process whereby the soil blocks off all water and is so hard it stops air getting in and it stops oxygen from getting in.

== Origin of the term ==
Xenocentrism was coined by American sociologists Donald P. Kent and Robert G. Burnight in the 1952 paper "Group Centrism in Complex Societies" published in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;&lt;ref name=merton&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPvcHuUMEMwC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Xenocentrism |title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |publisher=University of Chicago Press |author=Robert K. Merton |year= 1973|page=108 |accessdate=December 28, 2014|isbn=9780226520926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent and Burnight state that feelings of xenocentrism are caused by three possible factors; individuals who have familial ties to a foreign country, specifically 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants, those who oppose the political choices of their native country, an example of this being the [[Communist Party USA]] which idealized the [[Soviet Union]] and its anti-capitalist government, and individuals who are exposed to other cultures and grow disenchanted with and rebel against their own society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The term remained obscure but considered useful and occasionally used by other sociologists.&lt;ref name=merton/&gt;  The [[University of Florida]] treats it as a key term of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00014168/00001|title=Introduction to Sociology|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is opposed to [[ethnocentrism]], as coined by 19th-century American sociologist [[William Graham Sumner]], which describes the natural tendencies of an individual to place disproportionate worth upon the values and beliefs of one's own culture relative to others.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;Kent, Donald P. and Burnight, Robert G. "Group centrism in complex societies". ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' (1951): 256–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer xenocentrism==
Rene Dentiste Mueller and Amanda Broderick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mueller|first1=Rene Dentiste|last2=Broderick|first2=Amanda J|title=Consumer Xenocentrism An Alternative Theory of Foreign Product Bias|website=www.scribd.com/document/176866526/501-Mueller-R-Broderick-AConsumer-Xenocentrism-An-Alternative-Explanation-for-Foreign-Product-Bias|publisher=SCRIBD}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to apply the consumer xenocentrism (CX) concept to describe the preference some consumers have for foreign goods even when domestic goods are qualitatively and/or functionally similar or better.  Although the CX phenomenon is global, the researchers cite a significant number of studies that suggests there are proportionally more consumer xenocentrics in former colonies where the locals have been conditioned to perceive ‘foreign’ as better.  A consequence of consumer xenocentrism is its negative effect on local industry and on the decline in living standards as poor consumers buy the (often) more expensive foreign products. Consumer xenocentrism, especially among the local elites, reduces confidence and pride in local manufacturing which can lead to the loss of local industries, a decline in purchase choices, especially among traditional products or even a dependency on foreign ones.   Mueller, Wang, Liu and Cui,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Rene Dentiste|last2=Wan|first2=George Xun|last3=Liu|first3=Gouli|last4=Cui|first4=Charles Cui|title=Consumer Xenocentrism in China: An Exploratory Study|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics|date=2016|volume=28|issue=1|pages=73–91|doi=10.1108/apjml-11-2014-0158}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the concept to China and showed consumer xenocentrism is not a new phenomenon.  The researchers were also able to show that when consumer xenocentrism grew too much,  a ‘protection of the herd’ mentality caused the pendulum to swing  back towards consumer ethnocentrism (nationalism).

In his doctoral dissertation, Steven James Lawrence suggests xenocentrism may be an influential in making consumers buying decisions as they might have "favorable orientations to products from outside their membership group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/oa_dissertations/606/|title="Consumer Xenocentrism And Consumer Cosmopolitanism: The De-Velopment A" by Steven James Lawrence|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puja Mondal cited some examples from India:
{{quote|"People in India often assume that British lifestyle (dress pattern, etc.), French fashion or Japanese electronic devices (TV, tape recorders, mobile set, washing machines, etc.) and Swiss watches are superior to their own."|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/sociology/culture-sociology/sociology-of-culture-concepts-involved-in-sociology-of-culture/31263/|title=Sociology of Culture: Concepts Involved in Sociology of Culture|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grace Susetyo suggests "the idea that foreign cultures and their elements are superior to the local" causes a crisis of cultural identity among Western-educated Indonesians and is a problem that needs to be eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3576228/Perception_of_Xenocentrism_and_Cultural_Identity_in_Western-Educated_Indonesian_Teenage_Music_Students|title=Perception of Xenocentrism and Cultural Identity in Western-Educated Indonesian Teenage Music Students|author=Grace Susetyo|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Balabanis and Adamantios Diamantopoulos further defined consumer xenocentrism to be a multi-dimensional construct by which to explain consumer affinities for foreign products.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ama.org/publications/JournalOfInternationalMarketing/Pages/consumer-xenocentrism-as-determinant-of-foreign-product-preference.aspx|title=Consumer Xenocentrism as Determinant of Foreign Product Preference: A System Justification Perspective|last2=Diamantopoulos|first2=Adamantios|website=www.ama.org|publisher=American Marketing Association|language=en-us|last1=Balabanis|first1=George|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define consumer xenocentrism to be rooted in two concepts, perceived inferiority of domestic goods and aggrandized perception of foreign products.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[Academy of International Business]] is studying "out of group favoritism and in-group derogation" as a consumer effect in the Chinese consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learningace.com/doc/5288844/06157278446862e26c535c63efead796/aib2006_proceedings p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement of consumer xenocentrism===

Lawrence uses the definition of xenocentrism, conceived by Kent and Burnight, to describe propose a potential scale, CXENO, to predict how xenocentric views of non-domestic goods affects consumer behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most recently proposed scale to quantity xenocentric consumer tendencies, XSCALE, includes both instances of social and consumer xenocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rojas-Méndez|first1=José I.|last2=Chapa|first2=Sindy|title=Rescuing Xenocentrism: The Missing Construct in Consumer Behavior—An Abstract|journal=Creating Marketing Magic and Innovative Future Marketing Trends|date=1 January 2017|pages=1089–1089|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-45596-9_200|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45596-9_200|publisher=Springer, Cham|language=en|series=Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science|isbn=978-3-319-45595-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economists]] have begun to include consumer xenocentrism, along with other consumer centrisms such as [[consumer ethnocentrism]] and consumer cosmopolitanism, in their analysis of consumer behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Davies|first2=Mark A.P.|last3=Cleveland|first3=Mark|last4=Palihawadana|first4=Dayananda|title=Here, there and everywhere: a study of consumer centrism|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/doi/full/10.1108/IMR-06-2014-0205|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=33|issue=5|pages=715–754|doi=10.1108/imr-06-2014-0205|last1=Prince|first1=Melvin|accessdate=27 March 2017|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recent research has looked at how these three centrisms impact one another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
