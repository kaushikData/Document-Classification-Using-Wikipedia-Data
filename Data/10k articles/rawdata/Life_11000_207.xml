'''Abortion in Uganda''' is illegal unless performed by a doctor who believes pregnancy places the woman's life at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/heapol/czt070 |pmid=24064047 |title=Ugandan opinion-leaders' knowledge and perceptions of unsafe abortion |journal=Health Policy and Planning |volume=29 |issue=7 |pages=893–901 |year=2014 |last1=Moore |first1=Ann M. |last2=Kibombo |first2=Richard |last3=Cats-Baril |first3=Deva }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uganda]]n [[Ministry of Health (Uganda)|Ministry of Health]] estimates that {{as of|2008|lc=y}}, 26% of all [[maternal death]]s result from [[abortion]] complications. This is aggravated by legal, socioeconomic, and geographical barriers to safe abortion, which compel women to use unsafe abortion methods and deter them from seeking post-abortion medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Abortion in Uganda.

== Laws on women's sexual reproduction and abortion==
The legal status of abortion in Uganda is unclear because it provides for some exceptions while criminalizing the procedure in most cases. The Ugandan Constitution, in Article 22, item 2 states: "No person has the right to terminate the life of an unborn child except as may be authorised by law."&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995. http://www.parliament.go.ug/new/images/stories/constitution/Constitution_of_Uganda_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, what is authorized by law remains poorly understood.

The Penal Code of 1950, Article 141 on "Attempts to procure abortion" states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Any person who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman whether she is or is not with child, unlawfully administers to her or causes her to take any poison or other noxious thing, or uses any force of any kind, or uses any other means, commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;The Penal Code Act. Chapter 120. http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=170005 ([[WIPO Lex]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Article 142 lays out a punishment of seven years for an attempt to procure a miscarriage.

Nonetheless, under other provisions of the Penal Code an abortion may be performed to save the life of a pregnant woman. Section 217 of the Code provides that a person is not criminally responsible for performing in good faith and with reasonable care and skill a surgical operation upon an unborn child for the preservation of the mother’s life if the performance of the operation is reasonable, having regard to the patient’s state at the time and to all the circumstances of the case.  In addition, Section 205 of the Code provides that no person shall be guilty of the offence of causing by willful act a child to die before it has an independent existence from its mother if the act was carried out in good faith for the purpose of preserving the mother’s life.

Uganda, like a number of Commonwealth countries, whose legal systems are based the English common law, follows the holding of the 1938 English ''[[Rex v. Bourne]]'' decision in determining whether an abortion performed for health reasons is lawful. In the Bourne decision, a physician was acquitted of the offence of performing an abortion in the case of a woman who had been raped. The court ruled that the abortion was lawful because it had been performed to prevent the woman from becoming “a physical and mental wreck”, thus setting a precedent for future abortion cases performed on the grounds of preserving the pregnant woman’s physical and mental health. The liberalization and legality of abortion in Uganda has been complicated by the use of rape as a weapon of war and terror by rebel groups in the region."&lt;ref name=UNPPDB&gt;"Population Policy Data Bank." United Nations. The Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariay, n.d. Web. 25 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Uganda, an abortion is permitted to save a woman's life, preserve the physical health of the woman, and to preserve the mental health of the woman. An abortion is not permitted in terms of rape or incest, fetal impairment, economic or social reasons, or by request. A legal abortion has to be performed by a licensed and registered physician with the consent of two physicians prior to the medical procedure.&lt;ref name=UNPPDB/&gt;

==Government family planning ==
In 1988, the Ugandan government launched a comprehensive program in response to the country's high [[Total fertility rate|fertility and growth rates]], which adversely affected per capita incomes and threatened the sustainability of social services. The major goal was to increase the contraceptive rate from 5 percent to 20 percent by 2000. The services for birth control in Uganda are now accessible at clinics and are operated by the [[Family Planning Association]] of Uganda. [[Birth control|Contraceptives]] like condoms helped to reduce the rate of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Uganda, but there are still a significant number of unwanted pregnancies leading to abortion.&lt;ref name=UNPPDB/&gt;
 
There was direct support provided in the government's policy on contraceptive use, and since 1995, 8 percent of married women aged 15 to 49 use contraception. The total fertility rate from 1995 to 2000 was 7.1, and the age specific fertility rate per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 from 1995 to 2000 was 180. The government has shown a lot of concern for the morbidity and mortality resulting from induced abortion, but there has been a number of complications in childbearing and child birth. In Uganda, the female life expectancy at birth from 1995 to 2000 was 40.4 percent.&lt;ref name=UNPPDB/&gt;

==Movements==
Movements such as [[Pro-Life]] Uganda (Pro-Life Uganda) and [[Pro-Choice]] Uganda (Pro Abortion) fight for their belief that either a woman has the right to choose what happens to her and her body (Pro-Choice Uganda), or the fetus' life is sacred and everyone deserves to live (Pro-Life Uganda).&lt;ref&gt;"Pro Life Uganda." Pro Life Uganda. N.p., n.d. Web. 25 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a movement that took place that involved the Pro-Life organization, Christian founded anti-abortion that advocates against abortion. This group was joined by 100 delegates from the U.S., United Kingdom, Uganda and Spain in a three-day workshop to help the young women of Uganda understand the preciousness of life, and to counsel the young women against the practice of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lukwago |first1=Juliet |title=Uganda: World Workshop Against Abortion Opens At Namugongo |publisher=AllAfrica.com |date=1 September 2013 |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201309020107.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |volume=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

Since the beginning of the 21st century ABMs have been deployed in architecture and urban planning to evaluate design and to simulate pedestrian flow in the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G.D.P.A |last2=Wullschleger |first2=Tobias |last3=Müller |first3=Hanspeter |last4=Schmitt |first4=Gerhard |last1=Aschwanden |year=2009 |title=Evaluation of 3D city models using automatic placed urban agents |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=22 |pages=81–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580511001415 |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2011.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a growing field of socio-economic analysis of infrastructure investment impact using ABM's ability to discern systemic impacts upon a socio-economic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Paul |last2=Stiff |first2=David |last1=Smetanin |year=2015 |title=Investing in Ontario's Public Infrastructure: A Prosperity at Risk Perspective, with an analysis of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area |journal=The Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis |url=http://www.cancea.ca/sites/economic-analysis.ca/files/reports/CANCEA%20Report%20-%20Investing%20in%20Ontario%27s%20Infrastructure%20FINAL%20Oct%202015%20Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

==Verification and validation==
[[Verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sargent |first1=R.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A. K. |last=Niazi |title=Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems |date=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[University of Stirling]]|hdl=1893/3365 }} PhD Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis also gives details of "exploratory agent-based modeling", "descriptive agent-based modeling" and "validated agent-based modeling", using several worked case study examples.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

==Early fame==
Bahta originally gained recognition in 1875 when he killed [[Embaye Araya]] son of [[Rasi Araya]], an Ethiopian Governor, in a skirmish precipitated by raiding of the area.&lt;ref name="killion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first =RA  | last =Caulk  | title = Bad men of the Borders: Shum and Shifta in North Ethiopia in the 19th century  | booktitle =2nd Annual Seminar of Department of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahta and other Eritrian tribal leaders were in constant conflict with the Ethiopian forces under [[Alula Engida|Ras Alula]] and [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes]] (himself a [[Tigray Province|Tigrian]]); for example, despite the best efforts of Ras Alula's lieutenant Balatta Gabru in 1880, Bahta evaded capture and later that year allied himself with the [[Egypt]]ian garrison at Sanhit (latter [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Erlich|first= Haggai |title= Ras Alula and the Scramble for Africa|year= 1996|publisher= Red Sea|location= Lawrenceville|isbn=1-56902-029-9|page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, as an Italian colonial presence replaced the defeated Egyptians, and their control of [[Massawa]], Bahta moved to ally himself with them and their General, later provincial governor [[Oreste Baratieri]]. This was done in the hope that Eritreans would be able to maintain a certain amount of independence, at least more so than under Ethiopian influence.&lt;ref name="killion" /&gt; As a consequence, Bahta came to control [[Akkele Guzay]], and by 1889 his own forces formed an important flank in the Italian moves to create the Colony of Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;Erlich, ''Ras Alula'', pp. 149, 165&lt;/ref&gt; He fought alongside the Italians against the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdists]] at the [[Second Battle of Agordat|Battle of Agordat]] in December, 1893.

However Bahta became increasingly frustrated with the conduct of the Italian Colonial Government and their soldiers, particularly the expropriation of land from the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Marcus|first= Harold G.|title= The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913|year= 1995|publisher=Red Sea Press|location= Lawrenceville|isbn= 1-56902-010-8|pages= 154f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He understood that [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] was consolidating his power to the south with plans to displace the Italians. In June 1894, he, along with [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes]], Ras Alula, and [[Ras Woldemikael Selomon]] traveled to [[Addis Ababa]] to seek forgiveness from the Negus for their dealings with [[Oreste Baratieri|Baratieri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Henze|first= Paul B. |title= Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia|year= 2000|publisher= Palgrave|location= New York|isbn=0-312-22719-1|page = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Menelik forgave them and offered Mengesha the crown of Tigray in exchange for his loyalty and help in evicting the Italians. The Tigrian leaders plotted against Baratieri while maintaining a guise of friendship with him. Bahta even led an army into the western province of [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shiray]] on the pretext of fighting the Mahdists, but instead subjugated [[Kitet]] and started recruiting an even larger army.

==Rebellion against the Italians==
In December 1894, Bahta unilaterally led his force of 1,600 men in direct revolt against the Italians, although he claimed support of Mengesha. He captured the Italian administrator at Segheneyti, which was then the capital of the province, and declared an independent Akkele Guzay. He proclaimed himself "An avenger of rights trampled on by the Italians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Pankhurst | first=Sylvia | authorlink=Sylvia Pankhurst | title=Eritrea on the Eve: the Past and Future of Italy's 'first-born' colony.

Baratieri immediately suspected Mengesha and ordered Major Toselli and his battalion to move on Segheneyti.

Upon arrival, the Major entered negotiations with Bahta, who stalled him with excuses and promises of loyalty. The Italian reinforcements started to arrive and by the evening of the 17th Toselli had 1500 men and two artillery pieces. He went to move against Bahta the following morning, but found him gone. Bahta had secretly abandoned Segheneyti in the night and had moved his force north against the Italian garrison of 220 men at the small fort of [[Halay, Eritrea|Halay]], commanded by Captain Castellazzi. Toselli correctly guessed this was Bahta's plan, and marched his men towards Halay.

Bahta called for Castellazzi to surrender and abandon the fort. Negotiations continued until 13:30, when Bahta's patience came to an end and the attack was ordered. Low on ammunition, the Italians held out until 16:45, when the situation became critical. Toselli's forces arrived at that moment, and launched an attack on Bahta's rear. Bahta was killed in the attack, and his forces fled, many joining Mengesha. Mengesha's army would lose at the [[Battle of Coatit]], but Menelik would soon commit his forces, and destroy the Italians at the [[Battle of Adwa]], ending their colonial hopes for Ethiopia.

==Burial==
Because of his influence, after his death his burial was banned by the Italian Colonial government.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Skeletal Remains Of Degiat Bahta Hagos Laid To Rest |work=Eritrea Profile |publisher=Ministry of Information |date=2007-03-10 |url=http://www.shabait.com/upload/newspapers/Mar-07/eritrea_profile_10032007.pdf |accessdate=2007-03-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312160915/http://www.shabait.com/upload/newspapers/Mar-07/eritrea_profile_10032007.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They feared that his memorial would be nexus for further rebellion. His body was secretly buried at Halay, and later moved to Segheneyti in 1953. In 2007 he was interred once more in a newly constructed memorial with an honor guard in memory of his struggle.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

'''''Captain Underpants and the Revolting Revenge of the Radioactive Robo-Boxers''''' is the tenth book in the ''[[Captain Underpants]]'' series created by [[Dav Pilkey]]. It was published on January 15, 2013.
==Plot==
The giant zombie nerds move really slowly so the giant Zombie Nerd Harold actually crushed a giant ketchup packet. Tippy Tinkletrousers travels back to 10 minutes BEFORE Kipper and friends; they freeze upon seeing him. Tippy shrinks and abducts his past self to when George and Harold are about to be arrested. The boys travel back with their pets, but accidentally take Mr. Krupp with them. Big Tippy sends his smaller self back ten minutes to find where, then back there then, where the small ones zap themselves back and steal the Goosy-Grow 4000,  which turns Tiny Tippy extremely massive. When Big Tippy attempts to use his [[nuclear bomb]] to kill Captain Underpants, Supa Mega Tippy zaps himself back in time (with his twin) and kicks Big Tippy and his bomb away into the Gulf of Mexico. When the bomb explodes, it blows a huge crater and kills the dinosaurs.

The five protagonists and their captor then travel to the African savannas where the boys and their pets gain the trust of some cavemen who inhabit the surrounding jungles. The cavemen are taught English through drawings and subsequently, the boys make the world's first comic book (which involves drawings of traps working on Tippy). The Neanderthals, inspired by the book, then set traps for Tippy and defeat him. He then sets off his freeze ray (which has been tampered with by his younger twin so that it could not be turned off), and the Goosy-Grow 4000 enlarges the ice which appears to make Crackers's condition deteriorate and causes the Ice Age (and freezing Tippy himself)

George and Harold are then transported to the future by Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy, who is now gigantic, thanks to the Goosy-Grow 4000. But it turns out they are now teachers (the mean and cruel ones they are used to be) and Mr. Krupp is an old man. After getting rid of their evil future selves by vowing never to take life seriously, they snap their fingers, turning both Mr. Krupps into Captain Underpants, and they beat up Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy, who afterwards attempts to use his nuclear bomb to blow up the entire galaxy. After that, Crackers and Sulu decide to save the entire galaxy by sending Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy and themselves back to the time before the universe existed (13.7 billion years ago). The three are then destroyed by Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy's giant nuclear bomb and the universe is formed. It also turns out that Crackers had laid a brood of eggs (revealing Crackers to have been a female.) and George, Harold and the younger Captain Underpants all decide to take care of them. Suddenly, George's and Harold's nemesis, Melvin Sneedly, in a giant Robo-Squid called the "Super Squid", appears and captures George, Harold, Captain Underpants, and Crackers's eggs, taking them back to the future.

[[File:Charaf-ed-Din. Operation for castration (1466).jpg|thumb|270px|A medical illustration by [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi|Sharaf ad-Din]] depicting an operation for castration, c. 1466]]
{{Violence against men}}
'''Castration''' (also known as '''gonadectomy''') is any action, [[surgery|surgical]], [[chemical substance|chemical]], or otherwise, by which an individual loses use of the [[testicles]]. Surgical castration is bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (excision of both testes), and [[chemical castration]] uses [[pharmaceutical drug]]s to deactivate the testes. Castration causes [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] (preventing the castrated person or animal from [[reproduction|reproducing]]); it also greatly reduces the production of certain [[hormone]]s, such as [[testosterone]]. Surgical castration in animals is often called [[neutering]].

The term "castration" is sometimes also used to refer to the removal of the [[ovary|ovaries]] in the female, otherwise known as an [[oophorectomy]] or, in animals, [[spaying]]. [[Estrogen]] levels drop precipitously following oophorectomy, and long-term effects of the reduction of sex hormones are significant throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prophylactic oophorectomy in pre-menopausal women and long term health – a review | pmc=2585770 | pmid=18714076 | doi=10.1258/mi.2008.008016 | volume=14 | date=September 2008 | journal=Menopause Int | pages=111–6 | last1 = Shuster | first1 = LT | last2 = Gostout | first2 = BS | last3 = Grossardt | first3 = BR | last4 = Rocca | first4 = WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "castration" may also be sometimes used to refer to [[emasculation]] where both the testicles ''and'' the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two. This can cause confusion.

[[#Animals|Castration of non-human animals]] is intended to favor a desired development of the animal or of its habits, as an [[anaphrodisiac]] or to prevent [[overpopulation]]. As above, see [[neutering]] for more information on castration of non-human animals.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Castration of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'': fresco by [[Vasari]] &amp; [[Cristofano Gherardi]] (c. 1560, Sala di Cosimo I, [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]]).]]
Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their "power". Castrated men — [[eunuch]]s – were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] and palace households: in particular, the [[harem]]. Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. Other religions, such as [[Judaism]], were strongly opposed to the practice. The [[Leviticus]] [[Holiness code]], for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from [[sacrifice]].

Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of [[History of China|Chinese history]], most notably in the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]], late [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and late [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] dynasties. There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events.

In ancient times, castration often involved the [[emasculation|total removal of all the male genitalia]]. This involved great danger of death due to bleeding or infection and, in some states, such as the [[Byzantine Empire]], was seen as the same as a death sentence. Removal of only the testicles had much less risk.

Either surgical removal of both testicles or [[chemical castration]] may be carried out in the case of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malecare.com |title=MaleCare.com |publisher=MaleCare.com |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Testosterone]]-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or [[chemical castration]]) is used to slow down the cancer, greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant. 

Castration has also been used in the United States for [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93947|title=Some Sex Offenders Opt for Castration. ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trans women]] often undergo orchiectomy, as do some other transgender people. Orchiectomy may be performed as part of a more general [[sex reassignment surgery]], either before or during other procedures. It may also be performed on someone who does not desire, or cannot afford, further surgery.

[[File:Castration.jpg|right|thumb|The procedure of castration as punishment during the 16th century.]]
Involuntary castration appears in the history of warfare, sometimes used by one side to torture or demoralize their enemies. It was practiced to extinguish opposing male lineages and thus allow the victor to sexually possess the defeated group's women.{{ref}}

===Europe===
[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the [[Normans]] during their invasions of Sicily and Italy.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In the medieval [[kingdom of Georgia]], the [[pretender]] [[Demna of Georgia|Demna]] was castrated by his uncle [[George III of Georgia]] to ensure the supremacy of George's branch of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eastmond|first=Antony|title=Royal imagery in medieval Georgia|year=1998|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=0271016280|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KPdSQU-Bx4C&amp;pg=PA107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another victim of castration was the medieval French philosopher, scholar, teacher, and (later) monk [[Pierre Abélard]]. He was castrated by relatives of his lover, [[Heloise (student of Abelard)|Héloïse]].{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

[[Wimund (bishop)|Bishop Wimund]], a 12th-century English adventurer and invader of the Scottish coast, was castrated.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In medieval England those found guilty of high treason were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], which often included [[emasculation]] or removal of the genitalia.{{ref?|date=February 2018}}

In [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek mythology]], [[Cronus]] castrated his father, [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], after the latter imprisoned the [[cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[Hecatonchires]].

[[William Wallace]], the Scottish resistance leader, was castrated as part of his execution, for resistance to English rule.

[[Wim Deetman]] was criticized by the Dutch parliament for excluding evidence of castration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands|title=Time for the truth about Catholic sex abuse in the Netherlands|work=RNW|access-date=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321230333/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands#|archive-date=21 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic Church, where ten children were allegedly "punished" by castration in the 1950s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests. However, the Deetman Commission had rejected it as the person who reported the incident admitted it was speculative. Voluntary castration for homosexuality was also state policy in Netherlands at that point, as well against Catholic canon law, and there has been no evidence suggesting the Church had a part in organizing the procedures.
[[Chemical castration]] has been and is used as part of sentencing in criminal cases.

In 1952, [[Alan Turing]]—the father of computer science and the inventor of the [[Turing machine]]—was criminally prosecuted for homosexual acts and chose chemical castration as an alternative to a period of imprisonment.

===China===
According to legend, during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China, in 2281 BCE castration was passed into law as a punishment, which remained so until the reign of [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Gaozu of Tang]] (589–600 CE). However, it was still practiced after his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJESoip9wZEC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=the+five+punishments+are+adopted+branding+cutting+off+the+nose+feet+castration+and+death+emperor+wen+kao+tsu#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20five%20punishments%20are%20adopted%20branding%20cutting%20off%20the%20nose%20feet%20castration%20and%20death%20emperor%20wen%20kao%20tsu&amp;f=false|title=Chronological handbook of the history of China: a manuscript left by the late Rev.

During the reign of [[King Mu of Zhou|Mu]] of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (10th c. BCE) the Minister of Crime, Marquis Lu, reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUkQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=castration+rape+china#v=snippet&amp;q=castration%20capital%20avoid&amp;f=false|title=China of the Chinese|author=Edward Theodore Chalmers Werner|year=1919|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=|page=146|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the practice existed in China, not only were the testicles merely removed but castration included the severing of one's entire genitalia.

At the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], there were about 70,000 eunuchs (宦官 ''huànguān'', or 太監 ''tàijiàn'') employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the [[Forbidden City]].

====Non-Han peoples====
Many of the non-Han Chinese peoples who founded states in China after invading originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture, but adopted it from the Han Chinese.

The [[Khitan people]] adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs used were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a [[nomad]]ic [[Mongols|Mongolic people]] and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 12.](Page 18 on online document viewer, Page 12 on actual document)&lt;/ref&gt; When the Khitan founded the [[Liao Dynasty]] they developed a [[harem]] system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. All of the eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plains]] that came from two sources. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]. Another source was during their war with the Chinese [[Song dynasty]], the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and [[emasculate]] them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 13.](Page 19 on online document viewer, Page 13 on actual document)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khitan Empress Dowager [[Xiao Chuo]] (Chengtian) of the [[Liao Dynasty|Khitan Liao state]] took power at age 30 in 982 as a regent for her son.

During the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasty (1644–1911 CE), the sons and grandsons of the rebel [[Yaqub Beg]] in China were all sentenced to castration. Surviving members of Yaqub Beg's family included his 4 sons, 4 grandchildren (2 grandsons and 2 granddaughters), and 4 wives. They either died in prison in [[Lanzhou]], Gansu, or were killed by the Chinese. His sons Yima Kuli, K'ati Kuli, Maiti Kuli, and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879. They were all underage children, and put on trial, sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father's rebellious "sedition", or if they were innocent of their fathers crimes, were to be sentenced to castration and serving as a [[eunuch]] slave to Chinese troops, when they reached 11 years old, and handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yjg1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wG3LTdKpMMG2twfnsOGFCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=whether%20they%20have%20attained%20full%20age%20or%20not%2C%20be%20delivered%20imperial%20household%20made%20eunuchs%20slaves%20to%20soldiery%20turkestan&amp;f=false|title=Translations of the Peking Gazette|year=1880|page=83|isbn=|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6m_LTdeEC8u3tgfeofTnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 4|year=1888|publisher=D.

===Korea===
The eunuchs of Korea, called ''Naesi'' (내시, 內侍), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in [[Goryeosa]] ("History of Goryeo"), a compilation about the [[Goryeo]] period. In 1392, with the founding of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], the ''Naesi'' system was revised, and the department was renamed the "Department of ''Naesi''" (내시부, 內侍府).&lt;ref name="Naesi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=367722 |title=내시 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=100.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naesi system included two ranks, those of ''Sangseon'' (상선, 尙膳, "Chief of Naesi"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and ''Naegwan'' (내관, 內官, "Common official naesi"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 naesi in total served the palace in Joseon Dynasty period. They also took the exam on [[Confucianism]] every month.&lt;ref name="Naesi"/&gt; The naesi system was repealed in 1894 following [[Gabo reform]].

According to legend, castration consisted of daubing a boy's [[genital]]s with human [[feces]] and having a dog bite them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-fc5X0cUjwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=Korean+eunuchs,+however,+had+it+worst+of+all.+In+ancient+times+they+were+castrated+by+having+their+genitals+smeared+with+human+feces+and+then+being+exposed+to+packs+of+hungry+dogs#v=onepage&amp;q=Korean%20eunuchs%2C%20however%2C%20had%20it%20worst%20of%20all.%20In%20ancient%20times%20they%20were%20castrated%20by%20having%20their%20genitals%20smeared%20with%20human%20feces%20and%20then%20being%20exposed%20to%20packs%20of%20hungry%20dogs&amp;f=false|title=Manthropology: The Science of Why the Modern Male Is Not the Man He Used to Be|author=Peter McAllister|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|location=|isbn=0-312-55543-1|page=280|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], eunuchs became a desirable commodity for [[tributes]], and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=korean+castrated+dog+bite#v=onepage&amp;q=korean%20castrated%20dog%20bite&amp;f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author1=Gwyn Campbell |author2=Suzanne Miers |author3=Joseph Calder Miller |year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=137|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese created [[eunuch]]s through castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date= 5 October 2012|time= 14:00 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Theo ''Đất Việt''|url=http://ngoisao.net/tin-tuc/thoi-cuoc/24h/chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua-2621880.html |newspaper=Ngôi sao |date= 4 October 2012 |time=11:16 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Báo Đất Việt|url= http://www.baomoi.com/The-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/139/9058145.epi|newspaper= Báo Mới|date= 5 August 2012 |time=19:25 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thê lương chuyện ‘của quý’ của thái giám Việt xưa |others=Theo Đất Việt |url=http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-'cua-quy'-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn |newspaper=2sao |date=8 August 2012 |time=15:15 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411133500/http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-%27cua-quy%27-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn |archivedate=11 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa |others=ĐVO |url=http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |newspaper=Treonline |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053555/http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hành trình đau khổ của những hoạn quan thời xưa|others= Theo ''Báo Đất Việt''|url= http://giadinh.net.vn/the-gioi/hanh-trinh-dau-kho-cua-nhung-hoan-quan-thoi-xua-20110824020430125.htm|newspaper= Báo Gia đình &amp; Xã hội|date=24 August 2011 |time=14:25 (GMT+7)|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bí mật về thái giám trong cung triều Nguyễn|others= Theo Công An Nhân Dân|url= http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|newspaper=Zing News |date=18 July 2013 |time= 09:04 (GMT+7) |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table.

[[Lý Thường Kiệt]] was a prominent eunuch general during the [[Lý Dynasty]] (1009–1225).

The [[Trần Dynasty]] sent Vietnamese boy eunuchs as tribute to [[Ming Dynasty]] China several times, in 1383, 1384 and 1385&lt;ref name="Tsai 1996 p. 15"&gt;Tsai (1996), p. 15  {{Google books|Ka6jNJcX_ygC|The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty (Ming Tai Huan Kuan)|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Dao, Nguyen Toan, Tru Ca, and Ngo Tin were among several Vietnamese eunuchs sent to China.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyẽ̂n (2008), p. 169  {{Google books|tUN8tC0ftJcC|The History Buddhism in Vietnam, Vol. IIID.5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]], the Ming Chinese under the [[Yongle Emperor]] castrated many young Vietnamese boys, choosing them for their handsomeness and ability, and brought them to Nanjing to serve as eunuchs. Among them were the architect-engineer [[Nguyễn An]]&lt;ref&gt;Wang (2000), p. 135  {{Google books|CdJKLd2jJq0C|Aching for Beauty: Footbinding in China|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nguyen Lang]] (阮浪).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich (1976), p. 691  {{Google books|067On0JgItAC|Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644|page=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese were among the many eunuchs of different origins found at Yongle's court.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2009), p. 147  {{Google books|S3Y2PTI_vYYC|Children in Slavery Through the Ages|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the eunuchs in charge of the Capital Battalions of [[Beijing]] was Xing An, a Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Tran (2006), p. 116  {{Google books|tzh1fQEEFPAC|Việt Nam: Borderless Histories|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Lê Dynasty]] the Vietnamese Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展 |url=http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8 |publisher=國學網－－中國經濟史論壇(China Economic History Forum) |date=2008-03-16 |author=黄啟臣 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053755/http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8 |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3254|publisher=中國評論學術出版社(China Review Academic Publishers Unlimited)|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&amp;secid=3257 |title=中国评论学术出版社 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民|publisher=中國評論新聞網 |accessdate=26 July 2013 |date=2006-03-08 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=6&amp;kindid=30&amp;docid=100107474 |title=中国评论新闻：郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=55&amp;kindid=1160&amp;docid=100107474 |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090 |title=明代廣東海上絲綢之路的高度發展 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/5/1/0/100151090.html?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100151090&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&amp;kindid=1201&amp;docid=100107474&amp;mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞：鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民人文历史|url=http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|publisher=广州日报大洋网(www.dayoo.com)|date=2009-10-20|others=published at 15:28 [[24-hour clock|military time]]|accessdate=26 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054046/http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15–17 世紀廣東人與越南 |url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf |publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |author=李慶新 |page=12 |quote=此外,沿海平民在海上航行或捕撈漁獵,遇風漂流至越南者時有發生。如成化十三年, 廣東珠池奉御陳彜奏:南海縣民遭風飄至安南被編入軍隊及被閹禁者超過 100 人。5成化中, 海南文昌人吳瑞與同鄉劉求等 13 人到欽州做生意,遇風飄至安南,當局將他們"俱發屯田, 以瑞獨少,宮之"。6... 6《明孝宗實錄》卷一百五十三,弘治十二年八月辛卯。 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JBWO91Ba?url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf |archivedate=27 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15–17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fc9a0cdd50e2524de5187e89.html|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1472 entry in the [[Ming Shilu]] reported that when some Chinese from [[Nanhai District|Nanhai county]] escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that they found out up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Revenue responded by ordering Chinese civilians and soldiers to stop going abroad to foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|2005|p=[http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/entry/1706 2078/79]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese State at the Borders |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774813334 |url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf |author=Leo K.

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that 13 Chinese men from [[Wenchang]] including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from [[Hainan]] to [[Guangdong]]'s Qin subprefecture ([[Qinzhou]]), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the [[Chenghua Emperor]]'s rule (1447–1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, [[Wu Rui]] (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the [[Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long|Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long]]. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]]. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] magistrate and then was sent to [[Beijing]] to work as a eunuch in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Lary (2007), p. 91 {{Google books|pFzhWyoYG_wC|The Chinese State at the Borders|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese State at the Borders |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774813334 |url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf |author=Leo K.

Commoners were banned from undergoing castration in Vietnam, only adult men of high social rank could be castrated, most eunuchs were born as such with a congenital abnormality.

===Americas===
In 1778, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote a bill in Virginia reducing the punishment for rape, polygamy or sodomy from death to castration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs10.htm Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments 1778 Papers 2:492—504l]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years several U.S. states have passed laws regarding chemical castration for sex offenders but not one state has mandatory castration. In 2016, [[Steve Hurst]], an Alabama lawmaker proposed a bill requiring certain sex offenses to require the perpetrator be castrated prior to their release from state custody.&lt;ref name="CBS_US_Castration_Bill"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawmaker introduces sex offender castration bill in Alabama |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawmaker-introduces-sex-offender-castration-bill-in-alabama/ |accessdate=23 October 2018 |work=CBS News |date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
Aqa [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]], who established the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Dynasty in Iran (in the 18th century), was a victim of castration by officers of the previous kingdom. When he conquered [[Lotf Ali Khan]], the last king of the [[Zand Dynasty]], Qajar had  Lotf Ali Khan castrated in revenge.

==Slave trade==
[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-East and War-Eunuch near Door of Sultan's Harem.png|thumb|left|Chief Eunuch of [[Abdul Hamid II]] (1912)]]

In the over 13 centuries of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa unknown number of Africans were enslaved and shipped to the Middle East. It is claimed that a vast majority of the male black slaves, estimated at around 80%, were castrated.

"The Caliphate in Baghdad at the beginning of the 10th Century had 7,000 black eunuchs and 4,000 white eunuchs in his palace."&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora |isbn = 978-0374527976|last1 = Segal|first1 = Ronald|date = 2002-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab slave trade typically dealt in the sale of castrated male slaves. Black boys at the age of eight to twelve had their scrotum and penis completely amputated. Reportedly, about two of three boys died, but those who survived drew high prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1210/jcem.84.12.6206| pmid=10599682|title = Long-Term Consequences of Castration in Men: Lessons from the Skoptzy and the Eunuchs of the Chinese and Ottoman Courts| journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism| volume=84| issue=12| pages=4324–4331|year = 1999|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Jean D.| last2=Roehrborn| first2=Claus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking of boys for prostitution in modern times===
An article in the ''Gulf Times'' revealed in 2005 a major sex trade in mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], New Delhi, [[Lucknow]] and [[Gorakhpur]]. One victim was lured from Nepal at the age of 14, sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly castrated. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were also castrated. He escaped and made his way back to Nepal. Two [[non-governmental organization]]s, one that works with homosexuals in Nepal, and one that works to rescue and rehabilitate trafficked women and children, were co-operating to help and rescue these boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=32822&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=44&amp;parent_id=24 |title=Former sex worker's tale spurs rescue mission |date=10 April 2005 |work=Gulf Times |publisher=Gulf-Times.com |accessdate=5 October 2010 |quote=“I spent seven years in hell,” says Raju, now 21, trying hard not to cry.

==Preventive measure==
"Voluntary" chemical or surgical castration has been in practice in many countries—reports are available from American and European countries in particular for over eighty years (chemical for circa thirty)—as an option for treatment for people who have broken laws of a sexual nature, allowing them to return to the community from otherwise lengthy detentions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated.

A ''temporary'' "chemical castration" has been studied and developed as a preventive measure and [[punishment]] for several repeated [[sex crime]]s, such as rape or other [[sexual assault|sexually related violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web1/kamlin.html|title=Chemical Castration: The Benefits and Disadvantages Intrinsic to Injecting Male Pedophiliacs with Depo-Provera|author=Katherine Amlin|accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/04-97/04-27-97/a09wn032.htm|title='Chemical castration' OK'd for Montana inmates|publisher= N.Y.

In modern times, the [[Czech Republic]] practices surgically castrating convicted sex offenders. According to the reports compiled by Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008. The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/cze/2009-02-05-eng.htm |title=Council of Europe report on the Czech Republic |publisher=Cpt.coe.int |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Martin Hollý, director of the Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Bilefsky |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/europe/11castrate.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp |title=Europeans Debate Castration of Sex Offenders |location=Europe;Czech Republic |work=The New York Times |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One serial offender stated that being castrated was the "best decision" he ever made: "On the one hand you have to protect the potential victims and on the other hand I wanted to be protected from myself, I wanted to live like a normal person."&lt;ref name="ukadvisor"/&gt; Don Grubin, a professor at [[Newcastle University]]'s Institute of Neuroscience who also runs a chemical castration program backed by the U.K.'s [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], was initially opposed to physical castration.

===Criticism===
In nonhuman animals, the behavioral effects of gonad removal differ along lines of species and not sex, i.e. there are species where mating behavior ceases if the gonads are removed and other species where it does not cease, but removal of ovaries in females halt mating behavior in all of the same nonhuman animals in which male castration halts mating behavior. Therefore some scientists argue that the notion that castration/spaying would drastically reduce sex drive in human males but not in human females is zoologically nonsensical, citing that humans belong to the animal kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criminologists argue that the apparently lower recidivism rates in castrated male sex offenders compared to non-castrated ones does not prove that it is a biological effect of castration (correlation does not equal causation) but can be explained by other factors. One suggested factor from [[game theory]] is that men who are willing to accept castration to get a shorter prison sentence are those who value freedom from prison higher than men who are not willing to pay the price for freedom in the form of their testicles. This hypothesis can explain their apparent lower recidivism as a result of working harder to conceal the evidence for their crimes, and argue that their parole is a danger of releasing offenders who only hide their crimes more efficiently and are not any less likely to commit new crimes. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain neurologists argue that while testosterone most likely increases internal sexual stimulation, a reduction of sex drive is unlikely to result in a reduction of inappropriate sexual behavior, as reduced internal stimulation from hormones merely increases the required external stimulation to reach orgasm. These neurologists cite that spreading of brain activity that stimulate more brain activity can increase their activity and tire the circuits out, the brain’s path to orgasm, enough to tire out with less external stimulation if the internal signal is stronger, and require more specific external stimulation to reach “satisfaction” if the internal signal is weaker.{{clarification needed|date=January 2018}} Therefore, they argue, a reduced testosterone level would make it more difficult, not easier, to manage remaining vestiges of sex drive by masturbating without the use of pornography or to otherwise get by with more socially and legally acceptable substitutes for desires that it would be unacceptable to act on. These neurologists also cite that many people, both men and women, find that higher levels of initial sexual arousal make it easier to masturbate to orgasm without the preferred type of external stimuli, as predicted by the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015). "Pleasure systems in the brain"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017). "How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to prevent their voices breaking at [[puberty]] and to develop a special high [[Register (music)|voice]]. The first documents mentioning ''[[castrato|castrati]]'' are Italian church records from the 1550s.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;John Rosselli, "Castrato" article in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. [[Mozart]]'s ''Exultate Jubilate'', [[Gregorio Allegri|Allegri]]'s ''[[Gregorio Allegri#The Miserere|Miserere]]'' and other pieces from this period now sung by [[soprano]]s and countertenors were written for ''castrati''. Some of the alto parts of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] were first sung by a ''castrato''. ''Castrati'' include [[Farinelli]], [[Senesino]], [[Giovanni Carestini|Carestini]], and [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]]. The last true ''castrato'' was [[Alessandro Moreschi]] (1858–1922) who served in the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Samantha|title=All mouth and no trousers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/05/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures|website=The Guardian|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of ''castrati''. In Modern times, the Mexican Javier Medina is the only professional opera singer that can perform as a castrato, since he suffered from an involuntary chemical castration, as a result from a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Medina - "I'm A Natural Castrato" - The Finantial Times  [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74d57b3c-a7b8-11dd-865e-000077b07658.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4QmGfBuQ8] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
A number of religions have included castration as a central theme of their practice. These include:

* The cult of [[Cybele]], in which devotees castrated themselves in ecstatic emulation of [[Attis]]: see [[Galli|Gallus]].
* [[Skoptsy]]
* The [[Valesians]].

===Hinduism===
In South Asia, many [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities, led by a guru. The power of the hijras as a sexually ambiguous category can only be understood in the religious context of Hinduism. In some Hindu beliefs, ritual, and art, the power of the combined man/woman, or androgyne, is a frequent and significant theme. [[Bahuchara Mata]], the main object of hijra veneration, is specifically associated with transvestism and transgenderism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Hijra-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html |title=Religion and expressive culture – Hijra |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
While castration is not a major part of [[Christianity]], Jesus himself acknowledged in a discussion about avoiding adultery and divorce that some are involuntarily castrated or born that way, while some others "make themselves eunuchs" willingly out of a desire to be chaste {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1–12|KJV}}.  Given Jesus' frequent use of metaphor and hyperbole, e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|9:62|KJV}}, the church has broadly discouraged any understanding of this passage as recommending literal "self-castration".  That is consistent with Jesus' claims (as a rabbi) to uphold the Law given to Moses, e.g. {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17|KJV}}, a Law which also discouraged literal castration {{bibleverse||Deut|23:1|KJV}}.  However, in his own comments Jesus had no condemnation for any of the above.  In {{bibleverse||Acts|8:34–8:39|KJV}}, a eunuch is baptized by [[Philip the Evangelist]], demonstrating acceptance of castrated individuals in his church.

The first canon of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD forbid clergy members to voluntarily castrate themselves "when in perfect health", but freely accepted those who had been either castrated by others against their will, castrated due to a medical sickness or necessity, or those born as eunuchs.

Paul, arguing against self-righteousness regarding [[circumcision]] in {{bibleverse||Galatians|5:12|KJV}}, says ''As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!'' ([[New International Version|NIV]])

Well-known Christian eunuchs (or alleged eunuchs) include:

* [[Origen]], who is reported by [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html |title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine |publisher=Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have castrated himself based on his reading of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} and other passages in Matthew and Mark that appear to endorse voluntary amputation to avoid sin, although there is some doubt concerning this story. [[Philip Schaff|Schaff]] considers the account genuine but cites [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Baur]] ''et al.'' in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html Eusebius' Church History Book 6, Chapter 8 Origen's Daring Deed] note 1809: "This act of Origen’s has been greatly discussed, and some have even gone so far as to believe that he never committed the act ... There is no reason, however, to doubt the report, for which we have unimpeachable testimony, and which is in itself not at all surprising ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Origen argues against such literal interpretations of the passages from Matthew and Mark in his &lt;cite&gt;First Principles&lt;/cite&gt;.
* Bishop [[Melito of Sardis]] (d. ''ca'' 180), who was a [[eunuch]], according to the church history of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], though, significantly the word "virgin" was substituted in [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]' Latin translation of Eusebius.
* [[Boston Corbett]], who was inspired by this same verse {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} to castrate himself (Corbett was the 19th-century American soldier who is generally believed to have fired the shot that killed [[John Wilkes Booth]]).

===Judaism===
[[Judaism]] strictly forbids the castration of either humans or animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbos]] 110b&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 23:1 expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel; they are forbidden to marry or if married must divorce from their wives (though permitting the castrated to marry or remain married to female converts to Judaism). The laws of castration including cases of irreversible or un-reversed vasectomy and all other cases where the flow of sperm is known to have been placed into a permanent state of dysfunction with either no hope or no desire to take the steps to repair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation reinforced by Isaiah 56:3–5 encourages eunuchs who follow after God's laws.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

According to [[Rashi]], Kham (Ham) castrated his father Noah.

In Judaism, castrated animals are deemed unfit for [[sacrifice]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|22:24|}}). Castrated members of the priestly caste are forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple, to approach the altar, or to make sacrifices, although they could eat their share of the offerings and receive the priestly and Levite gifts (Lev. 21:16–24).

===Islam===
In Islam castration is considered a sin, whether one performs it on himself or on another. As Abdullah ibn Mas'ood said "We were on a campaign with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we had no women with us. We said: Why don’t we get ourselves castrated? But he forbade us to do that." The wisdom behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of jihad against the disbelievers. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of disbelievers would have increased, and that is contrary to the purpose for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sent. &lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126987/the-ruling-on-castration&lt;/ref&gt;

A subject of castration who is altered before the onset of [[puberty]] will retain a high voice, non-muscular build, and small genitals. He may well be shorter than average, as the production of sex hormones in puberty—more specifically, estrogen via aromatization of testosterone—stops long bone growth. The person may not develop [[pubic hair]] and will have a small sex drive or [[Asexuality|none at all]].

Castrations after the onset of puberty will typically reduce the sex drive considerably or eliminate it altogether. Castrated people are automatically [[Infertility|sterile]], because the [[testes]] (for males) and [[ovaries]] (for females) produce [[sex cells]] needed for [[sexual reproduction]]. Once removed, the subject is infertile. The voice does not change. Some castrated people report mood changes, such as depression or a more serene outlook on life, although this might not be due to chemical changes but instead emotional changes due to the implications of the procedure. Body strength and muscle mass can decrease somewhat. Body hair may sometimes decrease. Castration prevents [[male pattern baldness]] if it is done before hair is lost. However, castration will not restore hair growth after hair has already been lost due to male pattern baldness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historically, many eunuchs who additionally underwent a [[penectomy]] reportedly suffered from urinary incontinence associated with the removal of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&amp;surlignage=2&amp;PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |title=The various types of eunuch in the Byzantine state: their role and symbolic meaning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113171516/http://www.medspe.fr/site/templates/template.php?identifiant_article=2166&amp;surlignage=2&amp;PHPSESSID=bd0a2427de5e5665b9c541ca8a6ecc71 |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT), typical symptoms (similar to those experienced by menopausal women) include hot flashes, gradual bone-density loss resulting in osteopenia or osteoporosis, and potential weight gain or redistribution of body fat to the hips and chest. Replacement of testosterone in the form of gel, patches, or injections can largely reverse these effects, although breast enlargement has also been reported as a possible side effect of testosterone usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/28/article/3047/gm=20!gid2=2824 |title="HRT for Men Is Risky, Too" by Robert W.

A study conducted at a mental institution in Kansas, where a large number of male inmates had been castrated, found that the eunuchs lived an average of 14 years longer than the uncastrated men.&lt;ref name="longevity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-women-live-longer&amp;page=2|title=Why Women Live Longer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study of 81 historical eunuchs in Korea's royal court found a 14 to 19 year increase in lifespan compared to intact men of similar socioeconomic background; these eunuchs had a [[centenarian]] rate of over 3%.&lt;ref name="koreaeun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/24/14070451-upside-to-castration-eunuchs-lived-longer-study-finds|title=Upside to castration?

==Psychoanalysis and literary theory==
The concept of castration plays an important role in [[psychoanalysis]]; ''see'', for example, [[castration anxiety]].

Castration (as a metaphor) also plays an important role in psychoanalytically-influenced literary theory, for example [[Harold Bloom]]'s ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]''.

In the Mexican thriller ''[[La casa del pelícano]]'', castration is shown as being connected to the [[Oedipus complex]].

==Chemical castration==
{{Main|Chemical castration}}
In the case of chemical castration, ongoing regular injections of [[anti-androgen]]s are required. Chemical castration does not actually remove the testicles or ovaries of the subject,&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400960_pf.html "Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders?

Chemical castration seems to have a greater effect on bone density than physical castration.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Since the development of [[teriparatide]], this severe bone loss has been able to be reversed in nearly every case.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At this time there is a limitation on the use of this medication to 24 months until the long-term use is better evaluated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Animals==
{{see also|Neutering|Veterinary sterilization surgery}}
[[File:Castration horse.jpg|thumb|Castration being performed on a horse under [[ketamine]] [[anaesthesia]].]]
Humans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding.
Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]]; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]] such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.

Male horses are usually castrated ([[gelding|gelded]]) using [[emasculator]]s, because [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]]s are rather aggressive and troublesome. The same applies to male [[mule]]s, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as [[oxen]].
[[Selective breeding|Breeding]] individuals are kept [[entire (animal)|entire]] and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.

Livestock may be castrated when used for food to increase growth or weight or both of individual male animals{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and because of the undesirable taste and odor of the meat from sexually mature males. In [[domestic pig]]s the taint, called [[boar taint]], is caused by [[androstenone]] and [[skatole]] concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity.&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;[http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm Genetics of Boar Taint: Implications for the Future Use of Intact Males] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031092222/http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm |date=31 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management.&lt;ref name="pigsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |title=Managing Boar Taint: Focus on Genetic Markers |publisher=The Pig Site |date=12 August 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150415192046/http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers.&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;[http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210034407/http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html|date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name = "PSU"/&gt; Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3950/mythbusting-boar-taint/ |title=Mythbusting Boar Taint|publisher=The Pig Site |accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of pets, castration is usually called [[neutering]], and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called [[spaying]]). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, and also prostate problems are somewhat common in castrated male dogs when they get older.&lt;ref name=Teske&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0303-7207(02)00261-7 |title=Canine prostate carcinoma: epidemiological evidence of an increased risk in castrated dogs |date=2002 |last1=Teske |first1=E. |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=197 |pages=251–5 |pmid=12431819 |first2=E.

A. |issue=1–2 |last2=Naan |last3=Van Dijk |last4=Van Garderen |last5=Schalken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutered individuals have a much higher risk of developing prostate problems in comparison. Castrated male cats are more likely to develop an obstruction in their urethra, preventing them from urinating to some degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11345305 |doi=10.2460/javma.2001.218.1429 |date=2001 |author1=Lekcharoensuk |first2=C.

A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species:

&lt;!--Please add in alphabetical order--&gt;
*[[Pig#Pig vocabulary|Barrow]] (pig)
*[[Cattle#Terminology|Bullock]] (cattle)
*[[Capon]] (chicken)
*[[Gelding]] (horse)
*Gib (cat, ferret)
*[[Ox]] (cattle) (Castration performed on mature bull)
*Stag (cattle, sheep)
*[[Cattle#Terminology|Steer]] (cattle) (Castration performed on young calf)
*[[Wikt:wether|Wether]] (sheep, goat)

An incompletely castrated male in livestock species (horse and cattle) is known as a ''rig''.

The term ''stag'' is used for a male animal castrated after the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s have developed to such a point as to give him the appearance of [[sexual maturity]].

[[File:Elastrator rings.JPG|thumb|Rubber rings and pliers used in [[elastration]]]]
Methods of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] castration include instant [[surgical]] removal, the use of an [[elastrator]] tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply, the use of a [[Burdizzo]] tool or [[emasculator]]s to crush the [[spermatic cord]]s and disrupt the blood supply, [[pharmacological]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s and [[implant (medicine)|implant]]s and [[immunological]] techniques to [[inoculation|inoculate]] the animal against his own [[sex hormones|sexual hormones]].

Certain animals, like horses and [[swine]], are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration (which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anesthetic has been applied), while others, like dogs and cats, are anesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre-scrotal incision in the case of dogs, or a pre-scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats.

In veterinary practice an "open" castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured. A "closed" castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision.

==Parasitic infection==
{{main|Parasitic castration}}
Some [[parasite|parasitic]] [[nematode]]s chemically castrate their hosts. For example, ''[[Microphallus]] pseudopygmaeus'' chemically castrates its host, the snail ''[[Onoba aculeus]]'', and causes it to grow larger than normal.

A '''cerebral infarction''' is an area of [[necrosis|necrotic]] tissue in the [[human brain|brain]] resulting from a [[Brain ischemia|blockage or narrowing]] in the [[cerebral circulation|arteries]] supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. The [[cerebral hypoxia|restricted oxygen]] due to the restricted blood supply causes an [[Stroke#Ischemic stroke|ischemic stroke]] that can result in an infarction if the blood flow is not restored within a relatively short period of time. The blockage can be due to a [[thrombus]], an [[embolus]] or an [[atheromatous]] [[stenosis]] of one or more [[artery|arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Ropper, Allan H. |author2=Adams, Raymond Delacy |author3=Brown, Robert F. |author4=Victor, Maurice | title=Adams and Victor's principles of neurology | date=2005 | publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Pub. Division | location=New York  | isbn=0-07-141620-X | pages=686–704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.

==Classification==
There are various classification systems for a cerebral infarction.

* The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms. Based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as [[total anterior circulation infarct]] (TACI), [[partial anterior circulation infarct]] (PACI), [[lacunar infarct]] (LACI) or [[posterior circulation infarct]] (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bamford J, Sandercock P, Dennis M, Burn J, Warlow C |title=Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction |journal=Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8756 |pages=1521–6 |date=June 1991 |pmid=1675378 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(91)93206-O |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93206-O}} Later publications distinguish between "syndrome" and "infarct", based on evidence from imaging. "Syndrome" may be replaced by "hemorrhage" if imaging demonstrates a bleed.

* The TOAST (Trial of [[Danaparoid|Org 10172]] in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to [[atherosclerosis]] of a large artery, (2) embolism of [[heart|cardiac]] origin, (3) occlusion of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams HP, Bendixen BH, Kappelle LJ |title=Classification of subtype of acute ischemic stroke.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of cerebral infarction are determined by the parts of the brain affected. If the infarct is located in primary motor cortex, contralateral hemiparesis is said to occur. With [[brainstem]] localization, brainstem syndromes are typical: [[Lateral medullary syndrome|Wallenberg's syndrome]], [[Weber's syndrome]], [[Millard-Gubler syndrome]], [[Benedikt syndrome]] or others.
Infarctions will result in weakness and loss of sensation on the opposite side of the [[Human body|body]]. Physical examination of the [[head]] area will reveal abnormal pupil dilation, [[Pupillary light reflex|light reaction]] and lack of [[human eye|eye]] movement on opposite side. If the infarction occurs on the left side brain, speech will be slurred. [[Reflexes]] may be aggravated as well.

==Risk factors==
Major risk factors for cerebral infarction are generally the same as for [[atherosclerosis]]: [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Diabetes mellitus]], [[tobacco smoking]], [[obesity]], and [[dyslipidemia]].&lt;ref name="pmid16809576"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hankey GJ |title=Potential new risk factors for ischemic stroke: what is their potential? |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=2181–8 |date=August 2006  |pmid=16809576 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000229883.72010.e4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heart Association]]/[[American Stroke Association]] (AHA/ASA) recommends controlling these risk factors in order to prevent stroke.&lt;ref name="pmid20966421"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furie KL, Kasner SE, Adams RJ |title=Guidelines for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association|journal=Stroke |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=227–76 |date=January 2011  |pmid=20966421 |doi=10.1161/STR.0b013e3181f7d043 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHA/ASA guidelines also provide information on how to prevent stroke if someone has more specific concerns, such as [[Sickle-cell disease]] or pregnancy. It is also possible to calculate the risk of stroke in the next decade based on information gathered through the [[Framingham Heart Study]].&lt;ref name="pmid8266381"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Agostino RB, Wolf PA, Belanger AJ, Kannel WB |title=Stroke risk profile: adjustment for antihypertensive medication.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Cerebral infarction.jpg|thumb|Cerebral infarction]]
Whether a cerebral infarction is thrombotic or embolic based, its [[pathophysiology]], or the observed conditions and underlying mechanisms of the disease. In thrombotic ischemic stroke, a [[thrombus]] forms and blocks blood flow.&lt;ref name="Caplan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis R. Caplan|title=Caplan's Stroke: A Clinical Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYDe4PF9-OwC|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1-4160-4721-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thrombus forms when the [[endothelium]] is activated by a variety of signals to result in [[platelet]] aggregation in the artery. This clump of platelets interacts with [[fibrin]] to form a [[platelet plug]].&lt;ref name="pmid24092932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samad F, Ruf W |title=Inflammation, obesity, and thrombosis |journal=Blood |volume=122 |issue=20 |pages=3415–22 |date=November 2013  |pmid=24092932 |doi=10.1182/blood-2013-05-427708 |url=|pmc=3829115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This platelet plug grows into a thrombus, resulting in a stenotic artery. Thrombotic ischemia can occur in large or small blood vessels. In large vessels, the most common causes of thrombi are [[atherosclerosis]] and [[vasoconstriction]]. In small vessels, the most common cause is [[lipohyalinosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid16833026"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lastilla M |title=Lacunar infarct |journal=Clin. Exp. Hypertens. |volume=28 |issue=3-4 |pages=205–15 |year=2006 |pmid=16833026 |doi= 10.1080/10641960600549082|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipohyalinosis is when high blood pressure and aging causes a build-up of fatty hyaline matter in blood vessels. [[Atheroma]] formation can also cause small vessel thrombotic ischemic stroke.&lt;ref name="pmid2671793"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caplan LR |title=Intracranial branch atheromatous disease: a neglected, understudied, and underused concept |journal=Neurology |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1246–50 |date=September 1989  |pmid=2671793 |doi= 10.1212/wnl.39.9.1246|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An embolic stroke refers to the blockage of an artery by an [[Embolism|embolus]], a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including [[Fat embolism|fat]] (e.g. from [[bone marrow]] in a [[Bone fracture|broken bone]]), [[Air embolism|air]], [[cancer]] cells or clumps of [[bacteria]] (usually from infectious [[endocarditis]]). The embolus may be of cardiac origin due to [[Atrial fibrillation]], [[Foramen ovale (heart)|Patent foramen ovale]]  or from [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] plaque of another (or the same) large artery. Cerebral artery gas embolism (e.g. during ascent from a SCUBA dive) is also a possible cause of infarction (Levvett &amp; Millar, 2008)

==Diagnosis==
[[Computed tomography]] (CT) and [[MRI]] scanning will show damaged area in the brain, showing that the symptoms were not caused by a [[tumor]], [[subdural hematoma]] or other brain disorder. The blockage will also appear on the [[angiogram]].

==Treatment==
In last decade, similar to myocardial infarction treatment, thrombolytic drugs were introduced in the therapy of cerebral infarction. The use of intravenous [[Tissue plasminogen activator|rtPA]] therapy can be advocated in patients who arrive to stroke unit and can be fully evaluated within 3 h of the onset.

If cerebral infarction is caused by a [[thrombus]]  occluding blood flow to an artery supplying the brain, definitive therapy is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down ([[thrombolysis]]), or by removing it mechanically ([[thrombectomy]]). The more rapidly blood flow is restored to the brain, the fewer brain cells die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saver JL |title=Time is brain - quantified |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=263–6 |year=2006 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/01.STR.0000196957.55928.abv1 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000196957.55928.ab |pmid=16339467 |access-date=2010-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511134051/http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/01.STR.0000196957.55928.abv1# |archive-date=2011-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In increasing numbers of primary stroke centers, pharmacologic thrombolysis with the drug [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (tPA), is used to dissolve the clot and unblock the artery.
Another intervention for acute cerebral ischaemia is removal of the offending thrombus directly. This is accomplished by inserting a catheter into the [[femoral artery]], directing it into the [[cerebral circulation]], and deploying a corkscrew-like device to ensnare the clot, which is then withdrawn from the body. Mechanical embolectomy devices have been demonstrated effective at restoring blood flow in patients who were unable to receive [[Thrombolysis|thrombolytic drugs]] or for whom the drugs were ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flint AC, Duckwiler GR, Budzik RF, Liebeskind DS, Smith WS |title=Mechanical thrombectomy of intracranial internal carotid occlusion: pooled results of the MERCI and Multi MERCI Part I trials |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=1274–80 |year=2007 |pmid=17332445 |doi= 10.1161/01.STR.0000260187.33864.a7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith WS, Sung G, Starkman S |title=Safety and efficacy of mechanical embolectomy in acute ischemic stroke: results of the MERCI trial |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=1432–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15961709 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000171066.25248.1d|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/7/1432|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lutsep HL, Rymer MM, Nesbit GM |title=Vertebrobasilar revascularization rates and outcomes in the MERCI and multi-MERCI trials |journal=J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=55–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18346645 |doi=10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2007.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith WS |title=Safety of mechanical thrombectomy and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke.

[[Angioplasty]] and [[stent]]ing have begun to be looked at as possible viable options in treatment of acute cerebral ischaemia. In a [[systematic review]] of six uncontrolled, single-center trials, involving a total of 300 patients, of intra-cranial stenting in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the rate of technical success (reduction to stenosis of &lt;50%) ranged from 90-98%, and the rate of major peri-procedural complications ranged from 4-10%.  The rates of restenosis and/or stroke following the treatment were also favorable.&lt;ref name="pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Derdeyn CP, Chimowitz MI |title=Angioplasty and Stenting for Atherosclerotic Intracranial Stenosis: Rationale for a Randomized Clinical Trial |journal=Neuroimaging Clin.

If studies show carotid stenosis, and the patient has residual function in the affected side, [[carotid endarterectomy]] (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after cerebral infarction. [[Carotid endarterectomy]] is also indicated to decrease the risk of cerebral infarction for symptomatic carotid stenosis (&gt;70 to 80% reduction in diameter).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In tissue losses that are not immediately fatal, the best course of action is to make every effort to restore impairments through [[physical therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], occupational therapy, [[speech therapy]] and [[exercise]].

'''Codd's cellular automaton''' is a [[cellular automaton]] (CA) devised by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Edgar F. Codd]] in 1968. It was designed to recreate the computation- and construction-universality of [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] but with fewer states: 8 instead of 29. Codd showed that it was possible to make a self-reproducing machine in his CA, in a similar way to von Neumann's [[von Neumann Universal Constructor|universal constructor]], but never gave a complete implementation.

==History==
In the 1940s and '50s, [[John von Neumann]] posed the following problem:&lt;ref name=vonNeumann66&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''|last=von Neumann|first=John|last2=Burks|first2=Arthur W.|year=1966|publisher=www.walenz.org|accessdate=2012-01-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html|archivedate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What kind of logical organization is sufficient for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?
He was able to construct a [[von Neumann cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] with 29 states, and with it a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]. Codd, building on von Neumann's work, found a simpler machine with eight states.&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author=Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modified von Neumann's question:
*What kind of logical organization is ''necessary'' for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?

Three years after Codd's work, Edwin Roger Banks showed a 4-state CA in his PhD thesis that was also capable of universal computation and construction, but again did not implement a self-reproducing machine.&lt;ref name=Banks1971&gt;{{cite book|title=Information Processing and Transmission in Cellular Automata|year=1971| first=Edwin| last=Banks|publisher=PhD thesis, MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering|url=http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/banks/banks_commentary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Devore, in his 1973 masters thesis, tweaked Codd's rules to greatly reduce the size of Codd's design, to the extent that it could be implemented in the computers of that time. However, the data tape for self-replication was too long; Devore's original design was later able to complete replication using [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. [[Christopher Langton]] made another tweak to Codd's cellular automaton in 1984 to create [[Langton's loops]], exhibiting self-replication with far fewer cells than that needed for self-reproduction in previous rules, at the cost of removing the ability for universal computation and construction.&lt;ref name=Langton84&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(84)90256-2|title=Self-Reproduction in Cellular Automata|author=Langton, C.

[[Image:Codd CA ConstructionArm.gif|right|frame|100px|The construction arm in Codd's CA can be moved into position using the commands listed in the text. Here the arm turns left, then right, then writes a cell before retracting along the same path.]]

Codd's CA has eight states determined by a [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. 

The table below shows the signal-trains needed to accomplish different tasks. Some of the signal trains need to be separated by two blanks (state 1) on the wire to avoid interference, so the 'extend' signal-train used in the image at the top appears here as '70116011'.

==Universal computer-constructor==

Codd designed a self-replicating computer in the cellular automaton, based on [[Wang B-machine|Wang's W-machine]]. However, the design was so colossal that it evaded implementation until 2009, when Tim Hutton constructed an explicit configuration.&lt;ref name=Hutton2010 /&gt; There were some minor errors in Codd's design, so Hutton's implementation differs slightly, in both the configuration and the ruleset.

A '''comfort object''', '''transitional object''', or '''security blanket''' is an item used to provide [[psychology|psychological]] comfort, especially in unusual or unique situations, or at bedtime for [[children]]. Among toddlers, comfort objects may take the form of a [[blanket]], a stuffed animal, or a favorite toy, and may be referred to by nicknames.

== In child psychology ==

[[File:Objet transitionnel.svg|thumb|250px|Legend: (a) mother, (b) child, (1) illusion, (2) transitional object]]

In human [[childhood development]], the term '''transitional object''' is normally used. It is something, usually a physical object, which takes the place of the [[Maternal bond|mother-child bond]]. Common examples include [[doll]]s, [[teddy bear]]s or blankets.

[[Donald Woods Winnicott]] introduced the concepts of "transitional objects" and "transitional experience" in reference to a particular developmental sequence. With "transition" Winnicott means an intermediate developmental phase between the psychic and external reality. In this "transitional space" we can find the "transitional object".

When the young child begins to separate the "me" from the "not-me" and evolves from complete dependence to a stage of relative independence, it uses transitional objects. Infants see themselves and the mother as a whole. In this phase the mother "brings the world" to the infant without delay which gives it a "moment of illusion", a belief that its own wish creates the object of its desire which brings with it a sense of satisfaction. Winnicott calls this [[Donald Winnicott#Subjective omnipotence|subjective omnipotence]]. Alongside the subjective omnipotence of a child lies an [[Donald Winnicott#Objective reality|objective reality]], which constitutes the child’s awareness of separateness between itself and desired objects. While the subjective omnipotence experience is one in which the child feels that its desires create satisfaction, the objective reality experience is one in which the child independently seeks out objects of desire.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Later on the child comes to realize that the mother is a separate entity, which tells the child that they have lost something. The child realizes that they are dependent on others, thus losing the idea that they are independent. This realization creates a difficult period and brings [[frustration]] and [[anxiety]] with it. The mother cannot always be there to "bring the world" to the baby, a realization which has a powerful, somewhat painful, but ultimately constructive impact on the child. Through fantasizing about the object of its wishes the child will find comfort. A transitional object can be used in this process. The transitional object is often the first "not me" possession that really belongs to the child. This could be a real object like a blanket or a teddy bear, but other "objects", such as a melody or a word, can fulfill this role as well. This object represents all components of "mothering", and it means that the child itself is able to create what it needs as well. It enables the child to have a fantasized bond with the mother when she gradually separates for increasingly longer periods of time. The transitional object is important at the time of going to sleep and as a defence against anxiety.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In a later stage of the development the child no longer needs the transitional object. It is able to make a distinction between "me" and "not-me", and keeping inside and outside apart and yet interrelated. This development leads to the use of illusion, symbols and objects later on in life.

Winnicott related the concept of transitional object to a more general one, transitional phenomena, which he considered to be the basis of science, religion and all of culture. Transitional objects and phenomena, he said, are neither subjective nor objective but partake of both. In ''Mental Space'', Robert Young has provided an exposition of these concepts and has generalized their role into psychic phenomena in adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Young, R. M. (1994). Mental Space. London: Process Press. ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, R. M. (1989). "Transitional phenomena: production and consumption", in B. Richards, ed., Crises of the Self: Further Essays on Psychoanalysis and Politics. London: Free Association Books, pp. 57-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research with children on this subject was performed at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] by Richard H. Passman and his associates. Among other findings, they showed that security blankets are appropriately named &amp;mdash; they actually do give security to those children attached to them. Along with other positive benefits, having a security blanket available can help children adapt to new situations, aid in their learning, and adjust to physicians' and clinical psychologists' evaluations.  Passman's research also points out that there is nothing abnormal about being attached to them.  In the United States, about 60% of children have at least some [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to a security object.

== Comfort objects for therapeutic use ==
[[Emergency vehicle]]s and police [[patrol car]]s are sometimes equipped with [[stuffed toy]]s, to be given to victims involved in car accidents or traumatic shock situations in order to provide them comfort.

Often charities will provide comfort objects such as blankets and quilts to survivors of disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crafthope.com/2011/05/security-blankets-for-tornado-survivors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813114500/http://crafthope.com/2011/05/security-blankets-for-tornado-survivors/ |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weighted blankets, and other items like vests and shoulder wraps, have also been used by occupational therapists to relieve the symptoms of anxiety, especially on autistic patients, by promoting deep touch stimulation as a way to increase serotonin production, thereby providing a soothing sensation of security and comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gentleweight.com/weighted-blanket-therapy |title=Understanding Weighted Blanket Therapy: How Does It Work? |publisher=Gentleweight.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], writes [[Marita Sturken]] in ''Tourists of History'', "the [[Oklahoma City National Memorial]] sent six hundred teddy bears and then the state of Oklahoma sent sixty thousand stuffed animals to New York, which were distributed to children in schools affected by 9/11, family support organizations, and New York fire stations."&lt;ref&gt;The recent history of such comfort objects, particularly teddy bears, as well a critique of their comfort-providing function can be found in Marita Sturken, ''Tourists of History: Memory, Kitsch, and Consumption from Oklahoma City to Ground Zero'' (Durham: Duke University Press, 2007), here p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by adults ==
Adults may also use comfort objects. Many adults consider the comfort that ''security blankets'' provide as essential to their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/10/13/do-you-still-have-a-security-blanket/ Do You Still Have a Security Blanket?] Dr. John Grohol, PsychCentral, 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to a 2011 survey by [[Travelodge]], about 35 percent of British adults still sleep with a teddy bear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2012/02/21/35-percent-of-British-adults-sleep-with-bear/UPI-49791329806031/ 35 percent of British adults sleep with bear] United Press International, 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a comfort object may be expanded to include representations of one’s family, home, and culture. It is significant to the person and gives psychological strength and assistance by representing their emotional attachments. These objects can include photographs, memorabilia, music records or even artwork made with family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdu.edu/newspubs/magazine/09ws/objects.html|title=Objects of Affection: And the Students Who Won't Leave Home Without Them|website=www.fdu.edu|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in movement away from home and consistent movement from one place to another for job opportunities or immigration, it is very common for people to carry these items with them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/parenting/sc-fam-no-goodbye-comfort-objects-1017-story.html|title=Is it OK to hold on to your childhood comfort object?|last=Ben-Moche|first=Erin|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may look to these objects for emotional support during transitional periods, such as assimilating to a new area or when experiencing trauma or a significant loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Inventor Richard Kopelle created ''My Therapy Buddy'' (MTB) in 2002 as a self-described transitional object to benefit "one's emotional well-being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Official site of My Therapy Buddy|url = http://mtb.mytherapybuddy.com/|website = We have the original talking My Therapy Buddy|accessdate = 2015-12-20|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blue creature speaks to you when you squeeze it and says any of a number of phrases that include "everything is going to be alright."&lt;ref name="TV Mag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blackmon|first1=Joe|title=American Inventor Gives Vindication to My Therapy Buddy|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2007/06/06/american-inventor-gives-vindication-to-my-therapy-buddy/|accessdate=26 November 2015|work=RealityTVMagazine.com|agency=SheKnows, LLC|date=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention was rejected in the first season of ''[[American Inventor]]'', but went on to become a semi-finalist in the second season.&lt;ref name="TV Mag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TV World"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roccio|first1=Christopher|last2=Rogers|first2=Steve|title=ABC's 'American Inventor' reveals its first two second-season finalists|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/abc-american-inventor-reveals-its-first-two-second-season-finalists-5349.php|work=Reality TV World|accessdate=26 November 2015|issue=American Inventor 2|date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; My Therapy Buddy also appeared on [[Shark Tank]] but did not receive any offers.

== Cross-cultural uses ==
Researchers have observed that the incidence of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] behavior toward inanimate objects differs depending on the culture in which the infant was raised. It is suggested that infants’ attachment to inanimate objects would be less frequent in societies in which in an infant may spend most of the day in close contact with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/attachment-and-loss/oclc/24186|title=Attachment and loss|last=Bowlby|first=John|date=1969|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465097166|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, in Western countries object attachments were indeed found to be common,&lt;ref name="Fortuna"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fortuna|first=Keren|last2=Baor|first2=Liora|last3=Israel|first3=Salomon|last4=Abadi|first4=Adi|last5=Knafo|first5=Ariel|date=2014-05-22|title=Attachment to inanimate objects and early childcare: A twin study|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00486|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4033092|pmid=24904499}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rates reaching as high as 60%.&lt;ref name="Fortuna"/&gt; In a study conducted by Michael Hong, it was found that around 50% of American children and only around 20% of Korean children developed an attachment to a blanket or an equivalent type of primary transitional objects.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=K.

== In popular culture ==
The term ''security blanket'' was popularized in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' [[comic strip]] created by [[Charles M. Schulz]], who gave such a blanket to his character [[Linus van Pelt]]. Linus called it his "security and happiness blanket", in ''Good Grief, More Peanuts'' printed in 1956.&lt;ref name="Security blanket"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/security-blanket.html|title=Security blanket|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of a comfort blanket existed prior to ''Peanuts''. In a November 1954 ''Review Report'' article, writer "Bev" wrote about her daughter: "Security blanket. My younger child is one year old. When she finds a fuzzy blanket or a fleecy coat she presses her cheek against it and sucks her thumb." Since 1920, blankets which clipped onto sleeping infants to prevent them from rolling out of bed and keep the body covered were dubbed "security blanket fasteners".&lt;ref name="Security blanket" /&gt;

In the film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'', Leo Bloom is prone to [[panic attacks]] and to keep himself calm, he carries a fragment of his childhood blue blanket everywhere he goes and goes into hysterics when someone takes it from him until they give it back to him.

In the film ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]'', [[Elmo]] loves his fuzzy, blue Blanket more than anything else, to the point of not wanting to share it, as it is very special to him and setting out on an epic quest to get it back when it is stolen.

In the book ''[[The Giver]]'', "comfort object" is used as a term to refer to all [[stuffed toy|stuffed animals]]. The comfort objects are described as being "imaginary creatures with funny names" because the [[utopia]]n community where the book takes place has no animals.

'''Cutlet''' (derived from [[French language|French]] ''côtelette'', ''côte'', "[[rib]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=79|year=1855|issue=6|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to:

# a thin slice of [[meat]] from the leg or ribs of [[veal]], [[pork]], or [[mutton]] (also known in various languages as a ''[[cotoletta]]'', ''[[Kotellet|Kotelett]]'', ''kotlet'' or ''kotleta'')
# a [[frying|fried]] [[breaded cutlet]]
# a [[croquette]] or cutlet-shaped [[patty]] made of [[ground meat]]
# a kind of fish cut where the fish is sliced perpendicular to the spine, rather than parallel (as with [[Fish fillet|fillets]]); often synonymous with [[steak]]
# a [[prawn]] or [[shrimp]] with its head and outer shell removed, leaving only the flesh and tail
# various preparations using fried cutlets or croquettes
# a mash of vegetables (usually [[Potato]]) fried with [[bread]]

== American cuisine ==
From the late 1700s until about 1900, virtually all recipes for "cutlets" in English-language cookbooks referenced veal cutlets. Then pork cutlets began to appear. More recently,{{when|date=April 2015}} in American cuisine, cutlets have also been made using chicken, although this was also imported from Europe. The cutlet is usually coated with flour, egg and bread crumbs, then fried in a pan with some oil. Cutlets are used in several different meals.

== Austrian cuisine ==
{{main article|Schnitzel|Vanillerostbraten}}

== Australian cuisine ==
Australians eat lamb cutlets battered with egg yolk and breadcrumbs.  Chicken cutlets are also very popular, but known as chicken schnitzel. Both lamb cutlets and [[chicken schnitzel]] are a staple of Australian children's cuisine. Amongst most Australians of Italian descent, the term schnitzel is replaced by the term cutlet. Cutlets amongst this population are usually veal or chicken.

== British cuisine ==
In British cuisine a cutlet is usually unbreaded and can also be called a [[meat chop|chop]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/5888615/Pork-cutlet-with-broad-beans-wild-mushroom-and-sage.html Pork cutlet with broad beans, wild mushroom and sage], Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; If referring to beef, more than one piece together would be generally called a rib of beef or a rib joint, whilst lamb ribs are called a rack, or rack of lamb.  Lamb racks can also be tied into a circular shape before cooking, with the ribs on the outside, giving a crown shape, leading to the name "crown of lamb".

== German cuisine ==
{{main article|Kotellet|}}

== Hong Kong cuisine ==
In Hong Kong the cutlet was introduced during the period of British colonial occupation along with other cooking influences. It is seen as "sai chaan" or Western cuisine. Veal, pork and chicken are battered and deep fried for lunch. Seafood such as shrimp or scallop that is battered or breaded and deep fried such as can also be known as 'cutlet' in Hong Kong.  It is usually served alongside rice or spaghetti noodles.

== Indian cuisine ==
In Indian cuisine, a cutlet specifically refers to mashed vegetables (potato, carrot, beans) or cooked meat (mutton, beef, fish or chicken) stuffing that is fried with a batter/covering.  The meat itself is cooked with spices - onion, cardamom, cloves, [[cinnamon]], [[coriander]] (cilantro), green chillies, lemon and salt.  This is then dipped in an egg mix or [[Corn starch]] and then in [[Bread crumbs]] (also see [[breaded cutlet]]), and fried in [[ghee]] or vegetable oil. Mostly  chicken and mutton cutlets are very popular snacks in the city of [[Kolkata]].

The vegetarian version has no meat in it, instead the filling is a combination of mashed potatoes, onion, green chillies, spices and salt, cooked for a bit together. This version is more popular with the vegetarian Indian population. An example is the [[Aloo Tikki]].

== Iranian cuisine ==
[[File:Kotlet (3119520131).jpg|thumbnail|200px|Iranian cutlets]]

In Iran, cutlet  ([[Persian language|Persian]]: کتلت) is a popular hamburger like thin layered fried of mixture of ground beef, mashed potatoes, eggs, onions, spices and bread crumbs.

== Italian cuisine ==
The use of the cutlet ([[cotoletta]]) is quite widespread in Italian cuisine in many different variations. The most famous variant is the [[Veal Milanese|Milanese cutlet]] (''cotoletta alla milanese''), a veal cutlet covered in bread crumbs and fried in butter.  It should not be mistaken for the ''Wiener schnitzel'' (which should be referred as a ''scaloppina alla viennese'', or as ''fettina impanata'' in Italian), because it's a different cut of meat; the Milanese cutlet cut includes the bone, whereas the Wienerschnitzel doesn't. It is disputed whether the ''cotoletta alla milanese'' originated the Wienerschnitzel, or vice versa.

== Japanese cuisine ==
The cutlet was introduced to Japan during the [[Meiji period]], in a Western cuisine restaurant in the fashionable [[Ginza]] district of [[Tokyo]].  The Japanese pronunciation of cutlet is ''katsuretsu''.

In [[Japanese cuisine]], ''katsuretsu'' or shorter ''katsu'' is actually the name for a Japanese version of the [[Wiener schnitzel]], a breaded cutlet.  Dishes with ''katsu'' include [[tonkatsu]] and [[katsudon]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Polish cuisine ==
The Polish pork cutlet, [[kotlet schabowy]], is a [[pork chop]] coated with breadcrumbs. Kotlet schabowy can be served with [[mashed potatoes]], [[home fries]], [[pierogi]], [[fried mushrooms]], cooked vegetables ([[cabbage]]), with [[salads]] or with [[coleslaw]]. ''Kotlet z kurczaka'' is a [[chicken (food)|chicken]] cutlet coated with [[breadcrumbs]]. ''Kotlet z indyka'' is a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] cutlet coated with [[breadcrumbs]].

== Cuisines of Russia, Ukraine and other countries of former Soviet Union ==
In modern Russian, the word ''kotleta'' (котлета) refers almost exclusively to pan-fried minced meat croquettes / cutlet-shaped patties.  Bread soaked in milk, onions, garlic, and herbs is usually present in the recipe.  When in a hurry, a "cutlet" can be eaten between bread slices like a hamburger, but this fast meal is rarely served in restaurants.  At home, it is most often served with pan-fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, pasta, etc.

In the middle of the 20th century, industrially produced, [[Convenience food|semi-processed]] ground meat cutlets were introduced in the USSR. Colloquially known as [[Mikoyan cutlet]]s (named after Soviet politician [[Anastas Mikoyan]]), these were cheap pork or beef cutlet-shaped patties which resembled American burgers.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/15/others-come-and-go-mikoyan-remains.html?_r=0 |title=Others come and go—Mikoyan remains |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |first=Henry |last=Tanner |date=Nov 15, 1964 |accessdate = 10 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular form known as [[Pozharsky cutlet]] is an elaborated version of minced poultry ''kotleta'' covered with breadcrumbs. A distinct feature of this cutlet is that butter is added to minced meat, which results in an especially juicy and tender consistency.

Another Russian version of a cutlet, called ''otbivnaya kotleta'' ({{lang|ru|отбивная котлета}}), meaning "beaten cutlet", is a fried slice of meat, usually pork or beef, beaten flat with a tenderizing hammer or knife handle and covered with beaten eggs, dough or breadcrumbs.  The recipe is similar to those of [[escalopes]], [[schnitzel]], Polish, or American cutlets.  Today, this dish is simply called ''otbivnaya'', with the word ''kotleta'' reserved for minced meat patties.

[[Chicken Kiev]] is called ''kotleta po-kievski'' ({{lang|ru|котлета по-киевски}}) in Russian and similarly ''kotleta po-kyivski'' ({{lang|uk|котлета по-київськи}}) in Ukrainian, which means "Kiev-style cutlet".

The composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] died on 5 December 1791 at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have attracted much research and speculation. Some principal sources of contention are as follows.

*Whether Mozart declined gradually, experiencing great fear and sadness, or whether he was fundamentally in good spirits toward the end of his life, then felled by a relatively sudden illness. The former hypothesis was accepted for most of the history of Mozart biography, but the latter has been advanced by contemporary scholars.
*The actual cause of his death: whether it was from disease or poisoning. The poisoning hypothesis is widely discredited. If a particular disease was the actual cause of death, then it remains unknown; only plausible conjectures can be offered.
*His funeral arrangements, and whether they were the normal procedures for his day, or  if they were of a disrespectful nature.  Modern scholarship generally supports the view that the funeral arrangements were normal for Mozart's time.

[[File:Costanze Mozart by Lange 1782.jpg|thumb|upright|Constanze Mozart by her brother-in-law [[Joseph Lange]] (1782)]]
Mozart scholarship  long followed the accounts of early biographers, which proceeded in large part from the recorded memories of his widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] and her sister [[Sophie Weber]] as they were recorded in the biographies by [[Franz Niemetschek]] and [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen]].  For instance, the important biography by [[Hermann Abert]] (1923/2008:1305-9) largely follows this account. The following is a summary of this view.

When in August 1791 Mozart arrived in [[Prague]] to supervise the performance of his new opera ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' ([[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 621), he was "already very ill" (Abert, p.&amp;nbsp;1305). During this visit, Niemetschek wrote, "he was pale and expression was sad, although his good humour was often shown in merry jest with his friends."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation cited from Solomon (1995:487)&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return to Vienna (mid September 1791),&lt;ref&gt;Abert (1923/2004: 1245)&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart's condition gradually worsened.&lt;ref&gt;For this point {{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=586}} cites an article in the Berlin ''Musikalisches Wochenblatt'' ("Musical Weekly"), written shortly after Mozart's death.&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he was still able to work and completed his [[Clarinet Concerto (Mozart)|Clarinet Concerto]] (K. 622), worked toward the completion of his [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] (K. 626), and conducted the premiere performance of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (K. 620) on 30 September. Still, he became increasingly alarmed and despondent about his health. An anecdote from Constanze is related by Niemetschek:

{{quote|On his return to Vienna, his indisposition increased visibly and made him gloomily depressed. His wife was truly distressed over this. One day when she was driving in the [[Prater]] with him, to give him a little distraction and amusement, and they were sitting by themselves, Mozart began to speak of death, and declared that he was writing the Requiem for himself. Tears came to the eyes of the sensitive man: 'I feel definitely,' he continued, 'that I will not last much longer; I am sure I have been poisoned. I cannot rid myself of this idea.'}}

Constanze attempted to cheer her husband by persuading him to give up work on the Requiem for a while, encouraging him instead to complete the "Freimaurerkantate" (K. 623), composed to celebrate the opening of a new [[Mozart and Freemasonry|Masonic]] temple for Mozart's own lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy worked for a time – the cantata was completed and successfully premiered on 18 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told Constanze he felt "elated" over the premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=490}} The words are as related by Constanze decades later to the visiting English diarist [[Mary Cowden Clarke|Mary Novello]].&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart is reported to have stated, "Yes I see I was ill to have had such an absurd idea of having taken poison, give me back the Requiem and I will go on with it."

Mozart's worst symptoms of illness soon returned, together with the strong feeling that he was being poisoned. He became bedridden on 20 November, suffering from swelling, pain and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Maynard. (2005). Mozart: A life. Harper Perennial, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point on, scholars are all agreed that Mozart was indeed very sick, and he died about two weeks later, on December 5 (see below).

===Revisionist accounts===
The view that Mozart was in near-steady decline and despair during the last several months of his life has met with skepticism in recent years. [[Cliff Eisen]] supervised the reissue of Abert's biography in 2008 in a new edition, supplementing it with numerous footnotes. While generally deferential to Abert, Eisen expresses sharp criticism in the footnoting of the section leading up to Mozart's death:

{{quote|It should be noted that, in this context, the evidence cited by Abert is selective and suits the intended trajectory of his biography. With the exception of citations from Mozart's letters, all of the testimony is posthumous and prompted by complicated motives both personal and financial. Although it is 'authentic' in the sense that it derives from those who witnessed Mozart's death, or were close to him, it is not necessarily accurate. ... To be sure, Mozart was under the weather in Prague. But there is no evidence that he was 'very ill' and it is not true that his health 'continued to deteriorate'. As Abert himself notes later in this chapter, Mozart's health improved in October and early November (Abert/Eisen 2008:1305).}}

In the main biography article of the ''Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia'', Ruth Halliwell writes of the decline-and-despair account:

{{quote|While later sources describe [Mozart] as working feverishly on [his Requiem], filled with premonitions of his own death, these accounts are hard to reconcile with the high spirits of his letters from most of November.  Constanze's earliest account, published in Niemetschek's biography of 1798, states that Mozart 'told her of ... his wish to try his hand at this type of composition, the more so as the higher forms of church music had always appealed to his genius.' There is no hint that the work was a burden to him.}}

As for why Constanze might have been "prompted by complicated motives both personal and financial" (Eisen), Halliwell contends that "Constanze and Sophie were not objective witnesses, because Constanze's continuing quest for charity gave her reasons to disseminate sentimental and sensationalist views."&lt;ref&gt;From Halliwell's article "Mozart" in ''The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia'', p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  By "charity" Halliwell may be referring to the many benefit concerts from which Constanze received income in the years following Mozart's death, as well as, perhaps, the pension she received from the Emperor; see discussion below as well as [[Constanze Mozart]].

[[Christoph Wolff]], in a 2012 book entitled ''Mozart at the Gateway to his Fortune'', disputes the view that Mozart's last years represented a steady slide to despair and the grave; he also disagrees with interpretations of the music as reflecting late-life despair (for example) "the hauntingly beautiful autumnal world of [Mozart's] music written in 1791".&lt;ref&gt;Wolf 2012, "Prologue".  The quotation, of [[H. C. Robbins Landon]]'s book ''Mozart's Last Year'', appears on p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remembrances of Mozart's death ==
[[File:Requiem6.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Requiem6.png|thumb|295x295px|An 1857 [[Lithography|lithograph]] by Franz Schramm, titled ''Ein Moment aus den letzten Tagen Mozarts'' ("Moment from the Last Days of Mozart"). Mozart, with the score of the Requiem on his lap, gives [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr|Süssmayr]] last-minute instructions. Constanze is to the side and the messenger is leaving through the main door.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76850387|title=Mozart studies|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=ed.

Individuals present at the time of Mozart's death eventually committed their memories to writing, either on their own or through interviews by others. The stories they told are often contradictory, which may be due in part to some of the events not being recorded until the 1820s, when the witnesses' memories might have faded.

[[Benedikt Schack]], Mozart's close friend for whom he wrote the role of Tamino in ''The Magic Flute'', told an interviewer that on the last day of Mozart's life, he participated in a rehearsal of the ''Requiem'' in progress. Schack's questionable account appeared in an obituary for Schack which was published in the 25 July 1827 issue of the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'':

{{quote|On the very eve of his death, [Mozart] had the score of the Requiem brought to his bed, and himself (it was two o'clock in the afternoon) sang the alto part; Schack, the family friend, sang the soprano line, as he had always previously done, Hofer, Mozart's brother-in-law, took the tenor, [[Franz Xaver Gerl|Gerl]], later a bass singer at the Mannheim Theater, the bass. They were at the first bars of the Lacrimosa when Mozart began to weep bitterly, laid the score on one side, and eleven hours later, at one o'clock in the morning (of 5 December 1791, as is well known), departed this life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|pp=536–7}}{{harvnb|Schildkret|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biographer Niemetschek relates vaguely similar account, leaving out a rehearsal:

{{quote|On the day of his death he asked for the score to be brought to his bedside. 'Did I not say before, that I was writing this ''Requiem'' for myself?' After saying this, he looked yet again with tears in his eyes through the whole work.&lt;ref&gt;Niemetschek biography, quoted {{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The widely repeated claim that, on his deathbed, Mozart dictated passages of the ''Requiem'' to his pupil [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr|Süssmayr]] is strongly discounted by Solomon, who notes that the earliest reference for this claim dates to 1856. Sophie Weber did claim to recall, however, that Mozart gave instructions to Süssmayr.&lt;ref name=S493&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1840 letter from the composer [[Ignaz von Seyfried]] states that on his last night, Mozart was mentally occupied with the currently running opera ''The Magic Flute''. Mozart is said to have whispered the following to Constanze in reference to her sister [[Josepha Weber|Josepha Hofer]], the coloratura soprano who premiered the role of the Queen of the Night:

{{quote|Quiet, quiet! Hofer is just taking [[O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn|her top F]]; — now my sister-in-law is singing her second aria, '[[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Der Hölle Rache]]'; how strongly she strikes and holds the B-flat: 'Hört! hört! hört! der Mutter Schwur'&lt;ref&gt;English "Hear! hear! hear! a mother's oath". Mozart or Konstanze misremembered exactly what the Queen of the Night sings, which is "Hört, hört, hört, Rachegötter! Hört der Mutter Schwur!" ("Hear, ye gods of revenge!")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Solomon, while noting that Mozart's biographers often left out the "crueler memories" surrounding his death,&lt;ref name=S493 /&gt; stated, "Constanze Mozart told Nissen that just before the end Mozart asked her what [his physician] Dr. Closset had said. When she answered with a soothing lie, he said, 'It isn't true,' and he was very distressed: 'I shall die, now when I am able to take care of you and the children.&lt;ref&gt;Mozart's financial condition had improved considerably during the year 1791; see {{harvnb|Solomon|1995|loc=ch. 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ah, now I will leave you unprovided for.' And as he spoke these words, 'suddenly he vomited —it gushed out of him in an arc— it was brown, and he was dead.'"&lt;ref name=S493 /&gt; Mozart's older, seven-year-old son [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl]] was present at his father's death and later wrote, "Particularly remarkable is in my opinion the fact that a few days before he died, his whole body became so swollen that the patient was unable to make the smallest movement, moreover, there was stench, which reflected an internal disintegration which, after death, increased to the extent that an autopsy was impossible."&lt;ref name=S493 /&gt;[[File:Joseph Heicke Mozarts Begräbnis G 0992 II.jpg|thumb|A portrayal by Joseph Heicke of the journey of Mozart's coffin through a storm to the cemetery. Engraving from about 1860, a few years after the Deiner story appeared.|left|250x250px]]

==Funeral==
The funeral arrangements were made by Mozart's friend and patron Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]]. Describing his funeral, the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' states, "Mozart was buried in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the [[St. Marx Cemetery]] outside the city on 7 December." [[Otto Jahn]] wrote in 1856 that [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]], [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr|Süssmayr]], van Swieten and two other musicians were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jahn|1867|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}|nopp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common belief that Mozart was buried in a pauper's grave is also without foundation.  The "common grave" referred to above is a term for a grave belonging to a citizen not of the aristocracy.  It was an individual grave, not a communal grave; but after ten years the city had the right to dig it up and use it for a later burial.  The graves of the aristocracy were spared such treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aproposmozart.com/Brauneis%20--%20Dies%20irae.rev.Index.pdf Walther Brauneis, ''Dies irea, dies illa – Day of wrath, day of wailing: Notes on the commissioning, origin and completion of Mozart's Requiem (KV 626)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071543/http://www.aproposmozart.com/Brauneis%20--%20Dies%20irae.rev.Index.pdf |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of Mozart's funeral, attributed to Joseph Deiner, appeared in the Vienna ''Morgen-Post'' of 28 January 1856:

{{quote|The night of Mozart's death was dark and stormy ; at the funeral, too, it began to rage and storm. Rain and snow fell at the same time, as if Nature wanted to shew her anger with the great composer's contemporaries, who had turned out extremely sparsely for his burial. Only a few friends and three women accompanied the corpse. Mozart's wife was not present. These few people with their umbrellas stood round the bier, which then taken via the Grosse Schullerstrasse to the St. Marx Cemetery. As the storm grew ever more violent, even these few friends determined to turn back at the Stuben Gate, and they betook themselves to the "Silver Snake". Deiner, the landlord, was also present for the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As [[Nicolas Slonimsky|Slonimsky]] (1960:12-14) notes, the tale was widely adopted and incorporated into Mozart biographies.

Deiner's description of the weather is contrary to records kept of the previous day. The diarist [[Karl Zinzendorf]] recorded on 6 December that there had been "mild weather and frequent mist".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=418}} The original French, given by Slonimsky (1960:17), is "temps doux et brouillard frequent."&lt;/ref&gt; The Vienna Observatory kept weather records and recorded for 6 December a temperature ranging from 37.9 to 38.8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8&amp;nbsp;°C–3.8&amp;nbsp;°C), with "a weak east wind at all ... times of the day" (Slonimsky 1960:16).

==Aftermath==
Following her husband's death, Constanze addressed the issue of providing financial security for her family; the Mozarts had two young children, and Mozart had died with outstanding debts. She successfully appealed to the [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] on 11 December 1791 for a [[widow's pension]] due to her as a result of Mozart's service to the Emperor as a part-time chamber composer. Additionally, she organized a series of concerts of Mozart's music and the publication of many of her husband's works. As a result, Constanze became financially secure over time.&lt;ref name="Solomon 1995, 499"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the composer's death a Mozart biography was started by [[Friedrich Schlichtegroll]], who wrote an early account based on information from Mozart's sister, [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]. Working with Constanze, Franz Niemetschek wrote a biography as well. Much later, Constanze assisted her second husband, Georg Nikolaus von Nissen, on a more detailed biography published in 1826. See ''[[Biographies of Mozart]]''.

Mozart's musical reputation rose following his death; 20th-century biographer [[Maynard Solomon]] describes an "unprecedented wave of enthusiasm"&lt;ref name="Solomon 1995, 499" /&gt; for his work after he died, and a number of publishers issued editions of his compositions.

What may have been Mozart's skull was exhumed in 1801,&lt;ref&gt;(La Chronique Medicale, 13 (1906) 423)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1989–1991 it was examined for identification by several scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2061918 |year=1991 |last1=Puech |first1=PF |title=Forensic scientists uncovering Mozart |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=387 |pmc=1293314 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0379-0738(89)90241-7 |title=Identification of the cranium of W.A.

==Cause of death==
[[File:Antonio Salieri painted by Joseph Willibrord Mähler.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Salieri portrayed by [[Joseph Willibrord Mähler]]]]

===Theories involving homicide===
An early rumor addressing the cause of Mozart's death was that he was poisoned by his colleague [[Antonio Salieri]]. This rumor, however, was not proven to be true as the signs of illness Mozart displayed did not indicate poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, with references, of the poisoning rumor see {{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=587}}. The ''Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music'' states flatly, "He was not poisoned"; see {{harvnb|Sadie|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite denying the allegation, Salieri was greatly affected by the accusations that he had contributed to Mozart's death and contributed to his [[nervous breakdown]]s in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|pp=522, 524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Salieri theory, other theories involving murder by poison have been put forth, blaming the [[Freemasonry|Mason]]s, [[Jew]]s, or both. One such theory was the work of [[Mathilde Ludendorff]], wife of the German general [[Erich Ludendorff]]. William Stafford (1991) describes such accounts as outlandish [[conspiracy theories]], giving supporting reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford (1991:ch. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories involving disease===
Stafford (1991:56) described the effort to determine what disease killed Mozart:

{{quote|What did he actually die of? Mozart's medical history is like an inverted pyramid:  a small corpus of primary documentation supports a large body of secondary literature. There is a small quantity of direct eye-witness testimony concerning the last illness and death, and a larger quantity of reporting of what eye witnesses are alleged to have said.  Altogether it would not cover ten pages; some of it is vague, and some downright unreliable. All too often later writers have used this data uncritically to support pet theories. They have invented new symptoms, nowhere recorded in the primary sources.}}

In the parish register, the entry concerning Mozart's death states he died of "severe [[miliary fever]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=494}}. Numerous sources, even published biographies ([https://books.google.com/books?id=HiIgzSazS48C&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246], [https://books.google.com/books?id=jUcL1kBBmAkC&amp;pg=PR293&amp;lpg=PR293]), have altered this term to "military fever".&lt;/ref&gt; – "miliary" referring to the appearance of millet-sized bumps on the skin. This does not name the actual disease.

Mozart had health problems throughout his life, suffering from [[Mozart and smallpox|smallpox]], [[tonsillitis]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[typhoid fever]], [[rheumatism]], and [[gum disease]].&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough survey of Mozart's health history, with an M.D.'s proposed diagnoses, see {{harvnb|Davies|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether these played any role in his demise cannot be determined.

Conjectures as to what killed Mozart are numerous.  The following survey is arranged in rough chronological order.

Some ascribe Mozart's death to [[malpractice]] on the part of his physician, Dr. Closset. His sister-in-law [[Sophie Weber]], in her 1825 account, makes the implication. Borowitz summarizes:

{{quote|text=When Mozart appeared to be sinking, one of his doctors, Dr. Nikolaus Closset, was sent for and finally located at the theater. However, according to Sophie's account, that drama-lover "had to wait till the piece was over." When he arrived, he ordered cold compresses put on Mozart's feverish brow, but these "provided such a shock that he did not regain consciousness again before he died.&lt;ref name="Borowitz"&gt;{{harvnb|Borowitz|1973|pp=265–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a journal article from 2011, it was suggested that [[Vitamin D]] deficiency could have played a role in Mozart's underlying medical conditions leading to his death.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Grant and S. Pilz, ''Vitamin D deficiency contributed to Mozart's death'', Medical Problems of Performing Artists, '''26''' N2, 117 (2011) [http://www.sciandmed.com/mppa/journalviewer.aspx?issue=1192&amp;article=1908 article]&lt;/ref&gt;

A suggestion is that Mozart died as a result of his [[hypochondriasis]] and his predilection for taking [[patent medicine]]s containing [[antimony]]. In his final days, this was compounded by further prescriptions of antimony to relieve the fever he clearly suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2005|pp=220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 article in ''Neurology'' suggests Mozart died of a [[subdural hematoma]]. A skull believed to be Mozart's was saved by the successor of the gravedigger who had supervised Mozart's burial, and later passed on to anatomist Josef Hyrtl, the municipality of Salzburg, and the Mozarteum museum (Salzburg). Forensic reconstruction of soft tissues related to the skull reveals substantial concordance with Mozart's portraits. Examination of the skull suggested a premature closure of the [[metopic suture]], which has been suggested on the basis of his [[physiognomy]]. A left temporal fracture and concomitant erosions raise the question of a chronic subdural hematoma, which would be consistent with several falls in 1789 and 1790 and could have caused the weakness, headaches, and fainting Mozart experienced in 1790 and 1791. Additionally, aggressive [[bloodletting]] used to treat suspected rheumatic fever could have decompensated such a lesion, leading to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7864907 |year=1993 |last1=Drake Jr |first1=ME |title=Mozart's chronic subdural hematoma |volume=43 |issue=11 |pages=2400–3 |journal=Neurology |doi=10.1212/wnl.43.11.2400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 publication, a team of two physicians (Faith T. Fitzgerald, Philip A. Mackowiak) and a musicologist ([[Neal Zaslaw]]) reviewed the historical evidence and tentatively opted for a diagnosis of [[rheumatic fever]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Zaslaw, and Mackowiak 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of [[trichinosis]] was put forth by Jan V. Hirschmann in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=648393], and critical comment [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=211378] with reply at [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=211378].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, British, Viennese and Dutch researchers performed [[Epidemiology|epidemiological research]] combined with a study of other deaths in Vienna at the time of Mozart's death. They concluded that Mozart may have died of a [[Streptococcus|streptococcal]] [[infection]] leading to an [[Nephritic syndrome|acute nephritic syndrome]] caused by poststreptococcal [[glomerulonephritis]]. This disease was also called "Wassersucht" in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zegers|Weigl|Steptoe|2009|pp=274–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Good thief (c. 1560, Moscow Kremlin).jpg|thumb|right|x324px|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of [[Saint Dismas|The Good Thief]] in Paradise (Moscow School, c. 1560)]]

A '''deathbed conversion''' is the adoption of a particular [[religious]] [[faith]] shortly before dying.  Making a [[Religious conversion|conversion]] on one's [[:wikt:deathbed|deathbed]] may reflect an immediate change of belief, a desire to formalize longer-term beliefs, or a desire to complete a process of conversion already underway. Claims of the deathbed conversion of famous or influential figures have also been used in history as [[rhetorical devices]].

==Overview==
[[File:Raphael Baptism Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Baptism of Constantine]]'', as imagined by students of [[Raphael]]]]
Conversions at the point of death have a long history.  The first recorded deathbed conversion appears in the [[Gospel of Luke]] where [[Saint Dismas|the good thief]], crucified beside Jesus, expresses belief in Christ.  Jesus accepts his conversion, saying “Today you shall be with Me in Paradise".

Perhaps the most momentous conversion in Western history was that of [[Constantine I]], [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]] and later proclaimed a Christian [[Saint]] by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. While his belief in Christianity occurred long before his death, it was only on his deathbed that he was [[baptism|baptised]], in 337.  While traditional sources disagree as to why this happened so late, modern historiography concludes{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that Constantine chose religious tolerance as an instrument to bolster his reign.

== Notable deathbed conversions==

===King Charles II===
[[Charles II of England]] reigned in a Protestant nation at a time of strong religious conflict.  Though his sympathies were at least somewhat with the Catholic faith, he ruled as an Anglican, though he attempted to lessen the persecution and legal penalties affecting non-Anglicans in England, notably through the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]].  As he lay dying following a stroke, released of the political need, he was received into the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|authorlink=Ronald Hutton|title=Charles II: King of England, Scotland, and Ireland|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=0-19-822911-9|pages=443, 456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean de La Fontaine ===
The most famous French fabulist published a revised edition of his greatest work, ''Contes'', in 1692, the same year that he began to suffer a severe illness. Under such circumstances, [[Jean de La Fontaine]] turned to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jean-delafontaine.com/|title=Jean de La Fontaine Biography - Infos - Art Market|author=|date=|website=www.jean-delafontaine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A young priest, M. Poucet, tried to persuade him about the impropriety of the ''Contes'', and it is said that the destruction of a new play of some merit was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. La Fontaine received the [[Viaticum]], and the following years, he continued to write poems and fables.&lt;ref name="Sanctis1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sante De Sanctis|title=Religious Conversion: A Bio-psychological Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXeMAA0gmk8C|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-21111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1695.

=== Sir Allan Napier MacNab ===
[[Allan MacNab|Sir Allan Napier MacNab]], Canadian political leader, died 8 August 1862 in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. His deathbed conversion to Catholicism caused a furor in the press in the following days. The ''[[The Globe and Mail|Toronto Globe]]'' and the ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'' expressed strong doubts about the conversion, and the Anglican rector of [[Christ's Church Cathedral (Hamilton, Ontario)|Christ Church]] in Hamilton declared that MacNab died a [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacNab's Catholic baptism is recorded at St. Mary's Cathedral in Hamilton, performed by John, Bishop of Hamilton, on 7 August 1862.  Lending credibility to this conversion, MacNab's second wife, who predeceased him, was Catholic, and their two daughters were raised as Catholics.&lt;ref name=conversion&gt;

While Wilde's conversion may have come as a surprise, he had long maintained an interest in the Catholic Church, having met with [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1877 and describing the Roman Catholic Church as "for saints and sinners alone – for respectable people, the Anglican Church will do". However, how much of a believer in all the tenets of Catholicism Wilde ever was is arguable: in particular, against Ross's insistence on the truth of Catholicism: "No, Robbie, it isn't true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-vatican-wakes-up-to-the-wisdom-of-oscar-wilde-1750093.html |title=The Vatican wakes up to the wisdom of Oscar Wilde – Europe, World |publisher=The Independent |date= 17 July 2009|accessdate=2009-11-15 | location=London | first1=Jerome | last1=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9404|title=Oscar Wilde: The Final Scene|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/arts/al0010.html|title=The Long Conversion of Oscar Wilde|last=McCracken|first=Andrew|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "My position is curious," Wilde epigrammatised, "I am not a Catholic: I am simply a violent Papist."&lt;ref name="Frankel2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Frankel|title=Oscar Wilde: The Unrepentant Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4M4DwAAQBAJ|date=16 October 2017|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-98202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his poem ''Ballad of Reading Gaol'', Wilde wrote:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Ah! Happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win!
How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from Sin?
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in?

===Wallace Stevens===
The poet [[Wallace Stevens]] is said to have been baptized a Catholic during his last days suffering from [[stomach cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria J. Cirurgião, “Last Farewell and First Fruits: The Story of a Modern Poet.” ''Lay Witness'' (June 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  This account is disputed, particularly by Stevens's daughter, Holly,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brazeau, ''Parts of a World: Wallace Stevens Remembered'', New York, Random House, 1983, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and critic, [[Helen Vendler]], who, in a letter to [[James Wm. Chichetto]], thought Fr. Arthur Hanley was "forgetful" since "he was interviewed twenty years after Stevens' death."&lt;ref&gt;Archives of the Holy Cross Fathers (Eastern Province) (AHCFE), North Easton, Massachusetts, 02356. Helen Vendler's letter (dated 8/28/09): "Dear Father Chichetto: I am sorry to have annoyed you by my putting of quotes around the word 'baptism.' I simply wanted to indicate by the quotation marks my skepticism about the fact. Of course, I did find something 'arwy' in Father Hanley's account, but I have never accused Father Hanley of prevarication, only of forgetfulness. I  believe he believed that things happened as he said, but he was interviewed twenty years after Stevens' death. Of course I credit the first part of Father Hanley's story concerning conversations with Stevens during Stevens' first day in the hospital between 26 April and 11 May. He returned to the hospital with disseminated cancer in July, and Father Hanley says that the baptism took place 'a few days before his death.' Stevens had not apparently requested baptism in April during his first stay in the hospital. Of course, I can imagine Stevens discussing religion with a priest who was attempting to convert him, but nothing in his poetry or prose suggests any wish to be a member of any church. It's therefore hard to believe Father Hanley's recollection. And it is harder to believe because there is no written record and no  contemporaneous evidence. I can understand reasons why people might request that a baptism be kept private. Father Hanley does not describe any such request by Stevens, so the absence of a written record becomes more inexplicable. Father Hanley, in his long service, no doubt conseled, consoled, and baptized many dying people. It seems to me quite possible that he confused Stevens with someone else. Faulty memories are common in all of us, and it does not seem to me at all probable that Stevens would have requested baptism, have requested secrecy, or have responded with the cliche, 'Now I am in the fold.' Such language is inconsistent with Stevens' abhorrence of chiche.

I do not impugn Father Hanley's veracity, only his memory. In the absence of any contemporary testimony and any recorded notice, I think that any biographer would agree that an unsupported recollection,  voiced twenty years after the fact, cannot be taken as conclusive. There is nothing in Stevens' life and writing that makes a request on his part for baptism plausible or believable. It makes no difference to the  writing, of course, which was in any case complete before Stevens' hospitalization.  Yours truly, Helen Vendler"&lt;/ref&gt;  In his response, Chichetto noted that Vendler ignored "the testimony of Dr. Edward Sennett (in charge of the Radiology Dept. at St. Francis Hospital when Stevens was admitted both times) and the Sisters with whom he [Chichetto] talked in 1977 (and later) who believed Fr. Hanley's account."&lt;ref&gt;AHCFE, Fr. Chichetto's letter (dated 9/2/09): "Dear Helen Vendler,  I didn't expect you to agree with everything I put down in my letter to you. It is  disturbing, however, when you ignore  the testimony of Dr. Edward Sennett (in charge of the Radiology Dept. at St. Francis Hospital when Stevens was admitted  both times [1955]) and the Sisters with whom I talked in 1977 (and later) who believed Fr. Hanley's account. They never spoke of any kind of forgetfulness or memory loss on Fr. Hanley's part, whether noble (when one intentionally does not remember injuries, mischief, etc.) or unmeant (when one unintentionally cannot remember things owing to trauma, confusion or some other mental impairment). What provoked me NOT to visit Fr. Hanley in 1977 was their testimony that his account in 1955 was credible and that they believed Stevens was baptized. The Sisters had no reason to doubt Hanley's word, one of whom worked with him and knew him quite well. You seem to want to ignore that. Do you really believe they were ALL taken in by Fr. Hanley's 'forgetfulness,' by his 'mental impairment,' in 1977, when he was alive, retired, and in touch with them? (He lived only a half hour away from them!) Dr. Sennett was too sharp a person and knew the Sisters too well to believe they were being deluded and misled owing to Fr. Hanley's 'memory loss.'

Also, in your response, you ignore the fact that a number of priests in the past refrained from recording (in nearby parishes and hospitals) the baptisms of certain dying people. I myself, for example, remember baptizing two people and leaving their baptisms unrecorded on two different occasions. That is, I  baptized two people (unconditionally and absolutely), gave them Communion, and didn't record their baptisms in a nearby parish or at the hospital – for many reasons, not the least being that the dying person wanted no Catholic funeral and preferred that his/her 'reception' remain private (i.e., between himself/herself and God). I mentioned this in my first letter. Such private baptisms did occur in New England and elsewhere! (Today, of course, federal law and new legislation requires that some sort of record of a person's baptism be kept in the hospital as part of the deceased person's medical history. But that was not always the case in the past. And it is anyone's guess as to whether priests abide by those rules today; they pick and chose so freely.)

Finally, to assume that because 'nothing in his [Stevens'] poetry or prose suggests any wish to be a member of any church' he therefore could never have requested a private baptism flies in the face of so many 'hour of death' accounts of the dying, many of whose private testimonies, disclosures, groundless terrors contradict the reckonings and calculations erected or founded on their earlier lives (and, in this case, the person's writings). The dying often believe for themselves; not for another person or for the sake of some book they wrote. Any person who has witnessed the dying also knows that they 'say' and disclose their sentiments (in words and gestures) better than the witnesses or those around them can, foolish cliches and all.

In conclusion, I don't think this response to your letter will dissuade you from holding your own belief that Fr. Hanley was forgetful, etc. Indeed, reasoning further against your opinion in this matter would be like fighting against a shadow – all-consuming, exhausting without affecting the shadow. I also sincerely believe you can't change. As a critic, you have too much invested in your opinion. (One of my colleagues lent me her THE MUSIC OF WHAT HAPPENS to read. In that book you are quite adamant about Hanley on page 80.) However, based on Dr. Sennett's and the Sisters' propriety of feeling for Fr. Hanley and their belief that he was telling the truth in 1977 as he was in 1955, I do believe Stevens was baptized privately (though in academic journals his baptism will always be lightly condemned, censured, or laid aside as 'inconsistent' with his writings). I also believe that the baptism should never have been made public. Stevens was a great 'unnamer,' to quote Harold Bloom, and Fr. Hanley should have left his baptism unnamed, as it were, anonymous, like a 'blindness cleaned.' Sincerely, (Fr.) James Chichetto, C.S.C."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spurious deathbed conversions==

===Charles Darwin===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|upright|After [[Charles Darwin]] died, rumours spread that he had converted to Christianity on his deathbed. His children denied this occurred.]]
One famous example is [[Charles Darwin]]'s deathbed conversion in which it was claimed by [[Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope|Lady Hope]] that Darwin said:
"How I wish I had not expressed my theory of [[evolution]] as I have done." He went on to say that he would like her to gather a congregation since he "would like to speak to them of Christ Jesus and His salvation, being in a state where he was eagerly savoring the heavenly anticipation of bliss."&lt;ref name="stephenjaygould1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/ladyhope.html#Autobiography |title=The Lady Hope Story: A Widespread Falsehood |publisher=Stephenjaygould.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lady Hope's story was printed in the ''Boston Watchman Examiner''. The story spread, and the claims were republished as late as October 1955 in the ''Reformation Review'' and in the ''Monthly Record'' of the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] in February 1957.

Lady Hope's story is not supported by Darwin's children. Darwin's son [[Francis Darwin]] accused her of lying, saying that "Lady Hope's account of my father's views on religion is quite untrue. I have publicly accused her of falsehood, but have not seen any reply." &lt;ref name="stephenjaygould1"/&gt; Darwin's daughter [[Henrietta Litchfield]] also called the story a fabrication, saying "I was present at his deathbed. Lady Hope was not present during his last illness, or any illness. I believe he never even saw her, but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief. He never recanted any of his scientific views, either then or earlier. We think the story of his conversion was [[Lie#Fabrication|fabricated]] in the U.S.A. The whole story has no foundation whatever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hope.html |title=Lady Hope Story |publisher=Talkorigins.org |date=23 February 1922 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep Lambertian Networks''' ('''DLN''') &lt;ref&gt;[[Yichuan Tang]] et al, ''Deep Lambartian Networks http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/dln.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; is a combination of [[Deep belief network]]  and [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian reflectance assumption]] which deals with the challenges posed by illumination variation in visual perception. Lambertian Reflectance model gives an illumination invariant representation which can be used for recognition. The Lambertian reflectance model is widely used for
modeling illumination variations and is a good approximation for diffuse object surfaces. The DLN is a hybrid undirected-directed generative model that combines DBNs with the Lambertian reflectance model.

In the DLN, the visible layer consists of image pixel intensities v ∈ R&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of pixels in the image. For every pixel i there are two [[latent variables]] namely the [[albedo]] and [[surface normal]]. GRBMs are used to model the albedo and surface normals.

Combining Deep Belief Nets with the Lambertian reflectance assumption, the model can learn good priors over the albedo from 2D images. Illumination variations can be explained by changing only the lighting latent variable. By transferring learned knowledge from similar objects, albedo and surface normals estimation from a single image is also possible. Experiments demonstrate that this model is able to generalize as well as improve over standard baselines in one-shot [[face recognition]].

The model has been successfully applied in reconstruction of shadows facial images, given any set of lighting conditions. The model has also been tested on non-living objects. The method outperforms most other methods and is faster than them.

'''Dinosaur suits''' are a type of [[costumed character]] or [[creature suit]] resembling a [[dinosaur]]. Such costumes were used in film and television and as mascots for decades, reflecting dinosaurs' prominence in [[the arts]] and [[entertainment]]. Realistic dinosaur suits also gained popularity for live shows following the success of ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs − The Arena Spectacular]]''. They are also used in theme parks and in an educational context at various museums. Inflatable dinosaur suits have been used for pranks, gags, and [[protest]]s.

Dinosaur suits were first used in early [[monster movie]]s, such as ''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]'' (1961), which featured a [[Tyrannosaurus|T-Rex]] like monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891383031|title=Dinosaurs by the Decades: A Chronology of the Dinosaur in Science and Popular Culture|last=Moore|first=Randy|publisher=|year=|isbn=0313393656|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=243|chapter=The Chronology|oclc=891383031}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to be used in films such as ''[[Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend]]'' (1985) which used [[Animatronics|animatronic]] [[brontosaurus]] suits with [[Radio control|radio-controlled]] heads,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919495873|title=The Dinosaur Filmography|last=Berry|first=Mark F.|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|isbn=1476606749|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=26|oclc=919495873}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in television series like ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'' (1991), a sitcom with a family of dinosaurs.

The film [[Jurassic Park (film)|''Jurassic Park'']] (1993) used dinosaur suits for some of the creatures, such as [[velociraptor]]s and [[Pterosaur|pterodactyls]]. In modern-day movies such as ''[[Jurassic World]]'' (2015), this was instead done using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].

In [[Children's television series|children's television]], Barney, an anthropomorphic purple dinosaur, was used in the show ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'' alongside other dinosaurs, becoming widely known in pop culture.

== Live action ==
Some sports teams have dinosaur mascots represented by costumes, such as the [[Toronto Raptors]].

For ''Walking with Dinosaurs − The Arena Spectacular'', puppet-suits of dinosaurs such as the baby T-Rex and [[Utahraptor]]s were created by Creature Technology Co. for use on stage alongside larger remote-controlled animatronics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140804/entlife/140809590/|title=Updated dinosaurs stalk America in arena show|last=Kennedy|first=Mark|work=Daily Herald|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suits had the performer's legs visible, to make the leg shape more realistic. Feathers were later added to them due to recent discoveries about dinosaur plumage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the show's ongoing popularity, these types of suits also became popular for live appearances, with and without the performer's visible legs, and including other types of suits such as two-person [[triceratops]] and [[stegosaurus]] costumes.

As part of their Jurassic Park attractions, Universal Studios created several realistic dinosaur suits for their theme parks, including [[Velociraptor]]s and a life size adult [[Triceratops]] that was also used to advertise the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/the-scene/New-Raptors-Encounter-at-Universal-318366681.html|title=New: Raptors Encounter at Universal|work=NBC Southern California|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dinosaur suits utilised in Universal studios appear to replicate the method used for the dinosaurs in the classic Jurassic Park films. They are capable of complex behaviours such as roaring, snapping, trying to eat the guests or even showing affection in ways such as rubbing their heads or noses on the guests.

Dinosaur suits created by the company Erth are used to teach students about dinosaurs at the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] in the "Dinosaur Encounters" show, including a baby triceratops and baby T-Rex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/T-Rex-Attacks-Children-at-LA-Museum.html|title=T-Rex Attacks Children at LA Museum|work=NBC Southern California|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vocalizations of the suits are made by the performers themselves through a microphone and speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-its-like-inside-a-dinosaur-94683096/|title=What It’s Like Inside a Dinosaur|last=Switek|first=Brian|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other museums also began to use dinosaur suits as attractions, such as [[THEMUSEUM]] in [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/5295291-kitchener-museum-hiring-part-time-dinosaur/|title=Kitchener museum hiring part-time dinosaur|last=Desmond|first=Paige|date=2015-01-30|work=TheRecord.com|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large group of people wearing dinosaur suits marched on Washington in 2017 to protest President [[Donald Trump]]'s defunding of national service programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upworthy.com/these-dinosaurs-may-have-pulled-off-the-most-hilarious-protest-of-president-trump-yet|title=These dinosaurs may have pulled off the most hilarious protest of President Trump yet.|work=Upworthy|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amy Joy Wroe Bechtel''' (August 4, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1838dfwy.html|title=The Doe Network: Case File 1838DFWY|website=www.doenetwork.org|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; – disappeared July 24, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://charleyproject.org/case/amy-joy-wroe-bechtel|title=Amy Joy Wroe Bechtel – The Charley Project|website=charleyproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared [[Declared death in absentia|legally dead]] 2004) is an [[Americans|American]] woman who [[list of people who disappeared mysteriously|disappeared]] while jogging in the [[Wind River Range|Wind River Mountains]] approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]], [[Wyoming]]. Despite extensive investigative work and media portrayals, her case remains unsolved {{as of|2018|lc=y}}. She was declared dead in absentia by her husband, rock climber [[Steve Bechtel]], in 2004.

==Background==
Bechtel was born Amy Joy Wroe in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; She graduated from the [[University of Wyoming]], where she met her husband, [[Steve Bechtel]].&lt;ref name=id&gt;{{cite episode|series=[[Disappeared (TV series)|Disappeared]]|network=Investigation Discovery|airdate=January 7, 2013|title=Amy Wroe Bechtel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college, Bechtel was a competitive long distance runner, and hoped to try out for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=id/&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=101}}

==Disappearance==
On the morning of July 24, 1997, Bechtel told her husband, Steve, she was planning on running several errands in town after teaching a children's weight lifting class at the Wind River Fitness Center.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=102}} She stopped at Camera Connection, a photo store near her home in Lander, around 2:30pm after teaching her class.&lt;ref name=charley/&gt;{{Sfn|Scott|2009|p=103}} Following her time at the photo store, she stopped by Gallery 331, where she spoke to the proprietor, Greg Wagner.{{Sfn|Scott|2009|p=103}} Wagner noted that Bechtel seemed hurried, and repeatedly glanced at her watch during their conversation.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=103}} Wagner's was the last confirmed sighting of Bechtel.&lt;ref name=charley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/us/a-mystery-divides-family-in-wyoming.html|work=The [[New York Times]]|title=A Mystery Divides Family in Wyoming|date=September 28, 1997|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the photo shop, it is believed by authorities that Bechtel drove to the [[Shoshone National Forest]] to practice the course of an upcoming [[10K run]] she was enrolled to compete in.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; According to an eyewitness driving on Loop Road through the forest that afternoon, a woman resembling Bechtel was seen running along the road wearing black shorts similar to those she had worn earlier that day.&lt;ref name=id/&gt;

At 4:30pm, Steve returned home after having spent the day with a friend and found his wife absent.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; At 10:30pm, he called police to report his wife [[missing person|missing]].&lt;ref name=id/&gt; At 1:00am on the morning of July 25, Bechtel's car, a white [[Toyota Tercel]], was discovered parked on a turnout at Burnt Gulch in Lander.&lt;ref name=lgg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/long-gone-girl|work=[[Runner's World]]|title=Long Gone Girl|author=Billman, John|date=August 18, 2016|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=104}}

==Investigation==
By 3:00am on July 25, 1997, an extensive search for Bechtel was underway from law enforcement, as well as Steve and the couple's friends and family.{{sfn|Scott|2009|pages=104–5}} By July 27, police were receiving roughly 1,000 calls per day with tips and potential leads in Bechtel's disappearance; additionally, various lakes and mines were searched with no results.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=105}}

Investigators initially believed Bechtel to have fallen victim to the elements or potentially been attacked by a [[bear]] or [[mountain lion]]; however, they later suspected Steve after uncovering a series of his journals describing violence towards women, and specifically, his wife.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; Detectives interrogated Steve on August 1, 1997, falsely claiming to have evidence proving he had murdered his wife; in response, Steve terminated the interview.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=108}} He would later claim the journals had comprised song lyrics he had written for his band, and that they were unrelated to Bechtel or her disappearance.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; In 1998, local police stated that Bechtel was not a central suspect in the case, but that they had wanted to clear him of suspicion in order to follow other leads, which they were unable to do after his lack of cooperation.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=109}} Steve provided an [[alibi]] for the time of Bechtel's disappearance, which was corroborated by friends who agreed they had spent the afternoon with him rock climbing.&lt;ref name=lgg/&gt; However, he refused to submit to a [[polygraph]] test.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=110}} Additionally, a woman driving through the area from where Bechtel disappeared claimed to have seen a truck matching Steve's in the area.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=110}}

In late August 1997, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] requested satellite photos from [[NASA]] of the area on the day of Bechtel's disappearance, but the satellite images provided no information.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=112}} In January 1998, satellite images taken by the Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' were also obtained by the FBI, but they also revealed nothing of note.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=114}}

===Later developments===
In June 2003, a [[Timex Group|Timex]] Iron Man [[Watch#Digital|digital watch]] was discovered by a doctor hiking near the Popo Agie River and was turned in to police. It was noted to be similar to a watch Bechtel had owned at the time of her disappearance; however, law enforcement was unable to determine whether or not the watch belonged to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/possible-clue-found-to-woman-missing-6-years|work=The Denver Channel|title= Possible Clue Found To Woman Missing 6 Years|date=June 24, 2003|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 interview with the ''[[Billings Gazette]]'', Sheriff Sgt. Roger Rizor stated: "I believe it was a [[homicide]], and I believe what happened to her happened on the day she disappeared. In my mind there is only one person that I want to talk to, only one person who has refused to talk to law enforcement, and that's her husband."&lt;ref name=bg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming/sheriff-believes-amy-wroe-bechtel-was-victim-of-killer/article_5c2b29d9-de5f-54b9-b0cb-a93aff383668.html|work=[[Billings Gazette]]|title=Sheriff believes Amy Wroe Bechtel was victim of killer|author=Tuttle, Greg|date=June 21, 2007|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lil' Miss murder|Dale Wayne Eaton]], a convicted murderer on Wyoming's death row, has also been cited as a suspect in the case. According to Eaton's brother, he had been near the area where Bechtel disappeared at the time of her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.county10.com/2013/03/05/amy-wroe-bechtel-disappearance-takes-new-turn-prime-suspect-on-wyomings-death-row/|work=County 10 |title=Amy Wroe Bechtel disappearance takes new turn; Prime suspect on Wyoming's Death Row|author=Over, Ernie|date=March 6, 2013|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eaton has refused to discuss the case.&lt;ref name=charley/&gt;

==Media depictions==
Bechtel's case received significant media attention.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; On February 3, 1998, Steve appeared on ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|The Geraldo Rivera Show]]'' with Bechtel's sisters, who pleaded with him to provide information regarding her disappearance.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=115}}&lt;ref name=cst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/amy-wroe-bechtel-case-timeline/article_f289eca2-a639-5a75-a565-814f41b5249c.html|work=[[Casper Star Tribune]]|title=Amy Wroe Bechtel case timeline|date=July 22, 2007|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve denied any involvement in his wife's disappearance during the program.&lt;ref name=id/&gt;

The case was profiled in both ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|title=Into Thin Air|url=http://people.com/archive/into-thin-air-vol-49-no-11/|volume=49|number=11|author=Tresnowski, Alex|date=March 23, 1998|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1829016/long-gone|work=[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]|title=Long Gone|date=March 1, 1998|author1=Di Salvatore, Bryan|author2=McNamer, Deirdre|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the television series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unsolved.com/gallery/amy-bechtel/|work=Unsolved.com|title=Amy Wroe Bechtel|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later profiled on the series ''[[Disappeared (TV series)|Disappeared]]'' in 2013,&lt;ref name=id/&gt; and was also the subject of an extensive article featured in ''[[Runner's World]]'' in 2016.&lt;ref name=lgg/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1446">'''Dorjeban''', [[courtesy name]] '''Weizhong''' was a Mongolian politician of [[Yuan dynasty]] China. He was a descendant of [[Muqali]] and a member of the ruling house of [[Jalairs]]

Dorjeban had a high level knowledge of [[Classical Chinese]] language and was a devoted Confucian scholar. He was appointed the [[Investigating censor]] in 1333. In 1341, he became a scholar of [[Hanlin Academy]]. Later he served as the governor of [[Liaoyang Province]].

In the 1350s, farmers of [[Henan province]] started their riot against the dynasty because of years of famine. The imperial court interpreted the riot as a racial conflict instead of an economic one. Some Mongols suggested a genocide of Chinese civilians. Dorjeban strongly opposed this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social castes of Yuan dynasty|last=Meng|first=Siming|publisher=上海人民出版社|year=2006|isbn=9787208063914|location=Shanghai|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorjeban's sympathy towards rioters angered prime minister [[Toqto'a (Yuan dynasty)|Toqto'a]]. He was then relocated to Shanxi province as an investigating censor. He built roads to facilitate traffic and recruited volunteers to fight for the dynasty. He died on his term in Huguang province as a governor. Aged 40.&lt;ref&gt;History of Yuan vol.139&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund Fessenden Cobb''' (June 23, 1892 &amp;ndash; August 15, 1974) was an American actor. He appeared in 623 films between 1912 and 1966. 

==Biography==
Cobb was born in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], the son of William Henry Cobb and Edwinna Ross.&lt;ref name="ci"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallinghouse |first1=Scott |title=Edmund Cobb: From Wild West Shows to Television |journal=Classic Images |date=May 2018 |issue=515 |pages=60-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather, [[Edmund G. Ross]],&lt;ref name="egr"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ruddy |first1=Richard A. |title=Edmund G. Ross: Soldier, Senator, Abolitionist |date=2013 |publisher=UNM Press |isbn=9780826353757 |page=293 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wc9AAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=Edmund+Ross+Cobb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SDdCvrjMS6&amp;sig=4exBpgusecpM6CSI4QI082iS5pU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjksf-aq8rbAhUJWa0KHUuWCggQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Edmund%20Ross%20Cobb&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a newspaper editor, a governor of the New Mexico territory, a senator from Kansas, and a leader in the abolitionist movement in the United States.{{r|egr|page1=ix}} 

Despite his grandfather's efforts to lead Cobb into a career in politics, an initial effort in acting in a locally produced play turned him in that direction for a career. When he was 18, he worked for the St. Louis Motion Picture Company when it made a film in Albuquerque. Other roles with other companies followed.&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katchmer |first1=George A. |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Silent Film Western Actors and Actresses |date=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476609058 |pages=65-66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VnGeCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22Edmund+Cobb%22+actor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB69uLqcrbAhVOiqwKHZYCDWcQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Edmund%20Cobb%22%20actor&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest roles was a bit part in the [[Essanay Studios]] film ''A Pueblo Legend'' (1912).&lt;ref name="eafs"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Geoff |title=Encyclopedia of American Film Serials |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786477623 |pages=75-76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CYSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Edmund+Cobb%22+actor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB69uLqcrbAhVOiqwKHZYCDWcQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Edmund%20Cobb%22%20actor&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gilled lungfish''' (''Protopterus amphibius''), also known as the '''East African lungfish''', is a species of [[African lungfish]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{Fishbase|Protopterus|amphibius|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in swamps and flood plains of East Africa, where positively identified from [[Kenya]], [[Somalia]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; Records from [[Tanzania]] require confirmation&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; and may be the result of [[Introduced species|introductions]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Description==
''Protopterus amphibius'' generally only reaches a length of {{convert|44|cm|in|abbr=on}}, making it the smallest [[Extant taxon|extant]] lungfish.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.primitivefishes.com/Gilled%20African%20Lungfish.htm Primitive Fishes.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211022858/http://www.primitivefishes.com/Gilled%20African%20Lungfish.htm |date=2008-12-11 }} (Retrieved Feb. 19, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; This lungfish is uniform blue, or slate grey in colour. It has small or inconspicuous black spots and a pale grey belly.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; Like all [[Protopteridae|African lungfish]] it has two lungs and is an obligate air-breather.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also like all other African lungfish it is able to burrow and form a mucous cocoon for protection in a process known as [[estivation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Habitat ==
The gilled lungfish is a primarily [[Demersal fish|demersal]] fish, living largely within the riverbeds of the [[Zambezi River]] system of East Africa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kenyan Lungfish (Protopterus amphibius) - Information on Kenyan Lungfish - Encyclopedia of Life|url = http://eol.org/pages/217169/overview|website = Encyclopedia of Life|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inhabits similar areas in the wetlands of the region.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Protopterus amphibius (East-coast Lungfish)|url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/182130/0|website = www.iucnredlist.org|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
The gilled lungfish is listed as Least Concern, partially because reported numbers are high and partially because of the lack of data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is eaten for food by some natives of the area however the numbers lost to this practice are very small.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; More dangerous threats are the damming of the Zambezi, which will reduce the size of the delta in which the fish live, and pollution in areas that the fish inhabit&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; as well as encroachment of [[wetland]]s for agriculture that reduces the available habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Joanna of Bourbon''' (3 February 1338 &amp;ndash; 6 February 1378) &lt;ref&gt;[[Julian calendar]]&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Queen of France]] by marriage to [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]]. She acted as his political adviser and was appointed potential regent in case of a minor regency. 

==Life==
===Early life===
Born in the [[Château de Vincennes]], Joanna was a daughter of [[Peter I, Duke of Bourbon]], and [[Isabella of Valois (1313-1388)|Isabella of Valois]], a half-sister of [[Philip VI of France]].

From October 1340 through at least 1343, negotiations and treaties were made for her to marry [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy]]. The goal was to bring [[Savoy]] more closely into French influence. {{sfn|Cox|1967|p=57}}

===Queen===
On 8 April 1350, she married her cousin, the future [[Charles V of France]], at [[Tain-l'Hermitage]]. Born thirteen days apart, they both were 12 years old. When Charles ascended the throne in 1364, Joanna became [[List of French consorts|queen of France]]. 

Queen Joanna and Charles V had somewhat of a strained relationship during his tenure as dauphin because of his infidelity with [[Biette de Casinel]], but their relationship improved when after he became King, and reportedly, he sometime confided in her in political and cultural issues and relied on her advice.&lt;ref name="Tuchman, Barbara W"&gt; Tuchman, Barbara W, En Fjärran Spegel. Det stormiga 1300-talet. Atlantis, Stockholm, 1994. {{ISBN|91-7486-260-X}}, sid 304 &lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, Joanna was rumored to have taken the poet [[Hippolyte de Saint-Alphon]] for a lover, who was the biological father of her child John, who was born and died in 1366.&lt;ref name="Tuchman, Barbara W"/&gt;

Queen Joanna was described as mentally fragile, and after the birth of her son Louis in 1372, she suffered a complete mental breakdown.&lt;ref name="Tuchman, Barbara W"/&gt; This deeply worried Charles V, who made a pilgrimage and offered many prayers for her recovery.&lt;ref name="Tuchman, Barbara W"/&gt; When she did recover and regained her normal state of mind in 1373, Charles V appointed her legal guardian and regent of France should he die when his son and heir was still a minor.&lt;ref name="Tuchman, Barbara W"/&gt;

===Death and burial===
Joanna died at the royal residence [[Hôtel Saint-Pol]] in Paris, on 6 February 1378 (1377 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), &lt;ref&gt; ''Les chroniques de sire Jean Froissart...'' avec notes par J.A.C. Buchon, Tome II, A. Desrez Libraire-Editeur, Paris, 1835, p. 19. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29760b/f25.item.zoom]&lt;/ref&gt; three days after her 40th birthday, and two days after the birth of her youngest child, [[Catherine of Valois (1378-1388)|Catherine]]. [[Jean Froissart|Froissart]]&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Buchon, ''Collection des Chroniques nationales françaises écrites en langue vulgaire du treizième au seizième siècle, Chroniques de Froissart'', Tome VII, Verdière, Libraire, Paris, 1824, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; recorded that Joanna took a bath against her physicians' advice. Soon after, she went into labour and died two days after giving birth. The king was devastated. Her heart was buried in the [[Cordeliers Convent]] and her entrails in the [[Couvent des Célestins]]. The ''Couvent des Célestins'' in Paris was the most important royal necropolis after the [[Basilica of St Denis]]. The rest of her remains were then placed at Saint-Denis.

==Issue==
Joanna and Charles had nine children. Two of them reached adulthood:

# Joanna (September 1357 – 21 October 1360), interred at [[Saint-Antoine-des-Champs Abbey]].
# Bonne (1358 – 7 December 1360, Paris, France), interred beside her older sister.
# John (Vincennes, 6 June 1366 – 21 December 1366), interred at [[Saint Denis Basilica]].
# [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] (3 December 1368 – 22 October 1422), King of France.
# Marie (Paris, 27 February 1370 – June 1377, Paris).
# [[Louis of Valois, Duke of Orleans|Louis]] (13 March 1372 – 23 November 1407), Duke of Orléans.
# Isabella (Paris, 24 July 1373 – 13 February 1377, Paris).
# John (1374/76 – died young).&lt;ref&gt;His existence is disputed.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Catherine of Valois (1378-1388)|Catherine]] (Paris, 4 February 1378 – November 1388), interred at Abbaye De Maubuisson; married [[John de Valois, Count of Montpensier|John of Berry]], [[Montpensier|Count of Montpensier]] (son of [[John, Duke of Berry]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">'''Bishop Joasaph''' (secular name '''Ivan Ilyich Bolotov''', {{lang-ru|Иоанн Ильич Болотов}}; 22 January 1761 – May 1799) was a Russian Orthodox missionary, bishop of Kodiak, vicar of Irkutsk diocese.

He came to [[Alaska]] as the leader of a group of [[Missionary|missionaries]] from the [[Valaam Monastery]] in 1794. Under very primitive conditions he and his [[monastic]] companions established the foundations of an [[Orthodox Church in America|Orthodox presence in North America]]. Called to [[Irkutsk]], he was consecrated the [[auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], but did not survive a shipwreck on his return to Alaska.

==Life==
''Ivan Ilyich Bolotov'' (Russian Иоанн Ильич Болотов) was born on January 22, 1761, in the village of Strazhkov in the Kashin district of the [[Tver province|province of Tver]]. His father was the local [[priest]] in the village. His early education was at the [[ecclesiastical]] school at the [[monastery]] in Kashin. His education continued at the [[seminary|seminaries]] in Tver and [[Yaroslavl]], graduating with honors. After graduating he taught at the [[Uglich]] ecclesiastical school for the next four years. Deciding to enter a monastic life he joined the [[Tolga Monastery]] where he received his [[tonsure]] in 1786 and was given the name of ''Joasaph''.

Subsequently, he moved to a monastery in Uglich and then on to the Valaam. The dates of his [[ordination]] as a [[deacon]] and as a priest are not known. He was raised to the rank of [[archimandrite]] in 1783. When the call for assembling a missionary team to travel to remote Alaska was made, Fr. Joasaph was selected to lead the team based upon his accomplishments as a monastic. The team of ten consisted of Fr. Joasaph as leader, four [[hieromonk]]s, a [[hierodeacon]], two [[monk]]s, and two servitors. ([[#Sources|Chevigny]] 65)

The journey to Alaska took them ten months, nearly a year, before arriving in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], on September 24, 1794. There, they found conditions not as represented to them by [[Grigorii Ivanovich Shelikhov]], the promoter of the Alaskan enterprise. The village on Kodiak was more primitive than described and the church that was promised was not there. The monastics found many abuses between the Russians and the natives in the village about which Fr. Joasaph was compelled to report to the state and church authorities in Russia. Thus, an antagonistic environment grew between [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexander Baranov]], the village leader, and Fr. Joasaph and his missionaries.

Notwithstanding the adverse conditions, Fr. Joasaph and his party of monks were very successful in evangelizing the natives and expanded their preaching and efforts to the mainland. Yet, reaching out to the natives involved dangers. Witness the [[martyr]]dom of Fr. [[Juvenaly of Alaska|Juvenaly]] in 1796.

In reviewing the situation of the mission, in 1796, the [[Holy Synod]] created an [[auxiliary see]] in Alaska and elected Fr. Joasaph as Bishop of Kodiak. It was 1798 before news and instructions for his elevation reached him.  For his elevation to bishop, Fr. Joasaph needed to return to [[Irkutsk]], where he was consecrated on April 10, 1799. Bp. Joasaph's consecration was unusual in that, due to the isolation of Irkutsk from the Holy Synod, the Holy Synod provided instructions for Benjamin, [[Bishop of Irkutsk]], to perform the consecration of Fr. Joasaph alone. Thus was recorded the only known situation in the history of the [[Church of Russia]] where an episcopal consecration was conducted by a single bishop.

Bp. Joasaph was not to reach his new see as the perils of travel in the northern seas would result in his death. Bp. Joasaph and his companions, Hieromonk Makary and Hierodeacon Stephan, perished as their ship ''Phoenix'' met with a serious storm and sank near the Alaskan coast during May 21 to 24, 1799. The ship was also carrying an important cargo of both people and supplies for the Kodiak colony. Thus, its loss seriously set back both the Orthodox mission in Alaska and the colony. The Holy Synod took no action to replace Bp. Joasaph and in 1811 officially closed the Kodiak episcopal see. It would be some thirty years before another hierarch would be named to Alaska.

'''John Stewart''' (23 May 1868 – 30 August 1927) was an Australian businessman and politician who briefly represented the [[Electoral district of Claremont|seat of Claremont]] in the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Western Australia]], from 1917 to 1918.

Stewart was born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], to Jeannie (née Moore) and Bruce Stewart. He arrived in Western Australia in the 1890s, and by 1897 was working as an accountant in [[Fremantle]]. In 1900, he founded a produce firm, John Stewart &amp; Co., and subsequently became prominent in Fremantle's mercantile sector, serving as a president of the [[Fremantle Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Black, David, and Bolton, Geoffrey (1990). ''[http://ncb.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/Bio%20Register%20of%20WA%20MPs%20Vol.1%201870-1930.pdf Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia: Volume One (1870–1930)]'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Western Australian state election, 1914|1914 state election]], Stewart unsuccessfully contested the [[Electoral district of Fremantle|seat of Fremantle]] as a [[Western Australian Liberal Party (1911–1917)|Liberal]] candidate, opposing the [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor]] government of [[John Scaddan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28569744 "MR. J. STEWART'S CANDIDATURE."] – ''The West Australian'', 3 October 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; He was defeated by Labor's [[William Carpenter (Australian politician)|William Carpenter]], the sitting member, placing second (in front of another Liberal candidate) with 29.40 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44749296 "MR. CARPENTER ELECTED."] – ''The Western Mail'', 23 October 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong supporter of the war effort against Germany, Stewart resigned from the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce in June 1916 to protest its apparent unwillingness to bar "persons of enemy birth" from membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37435498 "MR. JOHN STEWART RESIGNS."] – ''The Western Mail'', 16 June 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in local [[Presbyterian Church of Australia|Presbyterian]] circles, he was a member of the boards of [[Scotch College, Perth|Scotch College]] and [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Perth|Presbyterian Ladies' College]], each located in the seat of Claremont. Stewart stood for that electorate at the [[Western Australian state election, 1917|1917 election]], running as one of three [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27309797 "MR JOHN STEWART'S CANDIDATURE."] – ''The West Australian'', 29 August 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; He placed second on first preferences, but on the [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-candidate-preferred vote]] eventually won on a majority of just two votes, following a recount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37996524 "MR. STEWART SUCCESSFUL"] – ''The Western Mail'', 5 October 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's time in parliament, however, was short-lived, as he resigned due to ill-health less than a year after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27487444 "RESIGNATION OF MR. STEWART."] – ''The West Australian'', 21 August 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81365317 "MR. JOHN STEWART, M.L.A. RESIGNS CLAREMONT SEAT."] – ''The Daily News'' ([[Perth]]), 20 August 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Claremont state by-election, 1918|resulting by-election]] was won by another Nationalist, [[Thomas Duff (politician)|Thomas Duff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92744262 "CLAREMONT BY-ELECTION"] – ''Kalgoorlie Miner'', 14 September 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart had married Lily Berry Tate in June 1897 in Fremantle, and the couple went on to have four sons and a daughter together.&lt;ref name="black"/&gt; Later becoming residents of [[Cottesloe, Western Australia|Cottesloe]], the couple left for an extended tour of Europe in 1926. On the return voyage to Australia, on the [[SS Narkunda|SS ''Narkunda'']] in late August 1927, they were at sea near [[Gibraltar]] when Stewart jumped from a porthole wearing only his pyjamas. Both he and an engineer who had dived after him were drowned, and an inquest returned a verdict of suicide, brought on by "acute insomnia and [[neurasthenia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58333422 "COTTESLOE RESIDENT DROWNED"] – ''The Sunday Times'', 4 September 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 59 at the time of his death, Stewart was eulogised in ''[[The West Australian]]'' as a "capable business man" and "generous donor", "possessing gifts above the average".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32049773 "SUICIDE AT SEA."] – ''The West Australian'', 1 September 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3320">[[Image:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|The ka statue, here that of pharaoh [[Hor]], provided a physical place for the ka to manifest.]]
A '''ka statue''' is a type of [[ancient Egypt]]ian statue intended to provide a resting place for the ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' (life-force or spirit) of the person after death. The ancient Egyptians believed the ''ka'' along with the physical body, the name, the ''ba'' (personality or soul), and the ''šwt'' (shadow), made up the five aspects of a person.

==Purpose and use==
After death, the ethereal aspects of the soul were believed to be released from the body, free to roam the earth, but required the physical body or a surrogate, such as the ka statue, to return to as a permanent home.

Ka statues could also be set up as a type of memorial for the deceased ''in absentia''; for example in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] hundreds were set up to allow the dead to participate in the yearly festivals commemorating the resurrection of [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakes (2003) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ancient Egyptians believed statues could magically perceive the world, they were ceremonially brought to life by priests in a special ritual called the [[Opening of the mouth ceremony]]. In the full version of this ceremony, the mouth, eyes, nose, and ears could be touched with ritual implements to give the statue the power of breath, sight, smell, and hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes (2003) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
{{Hiero | ''ka''| &lt;hiero&gt;D28&lt;/hiero&gt; | align=left | era=default}}
Ka statues were usually carved from wood or stone and sometimes painted in the likeness of the owner to reinforce the spiritual connection and preserve the person's memory for eternity.  Many ka statues were placed in a purpose-built mortuary chapel or niche, which could be covered with appropriate inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin (1995) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most ancient Egyptian statuary, ka statues display a rigid frontalism in which the body faces squarely forward in a formal way.  Whether seated or standing, their posture reflects the need for the statue to "see" the real world in front of them and conform to an ideal standard of beauty and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Robins (1998) pages 19, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] representing the ''ka'' is composed of a pair of upraised arms. It is sometimes depicted on top of the head of the statue to reinforce its intended purpose.

A '''lateral pontine syndrome''' is a lesion which is similar to the [[lateral medullary syndrome]], but because it occurs in the [[pons]], it also involves the [[cranial nerve nuclei]] of the pons.

==Symptoms==
Damage to the following areas produces symptoms (from medial to lateral):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure affected
! Effect
|-
| [[Lateral spinothalamic tract]]
| Contralateral loss of pain and temperature from the trunk and extremities.
|-
| [[Facial nucleus]] &amp; facial Nerve (CN.VII)
| '''(1)''' Ipsilateral paralysis of the upper and lower face ([[lower motor neuron lesion]]). '''(2)''' Ipsilateral loss of lacrimation and reduced salivation. '''(3)''' Ipsilateral loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. '''(4)''' Loss of corneal reflex (efferent limb).
|-
| [[Spinal trigeminal nucleus]] and tract
| Ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation from the face (facial hemianesthesia)
|-
| Vestibular Nuclei and intraaxial nerve fibers

'''''Le Jeu de la Mort''''' ''(The Game of Death)'' is a [[France|French]]/[[Switzerland|Swiss]] television [[documentary]] broadcast by the French public television channel [[France 2]]. It was presented as a [[social commentary]] on the effects of obeying orders and humiliation in [[reality television]], and its broadcast was followed by a studio discussion on the programme.&lt;ref name="bbc-jeudelamort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8573755.stm|title=Row over 'torture' on French TV|last=Chazan|first=David|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary focused on a modern version of the [[Milgram experiment]], with the additional factor of reality television's popularity and influence on the general public. The experiment was performed in the guise of a [[game show]] known as ''La Zone Xtrême''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="91797">This article lists the people who have been fatally injured in [[American open-wheel car racing|American Championship car racing]] during testing, practice, qualifying, or races since 1916, categorized into drivers, [[riding mechanic]]s, and non-participants.  The lists show "IndyCar" or "Champ Car" fatalities that occurred in events making up the National Championship, which has been held by the following sanctioning bodies:

*[[AAA Contest Board|American Automobile Association]] (1916, 1920–1941, 1946–1955)
*[[United States Auto Club]] (1956–1995)
*[[Champ Car|Championship Auto Racing Teams]] (1979–2007)
*[[IndyCar|Indy Racing League]] (since 1996)

The National Championship, which was split from 1979 to 2007, has featured regular races, non-points paying (non-championship) rounds, competitions sanctioned by entities that did not stage the National Championship in the same year (such as the [[Automobile Club of America]]), and the AAA [[Sprint car racing|Big car]] meetings held in the [[1946 AAA Championship Car season|1946 season]].

The most recent driver to be killed in an [[IndyCar Series]] event was [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] at the [[2015 ABC Supply 500]].

'''Loculus''' ([[Latin]], "little place"), plural ''loculi'', is an architectural compartment or [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] that houses a body, as in a [[catacomb]], [[hypogeum]], [[mausoleum]] or other place of entombment. In [[classical antiquity]], the mouth of the loculus might be closed with a slab,&lt;ref&gt;Katherine M. D. Dunbabin, ''The Roman Banquet: Images of Conviviality'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; plain, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], or [[Palmyrene funerary reliefs|sculptural]], as in the family tombs of ancient [[Palmyra]].

==Early life and career==
Max Freedom Long was born on October 26, 1890, in [[Sterling, Colorado]] to Toby Albert Long and his wife Jessie Diffendaffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Passport Applications Filed at U.S. Territories and Possessions, 1907-1925: Volume 8|url= |location= Honolulu, HI|publisher= Department of State|page= 2525|date= 1924|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 1910 census he was working as a photographer in his hometown, and was living with his grandfather's household with his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | url = https://archive.org/stream/13thcensus1910po0122unit#page/n691/mode/2up| title = Thirteenth Census of the United States| year = 1910| location = Sterling, Logan County, CO| roll = | page = 159 | line = 5| enumdist = 245| filmnum = 0112| nafilm = | accessdate = 23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[History of the University of California, Los Angeles|Los Angeles State Normal School]] from September 1914 to June 1916, and graduated with an Associate of Arts (two-year) degree in General Education.&lt;ref name="Chai, p. 102"&gt;Chai, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he worked briefly as an auto-mechanic in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards,|url= |location= Los Angeles, California |publisher= National Archives and Record Administration|page= |date= 1917|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Long moved to the island of [[Hawaii]] to teach in elementary schools around the big island.&lt;ref name="Chai, p. 102"&gt;Chai, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved to Honolulu in 1920 and lived there until 1932, where he worked in and later owned a photography store. In 1920, he married an English woman named Jane Jessie Rae, who was the proprietor of the Hotel Davenport in Honolulu. When he arrived in Hawaii, he claimed that some [[Native Hawaiians]] were practicing what he called [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Long wrote that at first he was skeptical of this magic, but later became convinced that it worked.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  He devoted the rest of his life to creating theories about how the Native Hawaiians did what he claimed they did, and teaching those theories through the sale of books and newsletters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the mid-1930s, Long relocated to [[Orange County, California]] and began to focus on writing books inspired by his experiences in Hawaii. He married a second time while in California.

==Invention of Huna==

Long decided to call his compilation of teachings [[Huna (New Age)|Huna]], because one meaning of the word is "hidden secret."&lt;ref&gt;Pukui and Ebert ''Hawaiian Dictionary''(University of Hawaii, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that he derived it from the word [[kahuna]], who were priests and master craftsmen who ranked near the top of the social scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/kona/historyg.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Long published a series of books on Huna starting in 1936, and founded an organization called the Huna Fellowship in 1945.

There are no accepted Hawaiian sources - Malo,&lt;ref&gt;David Malo, ''Hawaiian Antiquities'' (Bishop Museum, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; Kamakau,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Kamakau, ''The People of Old'' (Bishop Museum, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; 'I'i,&lt;ref&gt;John Papa 'I'i, ''Fragments of Hawaiian History'' (Bishop Museum, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kepelino]]&lt;ref&gt;Martha Beckwith, ''Kepelino's Traditions of Hawaii'' (Bishop Museum, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; - that refer to the word Huna as a tradition of esoteric learning.

Max Freedom Long wrote that he obtained many of his case studies and his ideas about what to look for in kahuna magic from the Director of the [[Bishop Museum]] in Honolulu, [[William Brigham]]. There is no credible evidence that the two men met. Even if they did, Brigham was not an expert on kahunas and did not document in his own writings any of the incidents Long ascribed to him, including walking on hot lava. In his letters and manuscripts, Brigham stated that Hawaiians were "an inferior race," and implied they were lazy. He referred to Queen Lili'uokalani as a "she devil," "squaw," and "nigger."&lt;ref&gt;Chai, Makana Risser. "Huna, Max Freedom Long, and the Idealization of William Brigham," ''The Hawaiian Journal of History,'' Vol. 45 (2011) pp. 101-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Hawaiian scholar Charles Kenn, a [[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]] recognized in the Hawaiian community as a ''kahuna'' and expert in Hawaiian history and traditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Stone| first = Scott S.C.| authorlink = | title = ''Living Treasures of Hawaii 25th Anniversary of the Selections of Outstanding Persons as Honored by The Honpa Honwanji Mission of Hawai'i'' | publisher = Island Heritage| year = 2000| location = Honolulu| pages = 24| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; was friendly with Max Freedom Long but said, "While this Huna study is an interesting study, … it is not, and never was Hawaiian." &lt;ref name="Lee 1999 56"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lee| first = Pali Jae| authorlink = | title = ''Ho`opono''| publisher = Night Rainbow Publishing| year = 1999| location = Honolulu | pages = 56| url = | doi = | id = | oclc =43454305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiian author Pali Jae Lee, a research librarian at the Bishop Museum, conducted extensive research on Max Freedom Long and Huna. She concluded, based on her interviews with Hawaiian elders, "Huna is not Hawaiian." Lee cites Theodore Kelsey, a [[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]] renowned for his work as a Hawaiian translator who wrote a letter to Long in 1936 (now in the Hawai'i State Archives) criticizing his use of the terms "unihipili" and "aumakua."&lt;ref name="Lee 1999 56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lee| first = Pali Jae| authorlink = | title = ''Ho`opono - Revised Edition: The Hawaiian Way to Put Things Back in Balance''| publisher = IM Publishing| year = 2007| location = Mountain View, HI| pages = 89–93| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-9677253-7-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Lisa Kahaleole Hall writes that Huna "bears absolutely no resemblance to any Hawaiian worldview or spiritual practice" and calls it part of the "New Age spiritual industry."&lt;ref&gt;"'Hawaiian at Heart' and Other Fictions," The Contemporary Pacific, Volume 17, Number 2, 404-413, © 2005 by University of Hawai'i Press
http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/13881/v17n2-404-413-dialogue2.pdf?sequence=1
&lt;/ref&gt; Huna books have been called "examples of [[cultural appropriation]]."&lt;ref name="Chai, p. 102"/&gt;

==Later life==
Max Freedom Long stopped issuing bulletins in late 1970 due to poor health. He died at his home in [[Vista, California]] on September 23, 1971 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to his head. He had been suffering from a bone cancer for a few years at that time, and was in constant pain in his final months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maxfreedomlong.com/articles/max-freedom-long-died/ |title= MAX FREEDOM LONG DIED SEPT. 23, 1971|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2009 |website= Maxfreedomlong.com|publisher= |access-date= 23 May 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a believer in [[voluntary euthanasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maxfreedomlong.com/articles/remembering-max-freedom-long/ |title= REMEMBERING MAX FREEDOM LONG (1971)|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2009 |website= Maxfreedomlong.com|publisher= |access-date= 23 May 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Max Freedom Long Library and Museum==
Prior to his death, Long's papers and library became part of the Max Freedom Long Library and Museum at the Huna Research Center at [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. It was established by a student named Dolly Ware, who inherited Long's library. After Dolly Ware's death in 2012, parts of it were sold to antiquarian book dealers. Other parts of the collection became the possession of E. Otha Wingo, who was a direct successor of Long's Huna tradition. Parts of the collection of the original Library and Museum have since been reconstituted at [[Valdosta State University]]'s Archives and Special Collections as part of their New Age Movements, Occultism, and Spiritualism Research Library. The remaining pieces are being sought by the curator of the collection Guy Frost of Valdosta State University's [[Odum Library]].

'''Mayhem''' is a [[common law]] [[criminal offense]] consisting of the intentional [[maiming]] of another person.

Under the law of [[England and Wales]] and other common law jurisdictions, it originally consisted of the intentional and wanton removal of a body part that would handicap a person's ability to defend themself in [[combat]]. Under the strict common law definition, initially this required damage to an eye or a limb, while cutting off an ear or a nose was deemed not sufficiently disabling. Later the meaning of the crime expanded to encompass any mutilation, disfigurement, or crippling act done using any instrument.

==In England==

===History of definitions===
{{update|type=section|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- See talk page, section "Abolition in England and Wales" --&gt;
In England and Wales, it has fallen into disuse. In 1992 [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|the Law Commission]] recommended that it be abolished,&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission, Consultation Paper No.122, Offences Against the Person and General Principles, Appendix A, Draft Criminal Law Bill, clause 31(1)(a)(iii) at page 90 of the report [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1992/c122.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1998 the [[Home Office]] proposed to abolish it, in the course of codifying the law relating to [[offences against the person]].&lt;ref&gt;The Home Office. 1998. Violence: Reforming the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. {{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-1998-violence-reforming-law/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227012915/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-1998-violence-reforming-law/ |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }} Draft Offences Against the Person Bill, clause 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fetter v. Beale''===
The most significant change in common-law mayhem doctrine came in 1697, when the King's Bench decided ''Fetter v. Beale'', 91 Eng. Rep. 1122. There, the plaintiff recovered in a battery action against a defendant. Shortly thereafter, "part of his skull by reason of the said battery came out of his head", and the plaintiff brought a subsequent action under mayhem. Though ''Fetter'' is also known as an early example of [[res judicata]], it is most significant for expanding the ambit of mayhem to include "loss of the skull".

==The modern doctrine==
In modern times, the offense of mayhem has been superseded in many [[jurisdiction]]s by statutorily defined offenses such as [[aggravated battery]].

==In the United States==
Modern statutes in the U.S. define mayhem as disabling or disfiguring, such as rendering useless a member of another person's arms or legs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=203. Cal. Pen. Code Sec. 203]&lt;/ref&gt; The injury must be permanent, not just a temporary loss.  Some courts will hold even a minor battery as mayhem if the injury is not minor.  Mayhem in the U.S. is a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dix |first=George E. |year=2010 |title=Gilbert Law Summaries on Criminal Law |publisher=Thomson/West |isbn=978-0-314-19430-5 |pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Both the noun "mayhem" and the verb "[[:wiktionary:maim|maim]]" come from [[Old French]] via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]].  The word is first attested in various [[Romance languages]] in the 13th century, but its ultimate origin is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third edition, June 2000; online version June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For one hypothesis about its origin, see [[wiktionary:mayhem|the Wiktionary entry for this word]].

==Other uses==
Mayhem can describe a person going on a [[Killing spree|rampage]]. Popular misunderstanding of the common [[journalese]] expression "[[rioting]] and mayhem" caused the common usual modern use of "mayhem" to mean "havoc and disorder", often with humorous overtones.

'''Nutty Putty Cave''' is a [[hydrothermal]] [[cave]] located west of [[Utah Lake]] in [[Utah County, Utah|Utah County]], [[Utah]], [[United States]].

The cave, first explored in 1960 by Dale Green, is currently owned by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705347362/Man-trapped-in-Utah-Countyaposs-Nutty-Putty-cave-dies.html?pg=3 "Man trapped in Utah County's Nutty Putty cave dies", ''The Deseret News'',26 Nov 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and managed by the Utah Timpanogos Grotto.

In the recent past this cave has had four rescues of cavers and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], who became stuck inside the cave's tight twists, turns, and crawls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuttyputtycave.com/history.html#Timeline NuttyPuttyCave Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, an effort was put forth to study and severely limit the number of visitors allowed inside the cave. It was estimated the cave was receiving over 5,000 visitors per year, with many visitors often entering the cave late at night and failing to take proper safety precautions. The cave’s popularity had caused excessive smoothing of the rock inside the cave to the point it was predicted a fatality would occur in one of the cave's more prominent features, a 45-degree room called "The Big Slide". On May 24, 2006, a [[cave gate|gate]] was installed, and the cave was temporarily closed. In early 2009, proper management was established and an application process was developed to ensure safety precautions were being met. On May 18, 2009 the cave was reopened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuttyputtycave.com/access.html NuttyPuttyCave Access Presentation Page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 24, 2009, John Edward Jones died after being trapped in the cave for 28 hours.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1128/p02s07-usgn.html|title= Nutty Putty Cave to be closed for good after trapped caver's death|author= Farrell, Michael B. | date= 2009-11-27 | work = The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate = March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rescuers concluded that it would be too dangerous to attempt to retrieve his body; the landowner and Jones' family came to an agreement that the cave should be permanently closed with the body sealed inside.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt; A film about the tragedy called ''[[The Last Descent]]'' was released on September 16, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9333">On Friday, 14 September 2007, '''ORB International''', an independent polling agency located in London, published '''estimates of the total war casualties in Iraq''' since the [[Iraq War|US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003]].&lt;ref name=ORB&gt;[http://www.zcommunications.org/more-than-1-000-000-iraqis-murdered-since-2003-invasion-by-orb "More than 1,000,000 Iraqis murdered"]. September 2007. Opinion Research Business.&lt;/ref&gt; At over 1.2 million deaths (1,220,580), this estimate is the highest number published so far. From the poll margin of error of +/-2.5% ORB calculated a range of 733,158 to 1,446,063 deaths. The ORB estimate was performed by a random survey of 1,720 adults aged 18+, out of which 1,499 responded, in fifteen of the eighteen governorates within Iraq, between August 12 and August 19, 2007.&lt;ref name=LAtimes&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/09/14/3839/ "Poll: Civilian Death Toll in Iraq May Top 1 Million"].

By Peter Beaumont and Joanna Walters. 16 September 2007. ''[[The Observer|The Observer (UK)]].''&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the [[Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties|2006 Lancet survey]] suggested almost half this number (654,965 deaths) through the end of June 2006. The Lancet authors calculated a range of 392,979 to 942,636 deaths.

On 28 January 2008, ORB published an update based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken September 20 to 24, 2007. As a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.&lt;ref name=update&gt;[http://www.opinion.co.uk/Newsroom_details.aspx?NewsId=120 Update on Iraqi Casualty Data] by Opinion Research Business, January 2008.

This ORB estimate has been criticised as exaggerated and ill-founded in [[peer reviewed]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228654909_Conflict_Deaths_in_Iraq_A_Methodological_Critique_of_the_ORB_Survey_Estimate "Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate"] By Michael Spagat and Josh Dougherty&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survey question and results ==

Participants of the ORB survey were asked the following question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many members of your household, if any, have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 (ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age)? Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The revised results&lt;ref name=orb2008jan28/&gt; were

|-

== Causes of death ==

ORB reported that "48% died from a gunshot wound, 20% from the impact of a car bomb, 9% from aerial bombardment, 6% as a result of an accident and 6% from another blast/ordnance."&lt;ref name=ORB/&gt;

== Methodology ==

From the September 14, 2007 ORB press release&lt;ref name=ORB/&gt; concerning the first set of interviews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Results are based on face-to-face interviews amongst a nationally representative sample of 1,720 adults aged 18+ throughout Iraq (1,499 agreed to answer the question on household deaths)
* The standard margin of error on the sample who answered (1,499) is +2.5%
* The methodology uses multi-stage random probability sampling and covers fifteen of the eighteen governorates within Iraq. For security reasons Karbala and Al Anbar were not included. Irbil was excluded as the authorities refused the field team a permit.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Their pollster was Dr. Munqeth Daghir, founding director of IIACSS.&lt;ref name=ORB/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munqeth Daghir"&gt;[http://www.research-live.com/features/of-course-i-was-scared-but-i-really-believe-that-i-am-doing-the-right-thing/2001599.article "Of course I was scared. But I really believe that I am doing the right thing"]. Article about ORB pollster Dr. Munqeth Daghir. Jan. 2006. ''Research'' (magazine). (See also: [http://www.opinion.co.uk/Documents/Polling%20in%20Iraq.pdf PDF article with photos]).&lt;/ref&gt; ORB reports: "IIACSS (Independent Institute for Administration and Civil Society Studies) is a polling/ research company established in Iraq in 2003 and which has a network of interviewers covering all regions of the country.  Further information about IIACSS and its founding director Dr. Munqith Dagher can be found within the relevant news article in the Newsroom section of ORB's website."&lt;ref name=orb2008jan28/&gt;

ORB is a member of the [[British Polling Council]].&lt;ref name=orb2008jan28/&gt;

== Estimated range of deaths ==

The 2005 census reported 4,050,597 households. From this ORB calculated 1,220,580 deaths since the 2003 invasion. From the poll margin of error of 2.5% ORB came up with a range of 733,158 to 1,446,063 deaths.&lt;ref name=ORB/&gt;

== January 2008 update: 1,033,000 deaths ==

Opinion Research Business published an update to the survey on 28 January 2008, based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken and as a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.&lt;ref name=update /&gt;

== Criticism ==

The ORB poll estimate has come under criticism in a [[peer reviewed]] paper entitled "Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate", published in the journal [[Survey Research Methods]]. This paper "describes in detail how the ORB poll is riddled with critical inconsistencies and methodological shortcomings", and concludes that the ORB poll is "too flawed, exaggerated and ill-founded to contribute to discussion of the human costs of the Iraq war".&lt;ref name="w4.ub.uni-konstanz.de"&gt;[http://w4.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/viewArticle/2373 "Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719105821/http://w4.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/viewArticle/2373 |date=July 19, 2011 }} By Michael Spagat and Josh Dougherty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhul.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/newsarticles/Studyrevealsfundamentalflawsto2007estimateofonemillionIraqiskilled.aspx "Study reveals fundamental flaws to 2007 estimate of one million Iraqis killed"] Royal Holloway University of London&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiologist Francisco Checci recently{{when|date=June 2014}} echoed these conclusions in a BBC interview, stating that he thinks the ORB estimate was "too high" and "implausible". Checci, like the paper above, says that a "major weakness" of the poll was a failure to adequately distinguish between households and extended family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/08/100827_iraq_deaths_nh_sl.shtml "Counting bodies: how many people were killed in the Iraq war?"] BBC World Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iraq Body Count project]] also rejected what they called the "hugely exaggerated death toll figures" of ORB, citing the [[Survey Research Methods]] paper,which Josh Dougherty of IBC co-wrote.&lt;ref name="w4.ub.uni-konstanz.de"/&gt; IBC concluded that, "The pressing need is for more truth rooted in real experience, not the manipulation of numbers disconnected from reality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/beyond/exaggerated-orb/ "Exaggerated claims, substandard research, and a disservice to truth"] By Iraq Body Count&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Rentoul]], a columnist for ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, has asserted that the ORB estimate "exaggerate[s] the toll by a factor of as much as 10" and that "the ORB estimate has rarely been treated as credible by responsible media organisations, but it is still widely repeated by cranks and the ignorant."&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2010/06/13/iraq-death-tolls-yet-again/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pat Buckley''' was an [[Irish people|Irish]] sportsperson.  He played hurling with his local club [[Aghabullogue GAA|Aghabullogue]] and was a member of the [[Cork GAA|Cork]] senior inter-county team from 1890 until 1892.  Buckley, together with his team-mate [[Dan Drew]], became the first players to win two All-Ireland winners' medals on the field of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jim| last=Cronin| title=A Rebel Hundred: Cork's 100 All-Ireland Titles| publisher=| year=1998| id= | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===Club===
Buckley played his hurling with his local club in [[Aghabullogue GAA|Aghabullogue]] and enjoyed some success.  He won a [[Cork Senior Hurling Championship|county senior championship]] title in 1890 following a 7-3 to 1-1 defeat of [[Aghada GAA|Aghada]].  It remains Aghabullogue's only county final victory.

===Inter-county===
Buckley first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with [[Cork GAA|Cork]] as part of the Aghabullogue selection in 1890.  That year he lined out in his first provincial decider with [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] providing the opposition.  The game was far from exciting, however, at full-time Cork were the champions by 2-0 to 0-1.&lt;ref name="Munster GAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munster.gaa.ie/teams/seniorhurling.html |title=Senior Hurling - Munster Final Winning Teams (1887-2007) |publisher=[[Munster GAA]] |date= |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719154803/http://munster.gaa.ie/teams/seniorhurling.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Buckley's first [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]] title.  Cork's next game was an All-Ireland final meeting with [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]].  The game was a controversial one and was marred by ill-tempered behaviour.  A Cork player had his toe broken by one of his Wexford counterparts.  Cork captain, [[Dan Lane]], led his men off the field in protest.  At the time Cork were trailing by 2-2 to 1-6, however, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]]'s Central Council later backed Cork and Buckley collected an [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] title.&lt;ref name="Cork Hurling Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/Cork/Profile.aspx|title=Cork Hurling Profile|publisher=www.hoganstand.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216074254/http://hoganstand.com/Cork/Profile.aspx|archivedate=2009-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckley was dropped from the Cork team again in 1891, however, he was back in 1892.  That year he lined out in his second provincial decider with All-Ireland champions Kerry providing the opposition once again.  An exciting game developed, however, at full-time Cork were the champions by 5-3 to 2-5.&lt;ref name="Munster GAA"/&gt; It was Buckley's second Munster title.  Cork's next game was an All-Ireland final meeting with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]].  The game was a controversial one as referee [[Dan Fraher]] changed his mind after initially awarding a goal to Cork.  He eventually decided that the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]]'s Central Council should decide the matter. Dublin, however, had walked off the field and, because of this, Cork were awarded the title.  It was Buckley's second All-Ireland title.&lt;ref name="Cork Hurling Profile"/&gt;

Along the path, there are numerous dots in clusters, with each cluster a different color.|Spatial firing patterns of 8 place cells recorded from the [[Hippocampus proper|hippocampal CA1]] layer of a rat's brain. Dots indicate positions (place fields) where [[action potential]]s were recorded as the rat moved back and forth along a track, with color indicating which neuron emitted that action potential.]]

'''Phase precession''' is a [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] process in which the firing of [[action potential]]s by individual [[neuron]]s is timed in relation to the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of [[neural oscillation]]s in the surrounding cells. In [[place cell]]s, a type of neuron found in the [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] region of the [[brain]], phase [[wikt:precession|precession]] is believed to play a major role in the [[neural coding]] of information. [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]], who later shared the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery that place cells help form a "map" of the body's position in space, co-discovered phase precession with Michael Recce in 1993.&lt;ref name="OKeefe1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Keefe J, Recce ML | title = Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG theta rhythm | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.450030307/abstract;jsessionid=D7DEB7FEC2C5F67890498798FC9414DE.f01t01?system | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–30 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8353611 | doi = 10.1002/hipo.450030307 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180129182136/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.450030307/abstract;jsessionid=D7DEB7FEC2C5F67890498798FC9414DE.f01t01?system | archivedate = 29 January 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/okeefe-bio.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014: John O'Keefe – Biograhpical|website=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=27 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929044010/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/okeefe-bio.html|archivedate=29 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Place cells==
{{main|Place cell}}
[[Pyramidal cell]]s in the hippocampus called place cells play a significant role in self-location during movement over short distances.&lt;ref name="Moser 69–77"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser EI, Kropff E, Moser MB | title = Place cells, grid cells, and the brain's spatial representation system | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723 | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | pages = 69–89 | date = 19 February 2008 | pmid = 18284371 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161124223905/http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723 | archivedate = 24 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rat moves along a path, individual place cells fire action potentials at an increased rate at particular positions along the path, termed "place fields". Each place cell's maximum firing rate{{snd}}with action potentials occurring in rapid [[Bursting|bursts]]{{snd}}occurs at the position encoded by that cell; and that cell fires only occasionally when the animal is at other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bures J, Fenton AA, Kaminsky Y, Zinyuk L | title = Place cells and place navigation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 343–50 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8990211 | pmc = 19339 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.1.343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a relatively small path, the same cells are [[Hippocampal replay|repeatedly activated]] as the animal returns to the same position.

Although simple [[rate coding]] (the coding of information based on whether neurons fire more rapidly or more slowly) resulting from these changes in firing rates may account for some of the neural coding of position, there is also a prominent role for the [[Phase response curve|timing of the action potentials]] of a single place cell, relative to the firing of nearby cells in the [[neural ensemble|local population]].&lt;ref name=Dual&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Keefe J, Burgess N | title = Dual phase and rate coding in hippocampal place cells: theoretical significance and relationship to entorhinal grid cells | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.20115/abstract?system | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 853–66 | date = 6 September 2005 | pmid = 16145693 | doi = 10.1002/hipo.20115 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180129175126/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.20115/abstract?system | archivedate = 29 January 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Computations&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgess N, O'Keefe J | title = Neuronal computations underlying the firing of place cells and their role in navigation | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(1996)6:6%3C749::AID-HIPO16%3E3.0.CO;2-0/abstract?system | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 749–62 | date = 1996 | pmid = 9034860 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(1996)6:6&lt;749::AID-HIPO16&gt;3.0.CO;2-0 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180129175123/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(1996)6:6%3C749::AID-HIPO16%3E3.0.CO;2-0/abstract?system | archivedate = 29 January 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the larger population of cells fire occasionally when the rat is outside of the cells' individual place fields, the firing patterns are organized to occur synchronously, forming [[waveform|wavelike]] [[voltage]] oscillations.

[[File:eeg theta.svg|thumb|right|350px|alt=A wavelike curvy line, with time in seconds labeled at the bottom|An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] [[theta wave]]]]

In 1993, O'Keefe and Recce discovered a relationship between the theta wave and the firing patterns of individual place cells.&lt;ref name="OKeefe1993"/&gt; Although the occasional action potentials of cells when rats were outside of the place fields occurred in phase with (at the peaks of) the theta waves, the bursts of more rapid spikes elicited when the rats reached the place fields were out of synchrony with the oscillation. As a rat approached the place field, the corresponding place cell would fire slightly in advance of the theta wave peak. As the rat moved closer and closer, each successive action potential occurred earlier and earlier within the wave cycle. At the center of the place field, when the cell would fire at its maximal rate, the firing had been advanced sufficiently to be anti-phase to the theta potential (at the bottom, rather than at the peak, of the theta waveform). Then, as the rat continued to move on past the place field and the cell firing slowed, the action potentials continued to occur progressively earlier relative to the theta wave, until they again became synchronous with the wave, aligned now with one wave peak earlier than before. O'Keefe and Recce termed this advancement relative to the wave phase "phase precession". Subsequent studies showed that each time a rat entered a completely different area and the place fields would be [[Phase resetting in neurons|remapped]], place cells would again become phase-locked to the theta rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bose A, Recce M | title = Phase precession and phase-locking of hippocampal pyramidal cells | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.1038/abstract?system | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–15 | date = 19 June 2001 | pmid = 11769305 | doi = 10.1002/hipo.1038 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180129175120/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.1038/abstract?system | archivedate = 29 January 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely accepted that the anti-phase cell firing that results from phase precession is an important component of information coding about place.&lt;ref name="Moser 69–77"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dual/&gt;&lt;ref name=Computations/&gt;&lt;ref name=Theta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buzsaki&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldz58irprjYC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;|title=Rhythms of the Brain|first=György|last=Buzsáki|name-list-format=vanc|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195301064|pages=308–26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226103105/https://books.google.com/books?id=ldz58irprjYC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;|archivedate=26 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other systems==
There have been conflicting theories of [[Theta wave#Mechanisms|how neurons in and around the hippocampus give rise to theta waves]] and consequently give rise to phase precession. As these mechanisms became better understood, the existence of phase precession was increasingly accepted by researchers.&lt;ref name=Buzsaki/&gt; This, in turn, gave rise to the question of whether phase precession could be observed in any other regions of the brain, with other kinds of [[Neural circuit|cell circuits]], or whether phase precession was a peculiar property of hippocampal tissue.&lt;ref name=Buzsaki/&gt; The finding that theta wave phase precession is also a property of [[grid cell]]s in the [[entorhinal cortex]] demonstrated that the phenomenon exists in other parts of the brain that also mediate information about movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06957 | vauthors = Hafting T, Fyhn M, Bonnevie T, Moser MB, Moser EI | title = Hippocampus-independent phase precession in entorhinal grid cells | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7199 | pages = 1248–52 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18480753 | doi = 10.1038/nature06957 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180130000010/http://www.nature.com/articles/nature06957 | archivedate = 30 January 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theta wave phase precession in the hippocampus also plays a role in some brain functions that are unrelated to spatial location. When rats were trained to jump up to the rim of a box, place cells displayed phase precession much as they do during movement along a path, but a subset of the place cells showed phase precession that was related to initiating the jump, independently of spatial location, and not related to the position during the jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenck-Santini PP, Fenton AA, Muller RU | title = Discharge properties of hippocampal neurons during performance of a jump avoidance task | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = 27 | pages = 6773–86 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18596153 | pmc = 2636898 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5329-07.2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been extended to include any attacks against Jews and physical destruction of Jewish property, as well as looting of Jewish homes and businesses, throughout history.{{r|YIVO}}{{r|books1}}{{r|books2}} The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incidents, at times leading to, or culminating in, [[massacre]]s. All outbreaks of antisemitic violence have become retrospectively known as pogroms.{{r|Brass}} 

The Russian-language term was adopted in the English language in order to describe the mass violence of 1881 and 1882 that was directed against Jews within the [[Pale of Settlement]] which was first created by [[Catherine the Great]] in what would become most of present-day [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], as well as parts of [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Poland]]. The term ''pogrom'' is sometimes used, as well, to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish ethnic or religious groups.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WileyBlackwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt;&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Definitions of pogrom}}
First recorded in 1882, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''pogrom'' (погро́м, {{IPA-ru|pɐˈgrom|pron}}) is derived from the common prefix po- and the verb ''gromit''' (громи́ть, {{IPA-ru|grɐˈmʲitʲ|pron}}) meaning "to destroy, to wreak havoc, to demolish violently". Its literal translation is "to harm".&lt;ref name=Abramson/&gt; The noun "pogrom", which has a relatively short history, is used in [[English language|English]] and many other languages as a [[loanword]], possibly borrowed from [[Yiddish]] (where the word takes the form פאָגראָם).&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; Its widespread circulation in today's world began with the antisemitic excesses in the Russian Empire in 1881–1883.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt;

==Historical background==
Anti-Jewish riots had already taken place in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. Jewish communities were targeted in the [[Black Death Jewish persecutions]] of 1348–1350, in [[Toulon]] in 1348, in [[Barcelona]] as well as in other Catalan cities,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe after the black death '' 2000 p. 13 "The first massacres took place in April 1348 in Toulon, where the Jewish quarter was raided and forty Jews were murdered in their homes. Shortly afterwards, violence broke out in Barcelona."&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Erfurt massacre (1349)]], the [[Basel massacre]], massacres in Aragon and in Flanders,&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Judaica: chronological index of Jewish history''; p. 203  Máttis Kantor - 2005 "The Jews were savagely attacked and massacred, by sometimes hysterical mobs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall ''John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture''; p. 376 2006 "The period of the Black Death saw the massacre of Jews across Germany, and in Aragon, and Flanders,"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the "Valentine's Day" [[Strasbourg pogrom]] of 1349.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, «La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire» ("The greatest epidemic in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n° 310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 510 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period,&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''The Renaissance'', Simon and Schuster (1953), page 730–731, {{ISBN|0-671-61600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending further to the [[Brussels massacre]] of 1370. On Holy Saturday of 1389, a pogrom began in [[Prague]] that led to the burning of the Jewish quarter, the killing of many Jews, and the suicide of many Jews trapped in the main synagogue; the number of dead was estimated at 400–500 men, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Newman [https://www.academia.edu/1470909/The_Passion_of_the_Jews_of_Prague_The_Pogrom_of_1389_and_the_Lessons_of_a_Medieval_Parody_2012_ The Passion of the Jews of Prague: The Pogrom of 1389 and the Lessons of a Medieval Parody] Church History 81:1 (March 2012), 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The first atrocities against Jewish civilians, on a genocidal scale of destruction, were committed during the [[Khmelnytsky Pogrom]]s of 1648–1657 in present-day [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Herman Rosenthal |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=469&amp;letter=C |title=Chmielnicki, Bogdan Zinovi |website=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians give estimates of the scale of the murders by Khmelnytsky's [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] ranging between 40,000 and 100,000 men, women and children,&lt;ref&gt;Historians, who put the number of killed Jewish civilians at between 40,000 and 100,000 during the [[Khmelnytsky Pogrom]]s in 1648–1657, include:&lt;ol type="a" style="Margin: 0;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;{{space}} Naomi E.

The [[Russian Empire]], which previously had very few Jews, acquired territories with [[Russian Partition|large Jewish populations]] during the military [[Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795 conducted jointly with [[Austrian Partition|the Austrian]] and [[Prussian Partition|Prussian armies]], and resulting in Poland's elimination from the geopolitical map of Europe for the next 123 years.&lt;ref name="Davies60"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Davies |title=God's Playground: a history of Poland |id=Volume II: Revised Edition |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press |year=2005 |chapter=Rossiya: The Russian Partition (1772–1918) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;q=alien+imposition |pages=60–61 |isbn=978-0199253401|title-link=God's Playground }}&lt;/ref&gt; In conquered territories, a new political entity called the [[Pale of Settlement]] was formed in 1791 by [[Catherine the Great]].

===Russian Civil War period===
Large-scale pogroms, which began in the Russian Empire several decades earlier, intensified during the period of the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Revolution of 1917]]. Professor [[Zvi Gitelman]] (''A Century of Ambivalence'') estimated that only in 1918–1919 over 1,200 pogroms took place in Ukraine, thus amounting to the greatest slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe since 1648.&lt;ref name=Gitelman25&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitelman |first=Zvi Y. |year=2001 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f2rng6jDW4C&amp;q=Kiev+March+1919+since+1648 |title=Revolution and the Ambiguities |id=Chapter&amp;nbsp;2 |isbn=978-0253338112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his book ''[[Two Hundred Years Together]]'' provided additional statistics from research conducted by [[Nahum Gergel]] (1887–1931). Gergel counted 1,236 incidents of anti-Jewish violence and estimated that 887 mass pogroms occurred, the remainder being classified as "excesses" not assuming mass proportions.&lt;ref name=NLe/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleg"/&gt; The [[Kiev pogroms of 1919]], according to Gitelman, were the first of a subsequent wave of pogroms in which between 30,000 and 70,000 Jews were massacred across Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Gitelman"&gt;{{cite book |first=Zvi Y. |last=Gitelman |author-link=Zvi Gitelman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f2rng6jDW4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Kiev%20pogrom%201919&amp;f=false |title=A Century of Ambivalence: The Jews of Russia and the Soviet Union, 1881 to the Present |pages=65–70 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0253338112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKa&gt;{{cite book |first=Sharman |last=Kadish |title=Bolsheviks and British Jews: The Anglo-Jewish Community, Britain, and the Russian Revolution |publisher=Routledge |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rhkA1VpX5KQC&amp;pg=RA5-PA286&amp;lpg=RA5-PA286&amp;dq=%22kiev+pogrom%22+1919#PRA1-PA87,M1|isbn=9780714633718 |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the pogroms accounted for in Gergel's research, about 40&amp;nbsp;percent were perpetrated by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] forces led by [[Symon Petliura]], 25&amp;nbsp;percent by the Ukrainian [[Green armies|Green Army]] and various Ukrainian [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalist]] gangs, and 17&amp;nbsp;percent by the [[White Army]], especially the forces of [[Anton Denikin]]. A further 8.5&amp;nbsp;percent of Gergel's total was attributed to pogroms carried out by men of the [[Red Army]] although these pogroms were not sanctioned by the Bolshevik leadership; the high command disarmed the regiments which had perpetrated pogroms.&lt;ref name=NLe&gt;{{cite book |first=Nora |last=Levin |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgQUCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Bolshevik+disarmed  |title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917: Paradox of Survival |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-5051-3 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Encyclopaedia Judaica |year=2008 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0016_0_15895.html |title=Pogroms |publisher=The Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian People's Republic of Symon Petliura also issued orders condemning pogroms,&lt;ref name="Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation"/&gt; but lacked authority to intervene.&lt;ref name="Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation"&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Serhy Yekelchyk |first=Serhy |last=Yekelchyk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CHiBwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Petliura+pogroms |title=Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-530546-3 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; After May 1919 the Directory lost its role as a credible governing body; almost 75 percent of pogroms occurred between May and September of that year.&lt;ref name=HoUJsntui&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TA1zVKTTsXUC&amp;q=Petliura+1%2C236+pogroms |title=History of Ukraine - The Land and Its Peoples |author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi |first=Paul Robert |last=Magocsi |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4426-4085-6 |page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Jews were killed only for being  Jewish, without any political affiliations.&lt;ref name="Kleg"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hate Prejudice and Racism |first=Milton |last=Kleg |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1993 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKrrSa7WqNwC&amp;q=1%2C326+pogroms+Ukraine |isbn=978-0791415368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instructions issued from above had only a limited impact on soldiers' attitudes toward violence against Jews, as related by author and future Nobel laureate [[Ivan Bunin]]. On May 15, 1919, Bunin wrote in his diary about yet another massacre: {{quote|Members of the [[Red Army]] in [[Odessa]] led a pogrom against the Jewish population in the town of [[:ru:Большой Фонтан (Одесса)|Big Fountain]]. Ovsyaniko-Kulikovsky and the writer Kipen happened to be there and told me the details. Fourteen [[commissar|commissars]] and thirty Jews from among the common people were killed. Many stores were destroyed. The soldiers tore through the night, dragged the victims from their beds, and killed whomever they met. People ran into the [[steppe]] or rushed into the sea. They were chased after and fired upon – a genuine hunt, as it were. Kipen saved himself by accident – fortunately he had spent the night not in his home, but at the White Flower sanitorium. At dawn, a detachment of Red Army soldiers appeared. 'Are there any Jews here?' they asked the watchman. 'No, no Jews here.' 'Swear what you're saying is true!' The watchman swore, and they went on farther. Moisei Gutman, a cab [driver], was killed. He was a dear man who moved us from our [[dacha]] last fall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Bunin]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Uf_yeeb97wC&amp;q=Big+Fountain Cursed Days: A Diary of Revolution.]'' May 2/15, 1919.

Gergel's overall figures, which are generally considered conservative, are based on the testimony of witnesses and newspaper reports collected by the ''Mizrakh-Yidish Historiche Arkhiv'' which was first based in Kiev, then Berlin and later New York. The English version of Gergel's article was published in 1951 in the [[YIVO]] Annual of Jewish Social Science titled "The Pogroms in the Ukraine in 1918–1921."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Henry |last=Abramson |title=Jewish Representation in the Independent Ukrainian Governments of 1917–1920'' |journal=Slavic Review |volume=Vol. 50, No. 3 (Fall, 1991) |date=September 1991 |pp=542–550 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/div-classtitlejewish-representation-in-the-independent-ukrainian-governments-of-1917-1920div/49220526A769CE874099110B4A6A835C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1911 [[History of the Jews in Wales#Modern period|Tredegar riot]] in [[Wales]], Jewish homes and businesses were looted and burned over the period of a week, before the [[British Army]] was called in by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]], who described the riot as a "pogrom".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; In 1919 there was a pogrom in [[Argentina]], during the [[Tragic Week (Argentina)|Tragic Week]].&lt;ref name="bookrags"/&gt;

On 1–2 June 1941, in the two-day [[Farhud]] pogrom in [[Iraq]], "rioters murdered between 150 and 180 Jews, injured 600 others, and raped an undetermined number of women. They also looted some 1,500 stores and homes".&lt;ref name="ushmm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

In [[Lithuania]], some local police led by [[Algirdas Klimaitis]] and [[Lithuanian partisans (1941)|Lithuanian partisans]] – consisting of [[Lithuanian Activist Front|LAF]] units reinforced by 3,600 deserters from the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Corps of the [[Red Army]]&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; promulgated anti-Jewish [[Kaunas pogrom|pogroms in Kaunas]] along with occupying [[Nazi]]s.

===After World War II===
After the end of [[World War II]], a series of violent antisemitic incidents occurred against returning Jews throughout [[Europe]], particularly in the Soviet-occupied East where [[Nazi]] propagandists had extensively promoted the notion of a [[Judeo-Bolshevism|Jewish-Communist conspiracy]] (see [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946]] and [[Anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944–1946]]). Anti-Jewish riots also [[The Sergeants affair#Reactions in Britain|took place in Britain]] in 1947.

In the Arab world, anti-Jewish rioters killed over 140 Jews in the [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania]]. Following the start of the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]], a number of anti-Jewish events occurred throughout the Arab world, some of which have been described as pogroms. In 1947, half of Aleppo's 10,000 Jews left the city in the wake of the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo|Aleppo riots]], while other anti-Jewish riots took place in [[1947 Aden riots|British Aden]] and [[1948 Anti-Jewish Riots in Oujda and Jerada|the French Moroccan cities of Oujda and Jerada]].&lt;ref name="antisemitism"/&gt;

{{see also|Definitions of pogrom}}

According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "the term is usually applied to attacks on [[Jews]] in the [[Russian Empire]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [and] the first extensive pogroms followed the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in 1881",&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; and the ''Wiley-Blackwell Dictionary of Modern European History Since 1789'' states that pogroms "were [[antisemitic]] disturbances that periodically occurred within the tsarist empire."&lt;ref name="WileyBlackwell"/&gt; However, the term is widely used to refer to many events which occurred prior to the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]. Historian of Russian Jewry [[John Klier]] writes in ''Russians, Jews, and the Pogroms of 1881–1882'' that "By the twentieth century, the word 'pogrom' had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews."&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt; [[Henry Abramson|Abramson]] wrote that "in mainstream usage the word has come to imply an act of [[antisemitism]]", since while "Jews have not been the only group to suffer under this phenomenon&amp;nbsp;... historically Jews have been frequent victims of such violence".&lt;ref name=Abramson/&gt;

[[File:TulsaRaceRiot-1921.png|left|thumb|The 1921 [[Tulsa race riot]], which destroyed the wealthiest black community in the United States, has been described as a pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-reading-ferguson-books-on-race-police-protest-and-us-history-20140818-story.html | title=Reading Ferguson: books on race, police, protest and U.S. history | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term is also used in reference to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of ''pogroms''. Reviewing its uses in scholarly literature, historian [[Werner Bergmann]] proposes that pogroms should be "defined as a ''unilateral, nongovernmental'' form of ''collective'' violence ''initiated by the majority population'' against a largely defenseless ethnic group, and he states that pogroms occur when the ''majority'' expects the state to provide them with no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority,"&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; but he adds that in Western usage, the word's "anti-Semitic overtones" have been retained.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt;  Historian [[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]] supports this, writing that "there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label [pogrom]," but states that the majority of the incidents "habitually" described as pogroms took place in societies significantly divided by ethnicity and/or religion where the violence was committed by the higher-ranking group against a stereotyped lower-ranking group against whom they expressed some complaint, and with the belief that the law of the land would not be used to stop them.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

There is no universally accepted set of characteristics which define the term pogrom.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergmann2/&gt;  Klier writes that "when applied indiscriminately to events in [[Eastern Europe]], the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that 'pogroms' were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features."&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt;  Use of the term pogrom to refer to events in 1918–19 in Polish cities including [[Kielce pogrom (1918)|Kielce]], [[Pinsk massacre|Pinsk]] and [[Lwów pogrom (1918)|Lwów]], was specifically avoided in the 1919 [[Morgenthau Report]] and the word "excesses" was used instead because the authors argued that the use of the term "pogrom" required a situation to be [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] rather than political in nature, which meant that it was inapplicable to the conditions existing in a war zone,&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pietrowski/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pease"/&gt; and media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 [[Crown Heights riot]] caused public controversy.&lt;ref name="JewishWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conaway"/&gt; In 2008, two separate attacks in the [[West Bank]] by [[Israeli Jews|Israeli Jewish]] [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] on [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Arab]]s were characterized as pogroms by then [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Ehud Olmert]].&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;"As a Jew, I was ashamed at the scenes of Jews opening fire at innocent Arabs in Hebron. There is no other definition than the term 'pogrom' to describe what I have seen."[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/settlers-attack-palestinian-village/2008/09/14/1221330653198.html Settlers attack Palestinian village]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7770384.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Olmert condemns settler 'pogrom'|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Werner Bergmann suggests a particularly unifying characteristic of all such incidents: "[b]y the ''collective attribution'' of a threat, the pogrom differs from other forms of violence, such as [[lynching]]s, which are directed at individual members of a minority group, while the ''imbalance of power'' in favor of the rioters distinguishes pogroms from other forms of riot ([[food riot]]s, [[race riot]]s or '[[communal riot]]s' between evenly matched groups); and again, the ''low level of organization'' separates them from [[vigilantism]], [[terrorism]], [[massacre]] and [[genocide]]".&lt;ref name="international"/&gt;

|38||Alexandrian pogrom (name disputed){{efn|Prof. Sandra Gambetti: "A final note on the use of terminology related to anti-Semitism. Scholars have frequently labeled the Alexandrian events of 38 C.E. as the first pogrom{{cn|date=May 2018}} in history and have often explained them in terms of an ''ante litteram'' explosion of anti-Semitism. This work [''The Alexandrian Riots''] deliberately avoids any words or expressions that in any way connect, explicitly or implicitly, the Alexandrian events of 38 C.E. to later events in modern or contemporary Jewish experience, for which that terminology was created. ... To decide whether a word like ''pogrom'', for example, is an appropriate term to describe the events that are studied here, requires a comparative re-discussion of two historical frames—the Alexandria of 38 C.E. and the Russia of the end of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alexandrian Riots of 38 C.E. and the Persecution of the Jews: A Historical Reconstruction |author=Prof. Sandra Gambetti |publisher=BRILL |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdCMH96eKwUC&amp;q=ante+litteram |pages=11–12 |isbn=978-9004138469 |location=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholarly research around the subject has been divided on certain points, including whether the Alexandrian Jews fought to keep their citizenship or to acquire it, whether they evaded the payment of the poll-tax or prevented any attempts to impose it on them, and whether they were safeguarding their identity against the Greeks or against the Egyptians.

Pereswetoff-Morath writes in "A Grin without a Cat" (2002) that "I feel that Birnbaum's use of the term "anti-Semitism" as well as, for example, his use of "pogrom" in references to medieval Rus are not warranted by the evidence he presents. He is, of course, aware that it may be controversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[George Vernadsky]]: "Incidentally, one should not suppose that the movement was anti-Semitic.

The misnamed "Pinsk pogrom", a plain, powerful, alliterative phrase, entered history in April 1919. Its importance lay not only in its timing, during the tensest moments of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and the most crucial deliberations over Poland's political future: The reports of Pinsk once more demonstrated the swift transmission of local violence to world notice and the disfiguring process of rumor and prejudice on every level."&lt;ref&gt;Defending the Rights of Others:The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878-1938, Carole Fink, 2006, p185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The first syllable, po-, is a prefix indicating "means" or "target". The word therefore seems to imply a sudden burst of energy (thunderbolt) directed at a specific target.

&lt;ref name="Bergmann"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A4mqsik_VDcC&amp;pg=PA351 International handbook of violence research, Volume 1 (Springer, 2005)] "The word "pogrom" (from the Russian, meaning storm or devastation) has a relatively short history. Its international currency dates back to the anti-Semitic excesses in Tsarist Russia during the years 1881–1883, but the phenomenon existed in the same form at a much earlier date and was by no means confined to Russia. As John D. Klier points out in his seminal article "The pogrom paradigm in Russian history", the anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia were described by contemporaries as demonstrations, persecution, or struggle, and the government made use of the term besporiadok (unrest, riot) to emphasize the breach of public order. Then, during the twentieth century, the term began to develop along two separate lines. In the Soviet Union, the word lost its anti-Semitic connotation and came to be used for reactionary forms of political unrest and, from 1989, for outbreaks of interethnic violence; while in the West, the anti-Semitic overtones were retained and government orchestration or acquiescence was emphasized."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Bergmann2&gt;Bergmann writes that "the concept of "ethnic violence" covers a range of heterogeneous phenomena, and in many cases there are still no established theoretical and conceptual distinctions in the field (Waldmann, 1995:343)" Bergmann then goes on to set out a variety of conflicting scholarly views on the definition and usage of the term pogrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, outbreaks of mass violence against Jews were extraordinary events, not a regular feature of East European life.|isbn=9780521895484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called pogrom in Lwów, in November 1918, turned out to be a military massacre where three times more Christians died than Jews. The so-called pogrom in Pinsk in March 1919 turned out to be work of a panicky lieutenant, whose order to executre thirty-five suspected Bolshevik infiltrators was described by a US investigator as 'fully justified by the circumstances'; the pogroms in Wilno in April 1919 and again in October 1920 were occasioned by the Red Army's hasty retreats, and by military reprisals against suspected collaborators."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon'''''|ポケモン不思議のダンジョン|Pokemon Fushigi no Danjon|lead=yes}} is a video game series [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] from the main [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'']] series developed by [[Spike Chunsoft]] (formerly [[Chunsoft]]).  The games features the fictional creatures called [[Pokémon]] navigating through a randomly generated dungeon using turn-based moves, indicative of ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' games. {{as of|September 2015}}, there have been ten games across four platforms, as well as two manga adaptations and several animated specials. These games are based in dungeons, where a floor map is randomly generated. In the dungeons, players fight other Pokémon while obtaining items and finding steps to the next floor. Across all installments, the series has sold over 13 million copies.{{ref|sales|[a]}}
== Gameplay ==
Although there are different features in each of the titles, the major gameplay in each title are the same. The player assumes the role of a Pokémon that was transformed from a human, found by the player's Pokémon partner in the start of the game. Before the game starts, the player will need to go through a personality test; this will decide which Pokémon the player is in the game (with the exception of the WiiWare games, ''Gates to Infinity'', and ''Super Mystery Dungeon'', where the player may choose their starter). Gameplay is based on a classic roguelike game, with the player navigating the randomly generated dungeon with their Pokémon team. Movement and actions are turn-based; the player can use basic attacks, Pokémon moves, and items. The game starts with one partner Pokémon, but the player can recruit other Pokémon that they meet in the dungeon into their team soon after the first mission.

'''''Pokémon Red Version''''' and '''''Blue Version'''''{{efn|Originally released in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Pokémon Red Version''''' and '''''Green Version'''''|ポケットモンスター 赤・緑|Poketto Monsutā Aka Midori|lit. ''Pocket Monsters: Red &amp; Green''}}}} are [[role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Game Freak]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy]]. They are the first installments of the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series. They were first released in Japan in 1996 as ''Red'' and ''Green''. "Blue" was released later in the year as a special edition. They were later released as ''Red'' and ''Blue'' in North America, Europe, and Australia over the following three years. ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'', a special edition version, was released roughly a year later. ''Red'' and ''Green'' have subsequently been [[video game remake|remade]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], released in 2004.

The player controls the protagonist from an [[top-down perspective|overhead perspective]] and navigates him throughout the fictional region of Kanto in a quest to master [[Pokémon battle|Pokémon battling]]. The goal of the games is to become the champion of the Indigo League by defeating the eight [[Gym Leaders]] and then the top four Pokémon trainers in the land, the [[Elite Four]]. Another objective is to complete the [[Pokédex]], an in-game encyclopedia, by obtaining the 150&lt;!--NOTE: do NOT change to 151--&gt; available Pokémon. ''Red'' and ''Blue'' utilize the [[Game Link Cable]], which connects two games together and allows Pokémon to be traded or battled between games. Both titles are independent of each other but feature the same plot,&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/159/159846p1.html|title=Pokemon Red Version Review|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=1999-06-23|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while they can be played separately, it is necessary for players to trade among both games in order to obtain all of the first 150 Pokémon.

''Red'' and ''Blue'' were well-received with critics praising the multiplayer options, especially the concept of trading. They received an aggregated score of 89% on [[GameRankings]] and are considered among [[Lists of games considered the best|the greatest games ever made]], perennially ranked on top game lists including at least four years on [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Games of All Time. The games' releases marked the beginning of what would become a multibillion-dollar franchise, jointly selling hundreds of millions of copies worldwide. In 2009 they appeared in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' under "Best selling RPG on the Game Boy" and "Best selling RPG of all time". The games were re-released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] service as a commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary in 2016.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
[[File:Bulbasaur pokemon red.png|thumb|left|The player's level 5 [[Bulbasaur]] (bottom) engaged in a battle with the rival's level 5 [[Charmander]] (top)]]
''Red'' and ''Blue'' are played in a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]], [[overhead perspective]] and consist of three basic screens: an [[overworld]], in which the player navigates the main character;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1997-12-09|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a side-view battle screen;&lt;ref name="battle"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1998-09-30|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a menu interface, in which the player configures his or her Pokémon, items, or gameplay settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1998-09-30|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player can use his or her Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pokémon]] or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a [[Pokémon moves|maneuver]] for his or her Pokémon to fight using one of four [[Gameplay of Pokémon|moves]], use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have [[health (gaming)|hit points]] (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of [[experience point]]s (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will [[Levels up|level up]].&lt;ref name="battle" /&gt; A Pokémon's level controls its physical properties, such as the [[Pokémon statistics|battle statistics]] acquired, and the [[Pokémon moves|moves]] it has learned. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also evolve. These evolutions affect the statistics and the levels at which new moves are learned (higher levels of evolution gain more statistics per level, although they may not learn new moves as early, if at all, compared with the lower levels of evolution).&lt;ref name="GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gameboy/rpg/pokemonblue/review.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206184212/http://www.gamespot.com/gameboy/rpg/pokemonblue/review.html|archivedate=2010-02-06|title=GameSpot review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Peter|last=Bartholow|date=2000-01-28|accessdate=2008-06-26|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gameplay of Pokémon#Catching Pokémon|Catching]] Pokémon is another essential element of the gameplay. While battling with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a [[Poké Ball]] at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the player's ownership. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1998-09-30|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the games is to complete the entries in the [[Pokédex]], a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, [[Pokémon evolution|evolving]], and trading to obtain all 151 creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Game Freak]] |title = Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual |publisher = [[Nintendo]]  |date =1998-09-30 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' allow players to trade Pokémon between two [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] via a [[Game Link Cable]].&lt;ref name="manual 36"&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Game Freak]] |title = Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual |publisher = [[Nintendo]]  |date =1998-09-30 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of trading must be done to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team.&lt;ref name="manual 36" /&gt; When playing ''Red'' or ''Blue'' on a [[Game Boy Advance]] or [[Game Boy Advance SP|SP]], the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com.au/gbc/faqs/index.php|title=nintendo.com.au&amp;nbsp;– GBC&amp;nbsp;– Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2008-10-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222212654/http://www.nintendo.com.au/gbc/faqs/index.php|archivedate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the English versions of the games are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.&lt;ref name="support"&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Boy Game Pak Troubleshooting&amp;nbsp;– Specific Games|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/gameboy/trouble_specificgame.jsp#missingno|quote=MissingNO is a programming quirk, and not a real part of the game|publisher=Nintendo of America Inc.|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as trading with each other and ''Pokémon Yellow'', ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' can trade Pokémon with the second generation of Pokémon games: [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'']]. However, there are limitations: the games cannot link together if one player's party contains Pokémon or moves introduced in the second generation games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/trading.html|title=Pokemon Gold and Silver Strategy Guide: Trading|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, using the [[Transfer Pak]] for the [[Nintendo 64]], data such as Pokémon and items from ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' can be used in the Nintendo 64 games ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/puzzle/pokemonstadium/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review|title=Pokemon Stadium for Nintendo 64 Review|publisher=GameSpot|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|date=2000-02-29|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/strategy/pokemonstadium2/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Bread-review&amp;page=2|title=Pokemon Stadium 2 for Nintendo 64 Review|publisher=GameSpot|first=Gerald|last=Villoria|page=2|date=2001-03-26|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red'' and ''Blue'' are incompatible with the ''Pokémon'' games of the later "Advanced Generation" for the [[Game Boy Advance]] or [[GameCube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p2.html|title=IGN: Pokemon Ruby Version Review|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2003-03-17|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Kanto-Full-Map.jpg|thumb|left|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' take place in the Kanto region, based on Japan's real [[Kantō region]].]]

===Setting===
''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' take place in the region of [[Pokémon universe#Kanto|Kanto]]. This is one distinct region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1998-09-30|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, [[Tentacool (Pokémon)|Tentacool]] can only be caught either through fishing or when the player is in a body of water, while [[Zubat (Pokémon)|Zubat]] can only be caught in a cave.

===Story===
The player begins in their hometown of Pallet Town. After venturing alone into the tall grass, the player is stopped by [[Professor Oak]], a famous Pokémon researcher. Professor Oak explains to the player that wild Pokémon may be living there, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1998-09-30|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring [[Pokémon Trainer]]. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a [[starter Pokémon]] for their travels out of [[Bulbasaur]], [[Squirtle]], and [[Charmander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Game Freak]]|title=Pokémon Red and Blue, Instruction manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=1998-09-30|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player's starting Pokémon. He will then challenge the player to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and will continue to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_113.html|title=Guides: Pokemon: Blue and Red|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|page=113|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While visiting the region's cities, the player will encounter special establishments called Gyms. Inside these buildings are [[Pokémon game mechanics#Pokémon Gyms|Gym Leaders]], each of whom the player must defeat in a Pokémon battle to obtain a total of eight Gym Badges. Once the badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the Indigo League, which consists of the best Pokémon trainers in the region. There the player will battle the [[Elite Four]] and finally the new [[List of Pokémon characters#Regional Champions|Champion]]: the player's rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_67.html|title=Guides: Pokemon: Blue and Red|page=67|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, throughout the game, the player will have to battle against the forces of [[Team Rocket]], a criminal organization that abuses Pokémon.&lt;ref name="GameSpot" /&gt; They devise numerous plans for stealing rare Pokémon, which the player must foil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_99.html|title=Guides: Pokemon: Blue and Red|page=99|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_165.html|title=Guides: Pokemon: Blue and Red|page=165|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File: The Story of Satoshi Tajiri.webm|thumb|An animated history of how Satoshi Tajiri came to conceive ''Pokémon'']]
The concept of the ''Pokémon'' saga stems from the hobby of [[insect collecting]], a popular [[pastime]] which [[game designer]] [[Satoshi Tajiri]] enjoyed as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amadeo|last=Plaza|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126085524/http://www.ampednews.com/features/182/2 |archivedate=January 26, 2007 |url=http://igo.ampednews.com/features/182/2/|title=A Salute to Japanese Game Designers|publisher=Amped IGO|page=2|date=2006-02-06|accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While growing up, however, he observed more urbanization taking place in the town where he lived and as a result, the insect population declined. Tajiri noticed that kids now played in their homes instead of outside and he came up with the idea of a video game, containing creatures that resembled insects, called Pokémon. He thought kids could relate with the Pokémon by individually naming them, and then controlling them to represent fear or anger as a good way of relieving stress. However, Pokémon never bleed nor die in battle, only faint&amp;nbsp;– this was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he did not want to further fill the gaming world with "pointless violence".&lt;ref name="interview2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112054158/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html|archivedate=2007-11-12|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|publisher=TIME Asia|first=Time|last=Larimer|page=2|date=1999-11-22|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Game Boy]] was released, Tajiri thought the system was perfect for his idea, especially because of the [[Game Link Cable|link cable]], which he envisioned would allow players to trade Pokémon with each other. This concept of trading information was new to the video gaming industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005118/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html|archivedate=2007-12-12|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|publisher=TIME Asia|first=Time|last=Larimer|page=1|date=1999-11-22|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two Game Boys with special cables, and I went wow, that's really going to be something!" said Tajiri.&lt;ref name="1UPTop5" /&gt; Tajiri was also influenced by [[Square (company)|Square]]'s Game Boy game ''[[The Final Fantasy Legend]]'', noting in an interview that the game gave him the idea that more than just action games could be developed for the handheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Japanese |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page02.html |title=Pokémon interview |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characters were named after Tajiri himself as [[Red (Pokémon character)|Satoshi]], who is described as Tajiri in his youth, and his long-time friend, role model, mentor, and fellow Nintendo developer; [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] as [[Blue (Pokémon character)|Shigeru]].&lt;ref name="interview2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2007Top100"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_37.html|title=IGN's Top 100 Games 2007 &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 37 Pokemon Blue Version|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-09-15|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67qcIxX2d?url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_37.html|archive-date=2012-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Sugimori]], an artist and longtime friend of Tajiri, headed the development of drawings and designs of the Pokémon, working with a team of fewer than ten people who conceived the various designs for all 151 Pokémon. Sugimori, in turn, finalized each design, drawing the Pokémon from various angles in order to assist Game Freak's graphics department in properly rendering the creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="powerup poke"&gt;{{cite book|first=Chris|last=Kohler|year=2004|title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]]|edition=1st|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|pages= 237–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music for the game was composed by [[Junichi Masuda]], who utilized the four sound channels of the Game Boy to create both the melodies and the sound effects and Pokémon "cries" heard upon encountering them. He noted the game's opening theme, titled "Monster", was produced with the image of battle scenes in mind, using [[white noise]] to sound like marching music and imitate a [[snare drum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=143 |title=HIDDEN POWER of Masuda: No. 125 |author=Masuda, Junichi |authorlink=Junichi Masuda |publisher=[[Game Freak]] |date=2009-02-28 |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally called ''Capsule Monsters'', the game's title went through several transitions due to trademark difficulties, becoming ''CapuMon'' and ''KapuMon'' before eventually settling upon ''Pocket Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allabout.co.jp/gm/gc/215584/ |script-title=ja:写真で綴るレベルＸ～完全保存版！ |publisher=AllAbout.co.jp |language=Japanese |accessdate=2010-05-21 |date=2004-02-18 |author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ja:ゲームフリーク 遊びの世界標準を塗り替えるクリエイティブ集団 |language=Japanese |author=Tomisawa, Akihito |isbn=4-8401-0118-3 |date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajiri always thought that [[Nintendo]] would reject his game, as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games turned out to be a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy.&lt;ref name="interview2" /&gt; Upon hearing of the ''Pokémon'' concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3979/the_art_of_balance_pokmons_.php |title= The Art of Balance: Pokémon's Masuda on Complexity and Simplicity |author=Nutt, Christian |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2009-06-09 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, ''Pocket Monsters: Red'' and ''Green'' were the first versions released, having been completed by October 1995 and officially released on February 27, 1996. They sold rapidly, due in part to Nintendo's idea of producing the two versions of the game instead of a single title, prompting consumers to buy both.&lt;ref name="1UPTop5" /&gt; Several months later, the ''[[#Pocket Monsters: Blue|Blue]]'' version was released in Japan as a mail-order-only special edition,&lt;ref name="EGMgreen"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|title=What's the Deal with Pokémon?|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|page=216|date=November 1999 |issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring updated in-game artwork and new dialogue.&lt;ref name="TipsBlue"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Tips &amp; Tricks]] |publisher=[[Larry Flynt Publications]] |date=December 1999 |page=111 |title=Pokémon Report |last=Chen |first=Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create more hype and challenge to the games, Tajiri revealed an extra Pokémon called [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] hidden within the games, which he believed "created a lot of rumors and myths about the game" and "kept the interest alive".&lt;ref name="interview2" /&gt; The creature was originally added by [[Shigeki Morimoto]] as an internal prank and wasn't supposed to be exposed to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_pokmon_heartgold_version__soulsilver_version_16288_16289.html#top|title=Iwata Asks – Pokémon HeartGold Version &amp; SoulSilver Version|publisher=[[Nintendo]].com|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until later that Nintendo decided to distribute Mew through a Nintendo promotional event. However, in 2003 a glitch became widely known and could be exploited so anyone could obtain the elusive Pokémon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/933/933126p1.html|title=IGN: Pokemon Report: OMG Hacks |publisher=IGN |first=Jack |last=DeVries |date=2008-11-24 |accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the North American [[Game localization|localization]] of ''Pokémon'', a small team led by Hiro Nakamura went through the individual Pokémon, renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from Nintendo Co. Ltd. In addition, during this process, Nintendo trademarked the 151 Pokémon names in order to ensure they would be unique to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staff |title=What's the Deal with Pokémon? |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |page=172 |date=November 1999 |issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the translation process, it became apparent that simply altering the games' text from Japanese to English was impossible; the games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to the fragile state of their [[source code]], a side effect of the unusually lengthy development time.&lt;ref name="powerup poke" /&gt; Therefore, the games were based on the more modern Japanese version of ''Blue''; modeling its programming and artwork, but keeping the same distribution of Pokémon found in the Japanese ''Red'' and ''Green'' cartridges, respectively.&lt;ref name="EGMgreen" /&gt;

As the finished ''Red'' and ''Blue'' versions were being prepared for release, Nintendo allegedly spent over 50 million dollars to promote the games, fearing the series would not be appealing to American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=66|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western localization team warned that the "cute monsters" may not be accepted by American audiences, and instead recommended they be redesigned and "beefed-up". Then-president of Nintendo [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] refused and instead viewed the games' possible reception in America as a challenge to face.&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5260140/pokemon-could-have-been-muscular-monsters|title=Pokemon Could Have Been Muscular Monsters|publisher=Kotaku|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these setbacks, the reprogrammed ''Red'' and ''Blue'' versions with their original creature designs were eventually released in North America over two and a half years after ''Red'' and ''Green'' debuted in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_62.html|title=Guides: Pokemon: Blue and Red|page=62|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were received extremely well by the foreign audiences and Pokémon went on to become a lucrative franchise in America.&lt;ref name="kotaku" /&gt;

''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' set the precedent for what has become a blockbuster, multibillion-dollar franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pokemon Franchise Approaches 150 Million Games Sold |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-04-2005/0004159206&amp;EDATE= |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Nintendo |date=4 October 2005 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426072034/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104 |archivedate=April 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, ''Red'', ''Green'', and ''Blue'' combined had sold 10.4 million copies in Japan.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:28|title=Pokemania: Secrets Behind the International Phenomenon|publisher=Columbia Business School|author=Safier, Joshua | author2=Nakaya, Sumie|date=2000-02-07|accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of its run, it had sold a total combined sale of 9.85 million in the United States&lt;ref name="magicboxus"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|title=US Platinum Videogame Chart|publisher=The Magic Box|accessdate=2008-08-03| date=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an additional 3.56 million have been sold in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|reason=Number not found anywhere except in references to Wikipedia.

The games received mostly positive reviews from critics, holding an aggregate score of 87.86% on [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="Game Rankings" /&gt; Special praise was given to its [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] features: the ability to trade and battle Pokémon with one another. Craig Harris of [[IGN]] gave the games a "masterful" 10 out of 10, noting that: "Even if you finish the quest, you still might not have all the Pokémon in the game. The challenge to catch 'em all is truly the game's biggest draw". He also commented on the popularity of the game, especially among children, describing it as a "craze".&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Peter Bartholow, who gave the games a "great" 8.8 out of 10, cited the graphics and audio as somewhat primitive but stated that these were the games' only drawbacks. He praised the titles' replay value due to their customization and variety, and commented upon their universal appeal: "Under its cuddly exterior, Pokémon is a serious and unique RPG with lots of depth and excellent multiplayer extensions. As an RPG, the game is accessible enough for newcomers to the genre to enjoy, but it will entertain hard-core fans as well. It's easily one of the best Game Boy games to date".&lt;ref name="GameSpot" /&gt;

The success of these games has been attributed to their innovative gaming experience rather than audiovisual effects. Papers published by the [[Columbia Business School]] indicate both American and Japanese children prefer the actual gameplay of a game over special audio or visual effects. In ''Pokémon'' games, the lack of these artificial effects has actually been said to promote the child's imagination and creativity.&lt;ref name="columbia" /&gt; "With all the talk of [[game engine]]s and [[texture mapping]] and so on, there is something refreshing about this superlative gameplay which makes you ignore the cutesy 8-bit graphics" commented ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/sep/30/onlinesupplement15?commentpage=1|title=Monsters to the rescue|publisher=The Guardian|author=Bodle, Andy and Greg Howson|date=1999-09-30|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video gaming website [[1UP.com]] composed a list of the "Top 5 'Late to the Party' Games" showing selected titles that "prove a gaming platform's untapped potential" and were one of the last games released for their respective [[video game console|console]]. ''Red'' and ''Blue'' were ranked first and called Nintendo's "secret weapon" when the games were brought out for the Game Boy in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="1UPTop5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3167655|title=Best Games to Come Out Late in a System's Life|publisher=1UP|author=1UP Staff|accessdate=2008-09-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226064448/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3167655|archivedate=2009-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' listed the ''Red'' and ''Blue'' versions together as the third best video game for the [[Game Boy]]/[[Game Boy Color]], stating that something about the game kept them playing until they caught every Pokémon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 2008 |title=Nintendo Power&amp;nbsp;– The 20th Anniversary Issue! |volume=231 |series= [[Nintendo Power]] |issue=231 |page=72 |pages= |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[San Francisco, California]] |type=Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Ben Reeves called them (along with ''Pokémon Yellow'', ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'') the second best Game Boy games and stated that it had more depth than it appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 25 Best Game Boy Games Of All Time |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/06/24/the-25-best-game-boy-games-of-all-time.aspx |work=[[Game Informer]] |last=Reeves |first=Ben |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' named the games one of the best Nintendo games of all time, placing 52nd on their list of the top 100 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=7258|title=Feature: 100 Best Nintendo Games|publisher=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''|first=Tom|last=East|date=2009-03-02|accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red'' and ''Blue'' made number 72 on ''IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time'' in 2003, in which the reviewers noted that the pair of games "started a revolution" and praised the deep game design and complex strategy, as well the option to trade between other games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2003/71-80.html|author=Staff|title=The Top 100: 71–80|publisher=IGN|date=2003-04-30|accessdate=2008-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910004823/http://top100.ign.com/2003/71-80.html|archive-date=2009-09-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, it climbed the ranks to number 70 in the updated list, with the games' legacy again noted to have inspired multiple video game sequels, movies, television shows, and other merchandise, strongly rooting it in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2005/061-070.html|title=IGN's Top 100 Games 061-070|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009135800/http://top100.ign.com/2005/061-070.html|archive-date=2014-10-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''Red'' and ''Blue'' were ranked at number 37 on the list, and the reviewers remarked at the games' longevity:

{{quote|For everything that has come in the decade since, it all started right here with ''Pokémon Red''/''Blue''''. Its unique blend of exploration, training, battling and trading created a game that was far more in-depth than it first appeared and one that actually forced the player to socialize with others in order to truly experience all that it had to offer. The game is long, engrossing and sparkles with that intangible addictiveness that only the best titles are able to capture. Say what you will about the game, but few gaming franchises can claim to be this popular ten years after they first hit store shelves.&lt;ref name="2007Top100"/&gt;}}

The games are widely credited with starting and helping pave the way for the successful multibillion-dollar series.&lt;ref name="1UPTop5" /&gt; Five years after ''Red'' and ''Blue'''s initial release, Nintendo celebrated its "Pokémoniversary". George Harrison, the senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications of Nintendo of America, stated that "those precious gems [''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue''] have evolved into ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. The release of ''Pokémon Pinball'' kicks off a line of great new Pokémon adventures that will be introduced in the coming months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/435/435984p1.html|title=IGN: Nintendo Celebrates Pokemoniversary|publisher=IGN|first=Craig|last=Harris|date=2003-08-29|accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has since sold over 300 million games, all accredited to the enormous success of the original ''Red'' and ''Blue'' versions.&lt;ref name="1UPTop5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-game-sales-pass-300-million-units/1100-6455215/|title=Pokemon Game Sales Pass 300 Million Units|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|date=2017-11-27|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 2014, an anonymous Australian programmer launched [[Twitch Plays Pokémon|Twitch Plays ''Pokémon'']], a "social experiment" on the video streaming website [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]]. The project was a [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] attempt to play a modified version of ''Pokémon Red'' by typing commands into the channel's chat log, with an average of 50,000 viewers participating at the same time.

The game was designed to resemble the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime series]], with the player receiving a [[Pikachu]] as his starter Pokémon, and his rival starting with an Eevee. Some non-player characters resemble those from the anime, including Team Rocket: [[Team Rocket (anime)|Jessie and James]].

Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and not much of an improvement over the previous games, [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'' were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2008/080425e.pdf#page=6|title=Financial Results Briefing for Fiscal Year Ended March 2008|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2008-04-25|page=6|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2015, Nintendo announced during a Nintendo Direct that the original generation of ''Pokémon'' games would be released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Virtual Console]] service on February 27, 2016, the 20th anniversary of the games' original Japanese release.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1892">'''Schizocoely''' (adjective forms: '''schizocoelous''' or '''schizocoelic''') is a process by which some animal [[embryonic development|embryos develop]]. [[Animal]]s which develop through schizocoely are known as '''schizocoelomates'''. Schizocoely occurs when a [[coelom]] (body cavity) is formed by splitting the [[mesoderm]]al embryonic tissue.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{Cite book

Schizocoelous development is typically attributed to [[protostomes]]:&lt;ref name=moore /&gt; phyla [[Mollusca]], [[Annelida]], and [[Arthropoda]], but some [[deuterostomes]] can exhibit schizocoely as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} &lt;!--'''NOTE TO EXPERT EDITOR: This still doesn't make any sense. Saying it is exclusive is NOT compatible with saying that some deuterostomes can exhibit it. Unless you mean to suggest that "Schizocoelous development" is different from "schizocoely", in which case you need to explain.''' ... Better now?--&gt;

The term refers to the order of organization of cells in the [[gastrula]] leading to development of the [[coelom]]. In these three phyla of organisms, the [[mesoderm]] (the middle [[germ layer]]) forms as a solid mass of migrated cells from the single layer of the gastrula. The new mesoderm then splits, creating the pocket-like cavity of the coelom.

He was born in [[Oakham, Massachusetts]] in 1792. He studied medicine, was licensed to practice in [[Vermont]] in 1815 and settled in [[Newfane, Vermont|Newfane]] there. In 1822, he moved to Frost Village near [[Waterloo, Quebec|Waterloo]] in [[Lower Canada]] with his family. He was licensed to practice medicine in the province in 1830. He served as surgeon to a militia battalion and was also [[coroner]] for the Bedford District and a justice of the peace in Shefford County. Foster also was a founder and served as administrator for the Shefford Academy in Frost Village. In 1841, he was elected to represent [[Shefford (electoral district)|Shefford]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] and was reelected in 1844. He served as a governor of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada from 1847 to 1866. In 1857, he moved to [[Knowlton, Quebec|Knowlton]] where he continued to practice medicine until his death in 1868.

His son [[Asa Belknap Foster|Asa Belknap]] also served as a member of the Legislative Assembly and was named to the Senate of Canada.

The latter, along with ''STTL'', had replaced in about mid-first century CE, the older model, common during the first century BCE and first century CE, of ending the inscription with ''[[wikt:hic#Latin|Hic]] [[wikt:situs#Latin|situs]] [[wikt:est#Latin|est]]'' or ''Hic [[wikt:sita#Latin|sita]] est'' ("he ''or'' she lies here"; abbreviated to ''HSE''),  and the name of the dead  person.&lt;ref name="Keppie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Roman Inscriptions|first=Lawrence|last=Keppie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJmFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=107|chapter=Gravestones and tomb monuments|publication-date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|A very common, through space and time, phrase in Greek and the analogue of the Latin one is {{lang|grc|[[wikt:Ἐνθάδε#Greek|Ἐνθάδε]] [[wikt:κεῖμαι#Greek|κεῖται]]}}, ''Enthade keitai'', "Here lies".}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="902">In '''''Spies v Smith''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], the [[testator]] was [[mentally retarded]] and [[epileptic]], and had appointed the two daughters of his [[step-mother]] as his sole [[heir]]s. When the testator’s father died, he went to live with his [[uncle]]. Thereafter, the testator made a new [[will and testament|will]] appointing the sons of his uncle as his heirs.

The testator’s step-mother alleged that his uncle had unduly influenced him to pass this second will, but the court held that she did not discharge the requisite onus of proving such.

[[Image:Cryobot.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a cryobot deploying a robotic submersible]]
'''SPINDLE''' ('''Sub-glacial Polar Ice Navigation, Descent, and Lake Exploration''') is a 2-stage autonomous vehicle system consisting of a robotic ice-penetrating carrier vehicle ([[cryobot]]) and an autonomous submersible HAUV (hovering autonomous underwater vehicle).&lt;ref name='Harvard 2016'&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.C51E..07S SPINDLE: A 2-Stage Nuclear-Powered Cryobot for Ocean World Exploration]. W Stone, B Hogan, VL Siegel, et al.  ''AGU Fall Meeting'', 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The cryobot is designed to descend through an ice body into a sub-surface ocean and deploy the HAUV submersible to conduct long range reconnaissance, life search, and sample collection.&lt;ref name='COllins 2017'&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/searching-ice-bound-life-on-earth-3980834 Searching for Ice-bound Life on Earth]. Carolyn Collins Petersen, ''Thought Co''. 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The HAUV submesible will return to, and auto-dock with, the cryobot at the conclusion of the mission for subsequent data uplink and sample return to the surface.

The SPINDLE designed is targeted at sub-glacial lakes such as [[Lake Vostok]] and South Pole Lake in [[Antarctica]]. SPINDLE would develop the technologies for a [[Flagship Program|Flagship-class]] mission to either the shallow lakes of Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the sub-surface ocean of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], or the geyser sources on both Europa and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].&lt;ref name='Harvard 2016'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Stone Aerospace'&gt;[http://www.stoneaerospace.com Stone Aerospace]. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The project is funded by NASA and is being designed at [[Stone Aerospace]] under the supervision of Principal Investigator [[William Stone (caver)|Bill Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsu.edu/mediacenter/news/2016/03/04spindle.as.php Researchers Secure NASA Funding for Robotic Search for Life Beneath Antarctica].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Stretch marks''', also known as '''striae''', are a form of [[scar]]ring on the [[skin]] with an off-color hue. Over time they may diminish, but will not disappear completely. Stretch marks form during rapid growth of the body, such as during puberty or pregnancy. In pregnancy they usually form during the last trimester, and usually on the belly, but also commonly occur on the breasts, thighs, hips, lower back and buttocks. These are known as striae gravidarum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/your-pregnancy/are-pregnancy-stretchmarks-different/ |title=Are Pregnancy Stretch Marks Different?|publisher=American Pregnancy Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119091203/http://americanpregnancy.org/commondiscomforts/PE-pregnancy-stretchmarks-different.html|archivedate=19 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Stretch marks are caused by tearing of the [[dermis]]. This is often from the rapid stretching of the skin associated with rapid growth or rapid weight changes. Stretch marks may also be influenced by hormonal changes associated with puberty, [[pregnancy]], [[bodybuilding]], or [[hormone replacement therapy]].

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
There is no evidence that creams used during pregnancy prevent stretch marks.&lt;ref name=CC-Brennan-2012 /&gt; Once they have formed there is no clearly effective treatment, though various methods have been attempted and studied.&lt;ref name=L2014/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms == 
Striae, or "stretch marks", begin as [[red]]dish or [[purple]] [[lesions]], which can appear anywhere on the body, but are most likely to appear in places where larger amounts of [[fat]] are stored; the most common places are the [[abdomen]] (especially near the [[navel]]), [[breast]]s, upper [[arm]]s, underarms, [[back]], [[thigh]]s (both inner and outer), [[hip]]s, and [[buttocks]].  Over time, they tend to [[atrophy]] and lose [[pigmentation]]. The affected areas appear empty, and are soft to the touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/568975/stretch-mark|title=Stretch Mark|accessdate=1 November 2009|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stretch marks occur in the [[dermis]], the resilient middle tissue layer that helps the [[skin]] retain its shape. No stretch marks will form as long as there is support within the dermis; stretching plays a role in where the marks occur and in what direction they run, however, there are a number of contributing factors (see: "Causes", below) to their formation.
They can (but do not always) cause a burning and itching sensation, as well as emotional distress.  They pose no health risk in and of themselves, and do not compromise the body's ability to function normally and repair itself, however, they are often considered a [[Beauty|cosmetic]] nuisance.&lt;ref name="Stretch Mark"/&gt; Young women are generally affected the most and often seek treatment for them from a dermatologist&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=AL|last2=Agredano| first2=YZ| last3=Kimball| first3=AB| title=Risk factors associated with striae gravidarum| journal=J Am Acad Dermatol| year=2004| volume=51| pages=881–5| doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2004.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Causes ==
Stretch marks appear to be caused by stretching of the skin. This is especially true when there is an increase in [[cortisone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stretch-marks/basics/causes/con-20032624|title=Stretch marks - Symptoms and causes|author=|date=|website=mayoclinic.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, an increase in cortisone levels can increase the probability or severity of stretch marks by reducing the skin's pliability; more specifically, it affects the [[dermis]] by preventing the [[fibroblast]]s from forming [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] fibers, necessary to keep rapidly growing skin taut. This can create a lack of supportive material as the skin is stretched, and lead to dermal and [[epidermis|epidermal]] tearing, which in turn can produce scarring in the form of stretch marks. This is particularly the case when there is new tissue growth (which can interfere with the underlying physical support of the dermis or epidermis, by displacing the supportive tissue).

Examples of cases where stretch marks are common, also given by the Mayo Clinic, include weight gain (in the form of [[fat]] and/or [[muscle]]), [[pregnancy]], and [[adolescence|adolescent]] [[growth spurt]]s, though it is also noted that some medications, as well as other medical conditions and diseases, may increase the likelihood of stretch marks appearing. In the case of medication, the Clinic points to "[[Corticosteroid]] creams, lotions and pills and chronic use of oral or systemic [[steroid]]s" as a common contributing factor; in the case of medical conditions that can contribute to stretch marks, examples given include [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[Marfan syndrome]], and "adrenal gland diseases".

===Pregnancy===
Pregnancy stretch marks, also known as striae gravidarum, is a specific form of [[scarring]] of the [[skin]] of the abdominal area due to rapid expansion of the [[uterus]] as well as sudden weight gain during pregnancy. About 90% of women are affected.&lt;ref name=BJD2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korgavkar|first1=K|last2=Wang|first2=F|title=Stretch marks during pregnancy: a review of topical prevention.|journal=The British Journal of Dermatology|date=March 2015|volume=172|issue=3|pages=606–15|pmid=25255817|doi=10.1111/bjd.13426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional factors appear to promote the appearance of stretchmarks: one study of 324 women, done just after they had given birth, demonstrated that low maternal age, high body mass index, weight gain over 15&amp;nbsp;kg (33 pounds) and higher neonatal birth weight were independently correlated with the occurrence of striae. Teenagers were found to be at the highest risk of developing severe striae.&lt;ref name="Striae gravidarum in primiparae"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atwal |first1=G.S.S. |last2=Manku |first2=L.K. |last3=Griffiths |first3=C.E.M. |last4=Polson |first4=D.W. |authorlink3=Chris Griffiths (dermatologist) |title=Striae gravidarum in primiparae |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=155 |issue=5 |pages=965–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17034526 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These off-color blemishes are [[Symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy|symptoms of pregnancy]] caused by the tearing of the [[dermis]], resulting in [[atrophy]] and loss of [[rete ridges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kroumpouzos |first1=G |last2=Cohen |first2=LM| title=Specific dermatoses of pregnancy: an evidenced-based systematic review| journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol| year=2003| volume=188| pages=1083–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scars often appear as reddish or bluish streaks on the abdomen, and can also appear on the breasts and thighs. Some of these striae disappear with time, while others remain as permanent discolorations of the body.&lt;ref name="Stretch Mark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stretch-marks/DS01081k |title=Stretch Mark |accessdate=2011-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical distension and rapidly developing areas of the body during [[pregnancy]] (such as the [[abdomen]], [[breasts]], and [[thighs]]) are most commonly associated with striae formation. Some have suggested that [[relaxin]] and [[estrogen]] combined with higher levels of [[cortisol]] during pregnancy can cause an accumulation of muocopolysaccharides, which increases water absorption of [[connective tissue]], making it prime for tearing under mechanical stress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Striae gravidarum in primiparae"/&gt;  There also seems to be an association between higher body mass indices and in women with bigger babies and the incidence and severity of striae. Also, younger women seem to be at higher risk of developing striae during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas| first1=RGR| last2=Liston| first2=WA| title=Clinical associations of striae gravidarum| journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology| year=2004| volume=24| number=3| pages=270–27| doi=10.1080/014436104101001660779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence and severity of striae gravidarum varies among populations. The current literature suggest that in the general population of the [[US]], there is a 50%-90% prevalence of striae associated with pregnancy,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; partly as a result of the normal hormonal changes of pregnancy and partly due to stretching of skin fibers.&lt;ref name=CC-Brennan-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=M|author2=Young, G |author3=Devane, D |title=Topical preparations for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=14 November 2012|volume=11|pages=CD000066|pmid=23152199|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0010450/|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000066.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tunzi-2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tunzi|first=M|author2=Gray, GR |title=Common skin conditions during pregnancy|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 January 2007|volume=75|issue=2|pages=211–8|pmid=17263216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women experience striae gravidarum during their first pregnancy. Nearly 45% percent of women develop striae gravidarum before 24 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref name="Stretch Mark"/&gt; Many women who develop lesions during the first pregnancy do not develop them during later pregnancies. Genetic factors such as family history and race also seem to be predictive in the appearance of striae.&lt;ref name="pmid17263216"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tunzi M, Gray GR |title=Common skin conditions during pregnancy |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=211–8 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17263216 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
A systematic review has not found evidence that creams and oils are useful for preventing or reducing stretch marks in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CC-Brennan-2012 /&gt; The safety in pregnancy of one ingredient, [[Centella asiatica]], has been questioned.&lt;ref name=Tunzi-2007 /&gt; Evidence on treatments for reducing the appearance of the scars after pregnancy is limited.&lt;ref name=Tunzi-2007 /&gt;

== Treatment ==
There is no clearly useful treatment for stretch marks though various things are tried.&lt;ref name=L2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=L|last2=Ma|first2=H|last3=Li|first3=Y|title=Interventions for the treatment of stretch marks: a systematic review.|journal=Cutis|date=August 2014|volume=94|issue=2|pages=66–72|pmid=25184641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various efforts that have been tried including [[Laser resurfacing|laser treatments]], [[glycolic acid]], and [[microdermabrasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Himdani|first1=S|last2=Ud-Din|first2=S|last3=Gilmore|first3=S|last4=Bayat|first4=A|title=Striae distensae: a comprehensive review and evidence-based evaluation of prophylaxis and treatment.|journal=The British Journal of Dermatology|date=March 2014|volume=170|issue=3|pages=527–47|pmid=24125059|doi=10.1111/bjd.12681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topical [[tretinoin]] is categorized by the FDA as a known [[teratogen]] (causing malformations in fetuses) in animals, without adequate human studies on safety in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=DailyMed-Tretinoin&gt;{{cite web|title=Renova (tretinoin) cream|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=ad4cd608-ee26-4467-9957-a95b33101f9a|work=DailyMed|publisher=FDA and National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carboxytherapy]] has been used; however, there is a lack of evidence to support its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | year=2009 | title=Carboxytherapy And Mesotherapy Unproven |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/159481.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since ancient times, pregnant women have sought remedies to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. Both ancient [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used [[olive oil]], while [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] and [[Somalis]] used [[frankincense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/f/franki31.html |title=Botany |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[Medical terminology]] for these kinds of markings includes striae atrophicae, vergetures, stria distensae, striae cutis distensae, lineae atrophicae, linea albicante, or simply striae.
