      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5260">The '''1970 British Cohort Study''' (BCS70) is a continuing, multi-disciplinary [[longitudinal survey]] monitoring the development of babies born in the UK during the week of 5–11 April 1970.

==History==
Since the start of the BCS70, eight full sets of data have been collected in 1970, 1975, 1980, 1986, 1996, 1999/2000, 2004/2005 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/444794/DFE-RR458_Summary_of_longitudinal_surveys.pdf|title=Summary of longitudinal surveys|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=2015|website=Department for Education|publisher=British Government|page=9|isbn=978-1-78105-510-6|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following survey was planned for 2016/2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/1970-british-cohort-study-2016-17-survey/|title=1970 British Cohort Study: 2016-17 Survey|last=Sullivan|first=Alice|date=2015-09-08|website=Health Research Authority|publisher=National Health Service|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wave in 1970, called the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=810&amp;sitesectiontitle=BCS+1970 British Births Survey], was conducted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100328202035/http://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/research/national-birthday-trust-fund/ National Birthday Trust Fund] together with the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] in order to collect information to compare with those of the [[National Child Development Study]] (NCDS). The following two sweeps in 1975 and 1980, when the study was known as the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=803&amp;sitesectiontitle=BCS+1975 Child Health and Education Study] (CHES), were carried out by the Department of Child Health at Bristol University. The 1986 survey was conducted by the [http://www.longviewuk.com/pages/iccs.shtml International Centre for Child Studies] and called Youthscan which was then taken over for the following surveys by the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU), now known as the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies] (CLS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/bcs70/l33229.asp ESDS Longitudinal, BCS70 dataset guide], retrieved September 17, 2009.

The scope of the BCS70 has been broadened in the course of the different surveys. While the focus was on medical aspects at birth, factors such as physical, educational, social and economic development were subsequently taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5585&amp;amp;key=/&amp;amp;flag=true Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS), BC70 catalogue record entry], retrieved September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology and scope==
The primary method of data collection consists of face-to-face interviews (with the parents), self-completion questionnaires and psychological and educational measurements. The sample size included 17,287 babies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland born in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/bcs70.asp BCS70 dataset guide], retrieved September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey results==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11049">The '''2010 fake housing loan in India''' was uncovered by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) in India. CBI arrested eight top-ranking officials of public sector banks and financial institutions, including the [[Life Insurance Corporation of India|LIC Housing Finance]] CEO Ramchandran Nair, in connection with the scam.&lt;ref name="deccanherald_cbi_busts"&gt;{{cite news

==CBI investigations==
CBI alleged that the officers of various public sector banks and financial institutions received bribes from a private financial services company, which acted as a mediator for corporate loans and other facilities from financial institutions. The bank officials sanctioned large-scale corporate loans to realty developers, overriding mandatory conditions for such approvals along with other irregularities.&lt;ref name="deccanherald_cbi_busts"/&gt;

The Central Bureau of investigation arrested number of high official from the several financial institutes in India in connection with the housing scam in November 24, 2010. Smith (2010) stated that findings are shocking where the head officers of several banks and financial institutes are involved in corporate corruption. 
Precisely, the banks and financial officials were from the public sectors including LIC, Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Punjab National Bank. However, ) stated that since the matter was related to the erosion of funds from the LIC housing and Finance Limited, event was named as the LIC housing and Finance Scandal. 
Lamont (2010) cited that the officers from the high rank including the secretary of LIC Investment, general managers, directors and deputy managers of banks were involved in taking out the funds from LIC in appropriate and unethical way.
Smith (2010) said that these officials were acting as the middleman to provide the funds to the main parties and in return they were having hefty amount of funds from the real investors, insurers and other consumers. 
Smith (2010) regarded this as the distortion of the corporate governance system where the business ethics were neglected to sustain the core business activities of the public sector banking firm. 
Meanwhile, Economic Times stated that the officials were charged with the exploiting of funds, looting, corrupting corporate loan process and manipulating and overriding with the regulations of the LIC Housing and Finance Limited in regard to the approvals and other rules and regulations. 
Nonetheless, The loans provided through this manner were estimated to be worth of 85 Billion Dollars, comes as the biggest scandal in the Housing Finance in Asia 
However, the stock price took a sharp dip soon after the event. Apparently, LICHF had a good run till September 2010 when it reached Rs.299 and the growth rate undoubtedly, received the appreciation by the investors and other shareholders. The stock recorded no significant changes thereafter but the appearance of corporate scandal shook the stock price chart and the price dip to Rupees 150 by the end of year 2010. 
At present the stock price is stands at around rupees 190 and gaining its momentum over a period of time but however, Lamont (2010) felt that the combination of factors that happened in the last quarter of FY10 were accountable for the sharp decline in the LIC Housing and Finance Share price. 
Reuters stated that LIC Housing and Finance is looking forward to raise the capital to the tune of Rupees 25000 Crores in 2011-12 through debt. Eventually, the technical experts believed that company is developing its core competencies and capabilities and undoubtedly, investors would revive the stock price and current Market changes and company’s development will be seen through the price momentum.
However, experts believed that the Housing and Finance Scandals by the top officials in LIC and other banking institutes will always stand to harm the future potential of such companies but however, the future and the endless opportunities lies in the hand of ultimate investors.
Eventually, Online newspaper, Rediff quoted as saying that most of the brokers are taking up the stock of LICHF after the scam as related to the current project being performed by the company. Namely, IIFL, Aditya Birla, IL&amp;FS are impressed by the current progress by the company and building up the stock ay higher rate.
However, Reuters stated that the Financial Budget introduced by the Indian Planning Commission had slightly adverse effects on the stock of banking, insurance, mortgages and other related sector in the industries. However, the company has been quoted as saying that they would include the margin between 2.8 and 3% in relation to the rising interest rates and their effects on the share price.
However, In response the scam, the Reserve Bank of India and other regulatory and financial bodies attempted to reform the housing finance sector by making several supervision and security measures in this regard. 
Eventually, the corporate scam destroyed the interest and confidence of investors and thus, the monetary and regulatory authorities must execute their task in relation to safeguarding the interests of investors.
Apparently, Smith (2010) stated that the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] exposed the stock price dip to 18% of the prevailing market rate after the scam and other banks who were involved saw a decline between 5 and 15% during the time. Hence, it was anticipated that investors believed in the core values and company’s relation with the investors and the stock changes occur in the short span of time however, the stock is futuristic for the long term.

CBI's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) raided offices of the public sector banks and LIC Housing Finance in six cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Jaipur, Kolkata and Jalandhar), to recover incriminating documents.&lt;ref name="deccanherald_cbi_busts"/&gt;

According to CBI, the companies to which the loans in question were given include:&lt;ref name="wsj_bankers_arrested"&gt;{{cite web

The CBI EOW also suspected that the companies may have inflated their assets value and balance sheets in order to make themselves eligible for the loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to CBI, an employee of the financial services firm had expressed his willingness to turn witness in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Reactions ==
Most firms, including BGR Energy and Oberoi Realty denied any role in the scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The scam was discovered shortly after the [[Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|2010 Commonwealth Games corruption controversy]] and the [[Adarsh Housing Society Mumbai]] scam. The investors were rattled as news of the arrests broke in Mumbai. The share of the LIC Housing Finance, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India as well as other banking and real-estate stock declined.&lt;ref name="wsj_bankers_arrested"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union finance ministry initially claimed that the case was a bribery incident, and not a large-scale scam. The CBI officials had indicated that the size of the scandal could be worth over Rs 1,000 crore, but the finance ministry officials claimed that the magnitude of the scandal was too insignificant to affect the Indian financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The income-tax (IT) department decided to investigate the books of those involved in the scam, after receiving primary reports from CBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, many political analysts believe innocent bankers were implicated in this falsely created scam to defuse attention of the common man against the much larger and serious scams done by the ruling Indian government, notably of corrupt politicians like CWG minister Suresh Kalmadi and ex-telecom minister A Raja.

Four radical [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] separately detonated three homemade bombs in quick succession aboard [[London Underground]] trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in [[Tavistock Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/7-7-anniversary-uk-s-risk-of-terror-attack-higher-now-than-days-of-london-bombings-1-7341303|title=7/7 Anniversary: UK's Risk of Terror Attack Higher Now than Days of London Bombings'|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train bombings occurred on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] near {{lus|Aldgate}} and at [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines)|Edgware Road]], and on the [[Piccadilly line]] near {{lus|Russell Square}}.

Fifty-two people of 18 different nationalities, all of whom were UK residents, were killed, and more than 700 were injured, in the attacks, making it Britain's deadliest terrorist incident since the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] near [[Lockerbie]], Scotland, as well as the country's first Islamist suicide attack.

The explosions were caused by [[acetone peroxide|triacetone triperoxide]]-based [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] packed into [[backpack]]s. The bombings were followed two weeks later by [[21 July 2005 London bombings|a series of attempted attacks]] that failed to cause injury or damage. The 7 July attacks occurred the day after London had won its bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].

{{see also|Attacks on the London Underground}}

At 8:49&amp;nbsp;am, three bombs were detonated on board London Underground trains within 50 seconds of each other:

# The first bomb exploded on a six-car [[London Underground C69 and C77 Stock]] [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] sub-surface train, number 204, travelling eastbound between [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] and [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]]. The train had left [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]] about eight minutes earlier. At the time of the explosion, the train's third car was approximately 100 yards (90&amp;nbsp;m) along the tunnel from Liverpool Street. The parallel track of the [[Hammersmith &amp; City line]] between Liverpool Street and [[Aldgate East tube station|Aldgate East]] was also damaged in the blast.
# The second bomb exploded in the second car of another six-car London Underground C69 and C77 Stock Circle line sub-surface train, number 216, which had just left platform 4 at [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines)|Edgware Road]] and was travelling westbound towards [[Paddington tube station (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines)|Paddington]]. The train had left King's Cross St Pancras about eight minutes previously. There were several other trains nearby at the time of the explosion; an eastbound Circle line train (arriving at platform 3 at Edgware Road from Paddington) was passing next to the bombed train and was damaged,&lt;ref name="lucky-driver"&gt;{{cite news |title=I'm lucky to be here, says driver |date=11 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4671767.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110184312/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4671767.stm|archivedate=10 November 2006 |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was a wall that later collapsed. Two other trains were at Edgware Road: an unidentified train on platform 2 and a southbound Hammersmith &amp; City line service that had just arrived at platform 1.
# A third bomb was detonated on a 6-car [[London Underground 1973 Stock]] [[Piccadilly line]] deep-level Underground train, number 311, travelling southbound from King's Cross St Pancras to [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]]. The device exploded approximately one minute after the service departed King's Cross, by which time it had travelled about 500 yards (450&amp;nbsp;m). The explosion occurred at the rear of the first car of the train—number 166—causing severe damage to the rear of that car as well as the front of the second one.&lt;ref name="north-diary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4670099.stm|title=Coming together as a city|accessdate=12 November 2006|date=15 July 2005|last=North|first=Rachel|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding tunnel also sustained damage.

It was originally thought that there had been six, rather than three, explosions on the Underground network. The bus bombing brought the reported total to seven; this was clarified later in the day. The erroneous reporting can be attributed to the fact that the blasts occurred on trains that were between stations, causing wounded passengers to emerge from both stations, giving the impression that there was an incident at each. Police also revised the timings of the tube blasts: initial reports had indicated that they occurred during a period of almost half an hour. This was due to initial confusion at London Underground (LU), where the explosions were originally believed to have been caused by [[Voltage spike|power surges]]. An early report, made in the minutes after the explosions, involved a person under a train, while another described a derailment (both of which did occur, but only as a result of the explosions). A [[Code amber alert (London Underground)|code amber alert]] was declared by LU at 09:19, and LU began to cease the network's operations, ordering trains to continue only to the next station and suspending all services.&lt;ref name="tube-log"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4674469.stm|title=Tube log shows initial confusion|accessdate=12 November 2006|date=12 July 2005|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the bombs are understood to have varied due to the differing characteristics of the tunnels in which they occurred:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/russell_sq.stm|title=Indepth London Attacks|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Circle line is a "[[cut and cover]]" sub-surface tunnel, about 7&amp;nbsp;m (21&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. As the tunnel contains two parallel tracks, it is relatively wide. The two explosions on the Circle line were probably able to vent their force into the tunnel, reducing their destructive force.
* The Piccadilly line is a deep-level tunnel, up to 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) below the surface and with narrow (3.56&amp;nbsp;m, or 11&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;8¼&amp;nbsp;in) single-track tubes and just 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;in) clearances. This confined space reflected the blast force, concentrating its effect.

===Tavistock Square bus===
[[File:Trapped underground.jpg|thumb|left|Passengers awaiting evacuation from a bombed train between [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross]] and [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]]]]

Almost one hour after the attacks on the London Underground, a fourth bomb was detonated on the top deck of a [[London Buses route 30|number 30]] [[double-decker bus]], a [[Dennis Trident 2]] (fleet number 17758, registration LX03&amp;nbsp;BUF, two years in service at the time) operated by [[Stagecoach London]] and travelling its route from [[Marble Arch]] to [[Hackney Wick]].

Earlier, the bus had passed through the [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross area]] as it travelled from Hackney Wick to Marble Arch. At its final destination, the bus turned around and started the return route to Hackney Wick. It left Marble Arch at 9&amp;nbsp;am and arrived at [[Euston bus station]] at 9:35&amp;nbsp;am, where crowds of people had been evacuated from the tube and were boarding buses.

[[File:7 July London bombings locations.png|right|thumb|300px|Locations of the bombings on a Central London tube map]]
The explosion at 9:47&amp;nbsp;am in Tavistock Square ripped off the roof and destroyed the rear portion of the bus. The blast took place near BMA House, the headquarters of the [[British Medical Association]], on [[Upper Woburn Place]]. A number of doctors and medical staff in or near that building were able to provide immediate emergency assistance.

Witnesses reported seeing "half a bus flying through the air". [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' later reported that two injured bus passengers said that they saw a man exploding in the bus.&lt;ref name="campbell-laville"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/13/july7.uksecurity6|title=British suicide bombers carried out London attacks, say police|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|first2=Sandra|last2=Laville|accessdate=15 November 2006|date=13 July 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the bomb inside the bus meant the front of the vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers at the front of the top deck survived, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those at the rear of the bus suffered more serious injuries. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the death toll from the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.

The bombed bus was subsequently covered with tarpaulin and removed by low-loader for forensic examination at a secure [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] site. The vehicle was ultimately returned to Stagecoach and scrapped thereafter on 15 October 2009. A replacement bus, a new [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] (fleet number 18500, which has been changed since to 19000, registration LX55&amp;nbsp;HGC), was named "Spirit of London". In October 2012, the "Spirit of London" bus was set alight in an arson attack.&lt;ref name=bbcarson&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20014969|title=Suspected arson on 7/7 tribute bus 'Spirit of London'|publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2012|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was repaired and refurbished at a cost of £60,000 and re-entered service in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2013/2013-23-04-spirit-of-london-relaunch.aspx|title=Stagecoach relaunches 'Spirit of London' bus following arson attack – Stagecoach Group|publisher=stagecoach.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 14-year-old girls were charged for the attack.&lt;ref name=bbcarson/&gt;

The 52 victims were of diverse backgrounds; among them were several foreign-born British nationals and foreign exchange students. The majority of the victims lived in or near London. Because of train delays before the attacks and subsequent transport problems caused by them, several victims died aboard trains and buses they would not normally have taken. Their ages ranged from 20 to 60 years old, with an average age of 34.

All of the victims were UK residents; 32 of them were British. One victim each came from Afghanistan, France, Ghana, Grenada, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mauritius, New Zealand, Nigeria, Romania, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. Three victims were Polish nationals, while one victim held [[Multiple citizenship|dual]] [[Vietnamese Australians|Australian-Vietnamese]] citizenship and one held dual [[Vietnamese Americans|American-Vietnamese]] citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/77-bombings-london-anniversary-live-the-52-victims-of-the-london-terror-attacks-remembered-10369569.html|title=The 52 victims of the 7/7 bombings remembered|date=6 July 2015|language=en-GB|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven of the victims were killed at Aldgate, six at Edgware Road, 26 at King's Cross and 13 at Tavistock Square.

Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Profiles===
The four suicide bombers were later identified and named as:
* '''[[Mohammad Sidique Khan]]:''' aged 30. Khan detonated his bomb just after leaving Edgware Road tube station on a train travelling toward Paddington, at 8:50&amp;nbsp;am. He lived in [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], Leeds, with his wife and young child, where he worked as a learning mentor at a primary school. The blast killed seven people, including Khan himself.
* '''[[Shehzad Tanweer]]:''' aged 22. He detonated a bomb aboard a train travelling between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate tube station, at 8:50&amp;nbsp;am. He lived in Leeds with his mother and father, working in a fish and chip shop. Eight people, including Tanweer, were killed by the explosion.
* '''[[Germaine Lindsay]]:''' aged 19. He detonated his device on a train travelling between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations, at 8:50&amp;nbsp;am. He lived in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, with his pregnant wife and young son. His blast killed 27 people, including Lindsay himself.
* '''[[Hasib Hussain]]:''' the youngest of the four at 18, Hussain detonated his bomb on the top deck of a double-decker bus at 9:47&amp;nbsp;am. He lived in Leeds with his brother and sister-in-law. 14 people, including Hussain, died in the explosion in Tavistock Square.

Three of the bombers were British-born sons of [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani immigrants]]; Lindsay was a [[conversion to Islam|convert]] born in [[British Jamaican|Jamaica]].

[[Charles Clarke]], [[Home Secretary]] when the attacks occurred, described the bombers as "[[cleanskin (security)|cleanskins]]", a term describing them as previously unknown to authorities until they carried out their attacks.&lt;ref name="TheTimes-2007-05-06"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the attacks, all four had travelled to [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, by car, then to London by train. They were recorded on CCTV arriving at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] at about 08:30&amp;nbsp;am.

On 12 July 2005, the BBC reported that the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]'s anti-terrorism chief [[Deputy Assistant Commissioner]] [[Peter Clarke (police officer)|Peter Clarke]] said that property belonging to one of the bombers had been found at both the Aldgate and Edgware Road blasts.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Videotaped statements===
Two of the bombers made videotapes describing their reasons for becoming what they called "soldiers". In a videotape broadcast by [[Al Jazeera]] on 1 September 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan, described his motivation. The tape had been edited and mentioned [[al-Qaeda]] members [[Osama Bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], describing them as "today's heroes". Khan's tape said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm London bomber: Text in full], BBC, 1 September 2005. Retrieved 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I and thousands like me are forsaking everything for what we believe. Our drive and motivation doesn't come from tangible commodities that this world has to offer. Our religion is [[Islam]], obedience to the one true God and following the footsteps of the final prophet messenger. Your democratically-elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against my people all over the world. And your support of them makes you directly responsible, just as I am directly responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and sisters. Until we feel security you will be our targets and until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation.}}

The tape continued:
{{quote|...I myself, I myself, I make [[dua]] (pray) to [[Allah]] ... to raise me amongst those whom I love like the [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]], the messengers, the martyrs and today's heroes like our beloved Sheikh Osama Bin Laden, Dr Ayman al-Zawahri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and all the other brothers and sisters that are fighting in the ... of this cause.}}

On 6 July 2006, a videotaped statement by Shehzad Tanweer was broadcast by [[Al-Jazeera]]. In the video, which may have been edited&lt;ref name="guardvideo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/06/july7.uksecurity1|title=Video of London bomber released|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include remarks by al-Zawahiri, Tanweer said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Globalization of Martyrdom: Al Qaeda, Salafi Jihad, and the Diffusion of Suicide Attacks | publisher=JHU Press | author=Moghadam, Assaf | year=2011 | pages=199 | isbn=1421401444 | chapter=The United Kingdom and the 77 Bombings | chapterurl=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=RMeqBfA9-RUC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|What you have witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to [[United States of America|America]] and Israel.}}

Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which "continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], Afghanistan, Iraq and [[Chechnya]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article683824.ece Video of London suicide bomber released], ''The Times'', 6 July 2006.

[[File:Blair G8 July7th05.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Tony Blair]] announces the attack at the [[31st G8 summit]] in Scotland]]

===Initial reports===
Initial reports suggested that a power surge on the Underground power grid had caused explosions in power circuits. This was later ruled out by power suppliers [[National Grid plc|National Grid]]. Commentators suggested that the explanation had been made because of bomb damage to power lines along the tracks; the rapid series of power failures caused by the explosions (or power being ended by means of switches at the locations to permit evacuation) looked similar, from the point of view of a control room operator, to a cascading series of circuit breaker operations that would result from a major power surge. A couple of hours after the bombings, Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed the incidents were terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incidents in London|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050707/debtext/50707-11.htm#column_465|publisher=[[United Kingdom Parliament]]|accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security alerts===
Although there were security alerts at many locations throughout the United Kingdom, no other terrorist incidents occurred outside central London. Suspicious packages were destroyed in controlled explosions in [[Edinburgh]], [[Brighton]], [[Coventry]], [[Southampton]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Darlington]] and [[Nottingham]]. Security across the country was increased to the [[UK Threat Levels|highest alert level]].

''[[The Times]]'' reported on 17 July 2005 that police sniper units were following as many as a dozen al-Qaeda suspects in Britain. The covert armed teams were ordered to shoot to kill if surveillance suggested that a terror suspect was carrying a bomb and he refused to surrender if challenged. A member of the Metropolitan Police's [[Specialist Firearms Command]] said: "These units are trained to deal with any eventuality. Since the London bombs they have been deployed to look at certain people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1697326,00.html |title=Police snipers track al-Qaeda suspects |work=The Times |date=17 July 2005 |accessdate=3 December 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022182920/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2087-1697326%2C00.html |archivedate=22 October 2006 |first=Leo |last=Lewis |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport and telecoms disruption===
[[Vodafone]] reported that its mobile telephone network reached capacity at about 10&amp;nbsp;am on the day of the bombings, and it was forced to initiate emergency procedures to prioritise emergency calls ([[ACCOLC]], the 'access overload control'). Other [[cellular network|mobile phone networks]] also reported failures. The [[BBC]] speculated that the telephone system was shut down by security services to prevent the possibility of mobile phones being used to trigger bombs. Although this option was considered, it became clear later that the intermittent unavailability of both mobile and landline telephone systems was due only to excessive usage. ACCOLC was activated only in a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} radius around Aldgate Tube Station because key emergency personnel did not have ACCOLC-enabled mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCue|first=Andy|title=7/7 bomb rescue efforts hampered by communication failings|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/networking/2006/06/05/77-bomb-rescue-efforts-hampered-by-communication-failings-39273086/|publisher=ZDNet UK|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communications failures during the emergency sparked discussions to improve London's [[emergency communication system|emergency communications system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Assembly 7 July Review Committee, follow-up re port |url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/7july/follow-up-report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107004751/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/7july/follow-up-report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 January 2012 |publisher=London Assembly |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AvoidLondon77.jpg|left|thumb|A sign on the [[M25 motorway|M25]] London orbital road warns drivers to avoid the city.]]

For most of the day, central London's public transport system was largely out of service following the complete closure of the Underground, the closure of the Zone 1 [[List of bus routes in London|bus network]], and the evacuation of incident sites such as Russell Square. Bus services restarted at 4&amp;nbsp;pm on 7 July, and most mainline railway stations resumed service soon afterward. [[River Thames|River]] vessels were pressed into service to provide a free alternative to overcrowded trains and buses. Local lifeboats were required to act as safety boats, including the Sheerness lifeboat from the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in Kent. Thousands of people chose to walk home or to the nearest Zone 2 bus or railway station. Most of the Underground, apart from the stations affected by the bombs, resumed service the next morning, though some commuters chose to stay at home. Affected stretches were also closed for police investigations.

Much of the King's Cross railway station was also closed, with the ticket hall and waiting area being used as a makeshift hospital to treat casualties. Although the station reopened later during the day, only suburban rail services were able to use it, with [[Great North Eastern Railway]] trains terminating at [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] (the service was fully restored on 9 July). King's Cross St Pancras tube station remained available only to [[Metropolitan line]] services to facilitate the ongoing recovery and investigation for a week, though [[Victoria line]] services were restored on 15 July and the [[Northern line]] on 18 July. All the damaged trains were basically removed in stages. [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras station]], located next to King's Cross, was shut on the afternoon of the attacks, with all [[Midland Mainline]] trains terminating at [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], causing disruption to services to [[Sheffield]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Derby]].

[[File:Caledonian Road tube station closed.jpg|left|thumb|Underground stations, including [[Caledonian Road tube station|Caledonian Road]] (pictured), were closed across London]]
On 25 July, the Hammersmith &amp; City line was reopened from Baker Street to Barking after the affected train was cleared at Aldgate, together with the stretch from Moorgate to Aldgate of the Metropolitan Line. The Hammersmith to Paddington part of the Hammersmith &amp; City line was a shuttle service after the bombings. On 29 July, the District line was reopened from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road, after the affected train was cleared.

On 2 August the Hammersmith &amp; City line resumed normal service; the Circle line was still suspended, though all Circle line stations are also served by other lines. The Piccadilly line service resumed on 4 August after the affected train was cleared on 16 July, and enhanced maintenance work was done. On 4 August, the Circle line was reopened again.

===Economic effect===
[[File:Headlines london bombing 7 july 2005 Waterloo station.JPG|right|thumb|160px|Headlines outside [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]]]]
There were limited reactions to the attack in the [[world economy]] as measured by [[financial market]] and [[exchange rate]] activity. The value of the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] decreased 0.89 cents to a 19-month low against the US dollar. The [[FTSE 100 Index]] fell by about 200 points during the two hours after the first attack. This was its greatest decrease since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], and it triggered the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s 'Special Measures', restricting [[panic selling]] and aimed at ensuring market stability. By the time the market closed it had recovered to only 71.3 points (1.36%) down on the previous day's three-year closing high. Markets in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain also closed about 1% down on the day.

US market indexes increased slightly, partly because the dollar index increased sharply against the pound and the euro. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] gained 31.61 to 10,302.29. The [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Composite Index]] increased 7.01 to 2075.66. The [[S&amp;P 500]] increased 2.93 points to 1197.87 after decreasing as much as 1%. Every benchmark value gained 0.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aflPCIrU37Ns&amp;refer=us|title=U.S. Stocks Rise, Erasing Losses on London Bombings; Gap Rises|first=Dune|last=Lawrence|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=7 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market values increased again on 8 July as it became clear that the damage caused by the bombings was not as great as thought initially. By end of trading the market had recovered fully to above its level at start of trading on 7 July. Insurers in the UK tend to [[reinsurance|reinsure]] their terrorist liabilities in excess of the first £75,000,000 with [[Pool Re]], a mutual insurer established by the government with major insurers. Pool Re has substantial reserves and newspaper reports indicated that claims would easily be funded.

On 9 July, the [[Bank of England]], [[HM Treasury]] and the [[Financial Services Authority]] revealed that they had instigated contingency plans immediately after the attacks to ensure that the UK financial markets could keep trading. This involved the activation of a "secret chatroom" on the British government's Financial Sector Continuity website, which allowed the institutions to communicate with the country's banks and market dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4666225.stm|title=Banks talked via secret chatroom|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media response===
[[File:Kings Cross press gazebo 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[News program|TV news]] tent at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]]]]
Continuous news coverage of the attacks was broadcast throughout 7 July, by both [[BBC One]] and [[ITV1]], uninterrupted until 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Sky News]] did not broadcast any advertisements for 24 hours. [[ITN]] confirmed later that its coverage on ITV1 was its longest uninterrupted on-air broadcast of its 50-year history. Television coverage was notable for the use of mobile telephone footage sent in by members of the public and live pictures from traffic [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras.

The [[BBC Online]] website recorded an all-time [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] peak of 11&amp;nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s at midday on 7 July. [[BBC News]] received some 1&amp;nbsp;billion total accesses throughout the course of the day (including all images, text and HTML), serving some 5.5 [[terabyte]]s of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000-page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] being awarded to London resulted in up to 5&amp;nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s. The previous all time maximum for the website followed the announcement of the [[Trial of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson verdict]], which used 7.2&amp;nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703070502/http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml|archivedate=3 July 2007|title=Statistics on BBC Webservers 7&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July it was reported that the [[British National Party]] released leaflets showing images of the 'No. 30 bus' after it was destroyed. The slogan, "Maybe now it's time to start listening to the BNP" was printed beside the photo. Home Secretary Charles Clarke described it as an attempt by the BNP to "cynically exploit the current tragic events in London to further their spread of hatred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4674675.stm|title=Politics BNP campaign uses bus bomb photo|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2005|accessdate=17 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026023429/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4674675.stm|archivedate=26 October 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media outside the UK complained that successive British governments had been unduly tolerant towards radical [[Islamist]] militants, so long as they were involved in activities outside the UK.&lt;ref name=NYTJuly8&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/international/europe/10qaeda.html?ei=5090&amp;en=03dee04dd2987f2b&amp;ex=1278648000&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;pagewanted=all|title=For a Decade, London Thrived as a Busy Crossroads of Terror|first1=Elaine|last1=Sciolino|first2=Don|last2=van Natta, Jr.|work=The New York Times|date=10 July 2005|accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's alleged reluctance to extradite or prosecute terrorist suspects resulted in London being dubbed ''[[Londonistan]]'' by the columnist [[Melanie Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;Philips, Melanie. ''Londonistan''. Encounter Books, 2006, p. 189 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of responsibility===
Even before the identity of the bombers became known, former Metropolitan Police commissioner [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Lord Stevens]] said he believed they were almost certainly born or based in Britain, and would not "fit the caricature al-Qaeda fanatic from some backward village in Algeria or Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police appeal for bombing footage|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4668675.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123232831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4668675.stm|archivedate=23 November 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks would have required extensive preparation and prior reconnaissance efforts, and a familiarity with bomb-making and the London transport network as well as access to significant amounts of bomb-making equipment and chemicals.

Some newspaper editorials in Iran blamed the bombing on British or American authorities seeking to further justify the [[War on Terror]], and claimed that the plan that included the bombings also involved increasing harassment of [[Islam in Europe|Muslims in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran press blames West for blasts|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4672037.stm |publisher=BBC News| date=11 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|first=Frances|last=Harrison|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120083318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4672037.stm| archivedate=20 November 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2005, quoting police and [[MI5]] sources, ''The Independent'' reported that the bombers acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind some place abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London bombings: the truth emerges|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/london-bombings-the-truth-emerges-502660.html|first=Jason|last=Bennetto|author2=Ian Herbert|work=The Independent|date=13 August 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September it was reported that al-Qaeda officially claimed responsibility for the attacks in a videotape broadcast by the Arab television network Al Jazeera. However, an official inquiry by the British government reported that the tape claiming responsibility had been edited after the attacks, and that the bombers did not have direct assistance from al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/09/july7.uksecurity |title=Leak reveals official story of London bombings UK news The Observer|work=Guardian|date=9 April 2006|accessdate=17 October 2009|first=Mark|last=Townsend}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zabi uk-Taifi, an al-Qaeda commander arrested in Pakistan in January 2009, may have had connections to the bombings, according to Pakistani intelligence sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/4313740/Al-Qaeda-commander-linked-to-2005-London-bombings-led-attacks-on-Nato-convoys.html|title=Al-Qaeda commander linked to 2005 London bombings led attacks on Nato convoys|work=The Telegraph|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=5 February 2009|first1=Dean|last1=Nelson|first2=Emal|last2=Khan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130034450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/4313740/Al-Qaeda-commander-linked-to-2005-London-bombings-led-attacks-on-Nato-convoys.html|archivedate=30 January 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, documents found by German authorities on a terrorist suspect arrested in Berlin in May 2011 have suggested that [[Rashid Rauf]], a British al Qaeda operative, played a key role in planning the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Nic Cruickshank, Paul and Lister, Tim (30 April 2012) [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/30/world/al-qaeda-documents-london-bombings/?c=&amp;page=0 "Documents give new details on al Qaeda's London bombings"] CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades====
A second claim of responsibility was posted on the Internet by another al-Qaeda-linked group, [[Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades]]. The group had, however, previously falsely claimed responsibility for events that were the result of technical problems, such as the [[2003 London blackout]] and the US [[Northeast blackout of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tube blasts 'almost simultaneous'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/09/july7.uksecurity12|first=Chris|last=Johnston|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
[[File:Russell square police road.JPG|thumb|right|Police cordon off [[Russell Square]] on 7 July 2005.]]
A survey of 500 British Muslims undertaken by [[Channel 4 News]] in 2007 found that 24% believed the four bombers blamed for the attacks did not perform them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/religion/survey+government+hasnt+told+truth+about+77/545847|title=Survey: 'government hasn't told truth about 7/7'|last=Soni|first=Darshna|date=4 June 2007|publisher=Channel 4 News|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been various [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] proposed about the bombings, including the suggestion that the bombers were '[[wikt:patsy|patsies]]', based on claims about timings of the trains and the train from Luton, supposed explosions underneath the carriages, and allegations of the faking of the one time-stamped and dated photograph of the bombers at Luton station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/27/july7.uksecurity|title=Seeing isn't believing|last=Honingsbaum|first=Mark|date=27 June 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/77+the+conspiracy+theories/545762|title=7/7: the conspiracy theories|last=Soni|first=Darshna|date=4 June 2007|work=Channel 4 News|accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims made by one theorist in the Internet video ''[[7/7 Ripple Effect]]'' were examined by the BBC documentary series ''[[The Conspiracy Files]]'', in an episode titled "7/7" first broadcast on 30 June 2009, which debunked many of the video's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8124687.stm|title=Unmasking the mysterious 7/7 conspiracy theorist|date=30 June 2009|work=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=12 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706155726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8124687.stm|archivedate=6 July 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the bombings [[Peter Power (crisis management specialist)|Peter Power]] of Visor Consultants gave interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] saying that he was working on a crisis management simulation drill, in the [[City of London]], "based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning", when he heard that an attack was going on in real life. He described this as a coincidence. He also gave an interview to the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' where he spoke of "an exercise involving mock broadcasts when it happened for real".&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Evening News "King's Cross Man's Crisis Course", 8 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After a few days he dismissed it as a "spooky coincidence" on Canadian TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/coincidence+of+bomb+exercises/109010 |title=BBC4 ''Coincidence of bomb exercises?'' 17 July 2005 |accessdate=14 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514120704/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/coincidence%2Bof%2Bbomb%2Bexercises/109010 |archivedate=14 May 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, there was much confused information from police sources as to the origin, method, and even timings of the explosions. Forensic examiners had thought initially that military-grade [[plastic explosives]] were used, and, as the blasts were thought to have been simultaneous, that synchronised timed detonators were employed. This hypothesis changed as more information became available. Home-made organic peroxide-based devices were used, according to a May 2006 report from the British government's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/11_05_06_isc_london_attacks_report.pdf|title=Report into the London Terrorist Attacks on 7&amp;nbsp;July 2005|author=Intelligence and Security Committee|date=May 2006|page=11|format=PDF|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosive was [[acetone peroxide|triacetone triperoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7682-explosives-linked-to-london-bombings-identified/|title=Explosives linked to London bombings identified|last=Vince|first=Gaia|date=15 July 2005|website=New Scientist|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

56 people, including the four suicide bombers, were killed by the attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4668245.stm|title=List of the bomb blast victims|accessdate=7 July 2007|date=20 July 2005|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 700 were injured, of whom about 100 were hospitalised for at least one night. The incident was the deadliest single act of terrorism in the United Kingdom since the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]], which crashed on Lockerbie and killed 270 people, and the deadliest bombing in London since the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Bomb Rescuers Were Hindered by Communications|author=Brian Lysaght and Alex Morales|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aZjIrmdLQ9zo&amp;refer=europe|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=5 June 2006|accessdate =5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police examined about 2,500 items of CCTV footage and [[forensic evidence]] from the scenes of the attacks. The bombs were probably placed on the floors of the trains and bus. Investigators identified four men who they alleged had been the suicide bombers. This made the bombings the first ever suicide attack in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Eggen|author2=Scott Wilson|title=Suicide Bombs Potent Tools of Terrorists|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/16/AR2005071601363.html|work=The Washington Post|date=17 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent Cannistraro]], former head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s anti-terrorism centre, told ''The Guardian'' that "two unexploded bombs" were recovered as well as "mechanical timing devices"; this claim was explicitly rejected by London's Metropolitan Police Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hugh |last=Muir |author2=Rosie Cowan |title=Four bombs in 50 minutes – Britain suffers its worst-ever terror attack |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1523819,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217222740/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C%2C1523819%2C00.html |archivedate=17 December 2007 |work=The Guardian |date=8 July 2005 |accessdate=3 December 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police raids===
[[West Yorkshire Police]] raided six properties in the Leeds area on 12 July: two houses in Beeston, two in [[Thornhill, West Yorkshire|Thornhill]], one in [[Holbeck]] and one in Alexandra Grove in [[Hyde Park, Leeds]]. One man was arrested. Officers also raided a residential property on Northern Road in the Buckinghamshire town of [[Aylesbury]] on 13 July.

The police service say a significant amount of explosive material was found in the Leeds raids and a [[controlled explosion]] was carried out at one of the properties. Explosives were also found in the vehicle associated with one of the bombers, Shehzad Tanweer, at Luton railway station and subjected to controlled explosion.&lt;ref name="campbell-laville"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London bombers 'were all British'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4676577.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One London bomber died in blast|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4674463.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216200353/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4674463.stm|archivedate=16 December 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The suicide bomb plot hatched in Yorkshire|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-suicide-bomb-plot-hatched-in-yorkshire-498616.html|first=Jason|last=Bennetto|author2=Ian Herbert|work=The Independent|date=13 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luton cell===
There was speculation about a possible association between the bombers and another alleged Islamist cell in [[Luton]] which was ended during August 2004. The Luton group was uncovered after [[Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan]] was arrested in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. His laptop computer was said to contain plans for tube attacks in London, as well as attacks on financial buildings in New York City and Washington, D.C. The group was subject to surveillance but on 2 August 2004  ''[[The New York Times]]'' published Khan's name, citing Pakistani sources. The news leak forced police in Britain and Canada to make arrests before their investigations were complete. The US government later said they had given the name to some journalists as "[[Journalism sourcing|background information]]", for which [[Tom Ridge]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]], apologised.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When the Luton cell was ended, one of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan (no known relation), was scrutinised briefly by MI5 who determined that he was not a likely threat and he was not surveilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MI5 judged bomber 'no threat'|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1697562,00.html|work=The Times|first=David|last=Leppard|date=17 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 2007 arrests===
On 22 March 2007, three men were arrested in connection with the bombings. Two were arrested at 1&amp;nbsp;pm at [[Manchester Airport]], attempting to board a flight bound for Pakistan that afternoon. They were apprehended by undercover officers who had been following the men as part of a surveillance operation. They had not intended to arrest the men that day, but believed they could not risk letting the suspects leave the country. A third man was arrested in the Beeston area of Leeds at an address on the street where one of the suicide bombers had lived before the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three held over 7&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;bombings|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6481495.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=22 March 2007|accessdate=1 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111135603/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6481495.stm|archivedate=11 January 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2007 arrests===
On 9 May 2007 police made four further arrests, three in [[Yorkshire]] and one in [[Selly Oak]], Birmingham. The widow of the presumed ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan, was among those arrested for "commissioning, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name="ringleader"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police quiz 7&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;bomber's widow|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6637917.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=9 May 2007|accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of those arrested, including Khan's widow, were released on 15 May.&lt;ref name="ringleader"/&gt; The fourth, Khalid Khaliq, an unemployed single father of three, was charged on 17 July 2007 with possessing an al-Qaeda training manual, but the charge was not related to the 2005 London attacks. Conviction for possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism carried a maximum ten-year jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6675165.stm|title=UK Man bailed over 'al-Qaeda manual'|publisher=BBC News|date=21 May 2007|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportation of Abdullah el-Faisal===
[[Abdullah el-Faisal]] was deported to Jamaica, his country of origin, from Britain on 25 May 2006 after reaching the parole date in his prison sentence. He was found guilty of three charges of soliciting the murder of Jews, Americans and Hindus and two charges of using threatening words to incite racial hatred in 2003 and, despite an appeal, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. In 2006 [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] alleged to MPs that el-Faisal had influenced Jamaican-born Briton Germaine Lindsay into participating in the 7/7 bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6691701.stm|title=UK Race hate cleric Faisal deported|publisher=BBC News|date=25 May 2007|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3494905.stm|title=England London , 'Hate preacher' loses his appeal|publisher=BBC News|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation of Mohammad Sidique Khan===
''The Guardian'' reported on 3 May 2007 that police had investigated Mohammad Sidique Khan twice during 2005. The newspaper said it "learned that on 27 January 2005, police took a statement from the manager of a garage in Leeds which had loaned Khan a courtesy car while his vehicle was being repaired." It also said that "on the afternoon of 3 February an officer from [[Scotland Yard]]'s anti-terrorism branch carried out inquiries with the company which had insured a car in which Khan was seen driving almost a year earlier". Nothing about these inquiries appeared in the report by Parliament's intelligence and security committee after it investigated the 7 July attacks. Scotland Yard described the 2005 inquiries as "routine", while security sources said they were related to the fertiliser bomb plot.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Reports of warnings===
While no warnings before 7 July bombings have been documented officially or acknowledged, the following are sometimes quoted as indications either of the events to come or of some foreknowledge.
* One of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, was briefly scrutinised by MI5 who determined that he was not a likely threat and he was not put under surveillance.&lt;ref name=NOTHREAT&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1697562,00.html MI5 judged bomber "no threat"] ''The Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some news stories, current a few hours after the attacks, questioned the British government's contention that there had not been any warning or prior intelligence. It was reported by [[CBS News]] that a senior Israeli official said that British police told the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israeli embassy in London]] minutes before the explosions that they had received warnings of possible terror attacks in the UK capital. An AP report used by a number of news sites, including ''[[The Guardian]]'', attributed the initial report of a warning to an Israeli "Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity", but added Foreign Minister [[Silvan Shalom]]'s later denial on [[Israel Defense Forces Radio]]: "There was no early information about terrorist attacks." A similar report on the site of right-wing Israeli paper ''Israel National News/Arutz Sheva'' attributed the story to "Army Radio quoting unconfirmed reliable sources."&lt;ref name=REPORT&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/85346 Report: Israel was warned ahead of first blast] Arutz Sheva – {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721080055/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=85346 |date=21 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the report has been retracted, the original stories are still circulated as a result of their presence on the news websites' archives.
* In an interview with the Portuguese newspaper ''[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]'' a month after the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], Syrian-born cleric [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] warned that "a very well-organised" London-based group which he called "al-Qaeda Europe" was "on the verge of launching a big operation."&lt;ref name=BAKRI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=43819&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56 |title=Islamic leader had warned of attack |work=Gulf Times |accessdate=17 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090903203004/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=43819&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56| archivedate= 3 September 2009 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, Bakri vowed that, if Western governments did not change their policies, Muslims would give them "a 9/11, day after day after day."&lt;ref name=NYTJuly8/&gt;
* According to a 17 November 2004 post on the ''[[Newsweek]]'' website, US authorities in 2004 had evidence that terrorists were planning a possible attack in London. In addition, the article stated that, "fears of terror attacks have prompted FBI agents based in the [[Embassy of the United States, London|U.S. embassy in London]] to avoid travelling on London's popular underground railway (or tube) system."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/38176 Terror Watch: The Real Target? – Newsweek National News – MSNBC.com] at www.msnbc.msn.com – {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118164900/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6514619/site/newsweek/ |date=18 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an interview published by the German magazine ''[[Bild|Bild am Sonntag]]'' dated 10 July 2005, [[Meir Dagan]], director of the Israeli intelligence agency [[Mossad]], said that the agency's office in London was alerted to the impending attack at 8:43&amp;nbsp;am, six minutes before the first bomb detonated. The warning of a possible attack was a result of an investigation into an earlier terrorist bombing in [[Tel Aviv]], which may have been related to the London bombings.&lt;ref&gt;at web.israelinsider.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anwar al-Awlaki===
''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that radical imam [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had inspired the bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6630555/Fort-Hood-shooting-radical-Islamic-preacher-also-inspired-July-7-bombers.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Fort Hood shooting: radical Islamic preacher also inspired July&amp;nbsp;7 bombers|first1=Philip|last1=Sherwell|first2=Duncan|last2=Gardham|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombers transcribed lectures of al-Awlaki while plotting the bombings. His materials were found in the possession of accused accomplices of the suicide bombers. Al-Awlaki was killed by a US drone attack in 2011.

===Independent inquest===
In 2006, the government refused to hold a public inquiry, stating that "it would be a ludicrous diversion". Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] said an independent inquiry would "undermine support" for MI5, while the leader of the opposition, [[David Cameron]], said only a full inquiry would "get to the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/03/july7.topstories3|title=7/7 leader: more evidence reveals what police knew|work=The Guardian|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=17 October 2009|location=London|first1=Helen|last1=Carter|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|first3=Ian|last3=Cobain}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to revelations about the extent of security service investigations into the bombers prior to the attack, the [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], said: "It is becoming more and more clear that the story presented to the public and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is at odds with the facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/03/july7.topstories3|title=7/7 leader: more evidence reveals what police knew|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|work=The Guardian|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=20 December 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The decision to not hold an independent public inquest was later reversed and in October 2010 an independent coroner's inquest of the bombings began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://7julyinquests.independent.gov.uk/ |title=Coroner's Inquest into the London bombings of 7 July 2005 |publisher=7julyinquests.independent.gov.uk|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heather Hallett|Lady Justice Hallett]] was appointed to hear the inquest, which would consider how each victim died and whether MI5, if it had worked better, could have prevented the attack, and also the emergency service response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11511461|title=7/7 bombs acts of 'merciless savagery', inquests told|publisher=BBC News|date=11 October 2010|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven months of evidence and deliberation, the verdict of the inquiry was released and read in the Houses of Parliament on 9 May 2011. It determined that the 52 victims had been unlawfully killed; their deaths could not have been prevented, and they would probably have died "whatever time the emergency services reached and rescued them". Hallett concluded that MI5 had not made every possible improvement since the attacks but that it was not "right or fair" to say more attention should have been paid to ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan prior to 7 July. She also decided that there should be no public inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/parliamentary-business/written-ministerial-statement/77-inquest-wms/|title=7/7 inquest – WMS|publisher=Home Office|date=9 May 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13308371|publisher=BBC News|title=7/7 inquests: Emergency delays 'did not cause deaths'|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report provided nine recommendations to various bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/may/06/7-7-inquest-verdict-live-coverage?commentpage=last#block-29|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Paul|last=Owen|title=7/7 inquest verdict – Friday 6&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;2011|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# With reference to a photograph of Khan and Shehzad Tanweer which was so badly cropped by MI5 that the pair was virtually unrecognisable to the US authorities asked to review it, the inquiry recommended that procedures be improved so that humans asked to view photographs are shown them in best possible quality.
# In relation to the suggestion that MI5 failed to realise the suspects were important quickly enough, the inquiry recommended that MI5 improves the way it records decisions relating to suspect assessment.
# The inquiry recommended that 'major incident' training for all frontline staff, especially those working on the Underground, is reviewed.
# With regards to the facts that London Underground (LU) is unable to declare a 'major incident' itself and that LU was not invited to an emergency meeting at Scotland Yard at 10:30&amp;nbsp;am on the morning of the bombings, the inquiry recommends that the way [[Transport for London]] (TfL) and the London [[Urban resilience|resilience]] team are alerted to major incidents and the way the emergency services are informed is reviewed.
# Regarding the confusion on 7 July 2005 over the emergency rendezvous point, it was recommended that a common initial rendezvous point is permanently staffed and advised to emergency services;
# In response to the evidence that some firefighters refused to walk on the tracks at Aldgate to reach the bombed train because they had not received confirmation that the electric current had been switched off, the inquiry recommended a review into how emergency workers confirm whether the current is off after a major incident.
# A recommendation was made that TfL reviewed the provision of stretchers and [[first aid]] equipment at Underground stations.
# Training of London Ambulance Service (LAS) staff of "multi-casualty triage" should be reviewed, following concerns in the inquest that some casualties were not actually treated by paramedics who had triaged them.
# A final recommendation was made to the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], the [[Mayor of London]] and the London resilience team to review the capability and funding of emergency medical care in the city.

===Alleged newspaper phone hacking===
It was reported in July 2011 that relatives of some of the victims of the bombings may have had their telephones accessed by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in the aftermath of the attacks. The revelations added to an existing [[News International phone hacking scandal|controversy over phone hacking]] by the tabloid newspaper.

The fathers of two victims, one in the Edgware Road blast and another at Russell Square, told the BBC that police officers investigating the alleged hacking had warned them that their contact details were found on a target list, while a former firefighter who helped injured passengers escape from Edgware Road also said he had been contacted by police who were looking into the hacking allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14040841|publisher=BBC News|title=News of the World 'hacked 7/7 family phones'|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of survivors from the bombed trains also revealed that police had warned them their phones may have been accessed and their messages intercepted, and in some cases officers advised them to change security codes and [[Personal identification number|PINs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hutchinson |first=Lisa |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/07/07/tyneside-7-7-bombings-survivor-lisa-french-has-been-contacted-by-detectives-investigating-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-scandal-72703-29009171/ |title=Tyneside 7/7 bombings survivor Lisa French has been contacted by detectives investigating News of the World phone hacking scandal. |publisher=ChronicleLive |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201141110/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/07/07/tyneside-7-7-bombings-survivor-lisa-french-has-been-contacted-by-detectives-investigating-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-scandal-72703-29009171/ |archivedate=1 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/london_bombing_survivor_threatens_to_sue_over_hacking_1_956554|title=London bombing survivor threatens to sue over hacking|work=Kent News|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812034940/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/london_bombing_survivor_threatens_to_sue_over_hacking_1_956554|archivedate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Ryan|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/warnings-of-potential-irish-victims-of-notw-phone-hacking-172128-Jul2011/|title=Warnings of potential Irish victims of NOTW phone hacking|publisher=Thejournal.ie|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|7 July 2005 London bombings memorials and services}}

Since the bombings, the United Kingdom and other nations have honoured the victims in several ways. Most of these memorials have included moments of silence, candlelit vigils, and the laying of flowers at the attack sites. Foreign leaders have also remembered the dead by ordering their flags to be flown at [[half-mast]], signing books of condolences at embassies of the UK, and issuing messages of support and condolences to the British people.

===United Kingdom===
The government ordered the [[Union Flag]] to be flown at half-mast on 8 July.&lt;ref&gt;(7 July 2005). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060308171225/http://www.utvlive.com/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=62372&amp;pt=n Union Flag to Fly at Half-Mast]". UTV. Retrieved 4 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the [[Bishop of London]] led prayers for the victims during a service paying tribute to the role of women during the Second World War. A vigil, called by the [[Stop the War Coalition]], [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and [[Muslim Association of Britain]], was held from 5&amp;nbsp;pm, at Friends Meeting House on Euston Road.

A two-minute silence was held on 14 July 2005 throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;(10 July 2005).

During the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games]] in London a minute's silence was held to commemorate those killed in the attacks.

A memorial service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral on 7 July 2015, to mark the 10th anniversary of the bombings. This was broadcast on BBC One.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b061vc8z&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pseudonym''' or '''pen name''', also known by its native names '''''hao''''' (in China) ({{zh|s=号}}), '''''gō''''' (in Japan) and '''''ho''''' (in Korea), is a professional name used by [[East Asian]] [[artist]]s. The word and the concept originated in [[China]], then became popular in other [[East Asian]] countries (especially in [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and the former [[Kingdom of Ryukyu]]).

In some cases, artists adopted different pseudonyms at different stages of their career, usually to mark significant changes in their life. Extreme practitioners of this tendency were [[Tang Yin]] of the [[Ming dynasty]], who had more than ten ''hao'' and [[Hokusai]] of Japan, who in the period 1798 to 1806 alone used no fewer than six.

==History==

===China===

In Chinese culture, the ''hào'' (Traditional 號; Simplified 号) originally refers to any name a person gives oneself, as opposed to a birth name (which is given by the parents or other elders). The use of this name as a nom de plume or artistic name, however, appears to have begun only during the [[Six Dynasties]] period, with [[Tao Yuanming]] and [[Ge Hong]] among the first literati to have given themselves ''hào''. 

Art names came into vogue during the [[Tang dynasty]], during which time they could either be coined by the person themself, or given to them as a name by others. Most ''hào'' can be placed within a few categories: 

* ''Hào'' derived from the locations or characteristics of the person's residence. For instance, Tao Yuanming was Wuliu Xiansheng, "Mister Five-Willows", while [[Su Shi]] was Dongpo Jushi, "[[Householder (Buddhism)|Householder]] of the Eastern Slope", after his residence while exiled in [[Huangzhou]]. These were mostly self-coined. 
* ''Hào'' derived from certain well known sayings by the person. For example, [[Ouyang Xiu]] was known as Liuyi Jushi, "Householder of the Six Ones", after his self description as "One myriad books, one thousand inscriptions, one [[guqin|qin]], one game of chess, one flask of wine and one old man". 
* ''Hào'' derived from one's famous poetic lines or images. These were most often given by others in admiration. [[Li Bai]], for his free-spirited behaviour, was known as Zhe Xianren, "Banished Immortal"; while the poet [[He Zhu]] was known as He Meizi, "He the Plum", after an acclaimed line about yellow plums. 
* ''Hào'' derived from one's official posts, birthplace, or a place where they served as officials. [[Du Fu]] was known as Du Gongbu, "Du of the Ministry of Works", having briefly been a senior officer in that ministry. [[Tang Xianzu]] was called "Tang of Nanhai" for his birthplace. 

By the [[Song Dynasty]], the majority of literati called each other by their art names, which in turn often changed; this situation continued up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://tieba.baidu.com/p/658776377&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
In [[Edo period|early modern]] Japan, a [[ukiyo-e|woodblock print]] artist's first ''gō'' was usually given to them by the head of the school (a group of artists and apprentices, with a senior as master of the school) in which they initially studied; this ''gō'' usually included one of the characters of the master's ''gō''. For example, one of Hokusai's earliest pseudonyms was Shunrō; his master [[Katsukawa Shunshō]] having granted him the character 'shun' from his own name.

One can often trace the relationship among artists with this, especially in later years, when it seems to have been fairly (although not uniformly) systematic (particularly in the [[Utagawa school]]) that the first character of the pupil's ''gō'' was the last of the master's ''gō''.

Thus, an artist named [[Utagawa Toyoharu|Toyoharu]] had a student named [[Utagawa Toyohiro|Toyohiro]], who, in turn, had as a pupil the famous landscape artist [[Hiroshige]].

Another figure who studied under Toyoharu was the principal head of the [[Utagawa school]], [[Utagawa Toyokuni|Toyokuni]]. Toyokuni had pupils named [[Utagawa Kunisada|Kunisada]] and [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]]. Kuniyoshi, in turn, had as a student [[Utagawa Yoshitoshi|Yoshitoshi]], whose pupils included Toshikata.

==Reused names==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
In some schools, in particular the main Utagawa school,{{citation needed|date=July 2009}} the ''gō'' of the most senior member was adopted when the master died and the chief pupil assumed his position. Perhaps as a sign of respect, artists might take the ''gō'' of a previous artist. This makes attribution difficult. The censors' seal helps determine a particular print's date. Style also is significant. For example, Kunisada, once he changed his ''gō'' to Toyokuni,  initiated the practice of signing prints with a signature in the elongated oval ''toshidama'' ('New Year's Jewel') seal of the Utagawa school, an unusual [[cartouche]] with the zig-zag in the upper right-hand corner. His successors continued this practice.

In modern scholarship on the subject, a Roman numeral identifies an artist in the sequence of artists using a ''gō''. Thus, Kunisada I is also known as Toyokuni III, since he was the third artist to use that ''gō''.

The '''Battle of Miani''' (or '''Battle of Meeanee''') was a battle between forces of the [[Bombay Army]] of the British East India company, under  [[Charles James Napier|Charles Napier]] and the Baluch army of [[Talpur]] [[Emir|Amirs]] of [[Sindh]], led by [[Mir Nasir Khan Talpur]]. The Battle took place on 17 February 1843 at [[Miani, Sindh]], in what is now Pakistan. This battle eventually led to the capture of parts of Sindh region, first territorial possession by British East India company in what is the modern-day country of [[Pakistan]].

==Background==
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Nadeem Wagan (a Sindh writer), the primary causes of the battle were the British East India company's desire to expand their possession in south Asia and the British General [[Charles James Napier|Charles Napier]]'s ambitions. The General had held previous position as Governor of the Greek island of Kefalonia with very limited scope for glory. The [[Talpur dynasty|Talpur]] kingdom of Sindh was inefficiently and loosely governed by the [[Amir]]s and a relatively easy target as opposed to the [[Sikh]] kingdom of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Napier moved his army aggressively from the [[East India Company]]'s [[Bombay presidency]] area and entered the Sindh border. Negotiations ensued between the Talpur Amir in [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] and Napier. An agreement was reached after the Amir gave significant concessions. Napier then started to move his army back towards Bombay and the Amir disbanded his army that had been mobilised. However, Napier was firmly determined in conquering Sindh and Hyderabad. Whilst moving towards Bombay and giving the impression of keeping the agreement that had been reached, he suddenly turned back towards Hyderabad on the pretext of hostile intentions by the Amir and marched with great speed towards the capital.
In the book Janat ul Sindh, Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai has written that, &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"On 16 February 1843 Sir Charles Napier came to Matiari from Hala.He was commanding 2800 soldiers with 12 canonns.On the other side Balouch army was consisted of 2200 soldiers with 15 cannons.Army of Sindh began to gather at the bank of Phuleli near Miani but there was no sufficient arrangements for providing ammunition to the army. English army was consisted of soldiers belonging to Bombay,Pune and Madras.Charles Napier was commander and his subordinates were captain John Jackab, captain Hutt, major Jackson, lieutenant Weddington, Major Penny Father, lieutenant Mac Merdo (Aide de camp of Napier), Major Wylie, Captain Tucker,Lieutinant Colonel Patel, Major Stori, captain Thomas, Major Machozison (Secretary of Napier), Capt. Wemus, Capt. Cookson,lieutenant Marston,Capt. Garrett were his subordinates. The Talpur army was composed of Shahdadani, Chakrani, and Khanani Talpurs.  Bijrani and Muhammadani Talpurs did not join. Mir Naseer had sent message to Malak Ibrahim Khan,the Sardar of Kalmati tribe to attack upon English army with the help of Nomri and Jokhiya tribes.The Kalmati Sardar left with band of 400 warriors but Jam Khan,Sardar of Jokhiya and Nomri tribes did not join him hence Ibrahim Khan went back to home. Mankani tribe also did not join. However Balochi tribes Nizamani, Bagrani, Mari, Jamali, Chang, Gopang, Jatoi, Qarai, Rind, Lashari, Bhurgri, and Chuulgri joined the army. In addition to Balouch tribes Khokhar, Khatiyan, Soomra, Khaskhali, and many others gathered under the banner of Sindh.  Sadaat of Sindh also joined the army with fervor of Jihad. Mir Jan Muhammad Khanani was commander of army.  His subordinates were Mir Ghulam Shah Shahwani, Syed Abdullah, Ibrahim Khan, Nawab Ahmed Khan Lighari, Ghulam Muhammad Lighari, Bakhtiyar Khan, Bahawal Khan Rind, Moro Khan Chang and Syed Fateh Muhammad Shah Lakiyari, who were warlords. Mir Ghulam Shah was Vice Commander. Hosh Muhammad Qambrani negro, Mashedi Irani and Mr Hawel were in charge of Talpur artillery.  The army of Meers' was seven times larger than English army but their weapons were imperfect as compare to the weapons of the rivals. English army was well trained but Talpur army was untrained and lacking discipline. The cannons of Meers' were three feet long and diameter of their muzzles was three inches. Their guns were breech-loaders of old times.  English soldiers, including local soldiers, were active and clever because of discipline having support of medical staff for providing first aid. Their army was supported by traveling band for providing ammunition and for digging tranches. Both armies were at the distance of 100 yards from each other. Mir Naseer Khan was wearing armor. Mir Rustam Khan, Mir Hussain Ali Khan and Mir Shahdad Khan were at his right and left sides. Both banks of Phuleli canal were covered by dense bushes which could be used for defense of the army. By that time Phuleli canal was dry and very wide. The chief of Chandia tribe was at some distance with 10000 warriors waiting and alert for the help of English army.On 17 February 1843 at early morning battle started".&lt;ref&gt;Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai; Janat ul Sindh, 3rd edition 1993,pages no 737-739; Sindhi Adbi Board Jamshoro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Battle==
The Baluch were forced to quickly re-mobilise their army but could not do so effectively as the army was mostly raised on a voluntary basis in times of war and most of the Baluch had returned home. Nevertheless, an army of around 8,000 - mostly cavalry - was raised and assembled at the battle ground of Miani. Disastrously for the Talpur Amirs another 8,000 troops under [[Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur]] (later known as ''Sher-e-Sindh'' or "Lion of Sindh") failed to reach the battle ground in time. Napier had already successfully isolated the [[Amir]] of [[Khayrpur (princely state)|Khairpur]] (thereafter known as the great traitor by the Sindhi) by bribery and title. Thus the Baluchi army assembled at Miani represented approximately a third of the potential military strength in Sindh. Although the East India Company later gave its troops numbered in the battle as around 2,800, contemporary Talpur records indicated the armies were approximately equal in numbers (around 8–10 thousand each) with the British having around 2,500 European officers and soldiers and the balance being Indian [[sepoys]].

The difference in military technology and tactics was enormous. The East India Company's army was led by professionally trained British officers and troops and the Indian Sepoys were also well trained and disciplined. They were armed with smoothbore percussion or [[flintlock]] [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s, which were accurate to 50–100 yards, and supported by modern artillery. In contrast, the Baluchi army consisted mostly of cavalry armed with muskets, spears and swords and some old artillery pieces acquired from [[Persia]]. The tactic was the favoured cavalry charge. Contemporary records indicate that the Baluchi army's morale was very high with the battle slogan being "we will die but not give up Sindh". Indeed, the Baluchis died in thousands, in 4–5 hours of carnage, the Baluchi horsemen charged in wave after wave and was mostly cut down long before they could reach British lines by rifle and artillery fire. When they did eventually reach British lines and, according to Napier himself in his book on the battle (''Conquest of Sindh''), he had to ride amongst his officers and troops to stop them from falling back in disarray in the face of the ferocity of the Baluch who had reached the British lines. Of the Baluch army of 8,000 at Miani, around 6 thousand Baluch were killed. Reliable sources put the British casualties as 256&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The History of British India: A Chronology'' by John F. Riddick&lt;/ref&gt; as kept by the East India company's paymasters while according to the Baluch, the Company's army suffered 3,000 dead (although Napier gives a much lower casualty figure as he does for his total force). In famous book on history of Sindh 'Jannat ul Sindh' Molai Shedai writes that."At the time of start of war at early morning at first one band of English army moved a head into the battle feild so that the hidden part of Talpur army might come out of the bushes"."At beginning Mir Jan Muhammad fought with stretegy and Charles Napier was sure of defeat. English cavalry bands attacked from right and left sides and Mir Jan Muhammad was martyred and Mir Ghulam Shah took over the command.John Jackab leading 1000 cavalry attacked through the bed of Phuleli canal and at once moved back with deception and Talpur army thought it retreat and their lines stood broken and they followed the cavalry and reached across the banks of Phuleli where English artillery was staged at hidden place and English army opened the artillery upon them continuously for three hours .One cannonball hit against the ammunition of Talpur army which was completely destroyed.After noon time one band of Ligharis was retreated then Thorha then Bahawal Khan ran from battlefield who was followed by Nawab Ahmed Lighari who also snatched the flag from Soomar before leaving the battlefield. Mir Naseer and Shahdad wanted to fight till last breath but their army was fleeing from battlefield .About 4000 were among them who left away without any order.One cannonball fall nearby and Suleman, personal servant of the Meer was martyred.It appeared that army of Meers was under siege. Chang, Gopang, Mari and Nizamani were still fighting in battlefield. English army took control of the artillery of Meers due to support of one of in charge of the artillery who was Mr Hawel.At one moment Charles Napier came under attack but was saved by Lieuftenant Marston.At last moments Mir Hussain Ali Khan also ran away from battlefield. Looking to the situation Mir Naseer Khan also left the battlefield along with 1200 cavalry and came at the Fort of Hyderabad.During 3 hours face to face battle only 27 soldiers of English Army were died and became injured. From officers Major Tezdil, Major Jackson, Captain Maddy, Captain Tieve, Captain Cookson, Lieuftenant Wood were died and Lieutenant Penny Father, Major Welly, Captain Tucker, Captain Convey, Lieuftenant Harding and Feri became injured. About 20 British officers died and 4 officers from infantry were amongst them. About 5000 from Talpurs'army died. Mir Jan Muhammad Khan,Talha khan Nizamani, Ghulam Hussain khan Nizamani, Abdullah Khan, Ali Bungash,Gohar Khan Hajizai, Naseer Khan Chang,Mir Ghulam Shah,Mir Mubarak Khan Bihrani and others were among them. During 3 hours battle only one Irish soldier could stab bayonet at the chest of one Balouch soldier who was also killed by the other with sword as dead bodies of the both were found together. Captain Postins in his book 'Personal observation of Sindh' while mentioning  about battle of  Miani wrote that' People of Sindh fought against the English army like persons who may fight for something which is more dearer to them than their lives'.&lt;ref&gt;Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai; Janat ul Sindh,3rd edition 1993, pages no:339 to 342; Sindhi Adbi Board Jamshoro&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on March 24, 1843, [[Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur|Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Talpur]], reached [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] with his private army of around 8,000 and tried to liberate Sindh from the occupation of the [[British East India Company]] forces. He sent Napier a message giving the General 48 hours to vacate the Hyderabad Fort. Napier who was firmly entrenched in Hyderabad Fort and had recently been reinforced from Bombay replied by firing his artillery from the Fort walls. Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Talpur was subsequently defeated in the [[Battle of Dubba]] and thereafter he went to Punjab to seek help from Maharaja Ranjeet Singh, the Sikh ruler of the Punjab. The Maharaja extended hospitality but declined to become involved. Sher Muhammad Khan then went to the Khan of Kalat to seek assistance, but the Khanate of Kalat had already suffered a defeat by the British in 1838 and was in no position to help. Eventually after 10 years, Mir Sher Muhammad returned to Sindh and surrendered to the British and the East India Company gave him amnesty.

The [[amir]]s of Hyderabad suffered great loss, their fort was plundered, and amirs themselves were exiled to Andaman Islands – never to see Sindh again. Napier's post-conquest occupation of Sindh was absolute. Fifteen years later when the [[Indian Mutiny]] or 'War of Independence' in 1857 broke out, no shots were fired in Sindh. His manipulations of the history of his interactions with the [[Talpur dynasty]] and the history of the battle were likewise absolute and designed to glorify his position. However, debates that took place in the [[British Parliament]] for the post-conquest show the degree of concern that existed in UK on the action he had taken in Sindh.

The battle honours of "Meeanee" and "Hyderabad" are shared by the [[22nd (Cheshire) Regiment]] and a number of Indian regiments, whereas that of "Scinde" is borne by the Cheshire Regiment alone.

==Casualties==
Five thousand [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s were killed or wounded while fighting the British.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_321.gif Miāni - ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', v. 17, p. 315.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fallen Amirs of Sindh consisted of [[Mir Nasir Khan Talpur]], his nephews [[Mir Shadad Khan Talpur]], [[Mir Hussein Ali Khan Talpur]], [[Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur]], the [[Subedar]] of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mir Rustam Khan Talpur]], [[Nasir Talpur]], [[Wali Mohammad Khan Talpur]] of [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Khairpur]]. Others such as [[Mir Ali Murad Khan Talpur]] was taken aboard the sloop {{HMS|Nimrod}} and exiled to [[Burma]].&lt;ref name=googlebooks&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl6qYIcln8MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Debal&amp;as_brr=1&amp;source=gbs_book_similarbooks#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Personal observations on Sindh: the manners and customs of its inhabitants; and its productive capabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

A British journal said of the captive Sindhi Amirs: "The Amirs as being the prisoners of the state are maintained in strict seclution; they are described as Broken-Hearted and Miserable men, maintaining much of the dignity of fallen greatness, and without any querulous or angry complainngs at this unalleviable source of sorrow, refusing to be comforted".&lt;ref name=googlebooks/&gt;

A '''bedspace apartment''' ({{zh|牀位寓所}}), also called '''cage home''' ({{zh|t=籠屋|labels=no}}), '''coffin cubicle''', or '''coffin home''', is a type of [[Residential area|residence]] that is only large enough for one bunk bed surrounded by a metal cage.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong People's Council on Housing Policy. 熱窩(住屋權報告書). Step Forward Multi Media, 2000, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, there were approximately 53,200 people living in cage homes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://socialindicators.org.hk/en/indicators/housing/8.11 Social Indicators of Hong Kong: Number of persons living in cage housing]". Retrieved 2013-3-31.&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of [[Residential area|residence]] originated in Hong Kong, and primarily exists in older urban districts such as [[Sham Shui Po]], [[Mong Kok]], [[To Kwa Wan]], and [[Tai Kok Tsui]].  

Generally, the residents are low-income people, including the elderly, drug addicts, and some low-skilled or unskilled labourers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20110916/15618628 Apple Daily, 2011-09-16].&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] of Hong Kong found that the people who lived in cage homes were those who did not qualify for [[social welfare]], or [[subsidy|subsidised]] rent or electricity.&lt;ref name="legco"&gt;[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr07-08/chinese/panels/hg/papers/hg0310cb1-971-1-c.pdf] #籠屋、板房及套房
租住問題研究報告, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the residents are male. Safety and other living conditions in bedspace apartments homes are often poor.

==Official definition==
While often called cage homes, they are categorised as "bedspace apartments" by the [[Hong Kong Government]]. According to the Bedspace Apartment Ordinance, the term "bedspace apartment" refers to a house that contains 12 or more people who rent bedspaces individually. It is legal to run these bedspace apartments, but landlords must first apply for a special license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedspace Apartments Ordinance |url=http://www.hadla.gov.hk/en/bedspace/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedspace Apartments Ordinance|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/4f0db701c6c25d4a4825755c00352e35/5D36F89C913B3600482575EF0008BCC1/$FILE/CAP_447_e_b5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bedspace apartments started to appear more commonly during the 1950s and 60s. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], a large number of Chinese mainlanders migrated to Hong Kong, and this, along with a surge in birth rates due to the prospering economy, caused the population to dramatically increase from 2,015,300 in 1951 to 3,129,648 in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong Annual Report. 1962. Population. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to cope with the housing demand, the [[Hong Kong Government]] started to build several public housing estates. However, the government could not handle the extra burden brought by the Chinese [[migrant worker]]s, and there were no housing or labour protection policies in place at that time. Cage homes thus became popular among migrant workers, as the rental fee was low.&lt;ref&gt; (2008) [http://www.soco.org.hk/cagehome2008/cage_bkg.htm#history Society for Community Organization. What is a "Caged Home"?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, people still live in cage homes because the Hong Kong government has instituted a single-person scoring system for public housing applications and lowered public housing quotas. In addition, according to the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], new immigrants must wait 7 years to become [[Hong Kong permanent resident]]s. As such, poor immigrants are often forced to live in bedspace apartments until they receive a [[Hong Kong Identity Card|Hong Kong ID card]].&lt;ref name="legco" /&gt;

== Cage hotels in the United States {{anchor|Cage hotel}}==
'''Cage hotels''', a form of [[single room occupancy]], were common in [[Chicago]] at the turn of the 20th century; an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 people lived in them during the winter. 

{{quote|These were lofts or other large, open buildings that were subdivided into tiny [[cubicle]]s using boards or sheets of [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]]. Since these walls were always one to three feet short of the floor or ceiling, the open space was sealed off with [[chicken wire]], hence the name “cage hotels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1958 survey by [[Christopher Jencks]] found that homeless men preferred cage hotels over [[Homeless shelter|shelters]] for reasons of privacy and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar preference for cage hotels over shelters was reported in turn of the century [[New York City]], where single working men ranked their housing preference in the following order: 

{{quote|They preferred lodging and [[boarding house]]s to cages, cages to [[Dormitory|dormitories]], dormitories to flops, and flops to the city’s shelters. Men could act on these preferences by moving as their incomes increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Environment==
Bedspace apartments are usually located inside old buildings in urban areas. In the apartment flats, the whole living space is divided into multiple sections. Each section has two to three layers of beds, which are subdivided with metal cages. With no doors, residents have to keep all of their personal belongings inside the confined space. Each bedspace is very narrow, so an adult can barely lie down, stand, or sit straight. Since residents do not have room for any extra personal belongings inside the cage home, such a bedspace is deemed to be a place for sleeping only. Cage homes are dim, cramped, and hot. The temperature can reach 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]).&lt;ref&gt;CNN.(2009) [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/10/28/cage.homes/index.html  Living in a cage in Hong Kong].&lt;/ref&gt; Residents share the toilets and kitchen, which are notoriously smelly, dirty, and very simple.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong People's Council on Housing Policy. 熱窩(住屋權報告書). (2000) Step Forward Multi Media, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Cage homes also lack privacy because the cages are so close to each other. Even though some modern cage homes have partitions to separate different sections, these typically consist of only a thin piece of wood or paper board.

===Safety===
Cage homes generally have poor safety, due to their location within old buildings and inadequate fire protection.

In 1998, the government set up the Bedspace Apartment Ordinance (Section 18: Precautions for Safety and Sanitation) to regulate fire safety standards and requirements. Nevertheless, licensed cage homes are still located in worn-out buildings which lack [[smoke detector]]s, [[Automatic sprinkler|automatic sprinkler systems]] and [[fire alarm system]]s. Worse still, many residents share only one electrical outlet. [[Electric shocks]] and [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage]] frequently occur since the government does not conduct regular inspections to ensure that the various safety measures are up to standard.

In addition, the Bedspace Apartment Ordinance does not regulate unlicensed cage home apartments or other similar residences that do not fulfill the requirements of being a "bedspace apartment." Thus, these unlicensed cage home apartments do not have sufficient safety equipment.

===Hygiene===
Because residents rarely clean the open areas, cage homes are often found to have [[flies]], [[mosquitoes]], mice, and [[cockroaches]]. As such, the filthy environment becomes a breeding ground for bacteria, [[viruses]], and diseases. Metal cages are typically made of iron, which rusts easily.

===Limited space===
Since cage homes are often located within older urban districts, they are usually extremely small. Such space is only suitable for people to take a rest, thus preventing any additional recreational activities. It is observed that an average of 6 to 12 people typically share a cage home apartment. Under the confined and crowded space, cage homes often have poor [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation systems]].&lt;ref name= &gt;''[https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-022713-213142/unrestricted/Subdivided_Housing_Issues_of_Hong_Kong_Causes_and_Solutions.pdf Subdivided Housing Issues of Hong Kong: Causes and Solutions: an Interactive Qualifying Project],'' p.11. Daniel Dwan, Meghan Sawicki and Jeffery Wong. [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. Sponsoring agency [[Hong Kong Institute of Education]]. Submitted 2013-02-28. Retrieved 2017-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Residents are highly susceptible to [[Respiratory disease|respiratory illness]]. In addition, residents (especially the elderly and disabled) find it difficult to evacuate the building in an emergency.

===Psychological well-being===
People who live in cage homes are often victims of destitution. The effect of living in such dilapidated, isolated, and cramped quarters can lead to a higher incidence of mental illness. Some elderly people have described their lives in cage homes as "waiting for death."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkTHlo845rM Apple Daily]. 2011-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social response==
According to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] proposed by the United Nations, cage homes violate the [[right to housing]].{{cn|date=March 2014}}

Many of Hong Kong's citizens and social organisations have urged the government to construct more [[Public housing in Hong Kong|public housing estates]] to replace cage homes for low-income people. The government insists that cage homes should not be eradicated, as there is such a large demand for small apartments in the community.

The 1992 film ''[[Cageman]]'', directed by [[Jacob Cheung]], demonstrates the harsh living conditions in cage homes and sheds light on the difficulties faced by residents.

===News response===
The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described the cage home as the "dark side" of the otherwise wealthy Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cage dogs of Hong Kong: The tragedy of tens of thousands living in 6ft by 2ft rabbit hutches - in a city with more Louis Vuitton shops than Paris|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2084971/Hong-Kongs-cage-homes-Tens-thousands-living-6ft-2ft-rabbit-hutches.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail|first=Damien|last=Gayle|date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN]] has also reported and commented on the living environment of cage homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong cage home recession |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/business/2009/10/28/yoon.hkong.cage.home.recession.cnn?iref=videosearch | publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It described cage homes as the "size of a shoe box,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Living In a cage in Hong Kong |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/10/28/cage.homes/index.html | publisher=CNN | date=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported that it was difficult for the rest of the world to believe that such a large number of people are living in such poor accommodations in a so-called wealthy city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN News Story about cage homes in Hong Kong |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5hlF2RYdY0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hong Kong Legislative Council]] published a report about the problem of cage homes in 2008. The report offered some solutions to the problems of cage homes.&lt;ref name="legco" /&gt;

[[File:Blob Birmingham.jpg|thumb|The [[Selfridges]] building ("The Blob") in [[Birmingham]] by architect Jan Kaplicky of [[Future Systems]]]]

A '''blobject''' is a design product, often a household object, distinguished by smooth flowing curves, bright colors, and an absence of sharp edges. The word is generally held to be a [[portmanteau]], a contraction of "blob" and "object."

The origin of the term is disputed, but it is often attributed to either the designer-author Steven Skov Holt&lt;ref name="Skov"&gt;[http://www.cca.edu/academics/faculty/sholt CA College of the Arts Bio on Steven Skov Holt]&lt;/ref&gt; or the designer [[Karim Rashid]].  Author and design journalist Phil Patton&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=23367 Random House Bio of Phil Patton]&lt;/ref&gt; attributed the word to Holt in 1993 in [[Esquire magazine]]. Holt has defined a blobject as, most often, a colorful, [[mass-produced]], [[plastic]]-based, emotionally engaging [[consumer product]] with a curvilinear, flowing shape.  This fluid and curvaceous form is the blobject's most distinctive feature. Rashid, the contemporary designer who wrote the book ''I want to Change the World,'' was an early leader in creating blobjects and has become one of the most celebrated designers of his generation.

Blobjects can also be found in most areas of contemporary [[visual culture]]. 
* A blobject can be a typographic font (cf. [[Neville Brody]]), an animation (cf. Monica Peon), a piece of furniture ([[Marc Newson]]), an article of clothing ([[Rei Kawakubo]]), a motorcycle (GK Dynamics), a car (GEMCAR), a building ([[Future Systems]]), a painting ([[Rex Ray]]), a piece of sculpture (Hadeki Matsumoto), or ceramics work (Ken Price).
* Blobjects can be made of any material in any size or scale for the home, office, car, or outdoors.
Common materials used in fabricating blobjects are plastic (especially [[polycarbonate]], [[polypropylene]], or [[polyethylene]]), [[metal]], and [[rubber]], with the aim being to give a more organic and animate feel. 

The blobject trend has largely been driven by advances in [[computer-aided design]], [[information visualization]], [[rapid prototyping]], [[materials science|materials]], and [[injection molding]]. These technologies have given designers the chance to use new shapes and to explore transparency and translucency without significant extra production costs.

More recently, in 2004, author [[Bruce Sterling]] used the word in the title of his keynote speech at Siggraph.&lt;ref name="BlobjectsRule"&gt;[http://www.siggraph.org/s2004/media/releases/release6.php?pageID=media Siggraph 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his speech titled, "When Blobjects Rule the Earth", Sterling speculated on the future of graphic simulation when practical differences no longer exist between computer generated models and physically manufactured objects.

The '''[[Circassians]] in Iran''' ([[Kabardian language|East Circassian]] and [[Adyghe language|West Circassian]]: Адыгэхэр Къажэрей, ''Adyghexer Kŭazhéreĭ''; {{lang-fa|
چرکس های ایران}}) are an ethnic minority in Iran. Circassians in Iran differ somewhat from other Circassians in diaspora in that most in the former stem from the [[Safavids|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era, although a number migrated [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|as muhajirs in the late 19th century]] as well. The Circassians in Iran were very influential during periods in the last few centuries. The vast majority of them have assimilated to Persian language, and no sizeable number speaks their native [[Circassian languages]] anymore.&lt;ref name="mcha.kbsu.ru"/&gt; Once a very large minority in Iran, nowadays due to being heavily assimilated over the course of time and the lack of censuses based on ethnicity, population estimates vary significantly. They are, after the [[Iranian Georgians|Georgians]], the largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation.

In Persian, the word ''Cherkes'' ({{lang|fa|چرکس}}) is sometimes applied generally to [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian peoples]] living beyond [[Derbent]] in [[Dagestan]],&lt;ref name="ČARKAS"/&gt; which was the northernmost principal city of Iran prior to its ceding to [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] in the first half of the 19th century following the [[Treaty of Gulistan]].

==History==
Circassians in Iran have a long history. To a certain good extent, they shared the same role as their brethren who lived in neighbouring [[Ottoman Turkey]]; many were importees, deportees, slaves, but also made up many of the notable [[noble families]] in the empire, while many others were kingmakers, military commanders, soldiers, craftsmen, peasants, while they also composed many of the kings' wives and women in the [[harem]]. Under the various kings of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty]], many Circassians would eventually happen to live in Iran.

===Safavids===
The first Circassian presence in Iran dates to the early [[Safavid]] era, during which [[Shaykh Junayd]] raided various regions of [[Circassia]] and carried of prisoners back.&lt;ref name="Eskandar Beg, I, pp. 17–18"&gt;Eskandar Beg, I, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of king (''[[shah]]'') [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524-1576), the Circassians started to play an important role in Iranian society,&lt;ref name="Eskandar Beg, I, pp. 17–18"/&gt; and began to appear as a large ethnic group in the successive empires based in Iran.

In order to make a [[counterbalance]] to the tribal, ethnic, and favoured interests the [[Qizilbash]] gave which make a system imbalanced, Tahmasp I had already been making the first steps of creating a new layer in Iranian society.&lt;ref name="Tahmāsp I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tahmasp-i|title=Tahmāsp I|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kings before Tahmasp and he himself often found themselves incapable of ruling effectively due to the extremely strong influence the Qizilbash expressed in all spheres of the empire. The Qizilbash had formed the backbone of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safaviyya]] from the earliest days, and they had always provided substantial military as well, on which the Safavids relied for a long period of time. In order to break this system, a counterbalance was needed, and a new layer in society was the medium through which this could be reached.&lt;ref name="Tahmāsp I"/&gt; This new layer in society, was called the "third force", as they were a new ethnic class, or "force", alongside the Turkomans and Persians. This new layer, initiated by Tahmasp I, would be composed of many hundreds of thousands of [[Christian]] and [[pagan]] Caucasian, mostly ethnically Circassian and Georgian, deportees, importees, slaves, and migrants. This new society layer was to be eventually fully accomplished and implemented by king [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-v|title=BARDA and BARDA-DĀRI v. Military slavery in Islamic Iran|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of this new layer, a new military force was established as well; a force that would directly contest the [[hegemony]] of the Qizilbash everywhere in the empire, replace them from all their positions, thereby firmly securing the kings' grip over the kingdom. These ''[[ghilman|gholams]]'', or "military slaves", were part of this newly created layer in society. The ''gholam'' slave system, although initiated by Tahmasp I, was perfectioned and fully implemented by king Abbas I, and its rank and file were drawn from these massive amounts of ethnic Circassians, Georgians, Armenians and other [[peoples of the Caucasus]], such as [[Lezgins]]. Eventually, these large amounts of Circassians and other Caucasians, only loyal to the shah, replaced the Qizilbash and vied through the system with them for political hegemony and supremacy, and were to be victorious,&lt;ref name="ČARKAS"/&gt; although sometimes they would vy against each other as well.&lt;ref&gt;Babaie, Sussan (2004). "Slaves of the Shah: New Elites of Safavid Iran." pp. 17, I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1860647219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassians made up a good bulk of these elite armies (the so-called ''gholams''), and played therefore a pivotal role. This elite [slave system] army was similar to the [[Janissaries]] of neighbouring [[Ottoman Turkey]], in its implementation and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-v|title=BARDA and BARDA-DĀRI v. Military slavery in Islamic Iran|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ones in the armies received, after advanced education, conversion to [[Islam]], and upbringing by Muslim families, the best military training and equipment, and were the strongest force and class of the empire. Other large amounts of Circassians were, like the Georgians, employed and deployed in all other possible aspects and positions that the empires offered, such as the [[harem]], civil administration, military administration, peasantry, and craftry, amongst others, while other large numbers were initially settled in various regions in mainland Iran, including [[Gilan province|Gilan]], [[Mazandaran province|Mazandaran]], and [[Fars Province|Fars]].

According to [[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Thomas Herbert]], who was in [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iran]] in the first half of the 17th century, Aspas was inhabited by some 40,000 transplanted [[Christian]] [[Circassians]] and [[Georgians]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Herbert.

Many of the shahs, princes, and princesses descended from noble Circassian lines. Many of the Safavid nobility at the court were Circassian.&lt;ref&gt;Aptin Khanbaghi.

===Qajars===
Following [[Ethnic Cleansing of Circassians|the mass expulsion of the native Circassians]] of the Northwest Caucasus in 1864 mainly towards the Ottoman Empire, some also fled to neighboring [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]], which bordered the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Russia. In Iran, the government followed an assimilation policy, starting the gradual absorption of the Caucasian refugees into the population. Some of these deportees from after 1864 rose to various high ranks such as in the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], where every member of the army was either Circassian or any other type of ethnos from the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mepc.org/journal/middle-east-policy-archives/iranian-armed-forces-politics-revolution-and-war-part-one?print|title=The Iranian Armed Forces in Politics, Revolution and War: Part One|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day==
Despite heavy assimilation over the centuries, Circassian settlements have lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ČARKAS"/&gt; However, the [[Circassian language]]s once also widely used by the large Circassian minority, no sizable number of Circassians in Iran speak the language anymore.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-iv--2 |title=Georgia viii: Georgian communities in Persia |last1=Oberling |first1=Pierre |date=7 February 2012 |website=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html |title=Circassian |publisher=Official Circassian Association |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |title=Persians: Kind, hospitable, tolerant flattering cheats? |first1=Sir John |last1=Chardin |authorlink=Jean Chardin |date=June 1997 |journal=[[Iranian.com|The Iranian]] |accessdate=9 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970620173929/http://www.iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |archivedate=20 June 1997 |deadurl=no}} Excerpted from:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9136">{{Distinguish | Dickey-Wicker Amendment}}
In United States politics, the '''Dickey Amendment''' is a provision first inserted as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] into the 1996 federal government [[omnibus spending bill]] which mandated that "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote [[gun control]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ208/pdf/PLAW-104publ208.pdf|title=Public Law 104–208|last=104th Congress|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same spending bill, Congress earmarked $2.6 million from the CDC's budget, the exact amount that had previously been allocated to the agency for firearms research the previous year, for [[traumatic brain injury]]-related research.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/02/gun-violence.aspx | title=Gun violence research: History of the federal funding freeze | work=American Psychological Association | date=February 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Jamieson, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment was lobbied for by the NRA. The amendment is named after its author [[Jay Dickey]], a Republican member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=apa/&gt; Many commentators have described this amendment as a "ban" on gun violence research by the CDC.&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/cdc-still-cant-study-causes-gun-violence-180955884/?no-ist | title=Why So Few Scientists Are Studying the Causes of Gun Violence | work=Smithsonian Magazine | date=13 July 2015 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Fessenden, Marissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions taken==
The amendment was introduced after lobbying by the [[National Rifle Association]] in response to their perceived bias in a 1993 study by [[Arthur Kellermann]] that found that guns in the home were associated with an increased risk of [[homicide]] in the home, as well as other CDC funded studies and efforts.&lt;ref name=apa/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt; [[Mark L. Rosenberg]], the former director of the [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control]], has described this amendment as "a shot fired across the bow" at CDC researchers who wanted to research [[gun violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/their-1996-clash-shaped-the-gun-debate-for-years-now-they-want-to-reshape-it/2015/12/30/707bfed6-a8e5-11e5-bff5-905b92f5f94b_story.html | title=Their 1996 clash shaped the gun debate for years. Now they want to reshape it. | work=Washington Post | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Frankel, Todd C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 op-ed, Dickey and Rosenberg argued that the CDC should be able to research gun violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-wont-know-the-cause-of-gun-violence-until-we-look-for-it/2012/07/27/gJQAPfenEX_print.html | title=We won’t know the cause of gun violence until we look for it | work=Washington Post | date=27 July 2012 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Dickey, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dickey has since said that he regrets his role in stopping the CDC from researching gun violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/jay-dickey-gun-violence-research/ | title=Former GOP congressman flips on support for gun violence research | work=CNN | date=2 December 2015 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Diamond, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying he simply didn't want to "let any of those dollars go to gun control advocacy."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2015/10/09/447098666/ex-rep-dickey-regrets-restrictive-law-on-gun-violence-research&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to this amendment being adopted, the [[American Psychological Association]] adopted a resolution condemning it.&lt;ref name=apa/&gt; In December 2015, multiple medical organizations, including [[Doctors for America]], the [[American College of Preventive Medicine]], and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], called on Congress to repeal the amendment.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt; That same month, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] also called for an end to this amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/12/08/458952821/congress-still-limits-health-research-on-gun-violence | title=Congress Still Limits Health Research On Gun Violence | work=NPR | date=8 December 2015 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Kodjak, Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to remove the amendment==
In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] directed the CDC to research gun violence. The CDC responded by funding a research project in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18319/priorities-for-research-to-reduce-the-threat-of-firearm-related-violence?gclid=CjwKEAjwzN27BRDFn9aAwLmH2yISJABWuEXcG8-xLh_NaouZI4Muf0cS3__taXwWeUb0sPqaDckI6xoC7o3w_wcB|title=Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence|last=IOM (Institute of Medicine) and NRC (National Research Council)|first=|date=2013-06-05|isbn=9780309284387|doi=10.17226/18319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducting their own study in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dms/files/cdcgunviolencereport10315.pdf|title=Elevated Rates of Urban Firearm Violence and Opportunities for Prevention|last=Sumner|first=Steven|date=November 3, 2015|website=Elevated Rates of Urban Firearm Violence and Opportunities for Prevention|publisher=Delaware Department of Health and Social Services|access-date=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, a spokeswoman for the agency, Courtney Lenard, told the ''Washington Post'' that "It is possible for us to conduct firearm-related research within the context of our efforts to address youth violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, and suicide.

On March 21, 2018, Congressional negotiators reached a deal on an Omnibus continuing resolution.

{{World economy}}
The '''economy of North America''' comprises more than 579 million people (8% of the world population) in its [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America|23 sovereign states and 15 dependent territories]].  It is marked by a sharp division between the predominantly English speaking countries of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], which are among the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world, and countries of [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] in the former [[Latin America]] that are less developed. [[Mexico]] and Caribbean nations of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are between the economic extremes of the development of North America.

[[Mexico]] lies in between these two extremes as a [[newly industrialized country]] (NIC), and is a part of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), being one of the only two Latin American members of this organisation (together with Chile). The United States is by far the largest economy in North America and the largest national economy in the world.

The US, Canada and Mexico have significant and multifaceted economic systems.&lt;ref name="cia-us"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html "United States, Economy.] [https://www.cia.gov U.S. Central Intelligence Agence]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the US has an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $47,200, and is the most technologically developed economy in North America.&lt;ref name="cia-us"/&gt; The United States' services sector comprises 76.7% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22.2% and agriculture comprises 1.2%.&lt;ref name="cia-us"/&gt;

Canada's economic trends are similar to that of the United States, with significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.&lt;ref name="cia-ca"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html  "Canada, Economy.] [https://www.cia.gov U.S. Central Intelligence Agence]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's GDP (PPP) was estimated at $39,400 in 2010.&lt;ref name="cia-ca"/&gt; Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%.&lt;ref name="cia-ca"/&gt;

Mexico has a GDP (PPP) of $15,312, and per capita income is estimated at approximately one-third of the United States'.&lt;ref name="cia-mex"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html  "Mexico, Economy.] [https://www.cia.gov U.S. Central Intelligence Agence]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The country has both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations,&lt;ref name="cia-mex"/&gt; and is modernizing in sectors such as energy production, telecommunications and airports.&lt;ref name="cia-mex"/&gt;

==Economic development==
&lt;!--Note, some of these sections are  just labels for development.  Please don't remove sections just because they're empty--&gt;

===Great Depression===
The [[Great Depression]] began in North America in October 1929.  The start is often dated to the stock market collapse of [[Black Tuesday]] although this was not the cause of the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/oecon/chap3.htm|title = Outline of the U.S. Economy|publisher = U.S. Department of State|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314003528/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/oecon/chap3.htm|archivedate = 2007-03-14|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada and the United States experienced especially large declines, with the gross domestic product falling 37% from 1929 to 1933 in the United States, and 43% in Canada over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1929_39depression.html |title=The Great Depression (1929-1939): historical context, economic impact and related links |publisher=Government of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127051620/http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1929_39depression.html |archivedate=2009-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economy reached its lowest point in 1933, however recovery was slow.  The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 created demand for war materials that brought about the end of the depression.

The Great Depression spurred increased government intervention in the economy in North America.  The United States introduced unemployment insurance, a [[minimum wage]] and standardised working hours under the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/dolchp03.htm|title = U.S. Department of Labor -- Brief History of DOL - The Department in the New Deal and World War II, 1933-1945|publisher = U.S. Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada introduced similar measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1941ui.html|title = Unemployment Insurance Act (1941): historical context, economic impact and related links|publisher = Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico nationalised some key industries during the Great Depression, with the railroads nationalised by 1937 and the oil industry nationalised in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 1887752|title = The Good Neighbor Policy and the Nationalization of Mexican Oil: A Reinterpretation|author = Clayton R Koppes|publisher = The Journal of American History|volume = 69|issue = 1|pages = 62–81|date=June 1982|journal = The Journal of American History|doi = 10.2307/1887752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
The large scale enlistment of men into armed forces during [[World War II]] women entered the workforce en masse, filling many jobs in manufacturing and technical areas that had previously been closed to women.  This led to the "We can do it!" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tupperware/sfeature/sf_women.html|title = American Experience {{!}} Tupperware! {{!}} Women and Work |publisher = Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic output in North America increased substantially, with unemployment practically eliminated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nationalww2museum.org/education/history_war.html|title = The National World War II Museum, New Orleans|publisher = The National World War II Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rationing severely reduced the availability of consumer goods, with the increase in industrial production coming from the demand for war materials. During the peak of World War II activity, nearly 40 per cent of US GDP was devoted to war production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=98|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA - a new era of economic integration===
The [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] of 1989 and the subsequent expansion to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) triggered a dramatic increase in trade between these three countries, with Mexican trade with the United States and Canada increasing threefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/mx.html|title = CIA - The World Factbook -- Mexico|publisher = Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 85% of Canadian exports in 2006 went to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html|title = CIA - The World Factbook -- Canada|publisher = Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variation==
With various climate zones, agricultural products vary from country to country. Job sectors are also different, with industrialized countries having more service workers, and developing countries relling on agriculture.

==Trade blocs==

===Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation===
The [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) is a group of [[Pacific Rim]] countries which meet with the purpose of improving economic and political ties. APEC's stated goals are aimed at free and open trade and investments by cutting tariffs between zero and five percent in the Asia-Pacific area for industrialised economies by 2010 and for developing economies by 2020.

The organisation has members from four continents, those from North America are [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]].

===Caribbean Community===
The [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) was created ''"To provide dynamic leadership and service, in partnership with Community institutions and Groups, toward the attainment of a viable, internationally competitive and sustainable Community, with improved quality of life for all"''. It's secretariat is based in [[Georgetown, Guyana]], South America.

- On January 1, 2006 six members: ([[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]) unofficially ushered in the [[Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy]] (CSME).

- At the official signing of the protocol on January 30, 2006 in Jamaica, A further six members: ([[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]) announced their intention to join by the second quarter of 2006. [[Montserrat]], a British Oversees territory is awaiting approval by the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Haiti]] and [[the Bahamas]] have no immediate plans to join.

===Central American Free Trade Agreement===
The [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) is an agreement between the [[United States]] and the Central American countries of [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]]. The treaty is aimed at promoting [[free trade]] between its members. [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] are negotiating membership.

===North American Free Trade Agreement===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) is an agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States to eliminate tariffs on goods traded between themselves.

Although currently only a trade agreement, with no supranational bodies or laws as in the [[European Union]], there have been various proposals to move towards a [[customs union]] or a [[North American currency union]]. It is unknown whether this may eventually develop into a [[North American Union]] similar to that of [[Europe]].

==Currency==

Below is a '''list of the currencies of North America''', with exchange rates between each currency and both the ''euro'' and ''US dollars'' &lt;sup&gt;as of 12 April 2008&lt;/sup&gt;. This list may vary as it is not current.

[[Agriculture]] is very important in Central American and Caribbean nations. In western Canada, in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, wheat and other various main agricultural products are grown. The U.S. also has many states with significant agriculture production, mainly in the central continental U.S. Mexico produces many tropical fruits and vegetables as well as edible animals.

===Manufacturing===
North America has developed and its [[manufacturing]] sector has grown. In the beginning the European nations were the large manufacturing powers. At the start of the 1950s, the United States was a top manufacturing power, with Canada and Mexico also making significant progress.

===Service===
In Canada, the US and the Caribbean, service-based employment is a significant percentage of overall employment. Many people work in stores and other retail locations. In Canada more than 70% work in the services sector, with a similar percentage in the United States.

===Investment and banking===
The United States leads North America in [[investment]] and [[bank]]ing. Canada, Mexico and most recently, February 2011,  El Salvador is growing in this sector.  And smaller economic powers such as Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama are also growing slowly in this sector.

===Tourism===
[[Tourism]] is extremely important for the Caribbean economies, as they contain many beaches and have warm climates. Skiing in Canada and the US is also important. Tourism of [[national parks]] and natural landmarks, such as [[Mount Rushmore]] and the [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States, and [[Niagara Falls]] and [[Moraine lake]] in Canada, contribute to the economy in these regions.

'''Embedded journalism''' refers to [[news]] [[journalist|reporters]] being attached to [[military]] units involved in [[armed conflicts]]. While the term could be applied to many historical interactions between journalists and military personnel, it first came to be used in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq media coverage|media coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The [[United States military]] responded to pressure from the country's news media who were disappointed by the level of access granted during the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]].

The practice has been criticized as being part of a [[propaganda campaign]] whereby embedded journalists accompanied the invading forces as cheerleaders and [[flacks]].

== 2003 invasion of Iraq ==

At the start of the war in March 2003, as many as 775 reporters and photographers were traveling as embedded journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/03/15_mediatwar.shtml|title=Reporters, commentators conduct an in-depth postmortem of Iraq war's media coverage|website=www.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reporters signed contracts with the military promising not to report information that could compromise unit position, future missions, classified weapons, and information they might find.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june03/embed_3-27.html|title=Pros and Cons of Embedded Journalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militarycity.com/iraq/1631270.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902091331/http://www.militarycity.com/iraq/1631270.html |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint training for war correspondents started in November 2002 in advance of start of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/01/usnews.iraq|title=Flabby journalists sent to boot camp|first=Julian|last=Borger|date=1 November 2002|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why the military decided to embed journalists with the troops, Lt. Col. Rick Long of the U.S. Marine Corps replied, "Frankly, our job is to win the war. Part of that is [[information warfare]]. So we are going to attempt to dominate the information environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/03/18_iraqmedia.shtml|title=Postmortem: Iraq war media coverage both dazzled and obscured|website=www.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military control ==

The first journalist to run afoul of U.S. military rules in Iraq was freelancer Philip Smucker, travelling on assignment for the'' [[Christian Science Monitor]] ''with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. Smucker was not officially embedded, but all reporters in the theater of war were deemed subject to Pentagon oversight. On March 26, 2003, during an interview with [[CNN]], Smucker disclosed the location of a Marine unit, as he'd also done during an interview with [[National Public Radio|NPR]]. He was thereafter expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silha.umn.edu/news/spring2003.php?entry=202816|title=: Silha Center : University of Minnesota|website=www.silha.umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just four days later, [[Fox News Channel]] correspondent [[Geraldo Rivera]] similarly broadcast details from Iraq of the position and plans of U.S. troops. "Let me draw a few lines here for you," he said, making on-camera marks in the sand. "First, I want to make some emphasis here that these hash marks here, this is us. We own that territory. It's 40%, maybe even a little more than that." At another point, complained a [[United States Central Command|CENTCOM]] spokesman, Rivera "actually revealed the time of an attack prior to its occurrence." Although Rivera—like Philip Smucker—was not officially embedded, he was swiftly escorted back to Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/01/us/a-nation-at-war-coverage-pentagon-says-geraldo-rivera-will-be-removed-from-iraq.html|title=A NATION AT WAR: COVERAGE; Pentagon Says Geraldo Rivera Will Be Removed From Iraq|first=David|last=Carr|date=1 April 2003|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Rivera apologized. "I'm sorry that it happened," he said on Fox News Channel, "and I assure you that it was inadvertent. Nobody was hurt by what I said. No mission was compromised." However, a network review, he admitted, "showed that I did indeed break one of the rules related to embedment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-04-07/news/18220259_1_geraldo-rivera-fox-news-channel-kuwait|title=Geraldo: I Messed Up, But 'Nobody Was Hurt'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005 the U.S. Coalition Forces Land Component Command in Kuwait pulled the credentials of two embedded journalists on a two-week assignment for the Virginian-Pilot newspaper in Norfolk, Virginia, claiming they violated a prohibition against photographing damaged vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Article/MRE-Criticizes-Expelling-of-Embeds-Over-Pix-of-Shot-Up-Humvee|title=MRE Criticizes Expelling of Embeds Over Pix of  Shot-Up Humvee – Editor &amp; Publisher|website=www.editorandpublisher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The [[ethics]] of embedded journalism are considered controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/embedistan-2/|title=Embedistan|first=Stephen|last=Farrell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/embedistan-embedding-in-iraq-during-the-invasion-and-the-drawdown/|title=Embedistan: Embedding in Iraq During the Invasion and the Drawdown|first=Steven Lee|last=Myers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has been criticized as being part of a [[propaganda]] campaign and an effort to keep reporters away from civilian populations and sympathetic to invading forces; for example by the [[documentary film]]s ''[[War Made Easy: How Presidents &amp; Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death]]'' and ''[[The War You Don't See]]''.

Embed critics objected that the level of military oversight was too strict and that embedded journalists would make reports that were too sympathetic to the American side of the war, leading to use of the alternate term "inbedded journalist" or "inbeds". "Those correspondents who drive around in tanks and armored personnel carriers," said journalist [[Gay Talese]] in an interview, "who are spoon-fed what the military gives them and they become mascots for the military, these journalists. I wouldn't have journalists embedded if I had any power!... There are stories you can do that aren't done. I've said that many times."&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Gay Talese on the state of journalism, Iraq and his life|Interview with Gay Talese]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an opinion piece critical of embedded journalism during both the U.S. [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|military occupation of Iraq]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. It was written by PVT [[Chelsea Manning]], the former U.S. Army intelligence analyst known for leaking the largest set of classified documents in American history. At no point during her 2009–10 deployment in Iraq, Manning wrote, were there more than a dozen American journalists covering military operations—in a country of 31 million people and 117,000 U.S. troops. Manning charged that vetting of reporters by military public affairs officials was used "to screen out those judged likely to produce critical coverage," and that once embedded, journalists tended "to avoid controversial reporting that could raise red flags" out of fear having their access terminated. "A result," wrote Manning, "is that the American public's access to the facts is gutted, which leaves them with no way to evaluate the conduct of American officials." Manning noted, "This program of limiting press access was challenged in court in 2013 by a freelance reporter, Wayne Anderson, who claimed to have followed his agreement but to have been terminated after publishing adverse reports about the conflict in Afghanistan. The ruling on his case upheld the military's position that there was no constitutionally protected right to be an embedded journalist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/opinion/sunday/chelsea-manning-the-us-militarys-campaign-against-media-freedom.html|title=Opinion - Chelsea Manning on the U.S. Military and Media Freedom|first=Chelsea|last=Manning|date=14 June 2014|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gina Cavallaro]], a reporter for the ''[[Army Times]], ''said, "They’re [the journalists] relying more on the military to get them where they want to go, and as a result, the military is getting smarter about getting its own story told." But, she added, "I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Iraq/embedded.html|title=Embed Cavallaro sees war from the inside|date=6 April 2005|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406014752/http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Iraq/embedded.html|archivedate=6 April 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dangers ==

During both the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) were used extensively against U.S.-led Coalition forces, and accounted for the majority of Coalition casualties. Journalists travelling with ground forces were at the same risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/10/journalists-afghanistan-deaths-kidnapping|title=How journalists embedded in Afghanistan are too close for comfort|first=Jon|last=Boone|date=10 January 2010|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4b4b39c0c.html|title=Refworld - UNESCO deplores recent killing, abduction of journalists in Afghanistan|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2006, while embedded with the U.S. Army's [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], ABC's [[ABC World News|''World News Tonight'']] co-anchor [[Bob Woodruff]] and cameraman [[Doug Vogt]] were, together with an Iraqi soldier, seriously injured when their convoy was ambushed near [[Taji, Iraq]], and an IED detonated beneath them. At the time of the attack, Woodruff and Vogt were exposed, standing in the back hatch of their Iraqi mechanized vehicle taping a video log of the patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/IraqCoverage/story?id=1553996&amp;page=1|title=Woodruff, Cameraman Seriously Injured in Iraq|first=A.

'''Gautam Radhakrishna Desiraju''' is an Indian [[chemist]] who has contributed substantially to the themes of crystal engineering and weak [[hydrogen bonding]]. He has authored books on these subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Desiraju, G. R.: "Crystal Engineering. The Design of Organic Solids", Elsevier, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desiraju, G. R. and Steiner, T.: "The Weak Hydrogen Bond in Structural Chemistry and Biology", Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He has co-authored a textbook in crystal engineering (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Desiraju, G. R., Vittal, J. J. and Ramanan, A.:"Crystal Engineering. A Textbook", World Scientific, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the most highly cited Indian scientists and has been recognised by awards such as the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] Forschungspreis, the ISA Medal for Science 2018 of the University of Bologna and the [[TWAS Prize]] in Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Prizes and Awards"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twas.org/opportunities/prizes-and-awards |title=Prizes and Awards |date=2016 |publisher=The World Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as President of the [[International Union of Crystallography]] for the triennium 2011–2014.

==Biography==
Gautam Desiraju was born 21 August 1952 in [[Madras]], [[India]]. He had his schooling in Cathedral and John Connon Boys School in [[Bombay]] and obtained his B.Sc. (1972) from St. Xavier's College, [[Bombay]]. He obtained his Ph.D. (1976) from [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] where he worked under the supervision of David Y. Curtin and Iain C. Paul.  He worked between 1976 and 1978 in the Research Laboratories of [[Eastman Kodak Company]] in Rochester, NY. From 1978 to 1979 he was a research fellow in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. He joined the [[University of Hyderabad]] in 1979 as a lecturer and was promoted as reader in 1984 and professor in 1990. He spent a year (1988–1989) in the CR&amp;D department of [[DuPont]] in Wilmington as a visiting scientist. After 30 years in the [[University of Hyderabad]], he joined the [[Indian Institute of Science]] in Bangalore in 2009. He is a member of the editorial advisory boards of [[Angewandte Chemie]], [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] and [[Chemical Communications]].  He is a past president of the [[International Union of Crystallography]][http://www.iucr.org/] during 2011-2014. He was the chair of the first [[Gordon Research Conferences|Gordon Research Conference]] in Crystal Engineering, which was held in 2010. He is a recipient of an honorary doctorate degree of the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]], Argentina and of the [[Rayalaseema University]], Kurnool. He organized in August 2017, with a Local Organizing Committee, the 24th Congress and General Assembly of the [[International Union of Crystallography]] [http://www.iucr2017.org] in Hyderabad. He was awarded the Acharya P. C. Ray Medal of the [[University of Calcutta]] for 2015, in January 2018, for innovation in science and technology.

==Major research contributions==

Desiraju's contribution to the subject of crystal engineering has focus on the concept of the [[supramolecular synthon]], which is a small sub-structural unit that is an adequate enough representation of the entire crystal structure of a molecular solid. The major problem in crystal engineering is that the prediction of a crystal structure from a molecular structure is very difficult and not easily derivable from functional groups. Identification of supramolecular synthons simplifies this otherwise intractable problem.&lt;ref&gt;Desiraju, G. R.: "Supramolecular Synthons in Crystal Engineering. A New Organic Synthesis", Angewandte Chemie International Edition Engl., 1995, 34, 2311.&lt;/ref&gt;  The supramolecular synthon concept is now widely used by crystal engineers in the design of molecular crystals and pharmaceutical co-crystals, which are important from scientific and commercial viewpoints. Crystal engineering is effectively like supramolecular synthesis in the solid state, and there is a direct analogy between the supramolecular synthon of Desiraju and the molecular [[synthon]] that was proposed for organic synthesis by [[E. J. Corey]].

Desiraju's second area of contribution focuses on weakly activated groups like the C-H group can act as donors of hydrogen bonds in molecular and biomolecular systems. These weak hydrogen bonds had been discussed sporadically since the 1930s, but it was only after the 1980s that the idea of a weakly activated group forming hydrogen bonds gained acceptance in the chemical community. Desiraju was among the few structural chemists who argued in those early days that the [[C–H···O interaction|C-H...O]] and other weak interactions have a hydrogen bond character.

Desiraju has authored around 425 publications. In addition to the three books on crystal engineering and hydrogen bonding, he has edited three multi-author books on these topics in structural chemistry. He has guided the PhD work of nearly 40 students over the past 38 years.

==General writing==
Desiraju has authored several commentaries on science, the evolution of chemistry as a subject,&lt;ref&gt;Desiraju, G. R.: "Chemistry. The Middle Kingdom", Current Science, 2005, 88, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; emergence and complexity, and research habits and practices in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Desiraju, G. R.: "Bold strategies for Indian science", Nature, 2012, 484, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written articles about the state of science education and research in India,[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2007/02/19/stories/2007021902651000.htm], and about the current status of chemistry research in India,&lt;ref&gt;Arunan, E., Brakaspathy, R., Desiraju, G. R., Sivaram, S.: "Chemistry in India: Unlocking the Potential", Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 2013, 52, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; where he has identified problems and suggested solutions in situations that are, in part, expected in a country that is rooted in the traditional but yet aspires for the contemporary.

==ISI Ratings==
His two authored books on crystal engineering and the weak hydrogen bond have around 3000 and 5000 cites each. His 1995 review in Angewandte Chemie has been cited more than 3400 times. Five of his 425 publications have been cited 1000 or more times, 24 over 200, and 55 over 100. He has an [[h-index]] of 78 [[Web of Science]] and this makes him one of the most highly cited scientists in India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">'''Generationism''' is the belief that a specific generation has inherent traits that make it inferior or superior to another generation. The term is usually applied to claims of superiority in the expressed values, valuations, lifestyles and general beliefs of one generation compared to those of another, where objectively verifiable criteria substantiating the claim of superiority in themselves are lacking. 

Generationism is most commonly used as an accusation against the belief that the contemporary generation in itself is inherently superior to previous generations, for example through the common practice of pejoratively referring to ancient cultures as "primitive" – not to be confused with the positive label of [[primitivism]] – although an older generation's opposition to the values and lifestyles of a younger generation may also popularly be referred to as generationist.

Generationism as a recurring sociological phenomenon has been studied in detail by the Swedish philosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] in their work "The Global Empire" (published in Swedish in 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{BardSoderqvist2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bard and Söderqvist regard generationism as a close but far less frequently analyzed relative of [[racism]] which they propose should be studied in more detail to strengthen the general argumentation for [[relativism]] and [[pragmatism]] in contemporary philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9742">'''Gruban v Booth''' was a 1917 fraud case in England that generated significant publicity because the defendant, [[Frederick Handel Booth]], was a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]]. Gruban was a German-born businessman who ran several factories that made tools for manufacturing munitions for the [[First World War]]. In an effort to find money to expand his business he contacted a businessman and Member of Parliament named Frederick Handel Booth, who agreed to provide the necessary money. After stealing money Booth tricked Gruban into handing over the company and then had him [[Internment|interned]] under war-time regulations to prevent the story coming out.

Gruban successfully appealed against his internment, and as soon as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case was so popular that the involved [[barrister]]s found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of [[Patrick Hastings]], and his victory in it led to him applying to become a [[Queen's Counsel|King's Counsel]].

==Background==
[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Lloyd George]], the [[Minister of Munitions]]]]
John Gruban was a German-born businessman, originally named Johann Wilhelm Gruban, who had come to England in 1893 to work for an engineering company, Haigh and Company.&lt;ref name="h18"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.57&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913 he had turned the business from an almost bankrupt company to a successful manufacturer of machine tools, and at the outbreak of the [[First World War]] it was one of the first companies to produce machine tools used to make munitions.&lt;ref name="h18"/&gt; This made Gruban a major player in a now-large market, and he attempted to raise [[Pound sterling|£]]5,000 to expand his business.&lt;ref name="h18"/&gt; On independent advice he contacted [[Frederick Handel Booth]], a noted [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] who was chairman of the Yorkshire Iron and Coal Company and had led the government inquiry into the [[Marconi scandal]].&lt;ref name="h19"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.58&lt;/ref&gt; When Gruban contacted Booth, Booth told him that he could do "more for [your] company than any man in England", claiming that [[David Lloyd George]] (at the time [[Minister of Munitions]]) and many other important government officials were close friends.&lt;ref name="h19"/&gt; With £3,500 borrowed from his brother-in-law, Booth immediately invested in Gruban's company.&lt;ref name="h19"/&gt;

The sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it difficult to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent.&lt;ref name="h19"/&gt; He again contacted Booth, who again claimed to be friends with David Lloyd George and his secretary, [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]], and said that if Gruban put Booth on the [[Board of Directors]] he could "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like".&lt;ref name="h19"/&gt; Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took £400 on expenses.&lt;ref name="h19"/&gt; He then claimed that this was not enough money for the work he did, and he should get a secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the "Birmingham Contract".&lt;ref name="h19"/&gt; The contract was worth £6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have £580 or £600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the [[Wastepaper Basket|wastepaper basket]].&lt;ref name="h20"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.59&lt;/ref&gt; From that point onwards Booth worked as hard as he could to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.&lt;ref name="h20"/&gt;

Over the next few months a series of complaints came from the [[Ministry of Munitions]] about Gruban's work and his German origins, ending in a written statement by David Lloyd George's private secretary that it was "undesirable that any person of recent German nationality or association should at the present time be connected in an important capacity with any company or firm engaged in the production of munitions of war".&lt;ref name="h20"/&gt; Booth showed this to Gruban and told him that the only way to save the company and prevent Gruban being [[Internment|interned]] was for him to transfer the ownership of the company to Booth.&lt;ref name="h21"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Gruban did this, and Booth immediately "came out in his true colours",&lt;ref name="h21"/&gt; treating Gruban with contempt and refusing to help support his wife and family now that Gruban had no income.&lt;ref name="h21"/&gt; Eventually Booth wrote to the Ministry of Munitions saying that Gruban had "taken leave of his senses", and the Ministry had Gruban interned.&lt;ref name="h21"/&gt;

Gruban appealed against the internment order, and was called before a court consisting of [[Robert Younger, Baron Blanesburgh|Mr Justice Younger]] and [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Mr Justice Sankey]].&lt;ref name="h21"/&gt; After reviewing the facts of the case and the stories of Gruban and Booth the judges ordered the immediate release of Gruban, and recommended that he seek legal advice to see if he could regain control of his company.&lt;ref name="h21"/&gt; After he was released Gruban found a [[solicitor]], W.J. Synott, who gave the case to [[Patrick Hastings]].&lt;ref name="h22"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
[[Patrick Hastings|Hastings]] felt that their best chances lay in interviewing [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] about his contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister he could be relied on to tell the truth.&lt;ref name="h22"/&gt; The case of ''Gruban v Booth'' opened on 7 May 1917 at the [[King's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice]] in front of [[Bernard Coleridge, 2nd Baron Coleridge|Mr Justice Coleridge]].&lt;ref name="h22"/&gt; Patrick Hastings and [[Hubert Wallington]] represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by [[Rigby Swift]] [[King's Counsel|KC]] and [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]].&lt;ref name="h22"/&gt; The trial attracted such public interest that on the final day the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts.&lt;ref name="h22"/&gt;

As counsel for the prosecution, Hastings was the first barrister to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying that one of the things which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel sure that your sense of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit to sit in the House of Commons, as he has been guilty of fraud".&lt;ref name="h23"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Hastings then called Gruban to the witness stand, and asked him to tell the jury what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over [[David Lloyd George]].&lt;ref name="h23"/&gt; Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.&lt;ref name="h23"/&gt;

Booth was then called to the witness stand, and initially claimed that Gruban had claimed to be "a very powerful man" and that it had been a case of Gruban using his power to help Booth, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="h23"/&gt; He was still in the witness box when the court day ended, and the next morning it was announced that [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] had come to the court.&lt;ref name="h24"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The judge allowed Addison to give his testimony before they continued with Booth, and during a cross-examination by Hastings Addison stated that he had not been advising Booth in any way, and that "to say that Gruban's only chance of escape from internment was to hand over his shares to Mr Booth was a lie".&lt;ref name="h24"/&gt;

The final witness was Handel Booth himself.&lt;ref name="h25"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Booth stated that he would never have asked for a ten-percent commission on the Birmingham contract, and that he had never claimed he could influence government ministers.&lt;ref name="h25"/&gt; Hastings showed the jury that both of these statements were lies, first by showing the piece of paper Booth had scribbled the "Birmingham contract" memo on and then by showing a telegram from Booth to Gruban in which Booth claimed that he "[had] already spoken to a Cabinet Minister and high official".&lt;ref name="h25"/&gt;

In his summing up [[Bernard Coleridge, 2nd Baron Coleridge|Mr Justice Coleridge]] was "on the whole unfavourable to Booth". He also pointed out that the German nationality of Gruban might prejudice the jury, and asked them to "be sure that you permit no prejudice on their hand to disturb the balance of the scales of justice".&lt;ref name="h26"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.67&lt;/ref&gt; The jury decided the case in only ten minutes, finding Booth guilty and awarding Gruban £4,750.&lt;ref name="h26"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5788">The '''Hadjarai''' are a group of peoples comprising 6.7% of the population of [[Chad]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/cd.html "Chad"], [[The World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt; or more than 150,000 people.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[James S.

It is used collectively to describe several distinct ethnic groups living in the hilly [[Guéra Region]].&lt;ref name=Decalo&gt;{{cite book|author=Decalo, Samuel|title=Historical Dictionary of Chad|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1987|page=160|isbn=0-8108-1937-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subgroups and culture ==
The fifteen&lt;ref name=Chesley/&gt; Hadjarai ethnic groups include the [[Daju people|Daju]]s, Kengas, [[Junkun]], [[Dangaleat]]s, [[Mogoum]]s, [[Sokoro]]s, [[Saba people|Saba]]s, [[Barains]], [[Bidio]]s, [[Yalnas]],&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; [[Bolgo]]s, [[Koffa]]s and [[Djongor]]s.&lt;ref name=Chapelle/&gt; Most of these are small farmers.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; Over 90% of Hadjarai women have undergone [[female genital cutting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78726.htm Chad - Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  - 2006], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, March 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Hadjarai groups speak diverse languages, they share many cultural traits,&lt;ref name=Chesley&gt;{{cite conference| last = Chesley| first = William T.| title = Une enquete sociolinguistique parmi les sokoro du Guera| booktitle = Société Internationale du Linguistique| date = May 1994| url = http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/afrikanistik/cnl/unpublished/pdf/sokoro.pdf| language = French| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184118/http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/afrikanistik/cnl/unpublished/pdf/sokoro.pdf| archivedate = 2007-09-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the most prevalent of which is a common belief in ''[[margais]]'', i.e., invisible spirits that control the natural elements. This belief has survived the rapid conversion of most Hadjarai to Islam during the [[French Chad|colonial period]], despite attempts by the French colonial authorities to avoid Islamization through the promotion of Christian missions.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Decalo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapelle&gt;{{cite book|author=Chapelle, Jean|title=Le Peuple Tchadien: ses racines et sa vie quotidienne|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=1981|pages=178–179|isbn=2-85802-169-4|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Though never united in the past,&lt;ref name=Decalo/&gt; the Hadjarai people share a strong spirit of independence, forged in pre-colonial Chad by their repeated clashes with slave-raiding ''[[Ghazw|razzia]]s'' in their territory, and supported in particular by the [[Ouaddai Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buijtenhuijs, Robert|title=Le Frolinat et les révoltes populaires du Tchad, 1965-1976|publisher=Mouton Éditeur|year=1978|page=45|isbn=90-279-7657-0 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of independence has led to frequent clashes with the central government after Chad gained independence in 1960, at first largely because of attempts to force them to move from the hills to the plains. They were among the staunchest supporters of the rebels during the [[Transitional Government of National Unity|Chadian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Chapelle/&gt; 

Although the Hadjarai played a crucial role in bringing to power [[Hissène Habré]] in 1982, they grew alienated from him after the death of their spokesman [[Idriss Miskine]]. They suffered heavily in 1987, after Habré launched a campaign of terror against them in response to the formation of the [[MOSANAT]] rebel movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Sam Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu, Sam C.]]|title=Limits of Anarchy: Intervention and State Formation in Chad|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1995|page=234|isbn=0-8139-1628-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the group were arrested and even killed ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Brody, Reed |title=The Prosecution of Hissène Habré - An "African Pinochet" |journal=New England Law Review |volume=35 |pages=321–335 |date=Winter 2001 |url=http://www.nesl.edu/lawrev/vol35/2/brody.PDF |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AThe+Prosecution+of+Hiss%C3%A8ne+Habr%C3%A9+-+An+%22African+Pinochet%22&amp;as_publication=New+England+Law+Review&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904125234/http://www.nesl.edu/lawrev/vol35/2/brody.PDF |archivedate=September 4, 2006 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 840 of those arrested appear to have been immediately killed.&lt;ref&gt;S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', 236&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hadjarai became important supporters of [[Idriss Déby]]'s rebellion against the President and contributed to Habré's downfall in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Atlas| first1 = Pierre M.| last2 =Licklider| first2 = Roy| title = Conflict among Former Allies after Civil War Settlement: Sudan, Zimbabwe, Chad, and Lebanon| journal = Journal of Peace Research| volume =36 | pages =35–54 | year = 1999| doi = 10.1177/0022343399036001003| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crisis among Déby and the Hadjarai leadership flared in 1991 after an alleged coup attempt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17399">'''Institutional complementarity''' refers to situations of interdependence among [[institutions]]. This concept is frequently used to explain the degree of institutional diversity that can be observed across and within [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] systems, and its consequences on economic performance. In particular, the concept of institutional complementarity has been used to illustrate why institutions are resistant to change and why introducing new institutions into a system often leads to unintended, sometimes suboptimal, consequences.&lt;ref name="Gagliardi"&gt;Gagliardi, F. (2014). A Bibliometric Analysis of the Literature on Institutional Complementarities, ''Mimeo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches, based on the concept of institutional complementarities, have found applications across a wide range of institutional spheres, going from firm governance and industrial relations to varieties of capitalism and political reforms. Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity. After a brief description of the canonical formal representation of institutional complementarity, the most relevant domains of applications will be discussed.

==Models of institutional complementarity==
The concept of institutional complementarity has deep roots in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Lachmann"&gt;Lachmann, L.M. (1979), The legacy of Max Weber, Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociological approach of the interdependence of different institutions has left the actions of the individuals largely outside the analysis, the modern approach, developed mainly by economists, has been based on the analysis of the constraints facing the actions of the individuals acting in different domains of choice. This approach has found applications across a wide range of institutional spheres, going from firm governance and industrial relations to varieties of capitalism and political reforms. Formal models have also been developed to study the nature and consequences of institutional complementarity.

The canonical model of institutional complementarity is due to [[Masahiko Aoki]]&lt;ref name="Aoki"&gt;Aoki, M. (2001), Towards a comparative institutional analysis, MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; and relies on the theory of supermodular games developed by [[Paul Milgrom]] and [[John Roberts]].&lt;ref name="MIlgromRoberts"&gt;Milgrom P, Roberts J (1990) Rationalizability, lerning and equilibrium in games with strategic complementarities. Econometrica 58(6): 1255–1277.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic structure of the model takes the following form.

Let us consider a setting with two institutional domains, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, and two sets of agents, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} that do not directly interact with each other. Nevertheless, an institution implemented in one domain parametrically affects the consequences of the actions taken in the other domain. For instance, {{math|''A''}} can be associated with the type of ownership structure prevailing in a given country and {{math|''B''}} with the structure of labour rights. For simplicity we assume that the technological and natural environment is constant.

Suppose that the agents in domain {{math|''A''}} can choose a rule from two alternative options: {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; similarly, agents in domain {{math|''B''}} can choose a rule from either {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For simplicity, let us assume that all agents in each domain have an identical payoff function {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''u''(''i'' ∈ ''C'')}} or {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''v''(''j'' ∈ ''D'')}} defined on binary choice sets of their own, either  {{math|&amp;#123;''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#125;}}  or {{math|&amp;#123;''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#125;}}, with another sets as the set of parameters. We say that an (endogenous) “rule” is institutionalized in a domain when it is implemented as an equilibrium choice of agents in the relevant domains.

Suppose that the following conditions hold:
: &lt;math&gt; u(A^1; B^1) - u(A^2; B^1) \geq u(A^1; B^2) - u(A^2; B^2) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; u(B^2; A^2) - u(B^1; A^2) \geq u(B^2; A^1) - u(B^1; A^1) &lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}. The latter are the so-called [[supermodular]] (complementarity) conditions. The first condition implies that the “incremental” benefit for the agents in {{math|''A''}} from choosing {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} rather than {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} increases as their institutional environment in  {{math|''B''}} is {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}  rather than {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} . The second condition implies that the incremental benefit for agents in {{math|''B''}}  from choosing {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}  rather than {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}  increases if their institutional environment in {{math|''A''}}  is {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}  rather than {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Note that these conditions are concerned with the property of incremental payoffs with respect to a change in a parameter value. They do not exclude the possibility that the level of payoff of one rule is strictly higher than that of the other for the agents of one or both domain(s) regardless of the choice of rule in the other domain. In such a case the preferred rule(s) will be implemented autonomously in the relevant domain, while the agents in the other domain will choose the rule that maximizes their payoffs in response to their institutional environment. Then the equilibrium of the system comprising {{math|''A''}}  and {{math|''B''}} – and thus the institutional arrangement across them – is uniquely determined by preference (technology).

However, there can also be cases in which neither rule dominates the other in either domain in the sense described above. If so, the agents in both domains need to take into account which rule is institutionalized in the other domain. Under the supermodularity condition there can then be two pure [[Nash equilibria]] (institutional arrangements) for the system comprising {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, namely {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. When such multiple equilibria exist, we say that {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as well as {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, are “institutional complements”.

If institutional complementarity exists, each institutional arrangement characterizes as a self-sustaining equilibrium where no agent has an inventive to deviate. It terms of welfare, it may be the case that possible overall institutional arrangements are not mutually Pareto comparable, or that one of them could be even Pareto suboptimal to the other. In these cases history is the main force determining which type of institutional arrangements is likely to emerge, with the consequence that suboptimal outcomes are possible.

Suppose for instance that {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a Pareto-superior institutional arrangement in which {{math|''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} . However, for some historical reason {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is chosen in domain {{math|''A''}} and becomes an institutional environment for domain {{math|''B''}}. Faced with this institutional environment agents in domain {{math|''B''}} will correspondingly react by choosing reason {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus the Pareto-suboptimal institutional arrangement {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} will result. This is an instance of coordination failure in the presence of indivisibility.

Obviously, there can also be cases where {{math|''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''u''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} but {{math|''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) &gt; ''v''(''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. This is an instance where the two viable institutional arrangements cannot be Pareto ranked. Agents exhibit conflicting interests in the two equilibria and the emergence of one institutional arrangement as opposed to the other may depend on the distribution of decisional power. If for some reasons agents choosing in domain A have the power to select and enforce their preferred rule, arrangement {{math|(''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is the most likely outcome. Alternatively, agents choosing in domain B will force the society to adopt {{math|(''B''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

==Applications==
[[Ugo Pagano]] and [[Robert Rowthorn]] &lt;ref name="Pagano92"&gt;Pagano U (1992) Organizational equilibria and production efficiency. Metroeconomica 43: 227–246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaganoRowthorn"&gt;Pagano U, Rowthorn R (1994) Ownership, technology and institutional stability. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 5(2): 221–242.&lt;/ref&gt;  present one of the earliest analytical contribution to institutional complementarity. In their models the technological choices take as parameters property rights arrangements whereas the latter are made on the basis of given technologies. The complementarities of technologies and property rights create two different sets of [[organizational equilibria]]. For instance, strong rights of the capital owners and a technology with a high intensity of specific and difficult to monitor capital are likely be institutional complements and define one possible organizational equilibrium. However, also strong workers' rights and a technology characterized by a high intensity of highly specific labor can be institutional complements and define an alternative organizational equilibrium. The organizational equilibria approach integrate the approach of [[Oliver Williamson]],&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;Williamson O E (1985) The economic institutions of capitalism. The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which have pointed out the influence of technology on rights and safeguards, and the views of the Radical Economists,&lt;ref name="Braverman"&gt;Braverman H (1974) Labor and monopoly capital: The degradation of work in the twentieth century. Monthly Review Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt; who have stressed the opposite direction of causation. The complementarities existing in the different organizational equilibria integrate both directions of causation in a single analytical framework. A similar approach has been used to explain organizational diversity in knowledge-intensive industries, such as software.&lt;ref name="Landini12"&gt;Landini F (2012) Technology, property rights and organizational diversity in the software industry. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 23(2): 137-150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landini13"&gt;Landini F (2013) Institutional change and information production. Journal of Institutional Economics 9(3): 257-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional complementarities characterize also the relations between intellectual property and human capital investments. Firms owning much [[intellectual property]] enjoy a protection for their investments in [[human capital]], which in turn favor the acquisition of additional intellectual property. By contrast other firms may find themselves in a vicious circle where the lack of intellectual property inhibits the incentive to invest in human capital and low levels of human capital investments involve that little or no intellectual property is ever acquired.&lt;ref name="PaganoRossi"&gt;Pagano U, Rossi M. A. (2004) Incomplete contracts, intellectual property and institutional complementarities. European Journal of Law and Economics 18(1): 55–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less formal approaches to institutional complementarities have also been adopted. In their seminal contribution Peter A. Hall and [[David Soskice]]&lt;ref name="HallSoskice"&gt;Hall P A, Soskice D (2001) Varieties of capitalism: The institutional foundations of comparative advantage. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; develop a broad theoretical framework to study the institutional complementarities that characterize different [[Varieties of Capitalism]]. Having a specific focus on the institutions of the political economy the authors develop an actor-centered approach for understanding the institutional similarities and differences among the developed economies. The varieties of capitalism approach has inspired a large number of application to the political economy field. To give some examples, Robert Franzese&lt;ref name="Franzese"&gt;Franzese R J (2001) Institutional and sectoral interactions in monetary policy and wage/price-bargaining. In: Hall P A, Soskice D (eds.) Varieties of capitalism: The institutional foundations of comparative advantage.

Gingerich  &lt;ref name="HallGingerich"&gt;Hall P A, Gingerich D W (2009) Varieties of capitalism and institutional complementarities in the political economy: An empirical analysis.

Review of International Political Economy 7(4): 645-687.&lt;/ref&gt;  analyzes the implications of institutional complementarity for social systems of innovation and production.

In addition to institutional variety, the notion of institutional complementarity has also motivated studies on institutional change.&lt;ref name="HallThelen"&gt;Hall P A, Thelen K (2009) Institutional change in varieties of capitalism. Socio-Economic Review 7(1): 7-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;Boyer R (2005) Coherence, diversity, and the evolution of capitalisms: The institutional complementarity hypothesis. Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review 2(1): 43-80.&lt;/ref&gt; In these works institutional complementarity is often presented as a conservative factor, which increases the stability of the institutional equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Pagano11"&gt;Pagano U (2011) Interlocking complementarities and institutional change. Journal of Institutional Economics 7(3): 373–392.&lt;/ref&gt; In presence of institutional complementarity change requires the simultaneous variation of different institutional domains, which in turn demands high coordination among the actors involved. Sometime, institutions themselves can act as resources for new courses of action that (incrementally) favor change.&lt;ref name="DeegJackson"&gt;Deeg R, Jackson G (2007) Towards a more dynamic theory of capitalist variety. Socio-Economic Review 5(1): 149-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside contributions on the distinct models of capitalism, the concept institutional complementarity has found application also in other domain of analysis. [[Masahiko Aoki]],&lt;ref name="Aoki94"&gt;Aoki M (1994) The contingent governance of teams: Analysis of institutional complementarity. International Economic Review 35(3): 657-676.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, studies the role of institutional complementarity in contingent governance models of teams.

Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics 166(1): 120-140.&lt;/ref&gt; rely on an institutional complementarity approach to investigate differences in the business laws governing in various countries. Francesca Gagliardi &lt;ref name="Gagliardi09"&gt;Gagliardi F (2009) Financial development and the growth of cooperative firms. Small Business Economics 32(4): 439-464.&lt;/ref&gt; argue in favor of an institutional complementarity relationship between local banking institutions and [[cooperative]] firms in Italy. Andrea Bonaccorsi and Grid Thoma,&lt;ref name="BonaccorsiThuma"&gt;Bonaccorsi A, Thoma G (2007) Institutional complementarity and inventive performance in nano science and technology. Research Policy 36(6): 813-831.&lt;/ref&gt; finally, uses the idea of institutional complementarity to investigate inventive performance in [[nano science]] and technology.

The '''Italian colonists in Albania''' were [[Italians]] who, between the two world wars, moved to [[Albania]] to colonize the Balkan country for the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

==Background==

The presence of [[Italians in Albania]] started during the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Middle Ages]].

Albania had held strategic importance for [[Italy]] since the [[Renaissance]], when the [[Republic of Venice]] controlled some areas of the Albanian coast (called [[Albania Veneta]]). In addition, [[southern Italy]] contained Albanian-speaking communities ([[Arbëreshë people]]), who had taken refuge there from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion of Albania during the [[Skanderbeg]] era, and who were favorable to a possible union of Albania and Italy.

At the end of the 19th century, Italian naval strategists eyed the port of [[Vlorë]] (Valona in Italian) and the island of [[Sazan]] (Saseno) at the entrance to the Bay of Vlorë. The port would give Italy control of the entrance to the Adriatic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, B. J: ''Albania at War, 1939-1945'', page 5. Hurst, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Albania could provide Italy with a beachhead in the Balkans. Before [[World War I]] Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]] had been instrumental in the creation of an independent Albanian state. At the outbreak of war in 1915, Italy seized the chance to occupy the southern half of Albania, to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from capturing. That success did not last long, as post-war domestic problems, defeat in the [[Vlora War]], and pressure from [[United States|US]] President [[Woodrow Wilson]], forced Italy to pull out in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/albania/25.htm|title=Albania - Albania's Reemergence after World War I|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Italy retained the island of [[Saseno]], in front of Valona, that was annexed to the Province of [[Zadar|Zara]] in Italian [[Dalmatia]].
[[File:Shefqet Verlaci.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Albanian prime minister Shefqet Verlaci, who approved the settlement of Italian colonists in 1940]]

When [[Benito Mussolini]] took power in Italy, he turned with renewed interest to Albania. Italy began penetrating Albania's economy in 1925, when Albania agreed to allow it to exploit its mineral resources.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/albania/28.htm|title=Albania - Italian Penetration|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was followed by the First Treaty of Tirana in 1926 and the Second Treaty of Tirana in 1927, whereby Italy and Albania entered into a defensive alliance.&lt;ref name="LoC" /&gt; Italian loans subsidized the Albanian government and economy, and Italian military instructors trained the Albanian army. Italian colonial settlement was encouraged and the first 300 Italian colonists settled in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://merlino.unimo.it/web_dep/materiali_discussione/0339.pdf "La storia economica albanese 1912-1939 e lo stabilirsi dell‘ egemonia italiana", page 24: First Italian settlers in Albania (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122152257/http://merlino.unimo.it/web_dep/materiali_discussione/0339.pdf |date=2009-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this strong Italian influence, [[King Zog]] of Albania refused to give in completely to Italian pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, B. J: ''Albania at War, 1939-1945'', page 7. Hurst, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, he openly stood up to the Italians by refusing to renew the 1926 Treaty of Tirana.

Fascist Italy increased pressure on Albania in the 1930s, and on April 7, 1939 [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-395-41685-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Keegan, John |author2=Churchill, Winston |title=The Second World War (Six Volume Boxed Set) |edition= |language= |publisher=Mariner Books |location=Boston |year=1986 |origyear= |pages= 314|quote= |isbn=0-395-41685-X |oclc= |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e0_3Nrc8D0wC&amp;pg=PA314 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; five months before the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The Albanian armed resistance proved ineffective and, after a short defense, Italy occupied the country. On 9 April 1939 Albanian [[Zog of Albania|King Zog]] fled to [[Greece]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-8240-7029-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zabecki, David T. |title=World War II in Europe: an encyclopedia |edition= |language= |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1999 |origyear= |pages=1353 |quote= |isbn=0-8240-7029-1 |oclc= |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gYDN-UfehEEC&amp;pg=PA1353 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Albania ceased to exist as an independent country. The Balkan country became a component of the [[Italian Empire]] and was turned into an Italian puppet state. Albania was designed for eventual colonization and [[Italianization]].

The throne was claimed by King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] of [[King of Italy|Italy]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-8240-7029-1" /&gt; who was the official ruler of Albania until his abdication on 25 July 1943. The country was led by Italian governors and an Albanian civil government.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8240-7029-1" /&gt;

From April 1939, Albanian foreign affairs, customs, as well as natural resources came under direct control of Italy. All [[petroleum]] resources in Albania went through [[Agip]], Italy's state petroleum company.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3knunC7z_oC&amp;pg=PA433 |title=Albania in the Twentieth Century, A History|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The puppet [[Albanian Fascist Party]] became the ruling party of the country and the local [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]], like prime minister [[Shefqet Verlaci]], allowed Italian citizens to settle in Albania and to own land so that they could gradually transform it into Italian soil. Verlaci (who had distant Italian roots) approved the possible administrative union of Albania and Italy, because he wanted Italian support for the union of [[Kosovo]], Southern Epirus ([[Chameria]]), and other [[Albanian irredentism|Albanian irredentist]] areas with the state of Albania, creating a [[Greater Albania]]. Indeed, this unification was partially realised after the [[Axis powers|Axis]] defeat of [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]] in spring 1941 and the expansion of Albania into Macedonia, Kosovo, Novi Pazaar and Montenegro.

Italian citizens began to settle in Albania as [[colonists]] and to own land so that they could gradually transform it into Italian soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Raphael | last1=Lemkin | first2=Samantha | last2=Power | year= 2008 | title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe | publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. | isbn = 978-1-58477-901-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0in2wOY-W0C | pages=99–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian colonists and the Italian "assimilation" were more or less welcomed in spring 1939, and were greeted by most Albanians when Albania was enlarged two years later. But in November 1941 they started to face contrary manifestations and the resistance of some Albanians, organized mainly by the Communist Party of [[Enver Hoxha]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosselli, Alberto. ''Storie Segrete. Operazioni sconosciute o dimenticate della seconda guerra mondiale''. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Italian colonists==

The process of colonization began in 1926 with 300 colonists.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sjöberg|first=Örjan|title=Rural Change and Development in Albania|year=1991|publisher=Westview Press|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first Italians to colonise Albania were fishing families from [[Apulia]], who moved to the island of [[Sazan]] opposite [[Vlora]] in 1918. The island was officially part of Italy from the end of [[World War I]] to 1947.

In 1926, the Italian government, in agreement with Albanian authorities, sent 300 Italian colonists to Kamez, near [[Tirana]], to promote agricultural development.&lt;ref&gt;http://google.com/search?q=cache:x9tD5qB0w4QJ:https://mail.sssup.it/~thoma/papers/caselli_thoma_2003.pdf+coloni+italiani+in+albania&amp;hl=it&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=68&amp;gl=it Italian hegemony in Albania&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Italians were farmers from [[Arberesh]] communities in southern Italy. They were initially successful, and created the company ''Ente industria agraria albanese'' with an agricultural school, but the regime of [[King Zog]] expelled them in 1931, fearing excessive Italian influence in Albanian society and politics.

After the occupation of Albania in April 1939, Mussolini sent nearly 11,000 Italian colonists to Albania. Most of them were from the [[Veneto]] region and [[Sicily]]. They settled primarily in the areas of [[Durrës|Durazzo]], [[Vlorë|Valona]], [[Shkodër|Scutari]], Porto Palermo, [[Elbasani]] and Santi Quaranta. They were the first settlers of a huge group of Italians to be moved to Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Richard. ''Mussolini as Diplomat'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these colonists, 22,000 Italian casual laborers went to Albania in April 1940 to construct roads, railways and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Most of the 1939 colonists were men enrolled in the so-called [[Albanian Militia]]. This organization was an Albanian [[fascism|fascist]] [[paramilitary]] group, part of the [[Blackshirts]]. Later even Albanians were recruited in the group. It was headquartered in Tirana and consisted of four legions in Tirana, [[Korçë]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Shkodër]]. The Albanian Militia was disbanded in 1943 following the fall of Italy in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Rosselli, Alberto. ''Storie Segrete. Operazioni sconosciute o dimenticate della seconda guerra mondiale'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

No Italian colonists remain in Albania. The few who remained under the communist regime of Enver Hoxha escaped (with their descendants) to Italy in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/03/19/sono-tornate-casa-le-italiane-albania.html|title=SONO TORNATE A CASA LE ITALIANE D' ALBANIA|work=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actually are represented by the association "ANCIFRA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancifra.wordpress.com/chi-sono/|title=Chi siamo?|work=A N C I F R A|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small community of '''Japanese people in Egypt''', mainly of expatriates from [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20110215113306/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110212003821.htm Hopes rise for peace in Egypt]." () ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]''. February 13, 2011. Retrieved on January 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's Ministry of Foreign affairs]], there are about 1,051 Japanese residents in [[Egypt]] as of 2009.

==Overview==
Japanese Rail engineers and experts, who were dispatched by [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]], have been coming to [[Cairo]] to provide technical guidance on inspection and repair work at [[Cairo Metro]] and Japanese firms "[[Kinki Sharyo]] Co." and the "[[Toshiba Corporation]]" have been contracted to produce the majority of the rolling stock for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr09/pe30_peo.html|title=Japanese Rail Engineers in Cairo|website=www.jrtr.net|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtreview.com/trade-finance/global-trade-review-news/2010/October/Japanese-group-to-build-Cairo-metro_8550.shtml : GTR Trade financial news - Japanese group to build Cairo metro]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a team of Japanese archaeologists working in Egypt for over 40 years. One of their major projects was radar scanning inside and outside the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and they have also conducted important work at [[Dashur]] and [[Abusir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drhawass.com/blog/celebrating-forty-years-japanese-excavations-egypt : Celebrating Forty Years of Japanese Excavations in Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]], many Japanese nationals in Egypt left the country. About 470 Japanese nationals fled the growing unrest in Cairo on three Japanese government-charted airplanes arranged by the Japanese Foreign Ministry's emergency task force in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/about-470-japanese-flee-cairo-unrest-on-chartered-planes : Japan Today - About 470 Japanese flee Cairo unrest on chartered planes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-01/31/c_13715130.htm : Japan to employ chartered planes to rescue Japanese stranded in Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government is also scrambling to check the safety of all Japanese nationals living in Egypt in the wake of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]’s resignation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/govt-scrambles-to-check-safety-of-japanese-in-egypt : Japan Today - Gov't scrambles to check safety of Japanese in Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Lee Hooker''' (August 22, 1912&lt;ref name="bare"/&gt;&lt;!-- Do not change his year of birth unless agreed by discussion on the article talk page --&gt; or 1917&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;&lt;ref name=jlh&gt;[http://www.johnleehooker.com/history/biography  Biography, ''JohnLeeHooker.com'']; retrieved August 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; – June 21, 2001) was an American [[blues]] singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of [[Delta blues]]. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including [[talking blues]] and early North Mississippi [[Hill country blues]]. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived [[boogie-woogie]].

Some of his best known songs include "[[Boogie Chillen']]" (1948), "[[Crawling King Snake]]" (1949), "[[Dimples (song)|Dimples]]" (1956), "[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]" (1962), and "[[One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer]]" (1966). Several of his later albums, including ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]'' (1989), ''[[Mr. Lucky (John Lee Hooker album)|Mr. Lucky]]'' (1991), ''Chill Out'' (1995), and ''[[Don't Look Back (John Lee Hooker album)|Don't Look Back]]'' (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and U.K. ''The Healer'' (for the song "I'm In The Mood") and ''Chill Out'' (for the album) both earned him Grammy wins &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/32nd-annual-grammy-awards|title=32nd Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=January 15, 2013|website=Grammy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/38th-annual-grammy-awards|title=38th Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=January 15, 2013|website=Grammy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Don't Look Back'', which went on to earn him a double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van Morrison).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/40th-annual-grammy-awards|title=40th Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=January 15, 2013|website=Grammy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hooker's date of birth is a subject of debate; the years 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have been suggested.  Most sources give 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920.  Information in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was born in 1912.&lt;ref name="bare"/&gt;  In 2017, a series of events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McCollum, [http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/05/01/john-lee-hooker-100th-centennial-tribute-grammy/101027412 "John Lee Hooker to get year-long 100th birthday tribute"], ''Detroit Free Press'', May 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that he was born in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]], in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in Coahoma County.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt; He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923),&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Boogie Man'', p. 24, "In 1928, Will Hooker Sr. and Jr. made a profit of twenty-eight dollars" from farming, making his death in 1923 impossible.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sharecropper]] and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census, Series T625, Roll 895, p. 235, in the city of Tutwiler, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, Supervisor's District 2, Enumeration District 87, Sheet 29 A, Lines 18–19, enumerated February 3, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a "decade or so younger" than her husband (''Boogie Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;23), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.

The Hooker children were [[Homeschooling|home-schooled]]. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the [[spirituals]] sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Paul. ''Conversation with the Blues''. p. 188. See also Bennett, Joe; Curwen, Trevor; Douse, Cliff. ''Guitar Facts''. p. 76.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the [[Delta blues]] of the time.&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|year=1982|title=Deep Blues|publisher=Penguin Books|location=|pages=242–43|isbn=0-14-006223-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence was [[Tony Hollins]], who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of "[[Crawlin' King Snake]]" and "[[Robert Petway#Catfish Blues|Catfish Blues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Charles Shaar (2011). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3I7PUE2lKS8C&amp;pg=PP109&amp;lpg=PP109&amp;dq=%22Tony+Hollins%22+blues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ej4vzrwNku&amp;sig=RLqMw20iRJUsfZREm0ot8zUpujI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih9uj6x-nPAhVGApoKHXyICBY4ChDoAQg4MAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tony%20Hollins%22%20&amp;f=false ''Boogie Man: The Adventures of John Lee Hooker in the American Twentieth Century''], Canongate Books.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again.&lt;ref&gt;''Boogie Man'' p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1930s, he lived in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he performed on [[Beale Street]], at [[the New Daisy Theatre]] and occasionally at house parties.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt;

He worked in factories in various cities during [[World War II]], eventually getting a job with the [[Ford Motor Company]] in [[Detroit]] in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Hastings Street]], the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.&lt;ref name="oliver"&gt;{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Wogan|year=1984|title=Shoes Off the Record|edition=|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|pages=116–18|isbn=0-306-80321-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier career==
Hooker's recording career began in 1948, when [[Modern Records]], based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit. The single, "[[Boogie Chillen']]", became a hit and the best-selling [[race record]] of 1949.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt; Despite being illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting [[traditional blues verses|traditional blues lyrics]], he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for [[Chess Records]] and [[Chance Records]] in 1951–1952), Johnny Lee (for [[De Luxe Records]] in 1953–1954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker,&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes. ''Alternative Boogie: Early Studio Recordings, 1948–1952''.&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie Man.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbitter, M.; Slaven, N. (1987). ''Blues Records 1943–1970: A Selective Discography''. London: Record Information Services. pp. 579–95.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, but instead he changed tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.&lt;ref&gt;''Boogie Man'', pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of this period he recorded and toured with [[Eddie Kirkland]]. In Hooker's later sessions for [[Vee-Jay Records]] in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including [[Eddie Taylor]], who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. "[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]" and "[[Dimples (song)|Dimples]]", two popular songs by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.

==Later career and death==

Beginning in 1962, Hooker gained greater exposure when he toured Europe in the annual [[American Folk Blues Festival]].&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;  His "Dimples" became a successful single on the [[UK Singles Charts]] in 1964, eight years after its first US release.&lt;ref name="OCC"/&gt; Hooker began to perform and record with [[Rock music|rock]] musicians.  One of his earliest collaborations was with British [[blues rock]] band [[the Groundhogs]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Khokhar Khanzada''' are a [[Muslim Rajput]] community found mainly in the [[Fatehpur district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They have no connection with the [[Ranghar]] [[Khokhar]] of [[Moradabad district]] in western [[Uttar Pradesh]], another community of [[Muslim]] [[Khokhar]]s settled in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The [[Khokhar]] are a well known tribe, found mainly in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] region of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].  They claim to be [[Rajput]] The Khokhar Khanzada are a sub-community within the larger [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Fatehpur District : A Gazetteer Volume XX, District Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Khokhar Pathan claim descent from Malik Babur, who said to have come from [[Kapurthala|kabool]] &amp; Iran He was sent to [[Fatehpur district|Fatehpur]] by the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] authorities in [[Delhi]] to suppress the [[Bhar]]s, a tribe that controlled most of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The [[Malik]] successfully defeated the [[Bhar]]s, and the grateful [[Alauddin Khalji]], the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]] granted several villages as a  [[jagir]] (estate) in [[Fatehpur district]], the main one being [[Kot, Fatehpur|Kot, shivpuri, manmai]]. In addition to the settlement at [[Kot, Fatehpur|Kot]], they are also found in the villages of Arhaiya, Urha, Shahnagar, Rahmatpur, Shivpuri, Kulli, Ghazipur and Parvezpur. Other than the [[jagirdar]] families, the majority of the [[Fatehpur district|Fatehpur]] Khokhar are small to medium-sized farmers. With the abolishment of [[zamindar]]i system of feudal ownership by the Indian government in 1949, this has had a strong impact on the large landowning families, as much of their land has been redistributed. A further change has been that many Khokhar Khanzada have also emigrated to [[Pakistan]], and are now found mainly in [[Karachi]].

==Customs and Traditions==
They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s,  and have customs similar to other [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] communities in the region. The community is largely endogamous, although there are cases of intermarriage with the [[Gautam Khanzada]], a neighbouring [[Muslim Rajput]] population. But most marriages are with a close kin, with the community practicing both parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages. The community speak [[Urdu]], as well as the [[Awadhi]] dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Fatehpur District : A Gazetteer Volume XX, District Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khokhar Ranghar==
The town of [[Sambhal]] in [[Moradabad District]] is also home to several families of [[Khokhar]]s, who have said to have emigrated from [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]] in what is now [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Pakistani Punjab]] during the reign of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Babur|Babar]]. As most [[Rajput]] converts to [[Islam]] were in common parlance referred to as [[Ranghar]], these [[Khokhar]]s were also referred to as the Khokhar. The Emperor Babar himself is said to have granted the Khokhars [[jagir]] for the town of the [[Sambhal]]. They played a particularly important role in [[Rohilkhand]] politics during the period of [[Rohilla]] rule. The Khokhar were the effective rulers of the town of [[Sambhal]] and the adjoining countryside until the establishment of [[United Kingdom|British]] rule after the [[Rohilla War]] of 1774. Although the Khokhars lost independent power, they remained one of the larger landowners in the district till 1949, when the newly independent [[India]] carried out substantive land reform, and broke up the large estates. The Khokhars remain a substantial element in the population of [[Sambhal]].&lt;ref&gt;Moradabad District United Provinces District Gazetteers edited by H Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many law collectives in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="The people's lawyers"&gt;Wabun Wind, ''The people's lawyers'' (New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston (1973 1st ed.) ({{ISBN|0030010411}})&lt;/ref&gt; These collectives ran as worker-run, [[cooperative]] law firms.&lt;ref name="The people's lawyers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HW48AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22bar+sinister%22|title=Editorial Comment Log|date=4 June 1971|publisher=State Bar of California|accessdate=4 June 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often had [[revolutionary]] politics, and supported explicitly revolutionary groups and individuals.&lt;ref name="The people's lawyers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CzarnBhJiZUC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22bar+sinister%22|title=Black, Brown, Yellow, and Left: Radical Activism in Los Angeles|first=Laura|last=Pulido|date=4 June 2018|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|accessdate=4 June 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawyer and non-lawyer employees were paid the same wages, and had equal decision-making power.&lt;ref name="The people's lawyers"/&gt;  At some law collectives, workers supporting families were paid more.  A handful of law collectives organized along those lines still exist - for example, the [[People's Law Office]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and the Portland Law Collective in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="The people's lawyers"/&gt;

Such law collectives' activities may have been covertly disrupted by government officials in order to diminish their effectiveness. For example, the Bar Sinister law collective in Los Angeles was allegedly [[black bag job|burgled]] by the [[FBI]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlginternational.org/2015/10/a-short-history-of-the-nlgs-cuba-solidarity-work/|title=A Short History of the NLG’s Cuba Solidarity Work|date=12 October 2015|website=Nlginternational.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JGj0eiWGGFIC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;vq=goodwin&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=bar+sinister&amp;f=false|title=FBI Secrets|first=M.

Since the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|1999 Seattle WTO protests]], there has been a small movement of activist law collectives.  These groups are usually non-lawyer centered, run along [[anarchist]] principles (even if they do not explicitly identify as anarchist), and work as part of the movement for social justice. These law collectives are made up mostly or entirely of non-lawyers.  They are located in cities including [[Philadelphia]]; [[Washington, DC]]; [[New York, NY|New York]]; [[Madison, WI|Madison]]; [[Portland, OR|Portland]]; [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]; and [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], and [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] in Canada.  Also, since June 2009, the Minnesota Law Collective has been open in St. Paul, Minnesota.

This new generation of law collective works to assist people in providing their own legal support. They give "trainer trainings" so people can give "Know Your Rights" and other workshops to their communities; teach people to provide legal support for their affinity groups or for specific protests; and to explain the law in general and law collective work in particular.

Law collectives have been central in the defense of activists from criminal prosecution in such protests including the Seattle WTO protests in November 1999; the "A16" [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] protests in 2000; the Republican and Democratic convention protests, also in 2000; the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA) protests in 2001 and 2004; protests by the [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]]; in protests around the US against the [[war in Iraq]] in 2003; in New York, Oakland, and Chicago during the [[Occupy movement]] in 2011; and in after unarmed black men were killed by police officers in [[Ferguson, MO|Ferguson]] and [[Baltimore, MD|Baltimore]] in 2014 and 2015.

A [[national library]] is established by the [[government]] of a nation to serve as the pre-eminent repository of information for that country. Unlike [[public library|public libraries]], they rarely allow citizens to borrow books. Often, they include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works; such as the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. National libraries are usually notable for their size, compared to that of other libraries in the same country. Some national libraries may be thematic or specialized in some specific domains, beside or in replacement of the 'main' national library.

Some national entities which are not independent but who wish to preserve their particular culture, have established a national library with all the attributes of such institutions, such as [[legal deposit]].

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards and carry out projects helping them to fulfil their duties. National libraries of Europe participate in [[The European Library]]. This is a service of The Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

The list below is organized alphabetically by country, according to the [[list of sovereign states]], including, at its end an 'other states' section for non-sovereign states. A "♦" indicates a national library of a constituent country or dependent state. It is listed under the sovereign state which governs that entity. Sovereign states are listed even when they have no national library or when the existence and name of a national library could not yet be ascertained. Other states, constituent countries and dependent states are listed only if they have a national library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3431">'''Marakkala''' is the modern colloquial term for Muslims, although '''Marakkalage''' is another uniquely [[Karava]] ancestral name and is also used by several traditional [[Karava]] families of [[Sri Lanka]] todate. Variant forms are : ''Maha Marakkalage, Arasa Marakkalage, [[Andra Pradesh|Andra]] Marakkalage, Antinna Marakkalage, Kodi Marakkalage, Loku Marakkalage, Manna Marakkalage, Sandra Marakkalage'' and Marakkala Malimige

The name Marakkalage derives from the type of craft [[Marakkar]] (Marakkalam in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means Wooden Ship) used in trade and warfare by the rulers of the [[Coromandel coast|Kuru Mandala coast]] (the region of the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kurus]]) and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="king1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xc8oW6pedrwC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq='karaiyars'+Portuguese+encounters+with+Sri+Lanka+and+the+Maldives,+By+Chandra+Richard+De+Silva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5lasSo4lgk&amp;sig=Q5Eczidt5Q4ZOZBnjZWyWhrRtBg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G0KJUMS-G-rV0QWQg4CgBA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=badagas%20karaiyars&amp;f=false ''Nayake of Tanjore sends an army of Vadugas with the king of the Karaiyars''] Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands, By Chandra Richard De Silva, p.111 &amp; 137&lt;/ref&gt; This may be an allusion to the Muslim [[Arabic]] traders who were the prominent shipmen of pre and early Colonial Sri Lanka. They were also used in their naval battles against the Portuguese, Dutch, British and other Europeans in the 16th, 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref name="king1"/&gt;  The ancestors of the families bearing these names may have been Muslim traders, or the owners or commanders of such vessals.

Gallappathige and Manavige (Maha Navi), Malimage (deriving from Malimar/Malimam) meaning ship's captain was also bestowed as an honor.

The Karavas claim to be the traditional martial and naval community of Sri Lanka and the preservation of that naval tradition in such mediaeval names is of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defonseka.com/k16.htm The ancient 'Kaurava Pavilion' at Anuradhapura] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220250/http://www.defonseka.com/k16.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}. defonseka.com.

===Winning Answer===
{{cquote|I truly believe in the 5 R's, which is re-think, reduce, re-use, recycle and respect. Because I believe that as human beings, if we apply that to our everyday lives, we can make a change and we will reduce the problem that we have just mentioned. If we apply that to our everyday lives, I believe that we as humans can save the place we live in, which is our Mother Earth.|||Katherine Espín on the question: The [[Paris Agreement on Climate Change]] is a historic international deal that seeks to limit [[Global Warming]] to below 1.5°C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1599">A '''money services business''' ('''MSB''') is a legal term used by [[financial regulators]] to describe businesses that transmit or convert [[money]].  The definition was created to encompass more than just [[bank]]s which normally provide these services to include [[non-bank financial institution]]s.

An MSB has specific meanings in different [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictions]], but generally includes any business that [[money transmitter|transmits money]] or representatives of money, provides [[Currency conversion|foreign currency exchange]] such as [[Bureaux de change]], or cashes [[cheques]] or other money related instruments.  It is often used in the context of [[Anti Money Laundering]] (AML) legislation and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/mlr/getstarted/register/msb.htm#1 |title=Money Service Businesses and Money Laundering Regulations |publisher=[[HM Revenue and Customs]] |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincen.gov/financial_institutions/msb/msb.registration.html |title=Money Services Business (MSB) Registration |publisher=[[Fincen]] |date= |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/anti-money-laundering/money-services-business/|title=What Is A Money Services Business?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5118">Several [[braille]] alphabets are used in Nigeria. For English, [[Unified English Braille]] has been adopted. Three other languages have been written in braille: [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. All three alphabets are based on English readings, with the addition of letters particular to these languages.  Punctuation is as in English Braille.

The letters of these languages beyond the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]] are as follows:

== Hausa Braille ==

{{Infobox writing system
| name = Hausa Braille
| altname = 
| type = alphabet
| typedesc = 
| time = 
| languages = [[Hausa language|Hausa]]
| fam1 = [[Braille]]
| fam2 = [[English Braille]]
| print = [[Hausa alphabet]]
| creator = 
| sample = 
| imagesize = 
| note = none
}}
Hausa includes

{| class="wikitable" style="line-height: 1.2"
|-align=center
|{{bc|type=image|⠟}} &lt;br&gt;kw
|{{bc|type=image|⠩}} &lt;br&gt;sh
|{{bc|type=image|⠌}} &lt;br&gt;ts
|{{bc|type=image|1246}} &lt;br&gt;ɗ
|}

from English ''q, sh, st, ed'' (international second ''d''), and three derived letters:

{| class="wikitable" style="line-height: 1.2"
|-align=center
!Basic letter:
|{{bc|type=image|⠃}} &lt;br&gt;b
|{{bc|type=image|⠅}} &lt;br&gt;k
|{{bc|type=image|⠽}} &lt;br&gt;y

|{{bc|type=image|⠨}} &lt;br&gt;ƙ
|{{bc|type=image|⠯}} &lt;br&gt;ƴ
|}

Hausa is presumably written in braille in Niger as well, since ''Ethnologue'' 17 reports that [[Zarma language|Zarma]] is written in braille in that country.  However, this need not mean it uses the same alphabet as Nigerian Hausa.

== Igbo Braille ==

{{Infobox writing system

| fam1 = [[Braille]]

| print = [[Igbo alphabet]]
| creator = 
| sample = 
| imagesize = 
| note = none
}}
Igbo Braille has

{| class="wikitable" style="line-height: 1.2"
|-align=center
|{{bc|type=image|⠟}} &lt;br&gt;kw
|{{bc|type=image|16}} &lt;br&gt;ch
|{{bc|type=image|⠣}} &lt;br&gt;gh
|{{bc|type=image|⠩}} &lt;br&gt;sh
|}

from English ''q, ch, gh, sh,'' and six other letters with common [[international braille|international/African]] values:

{| class="wikitable" style="line-height: 1.2"
|- align=center
!Basic letter:
|{{bc|type=image|⠃}} &lt;br&gt;b
|{{bc|type=image|⠑}} &lt;br&gt;e
|{{bc|type=image|⠊}} &lt;br&gt;i
|{{bc|type=image|⠕}} &lt;br&gt;o
|{{bc|type=image|⠥}} &lt;br&gt;u

|{{bc|type=image|⠢}} &lt;br&gt;ẹ
|{{bc|type=image|⠔}} &lt;br&gt;ị
|{{bc|type=image|⠪}} &lt;br&gt;ọ
|{{bc|type=image|⠞}} &lt;br&gt;ụ
|{{bc|type=image|346}} &lt;br&gt;ŋ
|}

(See [[Ewe Braille]] and [[Kabiye Braille]] for similar code assignments.)

== Yoruba Braille ==
{{Infobox writing system
| name = Yoruba Braille
| altname = 
| type = alphabet
| typedesc = 
| time = 
| languages = [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]
| fam1 = [[Braille]]
| fam2 = [[English Braille]]
| print = [[Yoruba alphabet]]
| creator = 
| sample = 
| imagesize = 
| note = none
}}
Yoruba Braille also has

{| class="wikitable" style="line-height: 1.2"
|-align=center
|{{bc|type=image|⠟}} &lt;br&gt;kw
|{{bc|type=image|⠩}} &lt;br&gt;ṣ
|}

(from English ''q, sh''), and three derived letters:

{| class="wikitable" style="line-height: 1.2"
|- align=center
!Basic letter:
|{{bc|type=image|⠃}} &lt;br&gt;b
|{{bc|type=image|⠑}} &lt;br&gt;e
|{{bc|type=image|⠕}} &lt;br&gt;o
|- align=center
!Derived letter:
|{{bc|type=image|⠆}} &lt;br&gt;gb
|{{bc|type=image|⠢}} &lt;br&gt;ẹ
|{{bc|type=image|⠪}} &lt;br&gt;ọ
|}

The vowel assignments follow [[world braille|international conventions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1085">The '''Ontario Telephone Service Commission''' (OTSC) was a quasi-judicial [[regulatory]] agency which regulated independent [[telephone companies]] (that is, those other than Bell Canada) in [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It reported to the provincial legislature through the minister of transportation and communications.

It served as the regulator for the independent companies until April 26, 1994, when a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the case Téléphone Guevremont Inc. v. Quebec (Régie des télécommunications), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 878
transferred Canada's provincially regulated telephone companies to federal jurisdiction, meaning that they would be regulated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48338">The '''theory of positive disintegration''' ('''TPD''') by [[Kazimierz Dąbrowski]] is a theory of [[personality development]]. Unlike mainstream [[psychology]], Dąbrowski's theoretical framework views psychological tension and [[anxiety]] as necessary for growth.  These "disintegrative" processes are therefore seen as "positive", whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain for their entire lives in a state of "primary integration", lacking true individuality. Advancing into disintegration and into the higher levels of development is predicated on having developmental potential, including overexcitabilities, above-average reactions to stimuli.

Unlike some other theories of development such as [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels.  TPD is not a theory of stages, and levels do not correlate with age.

==Dąbrowski's theory==
Kazimierz Dąbrowski (1902–1980), a [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychologist]], developed the Theory of Positive Disintegration which culminated in his 1964 publication of the book by the same name, "Positive Disintegration". He was heavily influenced by his [[Catholic]] upbringing which taught personal sacrifice and perpetual torment. His experience as a victim of [[medical torture]] for several months as a member of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], being only one of the 36 surviving psychiatrists in Poland out of the 400 practicing at the beginning of the war, informed his world view. He pursued a lifelong obsession with self-mutilation resulting in his semi-autobiographical 1937 work, "Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation." He believed that the key to the treatment of mental illness was intense personal suffering and hence marked the self-infliction of suffering as essential to personal development. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=C4sf_XDicrUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration |year = 2008| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26692/Dissertation.pdf?sequence=2 |title=A Hermeneutic Historical Study of Kazimierz Dabrowski and his Theory of Positive Disintegration| year=2002|author=Battaglia, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dąbrowski's theory of personality development emphasised several major features including:

* personality is not a given universal trait, it must be created&amp;mdash;shaped&amp;mdash;by the individual to reflect his or her own unique character (personality shaping)
* personality develops as a result of the action of developmental potential (DP) (overexcitability and the autonomous factor), not everyone displays sufficient DP to create a unique personality.
* developmental potential is represented in the population by a [[normal distribution|normal]] (bell) curve.  Dąbrowski used a multilevel approach to describe the continuum of developmental levels seen in the population.
* developmental potential creates crises characterized by strong anxieties and depressions&amp;mdash;psychoneurosis&amp;mdash;that precipitate disintegration
* for personality to develop, initial integrations based on instinct and socialization must disintegrate&amp;mdash;a process Dąbrowski called positive disintegration
* the development of a hierarchy of individual values&amp;mdash;[[emotional]] reactions&amp;mdash;is a critical component in developing one's personality and one's autonomy, thus, in contrast to most psychological theories, emotions play a major role in this approach
* emotional reactions guide the individual in creating his or her individual personality ideal, an autonomous standard that acts as the goal of individual development
* the individual must examine his or her essence and subsequently make existential choices that emphasize those aspects of essence that are higher and "more myself" and inhibit those aspects that are lower or "less myself" based upon his or her own personality ideal
* critical components of individual development include autoeducation and autopsychotherapy

===Factors in development===
Dąbrowski observed that most people live their lives in a state of "primary or primitive integration" largely guided by biological impulses ("first factor") and/or by uncritical endorsement and adherence to social convention ("second factor"). He called this initial integration Level I. Dąbrowski observed that at this level there is no true individual expression of the autonomous human self. Individual expression at Level I is influenced and constrained by the first two factors.

The first factor channels energy and talents toward accomplishing self-serving goals that reflect the lower instincts and biological ego—its primary focus is on survival and self-advancement. Often talents are used in antisocial or asocial ways. For example, at the lowest edge of Level I many criminals display this type of selfish behavior.  They advance their own goals at the expense of others.

The second factor, the social environment (milieu) and [[peer pressure]], constrains individual expression and [[creativity]] by encouraging a group view of life and discouraging unique thought and expression. The second factor externalizes values and morals, thereby externalizing conscience. Social forces shape expectations.  Behavior and one's talents and creativity are funneled into forms that follow and support the existing social milieu. "My mom says we should always be aware of what our lawn looks like because we want other people to think well of us when they drive by." Because conscience is derived from an external social context, so long as society holds ethical standards, people influenced by the second factor will behave ethically.  However, if a society becomes corrupt, people strongly influenced by second factor will not dissent. [[Socialization]] without individual examination leads to a rote and robotic existence (the "robopath" described by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]). Individual reactions are not unique, they are based upon social contexts ("I cry at funerals and laugh at weddings—everyone does"). According to Dąbrowski, people primarily motivated by second factor represent a significant majority of the general population.

Dąbrowski felt that our society was largely influenced by these lower two factors and could be characterized as operating at Level I. For example, our emphasis on corporate success ("a dog eat dog mentality") means that many [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]]s operate on the basis of first factor—they will quickly sacrifice another to enhance their own advancement. As well, our educational, political, corporate, and media systems are self-promoting and discourage real examination or individual autonomy—the second factor. Alternatively, social justifications are often used: "of course I break the speed limit, everyone does."  Or a soldier may explain that he or she was simply "following orders". Thus, this external value system absolves the individual of any individual responsibility.

Dąbrowski also described a group of people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. These people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which Dąbrowski called negative adjustment) and move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. Dąbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our [[status quo]] and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for Dąbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be—how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her "new" autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.

===Development potential===
Advanced development is often seen in people who exhibit strong developmental potential ("DP"). Developmental potential represents a constellation of genetic features, expressed and mediated through environmental interaction.  Many factors are incorporated in developmental potential but three major aspects are highlighted: overexcitability (OE), specific abilities and talents, and a strong drive toward autonomous growth, a feature Dąbrowski called the "third factor".

====Overexcitability====

The most evident aspect of developmental potential is [[overexcitability]] (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. Dąbrowski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual, and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause a person to experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. Dąbrowski studied human exemplars and found that heightened overexcitability was a key part of their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value "rudder", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1972|p=6}}

Although based in the nervous system, overexcitabilities come to be expressed psychologically through the development of structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1972|p=294}} With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy.

====Abilities and talents====

The second arm of developmental potential, specific abilities and talents, tends to serve the person's developmental level. As outlined, people at lower levels use talents to support egocentric goals or to climb the social and corporate ladders. At higher levels, specific talents and abilities become an important force as they are channeled by the person's value hierarchy into expressing and achieving the person's vision of his or her ideal personality and his or her view of how the world ought to be.

====The third factor====

The third aspect of developmental potential (DP), which is simply referred to as 'the third factor', is a drive toward individual growth and autonomy. The third factor is critical as it applies one's talents and creativity toward autonomous expression, and second, it provides motivation to strive for more and to try to imagine and achieve goals currently beyond one's grasp. Dąbrowski was clear to differentiate third factor from [[free will]]. He felt that free will did not go far enough in capturing the motivating aspects that he attributed to third factor.  For example, an individual can exercise free will and show little motivation to grow or change as an individual. Third factor specifically describes a motivation—a motivation to become one's self. This motivation is often so strong that  in some situations we can observe that one needs to develop oneself and that in so doing, it places one at great peril.  This feeling of "I've gotta be me"  especially when it is "at any cost" and especially when it is expressed as a strong motivator for self-growth is beyond the usual conceptualization ascribed to free will.

A person whose DP is high enough ''will generally'' undergo disintegration, despite any external social or family efforts to prevent it. A person whose DP is low will ''generally not'' undergo disintegration (or positive personality growth) even in a conducive environment.

The notion that some people have an innate potential for development that is determined by a higher sensitivity or overexcitability (analogous to the first aspect of DP) and by a related tendency to develop individual differences and autonomy from the group (analogous to the third aspect of DP) was independently developed by Elaine Aron (see [[Highly sensitive person]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aron |first=E. N. |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.9371&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |title=The Clinical Implications of Jungs Concept of Sensitiveness |journal=Journal of Jungian Theory and Practice |volume=8 |year=2006 |issue= |pages=11–43 |quote=Sensitive persons can certainly have mood disorders, but should not be mistaken for being chronically depressed only because of a pessimistic view of the future of the world or of their own abilities (a pessimism which may well be accurate, as in the case of depressive realism). Likewise they do not have an anxiety disorder merely because they worry more than the nonsensitive, and they do not have a personality disorder (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, etc.) merely because their unusualness has been present throughout their lives as an impediment to the cheerful, resilient functioning expected of most people most of the time.... They cannot shut out the world's achingly subtle, fleeting beauty or its inexplicable cruelty and suffering. They must find their own meaning in it. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117225340/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.9371&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |archivedate=2016-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although it should be noted that Aron's approach is substantially different from Dąbrowski's).

====Developmental obstacles====
Dąbrowski called OE "a tragic gift" to reflect that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. Potentials to experience great highs are also potentials to experience great lows. Similarly, potentials to express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing a great deal of personal conflict and [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. [[Suicide]] is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of [[self-harm]].

Dąbrowski advocated [[#Autopsychotherapy|autopsychotherapy]], educating the person about OEs and the disintegrative process to give him or her a context within which to understand intense feelings and needs. Dąbrowski suggested giving people support in their efforts to develop and find their own [[self-expression]]. Children and adults with high DP have to find and walk their own path, often at the expense of fitting in with their social peers and even with their families.  At the core of autopsychotherapy is the awareness that no one can show anyone else the "right" path.  Everyone has to find their own path for themselves.  As Joseph Campbell described the knights on the [[Grail Quest]]: If a path exists in the forest, don't follow it, for though it took someone else to the Grail, it will not take you there, because it is not your path.

==The levels==
The first and fifth levels are characterized by psychological integration, harmony, and little inner conflict. There is little internal conflict at Level I because just about every behavior is justified—it is either good for the individual and is therefore "right", or the individual's society endorses it and it is therefore "right".  In either case, with a high level of confidence the individual acts as he or she perceives anyone else would, and does what anyone is "supposed to do". At Level V there is no internal conflict because what a person does is always in accord with their own internal sense of values. Of course, there is often external conflict at both Levels I and V.

Levels II, III and IV describe various degrees and types of dis-integration and literal disease.

Dąbrowski was very clear that the levels he presents "represent a heuristic device". In the process of development the structures of two or even three contiguous levels may exist side by side, although it must be understood that they exist in conflict. The conflict is resolved when one of the structures is eliminated, or at least comes under complete control of another structure.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1996|p=17}}

===Level I: Primary integration===
As outlined above, the first level is called primitive or primary integration. People at this level are often influenced primarily by either prominent first factor (heredity/impulse) and/or second factor (social environment) forces.  The majority of people at Level I are integrated at the environmental or social level (Dąbrowski called them average people); however, many also exhibit shades of both impulse and socialization. Dąbrowski distinguished the two subgroups of Level I by degree: "the state of primary integration is a state contrary to mental health. A fairly high degree of primary integration is present in the average person; a very high degree of primary integration is present in the psychopath".{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=121}} Marked by selfishness and [[egocentrism]] (both reticent and explicit), those at level one development generally seek self-fulfillment above all, justifying their pursuits through a sort of "it's all about me" thinking; or, more simply put, they adhere strongly to the phrase "the end justifies the means", sometimes disregarding the severity of the "means". Many people who are considered "leaders" often fall into this category.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=127}}

A vast majority of people either do not break down their primitive integration at all, or after a relatively short period of disintegration, usually experienced at the time of adolescence and early youth, end in a reintegration at the former level or in partial integration of some of the functions at slightly higher levels, without a transformation of the whole mental structure.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|Kawczak|Piechowski|1970|p=4}}

===Level II: Unilevel disintegration===
The prominent feature of this level is an initial, brief and often intense [[crisis]] or series of crises.  Crises are spontaneous and occur on only one level. These crises involve alternatives that may appear to be different but ultimately are on the same level.

Unilevel disintegration occurs during developmental crises such as puberty or menopause, in periods of difficulty in handling some stressful external event, or under psychological and psychopathological conditions such as nervousness and psychoneurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=A more or less organized form of growth through positive disintegration. Lower psychoneuroses are predominantly psychosomatic in nature, higher psychoneuroses are highly conscious internal struggles whose tensions and frustrations are not anymore translated into somatic disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unilevel disintegration consists of processes on a single structural and emotional level; there is a prevalence of automatic dynamisms with only slight self-consciousness and self-control.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=6}}

Conflicts on the same level (horizontal) produce ambitendencies and ambivalences: the person is equally attracted by different but equivalent choices on the same level (ambitendencies) and is not able to decide what to do because he or she has no real preference between the choices (ambivalences).  If developmental forces are strong enough, ultimately, the person is thrust into an [[existentialism|existential]] crisis: one's social rationales no longer account for one's experiences and there are no alternative explanations.  During this phase, existential despair is the predominant emotion.  The resolution of this phase begins as individually chosen values begin to replace [[social mores]] that have been ingrained by rote and are integrated into a new hierarchy of personal values.  These new values often conflict with the person's previous social values.  Many of the status quo explanations for the "way things are," learned through education and from the social order, collapse under conscious, individual scrutiny. This causes more conflicts focused on the person's analysis of his or her own reactions to the world at large and of the behavior of self and others. Common behaviors and the ethics of the prevailing social order come to be seen as inadequate, wrong or hypocritical.  Positive maladjustment prevails. For Dąbrowski, these crises represent a strong potential for development toward personal growth and mental health.  Using a positive definition, mental health reflects more than social conformity: it involves a careful, personal examination of the world and of one's values, leading to the development of an individual personality.

Level II is a transitional period. Dąbrowski said you either fall back (reintegration on a lower level), end negatively, in suicide or [[psychosis]] or move ahead to Level III.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=7}}

The transition from Level II to Level III involves a fundamental shift that requires a phenomenal amount of energy.  This period is the crossroads of development: from here one must either progress or regress. The struggle between Dąbrowski's three factors reflects this transitional crisis: "Do I follow my instincts (first factor), my teachings (second factor) or my heart (third factor)?"  The developmental answer is to transform one's lower instincts (automatic reactions like anger) into positive motivation, to resist rote and social answers, and to listen to one's inner sense of what one ought to do.

===Level III: Spontaneous multilevel disintegration===
Level III describes a new type of conflict: a vertical conflict between two alternatives that are not simply different, but that exist on different levels. One is genuinely higher and the other is lower in comparison. These vertical conflicts initially arise from involuntary perceptions of higher versus lower choices in life. "You just look at something, maybe for the 1000th time (to use the words of [[G. K. Chesterton]]), and it strikes you—you see this one thing differently and once you do, it changes things. You can no longer "go back and see it the way you did before"." Dąbrowski called this vertical dimension multilevelness. Multilevelness is a gradual realization of the "possibility of the higher" (a phrase Dąbrowski used frequently) and of the subsequent contrasts between the higher and the lower in life. These vertical comparisons often illustrate the lower, actual behavior of a person in contrast to higher, imagined ideals and alternative idealized choices. Dąbrowski believed that the authentic individual would choose the higher path as the clear and obvious one to follow (erasing the ambivalences and ambitendencies of unilevel conflicts). If the person's actual behavior subsequently falls short of the ideal, internal disharmony and a drive to review and reconstruct one's life often follow. Multilevelness thus represents a new and powerful type of conflict, a conflict that is developmental in Dąbrowski's approach.

These vertical conflicts are critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Disintegration is multilevel (or vertical), if there are conflicts between higher and lower levels of instinctive, emotional or intellectual functions, e.g. higher and lower forms of the sexual instinct, or the instinct of self-preservation, etc. It consists mainly in differentiation and hierarchization of various levels of functions with a tendency towards gradual stabilization of a new hierarchy. In the course of positive multilevel disintegration primitive, animalistic drives and structures are subject to a disintegration, that is weakening, loosening and even total destruction under the impact of developmental dynamisms (cf.) and gradually give way to new, higher levels and new, higher structures. There is a growth of consciousness of inner conflicts, self-consciousness and self-control. The processes of inner psychic transformation gain in intensity and authenticity (cf.). There is a gradual build-up of the inner psychic milieu (cf.) with its main dynamisms such as "subject-object" in oneself, the third factor, inner psychic transformation, autonomy and authentism, and the personality ideal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person is to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person does not have the developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This vertical view becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, vertical view, it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined).

===Level IV: Directed multilevel disintegration===
In Level IV the person takes full control of his or her development. The involuntary spontaneous development of Level III is replaced by a deliberate, conscious and self-directed review of life from the multilevel perspective. This level marks the real emergence of the third factor, described by Dąbrowski as an autonomous factor "of conscious choice (valuation) by which one affirms or rejects certain qualities in oneself and in one's environment".{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1972|p=306}} The person consciously reviews his or her existing belief system and tries to replace lower, automatic views and reactions with carefully thought out, examined and chosen ideals. These new values will increasingly be reflected in the person's behavior. Behavior becomes less reactive, less automatic and more deliberate as behavioral choices fall under the influence of the person's higher, chosen ideals.

Social mores are reviewed and re-accepted by a conscious internalization when the individual feels it is appropriate. Likewise, when the person feels it is proper, a social value is reviewed and may be rejected to be replaced by a self perceived higher alternative value. One's social orientation comes to reflect a deep responsibility based on both intellectual and emotional factors. At the highest levels, "individuals of this kind feel responsible for the realization of justice and for the protection of others against harm and injustice. Their feelings of responsibility extend almost to everything."{{sfn|Dąbrowski|Kawczak|Sochanska|1973|p=97}} This perspective results from seeing life in relation to one's hierarchy of values (the multilevel view) and the subsequent appreciation of the potential of how life could be, and ought to be, lived. One's disagreements with the (lower level) world are expressed compassionately in doing what one can to help achieve the "ought".

Given their genuine (authentic) prosocial outlook, people achieving higher development also raise the level of their society. Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (negative adjustment in Dąbrowski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment). In other words, to be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature.

===Level V: Secondary integration===
The fifth level displays an integrated and harmonious character, but one vastly different from that at the first level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=The integration of all mental functions into a harmonious structure controlled by higher emotions such as the dynamism of personality ideal, autonomy and authenticity. Secondary integration is the outcome of the full process of positive disintegration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this highest level, one's behavior is guided by conscious, carefully weighed decisions based on an individualized and chosen hierarchy of personal values. Behavior conforms to this inner standard of how life ought to be lived, and thus little inner conflict arises.

Level V is often marked by creative expression. Especially at Level V, problem solving and art represent the highest and noblest features of human life. Art captures the innermost emotional states and is based on a deep empathy and understanding of the subject. Often, human suffering and sacrifice are the subjects of these works. Truly visionary works, works that are unique and novel, are created by people expressing a vision unrestrained by convention. Advances in society, through politics, philosophy and religion, are therefore commonly associated with strong individual creativity or accomplishments.

==Applications==

===Therapy===

The theory of positive disintegration has an extremely broad scope and has implications for many areas. One central application applies to psychological and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Dąbrowski advocated a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnosis of the person's situation, including symptoms and developmental potentials.

====Symptoms and developmental potentials====
If the disintegration appears to fit into a developmental context, then the person is educated in the theory and encouraged to take a developmental view of his or her situation and experiences. Rather than being eliminated, symptoms are reframed to yield insight and understanding into life and the person's unique situation.

====The importance of narratives====

Dąbrowski illustrated his theory through autobiographies of and biographies about those who have experienced positive disintegration. The gifted child, the suicidal teen or the troubled artist is often experiencing the features of TPD, and if they accept and understand the meaning of their intense feelings and crises, they can move ahead, not fall apart. The completion of an extensive autobiography to help the individual gain perspective on his or her past and present is an important component in the autopsychotherapy process. In this process, the therapist plays a very small role and acts more as an initial stimulus than an ongoing therapist.  Dąbrowski asked clients to read his books and to see how his ideas might relate to their lives.

====Autopsychotherapy====

For Dąbrowski, the goal of therapy is to eliminate the therapist by providing a context within which a person can understand and help oneself, an approach to therapy that he called autopsychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Psychotherapy, preventive measures, or changes in living conditions consciously applied to oneself in order to control possible mental disequilibrium.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client is encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery with an emphasis on looking for the contrast between what is higher versus what is lower within his or her personality and value structure. The person is encouraged to further explore his or her value structure especially as it relates to the rationale and justification of positions. Discrepancies between values and behavior are highlighted. The approach is called autopsychotherapy to emphasize the important role that the individual must play in his or her own therapy process and in the larger process of personality development.  The individual must come to see that he or she is in charge of determining or creating his or her own unique personality ideal and value structure. This includes a critical review of social mores and values that have been learned.

Dąbrowski was very concerned about what he called one-sided development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Type of development limited to one talent or ability, or to a narrow range of abilities and mental functions. In such development the creative instinct and empathy appear absent. In exceptionally capable individuals their one-sided development may come under the control of a primitive disposing and directing center and in the extreme case may take the form of psychopathy or paranoia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which people display significant advanced development in only one aspect of life, usually intellectual. He believed that it is crucial to balance one's development.

====Overexcitability====

Dąbrowski also encouraged people to see their reactions (overexcitabilities) and their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] view of the world in the context of their developmental potential. The experience of, and reaction to, crises are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crises with a positive and developmental view.

Dąbrowski reminds clients that without internal disease there is little stimulus for change or growth. Rather than trying to rapidly ameliorate symptoms, this approach encourages individuals to fully experience their feelings and to try to maintain a positive and developmental orientation to what they may perceive as strong depression or anxiety. Of course, this is a unique approach in today's world of seeking immediate and total relief of any unpleasant psychological experience (although it can be compared to Aron's to some extent).

===Education===

Another primary focus is on education, in particular, over the past 25 years, on the experience of creative and [[gifted]]
students. Dąbrowski hypothesized that these students will disproportionately show strong overexcitability and therefore will be prone to the disintegrative process.

==Dąbrowski and the gifted individual==
In an appendix to Dąbrowski (1967), results of investigations done in 1962 with Polish youth are reported. Specifically, "a group of gifted children and young people aged 8 to 23" were examined (p.&amp;nbsp;251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were "intellectually gifted" and 50 were from "drama, ballet, and plastic art schools" (p.&amp;nbsp;251). Dąbrowski found that every one of the children displayed overexcitability, "which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets. Moreover it turned out that these children also showed sets of nervousness, neurosis, and psychoneurosis of various kinds and intensities, from light vegetative symptoms, or anxiety symptoms, to distinctly and highly intensive psychasthenic or hysterical sets" (p.&amp;nbsp;253). Dąbrowski asked why these children should display such "states of nervousness or psychoneurosis" and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p.&amp;nbsp;255). "Probably the cause is more than average sensitivity which not only permits one to achieve outstanding results in learning and work, but at the same time increases the number of points sensitive to all experiences that may accelerate anomalous reactions revealing themselves in psychoneurotic sets" (p.&amp;nbsp;255).

The association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research (Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995). It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. Dąbrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth.

==Key ideas==
The theory is based on numerous key ideas:

*That our lower animal instincts (first factor) must be inhibited and transformed into "higher" forces for us to be Human (this ability to transform our instincts is what separates us from other animals).
*That the common initial personality integration, based upon socialization (second factor), does not reflect true personality.
*At the initial level of integration, there is little internal conflict as when one "goes along with the group", there is little sense of individual wrongdoing. External conflicts often relate to the blockage of social goals—career frustrations for example. The social mores and values prevail with little question or conscious examination.
*True personality must be based upon a system of values that are consciously and volitionally chosen by the person to reflect their own individual sense of "how life ought to be" and their "personality ideal"—the ideal person they feel they "ought to be".
*The lower animal instincts and the forces of peer groups and [[socialization]] are inferior to the autonomous self (personality) constructed by the conscious person.
*To break down the initial integration, crises and disintegrations are needed, usually provided by life experience.
*These disintegrations are positive if the person can achieve positive and developmental solutions to the situation.
*"Unilevel crises" are not developmental as the person can only choose between equal alternatives (go left or go right?).
*A new type of perception involves "multilevelness", a vertical view of life that compares lower versus higher alternatives and now allows the individual to choose a higher resolution to a crisis over other available, but lower, alternatives—the developmental solution.
*"Positive disintegration" is a vital developmental process.
*Dąbrowski developed the idea of "developmental potential" to describe the forces needed to achieve autonomous personality development.
*Developmental potential includes several factors including innate abilities and talents, "overexcitability" and the "third factor".
*Overexcitability is a measure of an individual's level of nervous response. Dąbrowski found that the exemplars he studied all displayed an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to [[angst]], depression and anxiety—psychoneuroses in Dąbrowski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature.
*The third factor is a measure of an individual's drive toward autonomy.
*Dąbrowski's approach is very interesting philosophically as it is Platonic, reflecting the bias of [[Plato]] toward [[essence]]—an individual's essence is a critical determinant of his or her developmental course in life. However, Dąbrowski also added a major [[Existentialism|existential]] aspect as well, what one depends upon the anxieties felt and on how one resolves the day to day challenges one faces. Essence must be realized through an existential and experiential process of development. The characterization advanced by [[Kierkegaard]] of "Knights of faith" may be compared to Dąbrowski's autonomous individual.
*Reviewed the role of logic and reasoning in development and concludes that intellect alone does not fully help us know what to do in life. Incorporates [[Jean Piaget]]'s views of development into a broader scheme guided by emotion. Emotion (how one feels about something) is the more accurate guide to life's major decisions.
*When multilevel and autonomous development is achieved, a secondary integration is seen reflecting the mature personality state. The individual has no inner conflict; they are in internal harmony as their actions reflect their deeply felt hierarchy of values.
*Rejected [[Abraham Maslow]]'s description of [[self-actualization]] (Dąbrowski was a personal friend and correspondent of Maslow's). Actualization of an undifferentiated human self is not a developmental outcome in Dąbrowski's terms. Dąbrowski applied a multilevel (vertical) approach to self and saw the need to become aware of and to inhibit and reject the lower instinctual aspects of the intrinsic human self (aspects that Maslow would have us "embrace without guilt") and to actively choose and assemble higher elements into a new unique self. Dąbrowski would have us differentiate the initial self into higher and lower aspects, as we define them, and to reject the lower and actualize the higher in creating our unique personality.

==Secondary integration versus self-actualization==
People have often equated Maslow's concept of self-actualization with Dąbrowski's level of secondary integration. There are some major differences between these two ideas. Fundamentally, Maslow described self-actualization as a process where the  self is accepted "as is",  so both higher and lower aspects of the self are actualized. Dąbrowski introduces the notion that although the lower aspects may  initially be intrinsic to the self, as human beings we are able to become aware of their lower nature.  We are able to develop [[self-awareness]] into how we feel about these low levels—if we feel badly about behaving in these  lower ways, then we are able to cognitively and volitionally  decide to inhibit and eliminate these behaviors. In this way, the  higher aspects of the self  are actualized while the lower aspects are inhibited and, for Dąbrowski, this is what is unique about humans and sets us apart from other animals— No other animal is able to differentiate their lower instincts and therefore can not inhibit their animalistic impulses. Dąbrowski has gone beyond Maslow's idea of self-actualization and it is not appropriate to equate the two authors on this point.

==Obstacles to the theory==
Both Dąbrowski and his work have faced many obstacles. Personally, he was severely affected by both [[World Wars]]. His work went against the grain as a humanistic theory promoting personal growth in the political atmosphere of [[Poland]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Another problem has been language. Dąbrowski wrote in [[Polish language|Polish]] and translated his works into [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[English language|English]] was the last language he learned and likely the most difficult in terms of capturing the subtleties of his ideas. In spite of these problems, Dąbrowski persevered with his studies of human development, developed his theory and practiced psychiatry all his life.

Dąbrowski died in 1980 and his students went on to explore careers of their own. Many of these students continue to study and speak on the theory, most advancing a deeply personal understanding of what the theory means to them.

Since 1980, there has been a small but consistent demand for Dąbrowski's works. This demand has largely evolved in the United States where Michael Piechowski applied his vision of the theory to gifted education. Many in education and in [[gifted education]] have looked to Dąbrowski's theory to help provide a context for their students. Although a small part of the overall theory, this aspect has generated a number of Master's and Ph.D. theses and introduced the theory to a large audience.

The reader interested in Dąbrowski has faced a serious scarcity of resources, especially of Dąbrowski's English works. His books are long out of print and rare, and his papers are held by a few people but not circulated. There are also many Polish works by Dąbrowski (about 20 books) on the theory, on psychotherapy, on education and on philosophy that have not been translated into English.

One severe hurdle to the investigation and study of the theory of positive disintegration is the fact that no suitable psychological test exists that measures any Dąbrowskian constructs well. The most widely known instrument, the Overexcitability Questionnaire—Two, has poor psychometric properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=An investigation of measurement invariance across genders on the Overexcitability Questionnaire--Two|journal=Journal of Advanced Academics|date=2011|volume=22|pages=578-293|doi=10.1177/1932202x11414821|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1932202x11414821|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public anthropology''', according to Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, "demonstrates the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline - illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change" (Borofsky 2004).

[[Merrill Singer]] has criticized the concept of public anthropology on the grounds that it ignores [[applied anthropology]]. He writes: "given that many applied anthropologists already do the kinds of things that are now being described as PA, it is hard to understand why a new label is needed, except as a device for distancing public anthropologists from applied anthropologists" (Singer 2000: 6).  Similarly, [[Barbara Rylko-Bauer]] writes: "one has to ask what is the purpose of these emerging labels that consciously distinguish themselves from applied/practicing anthropology?  While they may serve the personal interests of those who develop them, it is hard to see how they serve the broader interests of the discipline" (Rylko-Bauer 2000: 6).  Eric Haanstad responds to Singer's claim by arguing that public anthropology does not necessarily entail the exclusion of applied anthropology (Haanstad 2001a). Alan Jeffery Fields defends the concept of public anthropology by claiming it is "a useful trope for one important reason: it calls attention to the fact that there is a division between public and academic perceptions" (Fields 2001a).

In [[international relations]] since the late 20th century, a '''regional power''' is a term used for a [[sovereign state|state]] that has [[Power (international relations)|power]] within a [[Geography|geographic]] [[region]].&lt;ref name=es&gt;Joachim Betz, Ian Taylor, [http://www.essex.ac.uk/ECPR/events/jointsessions/helsinki/long_ws_outlines/ws9.doc "The Rise of (New) Regional Powers in Asia, Africa, Latin America..."]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, German Overseas Institute &amp; University of St. Andrews, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=po&gt;Martin Beck, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090327080130/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/content/forumregional/pdf/giga_conference_RegionalPowers_0612/giga_RegPowers0612_paper_beck.pdf ''The Concept of Regional Power: The Middle East as a Deviant Case?''], German Institute of Global and Area Studies, Hamburg, 11–12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; States which wield unrivalled power and influence within a region of the world possess [[regional hegemony]].

== Characteristics ==
Regional powers shape the [[polarity (international relations)|polarity]] of a regional area. Typically, regional powers have capabilities which are important in the [[region]] but do not have capabilities at a global scale. Slightly contrasting definitions differ as to what makes a regional power. The [[European Consortium for Political Research]] defines a regional power as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A state belonging to a geographically defined region, dominating this region in [[economics|economic]] and [[military]] terms, able to exercise [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Power (international relations)|influence]] in the region and considerable influence on the world scale, willing to make use of power [[resource]]s and recognized or even accepted as the regional leader by its neighbours".&lt;ref name=es/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies]] states that a regional power must:&lt;ref name=po/&gt;

* form part of a definable region with its own identity
* claim to be a regional power (self-image as a regional power)
* exert decisive influence on the geographic extension of the region as well as on its ideological construction
* dispose over comparatively high [[military]], [[economics|economic]], [[demography|demographic]], [[politics|political]] and [[ideology|ideological]] capabilities
* be well integrated into the region
* define the regional security agenda to a high degree
* be appreciated as a regional power by other powers in the region and beyond, especially by other regional powers
* be well connected with regional and global forums

== Regional powers ==
[[File:Regonal powers in the world.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2]]

Below are states that have been described as regional powers by international relations and [[political science]] [[academy|academics]], analysts, or other experts. These states to some extent meet the criteria to have regional power status, as described above. Different experts have differing views on exactly which states are regional powers. States are arranged by their region, and in alphabetic order.

Primary, or major, regional powers (also known as ''pivotal powers'') are placed in the major regions as identified by analysts. Secondary, or minor, regional powers are listed within their subregions. Major regional powers are indicated in '''bold''' and minor regional powers in normal font.

=== Asia ===
Historically, [[China]] was the dominant power in [[East Asia]]. But, at the beginning of the early 20th century, the Empire of Japan became an important player in [[World War I]] as one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. With economic turmoil, Japan's expulsion from the League of Nations, and its interest in expansion on the mainland, Japan became a major player in [[World War II]] as one of the [[Axis powers]]. China became a key player in World War II as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]].

Since the late 20th century, regional alliances, economic progress, and contrasting military power have changed the strategic and regional power balance in Asia. In recent years, a re-balancing of military and economic power among countries such as [[China]] and [[India]] has resulted in significant changes in the geopolitics of Asia. [[China]] and [[Japan]] have also gained greater influence over regions outside Asia.  With close economic and military ties with the [[United States]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are seen as major regional powers "[[containment|containing]]" the communist regimes of [[China]] and [[North Korea]].

'''Serbenda''' ({{lang-sr|Србенда}}/''Srbenda''; [[plural]]: '''Serbendas'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=John |year=2013 |title=Utopia's Suicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Serbian: Србенде/''Srbende'') is a term for a [[Serb]] who is thoroughly and uncompromisingly devoted to all things [[Serbia]]n.&lt;ref name="Živković 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Živković |first=Marko |authorlink=Marko Živković |year=2011 |title=Serbian Dreambook: National Imaginary in the Time of Milošević}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally considered a term of [[endearment]] by [[Serbs]], it can sometimes contain negative connotations, referring to nationalist [[aggression]] and heightened [[tribalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saric |first=Ljiljana |authorlink=Ljiljana Saric|year=2010 |title=Contesting Europe's Eastern Rim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian writer and scholar Jovan Skerlić in 1925 described the "Serbenda" as being an "autochthonous, raw Serb, without a trace of anything foreign".&lt;ref name="Živković 2011"/&gt;

[[University of Alberta]] professor of [[Cultural Anthropology]] Marko Živković says the term "carries the connotations of rusticity, simplicity, and traditional patriarchal values-the opposite of high culture polish and cosmopolitan sophistication".&lt;ref name="Živković 2011"/&gt;

The word ''Srbenda'' (anglicized "Serbenda") is an augmentative of ''Srbin'' ("a Serb").&lt;ref name="Živković 2011"/&gt;

'''Solomon Islands Sign Language''' is the local [[deaf sign language]] of the [[Solomon Islands]]. There are significant between the sign of the main islands of [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Malaita]], and presumably elsewhere. The capital [[Honiara]], where deaf people from all nine provinces have gathered, has the most developed [[Deaf community]], and there is a nearby [[Deaf village]] at [[Aruliho]]. SISL is all domains of life, with admixture of [[Signed English]] and [[AUSLAN]] signs.&lt;ref name=ISO/&gt;

There is a relatively high incidence of deafness in the Solomon Islands due to poverty-related diseases such  malaria, meningitis, rubella, and otitis media. Attitude towards SISL is very positive, and the community worries that AUSLAN, which is taught at school, does not reflect their cultural and language needs. This has been confirmed by a pilot linguistic investigation.&lt;ref name=ISO&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2016-013_szs.pdf ISO 639-3 Registration Authority Request for New Language Code Element in ISO 639-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Songora''' or Shongora (''pl.'' Basongora, ''sing.'' Musongora) also known as "Bacwezi", "Chwezi", ''Huma'' or "Bahuma") are a traditionally a [[Pastoralism|pastoralist people]] of the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of [[Central Africa]] located in Western [[Uganda]] and Eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. They have distinctive customs and speak 'Rusongora' an [[African languages|African language]] that is originates from [[Kordofanian languages|Proto-Kordofanian]] and is similar to [[Runyankole]] and [[Rutoro]]. The Basongora population has reported as numbering 25,000 in 2015 in Uganda. Some Basongora also live in Eastern Congo.

The colonial and neo-colonial governments in [[Central Africa]] instituted programs to encourage the Basongora to abandon their traditional lifestyle, and most of the territory traditionally owned by the Songora community has been appropriated for use as national parks or has been settled and occupied by other communities, notably the [[Batoro]] and [[Konjo people|Bakonzo]]. Also Songora territory has been partitioned into several districts and is distributed across Uganda and Congo.

The traditional lifestyle of the Basongora is notable for its adaptation to dry [[savana]] and [[scrubland]]s, as well as mountainous terrain.

==Overview==
The Basongora are a mixed [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]]/[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] group in [[East Africa|East]] and [[Central Africa]], traditionally residing in the foothills and plains at the floor of the western arm of the [[Great Rift Valley]] and the hills around the base of the [[Rwenzori Mountains|Rwenzori Mountain Range]]. The Songora traditional economy was largely based on cattle-rearing, as well as salt-manufacture and trade in iron. The political organization of the Songora was a form confederacy of several states united by a parliament called Muhabuzi, and a [[constitutional monarchy]] led by a trimviate that consisted of an empress dowager (Omu'Gabe'kati), a female ruler (Omu'Go), and a male ruler (Omu'Kama){{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. The confederacy emerged from a single Songora state that dates back to the 12th century consisted of several provinces including Kisaka-Makara, Kitagwenda, Bugaya, Bunyaruguru and Kiyanja{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} .

==History==
According to their own [[oral history]], the Basongora emerged from the ancient empires of the [[Batembuzi]] constituted by the dynasties of the Kushites, Axumites, the Shenzi [Zenj], and the Chwezi. The traditional homeland of the Basongora is the region centred in the foothills and plains that surround the [[Rutshuru]] and [[Rwenzori]] mountain ranges.

Some of the most notable Songora monarchs include [[Kyomya Bwachali]] who died around 1850, and was the maternal grandfather of King Ntare V of [[Nkore]] kingdom{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. The last precolonial King of Busongora was King [[Kasigano]]. He was deposed in 1907 by the British, austensiby for his having sought to ally himself with the Belgians in the Congo{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} . Busongora was then partitioned and divided between the [[Congo Free State|Congo]] and [[Uganda Protectorate]], and the portions that fell within Uganda were further sub-divided into several districts, all of which were then annexed to the kingdoms of [[Toro Kingdom|Toro]] and Nkore{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} . The Kingdom of [[Rwenzururu]] formed in the later part of the 20th century on the territory of Busongora{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} . 

Between 1924 and 1933 there was an outbreak of the rinderpest that decimated the cattle populations of the  Basongora especially in Kishaka-Makara chiefdom, forcing them to disperse to other areas of Uganda and the eastern Congo.  Basongora believe the outbreak began as a result of a virulent drugs vaccination program started by the colonial government. The biggest group that fled to the Congo did not return to the area until 1964 due to the strife caused by the [[Mulele]] rebellion there.

In 1925, Parc Nationale des Virunga was created by the Belgian colonial authorities encompassing areas of the chiefdom of Kiyanja (of the Bamooli clan), Kakunda (now called Kyavinyonge), Rwemango, Makara, Kashansha and Bugaya among others and pressure to protect the adjoining ecosystem in Uganda led to the establishment of game reserves around Lake George (Known as Rweishamba by Basongora)and Lake Edward (locally known as Rweru) between 1906 and 1950. Several name changes followed and Kazinga National Park was gazetted in 1952 and in 1954 it was renamed Queen Elizabeth National Park by the colonial administration. This left only limited land for the pastoral Basongora. In 1940s the colonial government introduced cotton growing in  Busongora. By coincidence, the best soil and suitable climate for cotton growing was in the Bwengo area and other plains of the Busongora County in Kasese. Although some remained in the park – albeit illegally, thousands of others moved across the border with their herds into the Virunga National Park in the Congo{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

Between  the  1940 and 1950s,the cotton growing enterprise lured particularly the Bakonjo from the highlands to the lowlands{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} . By 1962, the Rwenzururu Freedom Movement had also displaced some Bakonjo from the mountains, forcing them to settle in parts of Busongora that had not been gazetted as protected areas{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} .In 1962 Basongora started returning to their original areas only to find that the Toro Development Company (TDC) that wound up in 1970, had leased some of their land, and was running projects such as the Mubuku Irrigation Scheme{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

When the cotton industry plummeted in the 1970s, the general Ugandan public lost interest in cotton, thus giving the Basongora pastoralists a chance to resettle in vast plains of Nyakatonzi{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. When the NRM government introduced the decentralization policy,it was hijacked by the extremist fringe of the Bakonjo and was seen as an opportunity to displace and subjugate the Basongora{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} . This coincided with peak cotton production between 1987 and 1989 and it is in the same period that Basongora were displaced from their ancestral lands of Bukangara and Rweihingo{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} .

==Monarchy==

On 12 May 2012 Basongora revived their ancient kingdom that had been dismembered and abolished during the colonial occupation one hundred years prior. On 1 July 2012, the Songora installed Bwebale Ivan Rutakirwa Rwigi IV as the king of "BuSongora Kingdom", and claimed twenty sub-counties of Uganda as their territory.&lt;ref name="UG-Pulse"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rwenzururu kingdom accuse government of siding with Basongora|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Ugpulse (Ultimate Media)|url=http://www.ugpulse.com/uganda-news/government/rwenzururu-kingdom-accuse-government-of-siding-with-basongora/26555.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sub-counties include: Muhokya, Bugoye, Nyakatonzi, Katwe, Karusandara, Mubuku, Ibuga, Hamukungu, Kasenyi, Busunga, and Katunguru, among others{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} . The kingdom also claimed their ancestral areas of Shema, Bunyaruguru and Kitagwenda in Uganda, as well as Virunga National Park in the Congo, as part of the kingdom{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} .

King Rwigi IV died on 28 April 2015.

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}} 

Other notable figures in ancient Songora history include at least two empresses; Nyakahuma, and [[Kitami rwa Nyawera]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. The Queen Kiboga of Nkore was a Songora{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. She was also mother to Nkore's King [[Ntare V]], and sister to King Kaihura of the Songora. Princess Kantunguru of Nkore was also a Songora and has a town named after her in western Uganda. Many of the rulers of states of [[Rwanda]], [[Mpororo]], [[Bunyoro]], Toro and Nkore chose their wives from among the Songora.  Other notable Songora kings in the pre-colonial era include: Kyomya III father of the founder of Bunyoro - Rukidi Mpuga; Bulemu I Rushoita, Rwigi II Kyeramaino Rweshakaramyambi, Nyabongo Kikundi Nyakwirigita, Ihiingo, Goro, Nyabongo I, Kasheshe (for whom the municipality/city of [[Kasese]] is named), Rutairuka, Makora, and Kaihura{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

During the post colonial era, beginning in the early 1960s, the Songora didn't formally have rulers recognized by the central governments in Uganda and Congo/[[Zaire]]. However, there are several notable Songora personalities in various fields that have played a key role in maintaining the presence of the community. Among them are Timothy Bazarrabusa (RIP) an educationalist who served as Uganda's first High Commissioner to London, [[Amon Bazira (RIP)]], who served as Director of Intelligence, as Chair of the Security &amp; Defence Parliamentary Committee, and as State Minister of Lands, Waters and Mineral resources in Uganda from 1981-85. Gen. [[James Kazini (RIP)]] was commander of the Uganda people's defense force, Lt Col Jet Mwebaze (RIP) a commander within the UPDF. Other notable Basongora include the Noble Sirasi Kisankara (RIP), The Prophet Yombo Yowasi [RIP], the Rwabukurukuru family, Wilson Isingoma, Boaz Kafuda, Prof. Mbabi-Katana, Enoch Rukidi, Kosia Mpazi, the Rwamashonje family,the Rubuubi family,the Rwakashamba family, Yefesi Saiba, and Ananais Mulumba.

==Culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}} 

Songora society is strongly pastoral. Cattle motifs form an important part of the language. Cattle have an important place in the imagination, poetry and art of the community. The disciplines required in the management of cattle have a great import impact on the diet, health and appearance of the Songora. Age determines seniority in social relations, and men and women are considered equal. The Songora are generally monogamous. Traditionally the Songora were monotheistic.

The Songora reacted to a tetanus epidermic in the 1880s by requiring everyone in the community to remove the four front lower teeth, as a means to force-feed medication to victims of the disease. When the epidermic ended, many Songora continued with the teeth removal even though it was no longer necessary in the era of syringes and other means of treatment.

In recent decades the traditional Songora territory has yielded interesting artefacts that are of great value to general human history. The [[Ishango Bone]] is one of the items that was found in Songora territory. While the Eastern Arm of the [[Great Rift Valley]] located in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania has yielded the greatest amount of ancient human fossils,  the northern portion of the Western Arm of the Rift Valley - home of the Songora - remains largely unexplored, although it appears to contain important fossils. The lack of exploration has been caused by the high level of war and civil conflict in the region.

'''''Time of the Gypsies''''' ({{lang-sr|Дом за вешање}}, ''Dom za vešanje'', literally "Home for Hanging") is a 1988 Yugoslav [[coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[crime film|crime]] [[drama film|drama]] film by [[Serbia|Serbian]] director [[Emir Kusturica]]. Filmed in [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]], ''Time of the Gypsies'' tells the story of a young [[Romani people|Romani]] man with magical powers who is tricked into engaging in petty crime. It is widely considered to be one of Kusturica's best films. The film was recorded in Sarajevo, Skopje and Milan, by the Forum Sarajevo. The film was selected as the Yugoslav entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[62nd Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

The film revolves around Perhan, a Romani teenager with [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers and his passage from boy to man that starts in a little village in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and ends in the criminal underworld of [[Milan]]. The film deals with [[magic realism]].

[[Time of the Gypsies / Kuduz - Soundtrack|The film's soundtrack]] was composed by [[Goran Bregović]].

==Plot==
Perhan lives with his devoted grandmother Khaditza, his lame sister Danira and his dissolute uncle Merdzan. He wants to marry a girl named Azra, but her mother won't allow it, as Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with Perhan's late mother. Ahmed, the "Gypsy sheik," comes to the village with his brothers. Merdzan loses his clothes playing cards with Ahmed's brothers, and comes home desperate for money so that he can repay. It is raining and not finding any money, he accuses the grandmother of hiding the money from him and lifts the frame of the house up (using a rope and a truck), so that it is suspended in mid-air as the rain comes down on Perhan, his grandmother and Danira. Very soon after, Khaditza is summoned to use her powers to save Ahmed's sick son, Roberto, which Khaditza does. For repayment, she proposes a deal with Ahmed - to pay for Danira's leg to be healed at a hospital in [[Ljubljana]]. Perhan goes with Danira, promising his grandmother not to leave her, but Ahmed asks where will he stay and convinces him to go to Milan. At first Perhan wants to make money honestly, but after being dragged through the mud, Perhan begins stealing and squirreling money away in a shack.

After being double-crossed by his brother Sadam, Ahmed appoints Perhan boss of the operation. Now relatively rich, Perhan goes home, where he is enraged to find Azra is pregnant. Perhan refuses to believe that the baby is his. They marry with the condition that she sell the baby. Perhan is also disappointed to find that the house Ahmed promised to build him is not being built at all, and that Danira was not operated on, but forced to be a beggar as part of Ahmed's money operation. On their wedding night, Azra tells him the child is theirs, and was conceived when they made love on the [[Đurđevdan|Feast of St George]]. Still wearing her wedding dress, Azra dies after giving birth to a boy while levitating mid-air. Because Ahmed leaves with the baby, which we discover later is also named Perhan, he is raised by Ahmed's crew.

After four years of searching, Perhan reunites with Danira in Rome, who leads him to Perhan Jr., whom Perhan now accepts as his child. Perhan drops the children off at the train station, promising to meet up with them after buying an accordion for his son and a present (sponges) for grandmother. The boy tells him he is mad at him because he will not return, and he will not get an accordion. Perhan assures him he will, "Cross my gypsy heart," but immediately runs out of the station to settle the score with Ahmed, who is about to be married. Perhan arrives at the wedding and kills Ahmed with a fork, using his telekinetic powers. He also kills Ahmed's brothers, but he is in turn killed by Ahmed's new wife. At the funeral, the grandmother passes out drinks to everyone and Perhan Jr. goes outside the house, peers through the window at his dead father, breaks the glass and steals the golden coins put on his father's eyes. Merdzan notices, and follows him out in the rain, as the child runs away hidden under a cardboard box. Merdzan is about to catch him up and pick up the board, but seems to have second thoughts, stops, and starts running in another direction.

The '''[[Vlachs]]'''  ([[endonym]]: ''Rumînji'' or ''Rumâni'', {{lang-sr|Власи}} / ''Vlasi'') are an ethnic minority in eastern [[Serbia]], culturally and linguistically related to [[Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=whIP49KZ6xIC&amp;pg=PA68 | title = Documents: Working Papers, 2008 Ordinary Session (second Part), 14-18 April 2008, Vol. 3: Documents 11464, 11471, 11513-11539 | isbn = 9789287164438 | author1 = Assembly | first1 = Council of Europe: Parliamentary | date = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Istorija postojanja Vlaha|url=http://www.vlasi.rs/index.php?page=1|work=Nacionalni savet Vlaha|publisher=Nacionalni savet Vlaha|accessdate=26 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331003431/http://www.vlasi.rs/index.php?page=1|archive-date=31 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herrmann, J. |url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?FileID=11906&amp;Lang=EN |work=Parliamentary Assembly's Documents |title=The situation of national minorities in Vojvodina and of the Romanian ethnic minority in Serbia |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They mostly live in the [[Timočka Krajina]] region (roughly corresponding to the districts of [[Bor District|Bor]] and [[Zaječar District|Zaječar]]), but also in [[Braničevo District|Braničevo]] and [[Pomoravlje District|Pomoravlje]] districts. A small Vlach population also exists in [[Smederevo]] and [[Velika Plana]] ([[Podunavlje District]]), and in the municipalities of [[Aleksinac]] and [[Kruševac]] ([[Rasina District]]). 

== History ==
Vlach is an exonym for the eastern Romance speaking community in the Balkans, which resulted from the occupation and colonisation of the region during the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vlach|title=Vlach {{!}} European ethnic group|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948626914|title=National ideologies and language policies|last=Rumen.|first=Daskalov,|last2=Tchavdar.|first2=Marinov,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004250765|oclc=948626914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northeastern Serbia is home to several [[Vlachs|Vlach]]/[[Romanians|Romanian]] communities who speak dialects similar to ones in parts of western Romania: in [[Banat]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Wallachia). These are the Ungureni (''Ungurjani'', Унгурјани), Munteni (''Munćani'', Мунћани) and Bufeni (''Bufani'', Буфани). Today, about three quarters of the Vlach population speak the Ungurean [[subdialect]] which is similar to the Romanian spoken in [[Banat]]. In the 19th century other groups of Romanians originating in [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Wallachia) also settled south of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sr icon}} Kosta Jovanović, ''Negotinska Krajina i Ključ'', Belgrade, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; These are the Țărani (''Carani'', Царани), who form some 25% of the modern population and speak a variety of Oltenian dialect. From the 15th through the 18th centuries large numbers of Serbs also migrated across the Danube, but in the opposite direction, to both Banat and Țara Româneasca. Significant migration ended by the establishment of the kingdoms of Serbia and Romania in the second half of the 19th century. The Vlachs of northeastern Serbia share close linguistic and cultural ties with the Vlachs in the region of Vidin in Bulgaria as well as the Romanians of [[Banat]] and [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Wallachia). Some authors{{who|date=February 2012}} consider that the majority of Vlachs/Romanians in [[Timočka Krajina]] are descendants of Romanians that migrated from Hungary in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Aspects of the Balkans: continuity and change. Contributions to the International Balkan Conference held at UCLA,'' October 23–28, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

=== Language ===
 {{Main|Vlach language in Serbia}}
The [[Vlach language in Serbia|language spoken by the Vlachs]] consists of two distinct [[Varieties of the Romanian language|Romanian subdialects]] spoken in regions neighboring Romania: one major group of Vlachs speaks the dialect spoken in [[Mehedinți County]] in western [[Oltenia]], while the other major group speaks a dialect similar to the one spoken in the neighboring region of [[Banat]].

The [[Romanian language]] is not in use in local administration, not even in localities where members of the minority represent more than 15% of the population, where it would be allowed according to Serbian law.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt;

===Religion===
The [[Romanian Orthodox Church, Malajnica|Romanian Orthodox Church in Malajnica]], built in 2004, is the first [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian church]] in eastern Serbia in 170 years. Before its construction, [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians]] in [[Timočka Krajina|Timoč]] were not allowed to hear liturgical services in their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bignewsmagazine.com/2004/12/xenophobic-actions-against-timoc-romanians/ |title=Xenophobic actions against Timoc Romanians |access-date=2012-02-28 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716120125/http://bignewsmagazine.com/2004/12/xenophobic-actions-against-timoc-romanians/ |archive-date=2012-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SERBIA: Romanian priest to pay for official destruction of his church|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=654|work=F18News|publisher=Forum 18 News Service|accessdate=26 June 2012|author=Drasko Djenovic|date=9 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgnpress.ro/Politic/Haiducul-credintei-din-Valea-Timocului-Boian-Alexandrovici-decorat-de-presedintele-Basescu.html "Haiducul credintei din Valea Timocului, Boian Alexandrovici, decorat de presedintele Basescu"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919130036/http://www.rgnpress.ro/Politic/Haiducul-credintei-din-Valea-Timocului-Boian-Alexandrovici-decorat-de-presedintele-Basescu.html |date=2008-09-19 }} {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Vlachs of Eastern Serbia are [[Eastern Orthodox church|Orthodox Christians]] who had belonged to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] since the 19th century. This changed on 24 March 2009, when Serbia recognized the authority of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] in [[Timočka Krajina|Valea Timocului]] and the confessional rights of the Vlachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ziuadevest.ro/actualitate/5863-biserica-roman-din-timoc-a-fost-recunoscut-de-ctre-curtea-suprem-de-justiie-a-serbiei.html |title=Biserica Română din Timoc a fost recunoscută de către Curtea Supremă de Justiţie a Serbiei - Ziua de Vest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726162514/http://www.ziuadevest.ro/actualitate/5863-biserica-roman-din-timoc-a-fost-recunoscut-de-ctre-curtea-suprem-de-justiie-a-serbiei.html |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 Serbian law on religious organizations did not recognize the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] as a traditional church, as it had received permission from the Serbian Church to operate only within Vojvodina, but not in Timočka Krajina.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt; At Malajnica, a Vlach priest belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church encountered deliberately-raised administrative barriers when he attempted to build a church.&lt;ref name="coe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2005/09/050916_malainita.shtml "Biserica românească din Malainiţa ameninţată din nou"], ''BBC Romanian'', 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other Romanian Orthodox churches are planned or under construction in [[Jasikovo]], [[Ćuprija]], [[Bigrenica]] and [[Samarinovac (Negotin)|Samarinovac]]. Additionally, a Romanian Orthodox monastery is under construction in Malajnica. The Romanian Orthodox churches in Eastern Central Serbia are subordinated to the ''Protopresbyteriat Dacia Ripensis'' with its seat in [[Negotin]]. The protopresbyteriat is subordinated to the Romanian Orthodox diocese Dacia Felix with its seat in [[Vršac]].

The relative isolation of the Vlachs has permitted the survival of various pre-Christian religious customs and beliefs that are frowned upon by the Orthodox Church. Vlach magic rituals are well known across modern Serbia.  The Vlachs celebrate the [[wikt:ospăț|ospăț]] (''hospitium'', in Latin), called in Serbian ''praznik'' or ''[[slava]]''. The customs of the Vlachs are very similar to those from Southern Romania ([[Walachia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziarullumina.ro/articole;940;1;24534;0;Obiceiuri-de-inmormantare-la-romanii-din-Timoc.html ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721093559/http://www.ziarullumina.ro/articole%3B940%3B1%3B24534%3B0%3BObiceiuri-de-inmormantare-la-romanii-din-Timoc.html |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgroups==
The Vlach community is divided into several groups, each speaking their own dialectal variant:

* the '''Ţărani''' (Carani) of the Bor, [[Negotin]] and [[Zaječar]] regions are closer to [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Walachia) in their speech and music. The Ţărani have the saying "''Nu dau un leu pe el''" (He's not worth even a [[Romanian leu|leu]]). The reference to "leu" (lion) as currency most likely goes back to the 17th century when the Dutch-issued daalder (leeuwendaalder) bearing the image of a lion was in circulation in the Romanian principalities and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire whose own currency was habitually being debased by the government. In the Romanian principalities, as well as in Bulgaria, the ''leeuwendaalder'' (in Romanian and Bulgarian ''leu'' and ''lev'', respectively) came to symbolize a strong currency. Indeed, on gaining independence in the 19th century both countries adopted this name for their new currencies. Since newly independent Serbia named its currency (the [[dinar]]) after the Roman ''[[denarius]]'', the reference to the ''leu'' among the Ţărani is an indication of their connection to, if not origin in, what is now Romania.
* the '''Ungureni''' or Ungureani (Ungurjani) of [[Homolje]] are related to the Romanians of [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]], since ''Ungureni'' (compare with the word "[[Hungarians]]") is a term used by the Romanians of [[Wallachia]] to refer to their kin who once lived in provinces formerly part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The connection is evident not only in vocabulary, but also in the similarities of dialectal phonology and folk music motifs, as well as in sayings such as "''Ducă-se pe [[Mureş River|Mureş]]''" (May the Mureş take him/it away), a reference to the Transylvanian river. There is also a sub-group known as ''Ungureni Munteni'' (Ungurjani-Munćani), "the ungureni from the mountains".
* '''Bufani''' are immigrants from [[Lesser Walachia]] (Oltenia).

On the census, the Vlachs declared themselves either as Serbs, Vlachs or Romanians. Therefore, the "real" number of people of Vlach origin could be much greater than the number of recorded Vlachs, both due to mixed marriages with Serbs and also Serbian national feeling among some Vlachs.

Therefore, the number of people of Vlach origin could be bigger than the number of recorded Vlachs, both due to mixed marriages with Serbs and also Serbian national feeling among some Vlachs.

== Identity ==
[[File:Rumuni (vlasi) Ždrelo.JPG|thumb|Romanians (Vlachs) from the village of Zdrelo in 1868]]
The community is known as ''Vlasi'' ("Vlachs") in Serbian, while their [[endonym]] is ''Rumînji'', virtually the same as the Romanian endonym {{lang|ro|români}} {{IPA-ro|roˈmɨnʲ|pron}}. The Vlach community is highly assimilated into Serbian society, bilingual in the Serbian and Vlach languages, and adhering to the Eastern Orthodo Church.
[[File:Mănăstiri românesti inTimoc.jpg|260px|thumb|left|Some medieval Romanian monasteries in Timoc]]
Despite their recognition as a separate ethnic group by the Serbian government, Vlachs are cognate to Romanians in the cultural and linguistic sense. Some Romanians, as well as international linguists and anthropologists, consider Serbia's Vlachs to be a subgroup of Romanians. Additionally, the Movement of Romanians-Vlachs in Serbia, which represents some Vlachs, has called for the recognition of the Vlachs as a Romanian national minority, giving them rights similar to those of the [[Romanians of Serbia|Romanians of Vojvodina]]. However, the results of the last census showed that most Vlachs of Eastern Serbia opted for the Serbian [[exonym]] ''vlasi'' (= Vlachs) rather than ''rumuni'' (= Romanians).&lt;ref name="popis2002"/&gt; As a result of [[serbianization]], most Vlachs declared themselves to be "Serbs" on censusus taken by [[Communist Yugoslavia]], but the number of those who preferred to declare themselves as Vlachs or Romanians significantly increased from 1991 (16,539 declared ''vlasi'' and 42 declared ''rumuni'') to 2001 (39,953 declared ''vlasi'' and 4,157 declared ''rumuni'').

Romania has given modest financial support to the Vlachs in Serbia for the preservation of their culture and language, since at present the Vlachs' language is not recognized officially in any localities where they form a majority, there is no education in their mother tongue, and there is no Vlach media or education funded by the Serbian state. There are also no church services in Vlach. Until very recently in the regions populated by Vlachs the official policy of the Serbian Orthodox church opposed the giving of non-Serbian baptismal names.

On the other hand, some Vlachs consider themselves to be simply [[Serbs]] that speak the ''[[Vlach language]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Vlach]] is commonly used as a historical umbrella term for all Latin peoples in [[Southeastern Europe]] ([[Romanians]] proper or Daco-Romanians, [[Aromanians]], [[Megleno-Romanians]], [[Istro-Romanians]]). After the foundation of the Romanian state in the 19th century, Romanians living in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] and in [[Austria-Hungary]] were only seldom called "Vlachs" by foreigners, the use of the exonym "Romanians" was encouraged even by officials, and the Romanian population ceased to use the exonym "Vlach" for their own designation. Only in the [[Serbian Kingdom|Serbian]] and [[History of Bulgaria (1878–1946)|Bulgarian Kingdom]], where the officials did not encourage the population to use the modern exonym "Romanian", was the old designation "Vlach" retained, but the term "Romanian" was used in statistical reports (but only up to the [[Interwar period]], when the designation "Romanian" was changed into "Vlach").&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131215200852/http://www.timoc.org/54_Bor_12092005/BROSURA.pdf] Serbian/Romanian.

[[Bor (Serbia)|Bor]] 2000/2001/2002.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Romanians of Vojvodina (hence those who lived in Austria-Hungary) today prefer to use the modern exonym "Romanian", while those of Central Serbia still use the ancient exonym "Vlach". However, both groups use the [[endonym]] "Romanians", calling their language "Romanian" (''română'' or ''rumână'').&lt;ref&gt;Website of the [http://www.timoc.org/onamarom.htm Federaţia Rumânilor din Serbie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026175835/http://www.timoc.org/onamarom.htm |date=2006-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Reportaj-romanii-Serbiei-M-am-declarat_0_439156333.html Reportaj printre românii din estul Serbiei]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some notes of the government of Serbia, officials recognise that "''certainly members of this population have similar characteristics with Romanians, and the language and folklore ride to their Romanian origin''". The representatives of the Vlach minority sustain their Romanian origin.

In a [[Romania]]n-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] agreement of November 4, 2002, the Yugoslav authorities agreed to recognize the Romanian identity of the Vlach population in Central Serbia,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adevărul]], November 6, 2002: ''Prin acordul privind minoritatile, semnat, luni, la Belgrad, de catre presedintii Ion Iliescu si Voislav Kostunita, statul iugoslav recunoaste dreptul apartenentei la minoritatea romaneasca din Iugoslavia al celor aproape 120.000 de vlahi (cifra neoficiala), care traiesc in Valea Timocului, in Serbia de Rasarit. Reprezentantii romanilor din Iugoslavia, profesori, ziaristi, scriitori, i-au multumit, ieri, la Pancevo, sefului statului pentru aceasta intelegere cu guvernul de la Belgrad. Acordul este considerat de importanta istorica pentru romanii din Valea Timocului, care, din timpul lui Iosip Broz Tito, traiesc fara drept la invatamant si viata religioasa in limba materna, practic nerecunoscuti ca etnie. "Nu vom face ca fostul regim, sa numim noi care sunt minoritatile nationale sau sa stergem cu guma alte minoritati", a spus, ieri, Rasim Ljajic, ministrul sarb pentru minoritati, la intalnirea de la Pancevo a presedintelui cu romanii din Iugoslavia. Deocamdata, statul iugoslav nu a recunoscut prin lege statutul vlahilor de pe Valea Timocului, insa de-acum va acorda acestora dreptul la optiunea etnica, va permite, in decembrie, constituirea Consiliului Reprezentantilor Romani si va participa in Comisia mixta romano-iugoslava la monitorizarea problemelor minoritatilor sarba si romana din cele doua state. In Iugoslavia traiesc cateva sute de mii de romani. Presedintele Ion Iliescu s-a angajat, ieri, pentru o politica mai activa privind romanii din afara granitelor: "Avem mari datorii fata de romanii care traiesc in afara granitelor. Autocritic vorbind, nu ne-am facut intotdeauna datoria. De dragul de a nu afecta relatiile noastre cu vecinii, am fost mai retinuti, mai prudenti in a sustine cauza romanilor din statele vecine. (...) Ungurii ne dau lectii din acest punct de vedere", a spus presedintele, precizand ca romanii trebuie sa-si apere cauza "pe baza de buna intelegere".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6456">Since 1994, Youth on Board (YOB) has been a leader in the field of youth organizing and youth-adult partnerships in the Boston area and beyond. YOB is a youth-led, adult supported program where young people of color have the space and tools to recognize and utilize the power they hold to dismantle political and economic structures that reinforce inequity. YOB believes in the power of young people to transform their communities by recognizing that when young people are fully engaged—when their voices are heard, their opinions matter, and their unique perspective is respected—they commit themselves to making their schools, their communities, and their own lives better. 
 
YOB has worked in more than 5 countries, 27 states, and over 100 schools and isa project of [[YouthBuild USA]].

== Background ==
YOB was founded by Karen Young after working as a national student organizer with [[Campus Outreach Opportunity League|COOL]]. In 1993 Karen met Jenny Sazama and received initial funding from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Jenny was brought in as YOB's associate director and later became co-director with Karen. Jenny became the director of Youth on Board when Karen moved on to do other projects in 2010. &lt;ref&gt;[http://wkkf.org/default.aspx?tabid=55&amp;CID=275&amp;ProjCID=275&amp;ProjID=74&amp;NID=28&amp;LanguageID=0 "'Cross-Cultural Training' for Youth and Adults"]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]]. Retrieved June 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 2010 Rachel Gunther became YOB's Associate Director. 

YOB is widely known for the contributions to Project 540, a national student engagement program for 100,000 students in more than 100 high schools across the country. With funding from several sources, including [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]], [[Boston Public Schools]], and others, Youth on Board has published numerous important materials. Most notable is ''15 Points to Successfully Involving Youth in Decision-Making.''&lt;!-- Young, K., Sazama, J. et al. (2005). ISBN 978-0967064901 --&gt; Other publications by YOB include ''Your Guide to Youth Board Involvement and the Law'',&lt;ref&gt;Sazama, J. and Young, K.

The Boston Student Advisory Council (BSAC) is a group of student leader from Boston public schools who work on issues that affect young people both inside and outside of school. BSAC is made up entirely of low-income students of color who as key stakeholders are at the center of the decisions that affect them the most. Through a partnership with the Boston Public School district (BPS), YOB co-administers this citywide body of student leaders that represents most high schools in the district. 
 
YOB and BSAC work directly with young people as they develop an understanding of the ways economic and political power is distributed in our society. They learn how to change structures that reinforce inequity. YOB and BSAC students have led organizing efforts, forged relationships with district and city-leaders, created and changed school policies, lobbied for increased student representation on the School Committee and other decision-making bodies, and advanced the voice and status of young people throughout Boston. Projects often operate on multiple levels, addressing district-level systems change, as well as systems change on the state level, while developing workable models of student-led campaign development and movement-building for replication across the country. Most critically, all of BSAC’s projects and campaigns are developed by young people themselves.

'''Consulting and Technical Assistance'''
 
Youth on Board provides trainings and technical assistance on various areas, including youth/adult partnership, youth leadership development, adultism, and establishing a student advisory council. 
 
'''Support the Youth Voice in Decision-Making Movement'''
 
YOB supports youth voice in decision-making on a local and national level through speaking engagements, coalitions, consultations, writing articles, participating in research studies, and writing and selling publications.  They are regularly called upon by foundations, think tanks, Federal and State DOE, media outlets, and researchers.  We have written countless articles in publications such as YouthToday and [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-fvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=youth+on+board+rachel+gunther&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QInT19eHme&amp;sig=zqJuupbCpVvlTs51xxn0pl9QQ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZmLSn1YbUAhUm94MKHXJUBYoQ6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=youth%20on%20board%20rachel%20gunther&amp;f=false Advancing Social Justice in the United States]. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=M-fvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=youth+on+board+rachel+gunther&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QInT19eHme&amp;sig=zqJuupbCpVvlTs51xxn0pl9QQ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZmLSn1YbUAhUm94MKHXJUBYoQ6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=youth%20on%20board%20rachel%20gunther&amp;f=false    &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Take Campaigns to Scale'''
 
Using BSAC as an "incubator" of programing, Youth on Board takes highly successful campaigns to scale.  To date we have done this with:
 
# Constructive Feedback Campaign/Student-to-Teacher Evaluation    
# Modeling Student Advisory Councils and Youth Councils based on the inside/outside BSAC model   
# Action and Support model of organizing   
# Social Emotional Learning
