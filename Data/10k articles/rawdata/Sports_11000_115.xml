The '''1954 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race''' was won on handicap by ''Solveig'', making her the overall winner in 1954. She had obtained [[line honours]] in 1953. The 36-foot double ender that was built in 1950 in Sydney by the Norwegian boatyard, [[Halvorsen &amp; Sons]], was fabricated of Huon Pine, a rare wood, the second-oldest organism known to mankind, and found only in the rain-forests of [[Tasmania]]. ''Solveig'' is still a sound vessel, lying off [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], U.S.A.

'''Athletic DNA''' (ADNA) is an American [[sportswear (activewear)|sports apparel]] company. Founded in [[Seattle]] in 2007, ADNA began by training young tennis athletes, which evolved into sponsoring Select [[Junior Tennis]] players, and then expanded to manufacturing clothing for youth and adult [[tennis]] players.  ADNA has since spread to professional tennis, and currently sponsors players on the [[ATP Tour]]&lt;ref name=tennisenfuego&gt;[https://archive.is/20130204082731/http://tennisenfuego.com/2011/09/10/athletic-dna-coming-your-way/ Tennis En Fuego: Athletic DNA Coming Your Way, September 10, 2011] Retrieved Oct. 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[WTA Tour]].

==Origins==

Athletic DNA is run by former [[University of Illinois]] tennis player Mike Calkins, [[New Zealand]] [[Davis Cup]] representative; former [[University of Idaho]] tennis player Dan Willman; and Karl Wiersholm, father of nationally ranked junior tennis player Henrik Wiersholm.&lt;ref name=tennisrecruiting&gt;[http://www.tennisrecruiting.net/article.asp?id=794 TennisRecruiting.net: Athletic DNA Launches Clothing Line with Juniors in Mind] Retrieved Oct. 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The company began in Seattle when founders Calkins and Willman partnered to form an academy for junior tennis players.&lt;ref name=tennisenfuego/&gt; The academy was successful, producing four No. 1 players in five years. Wiersholm then approached Willman and Calkins about branding what they had done with their junior tennis players. Weirsholm noticed that in the general population of tennis players their [[work ethic]] and character traits were changing while at his academy positive work ethics and character traits seemed to be essentially part of their [[DNA]]. This is what inspired the name Athletic DNA.&lt;ref name=tennisenfuego/&gt; With a noticeable lack of apparel targeted towards youth, ADNA began designing and manufacturing apparel for juniors and sponsoring the top young players in the sport.
 
ADNA manufactures clothing for juniors and adults,&lt;ref name=ADNA&gt;[http://www.athleticdna.com/ ADNA Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced a new line of tennis apparel for women in January, 2012.&lt;ref name=tennisenfuego/&gt;&lt;ref name=tenniswarehouse&gt;[http://blog.tenniswarehouse.com/tennis-shoes-apparel/when-the-clothes-talk-athletic-dna-at-tw/ Tennis Warehouse Ultimate Equipment Blog: When the clothes talk…] Retrieved Oct. 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===ADNA Select Athletes===

Since most people involved in the company have an extensive tennis background, either through coaching or playing, ADNA heavily invests in the development of their sponsored players.&lt;ref name=usta&gt;[http://www.usta.com/Play-Tennis/College-Tennis/College_Spotlight_Evan_Zeder_Athletic_DNA/ United States Tennis Association, College Spotlight: Evan Zeder, Athletic DNA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902191818/http://www.usta.com/Play-Tennis/College-Tennis/College_Spotlight_Evan_Zeder_Athletic_DNA/ |date=September 2, 2012 }} Retrieved Oct. 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ourstory&gt;[http://www.athleticdna.com/Our-Story athleticdna.com, Our Story]&lt;/ref&gt; Junior tennis players in the top 500 of rankings qualify for sponsorship and clothing discounts through the company’s Select Program,&lt;ref name=usta/&gt; which is open to the public for application. The ADNA Select Program currently includes over 200 junior tennis players.&lt;ref name=selectjunior&gt;[http://www.athleticdna.com/ADNA-Select-Juniors Athletic DNA Select Juniors] Retrieved Oct. 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

[[File:Lleyton Hewitt, Mar 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Lleyton Hewitt]]]]
ADNA produces its clothing specifically for high-performance athletes. Their colors initially heavily leaned towards red, black and white.&lt;ref name=tennisenfuego/&gt; However, in recent line releases, their tops, bottoms, [[Hoodie]]s and [[tracksuit|warm-ups]] expanded to a variety of designs and colors, and feature the recognizable ADNA “[[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]]” logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athleticdna.com/Mens-Tops Athletic DNA Men's Tops Catalogue] Retrieved Oct. 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing is typically less traditional, abandoning the “country club” look,&lt;ref name=tennisrecruiting/&gt; with bright colors and bold designs, and is geared toward comfort and performance as much as portraying [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]].&lt;ref name=tennisenfuego/&gt;

==Sponsored Players and Coaches==

In addition to the over 500 juniors sponsored by ADNA, the company’s apparel is also seen on the ATP tour.&lt;ref name=usta/&gt;&lt;ref name=selectjunior/&gt; A list of current and former ATP tennis players and coaches who are, or have been, sponsored by ADNA include:

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

An '''athlete biological passport''' is an individual electronic record for professional athletes, in which profiles of [[biological markers]] of doping and results of [[doping test]]s are collated over a period of time. Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athlete’s established levels outside permissible limits, rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doping.chuv.ch/en/lad_home/lad-prestations-laboratoire/lad-prestations-laboratoire-passeport.htm| title=Information on the athlete biological passport| author=[[Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the terminology ''athlete passport'' is recent, the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping. Maybe the first marker of doping, that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood, but through the induced deviations in biological parameters, is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio (T/E). The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect [[anabolic steroid]]s in urine samples. A decade later, in 1997, markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations, such as the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) and the [[Federation Internationale de Ski]], to deter the abuse of recombinant [[erythropoietin]] that was undetectable by direct means at that time. It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term ''athlete passport''. The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=11869930| title=A strategy to detect doping in sports|author=Ashenden M. |publisher=Haematologica|volume=87|issue=3|date=March 2002|journal=Haematologica|pages=225–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/Resources1/Q-and-A/Athlete-Passport/| title=Q-A on the athlete passport| publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203095904/http://www.wada-ama.org/en/Resources1/Q-and-A/Athlete-Passport/| archivedate=3 February 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many believe{{who|date=February 2013}} that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports. While a new [[drug test]] must be developed and validated for each new drug, the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being. New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method. In contrast, the physiology of the human being remains the same through several generations and all [[biomarker]]s developed today in the athlete passport will remain valid for at least several decades. For example, the blood module of the passport is already sensitive today to any new future form of recombinant [[erythropoietin]], as well as to any form of [[gene doping]] that will enhance oxygen transfer to the muscles. Also, while a negative [[drug test]] does not necessarily mean that the athlete did not dope, the athlete can present his/her passport at the beginning of a competition to attest that he/she will compete in his/her natural, unaltered condition.

The athlete passport received a lot of attention when its blood module was established at the beginning of the 2008 racing season by the UCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/ENews/ENewsDetails.asp?MenuId=&amp;id=NTQzOA |title=Implementation of blood passport by UCI |publisher=UCI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222000131/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/ENews/ENewsDetails.asp?MenuId=&amp;id=NTQzOA |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 they revealed that 23 riders were under suspicion of doping following the first phase of blood tests conducted under the new biological passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/03/cycling| title=Blood tests cast doubt on 23 riders| author=Richard Moore| publisher=The Guardian| date=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The blood module of the athlete passport aims to detect any form of [[blood doping]], the steroid module any form of doping with [[anabolic steroid]] and the endocrine module any modification of the [[growth hormone]]/[[IGF-1]] axis. Each of these modules are however at different steps of development, validation and application in sports.

== Athlete biological passport testing ==
According to the World Anti-Doping Agency, the athlete biological passport is administered to establish whether an athlete is manipulating his/her physiological variables without detecting a particular substance or method. The biological passport uses the standardized approach of urine sampling to determine steroid abuse. The objective of this testing is to identify athletes in a haematological module and a steroidal module.

The haematological module tests for certain markers in the body that identify the enhancement of oxygen transport. The specific markers the module tests for include haematocrit, haemoglobin, red blood cell count, percentage of reticulocytes, reticulocytes count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean red cell distribution width, and immature reticulocyte fraction.

The steroidal module collects information on markers for steroid doping and aims to identify endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids. The specific markers the module tests for include testosterone, epitestosterone, the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio, androsterone, and etiocholanolone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/Science_Medicine/Athlete_Biological_Passport/WADA-ABP-Operating-Guidelines_v4.0-EN.pdf|title=Ressources|work=Agence mondiale antidopage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Anti-Doping Agency recently released the 2014 Prohibited Substances list and it will take effect on 1 January. In the new list, the agency modified the definitions of exogenous and endogenous steroids being tested for in the steroidal module of the biological passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-Prohibited-list/2014/WADA-prohibited-list-2014-EN.pdf|title=Ressources|work=Agence mondiale antidopage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cycling ==
[[File:Ricardo Serrano (Tinkoff).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ricardo Serrano (cyclist)|Ricardo Serrano]] was one of the five first riders that UCI opened a biological passport case against, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Brown: [http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-names-first-five-biological-passport-violators UCI names first five biological passport violators], cyclingnews.com, 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Whereabouts rules ===

{{see also|World Anti-Doping Agency#"Whereabouts" controversy}}
Under the new rules, registered riders have to give the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] daily information about their location and provide a one-hour window for possible testing. They have to submit a form every quarter year saying where they will be every day of the next quarter and they must notify the UCI if they change their whereabouts on any day. This means the whereabouts information provided in the whereabouts filings is accurate and sufficient in detail to enable any relevant Anti-Doping Organization to locate him for testing on any given day in that period of time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uci.ch/includes/asp/getTarget.asp?type=FILE&amp;id=NDc3MDk{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most invasive testing programme in the history of any sport, but the UCI feels this invasion of privacy is justified as previously implemented anti-doping regimes have failed to detect every doping violation.

=== Cyclists sanctioned on basis of biological passports ===
The biological passport programme has allowed the UCI to sanction riders for committing an anti-doping rule violation. Riders have also been targeted with further doping controls based on their biological passport.

'''CHS Field''' is a [[baseball park]] in downtown [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]]. It is home to the [[St. Paul Saints]] of the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]], as well as home to [[Hamline University|Hamline University's]] baseball team. 

==History==
Located in the historic [[Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Lowertown District]] of Saint Paul, the park is built upon the former site of a long-vacant industrial-use facility. In September 2012, the stadium was approved for $25 million in funding from the [[Minnesota Legislature]]. The remainder of the funding for the $64 million project was shared between the city and the Saints. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Melo|first1=Frederick|title=St. Paul: With $25M in state funding, Saints ballpark in Lowertown is a go|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21529112/st-paul-saints-dayton-announce-thursday-if-ballpark|website=twincities.com|publisher=Saint Paul Pioneer Press|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The construction of this new ballpark was prompted in part by the deteriorating state of the Saints' original ballpark, [[Midway Stadium]], which was built in 1982.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt; Midway Stadium was located in an industrial area of Saint Paul, near the [[Minnesota State Fair|Minnesota State Fairgrounds]]. A groundbreaking event was held by the Saints on May 10, 2014, with the first concrete being poured on the site.  &lt;ref name="groundbreaking" /&gt;

On September 8, 2014, it was announced that local [[Fortune 100]] business [[CHS Inc.]] had acquired the naming rights to the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saints’ New Home Gets A Name: CHS Field|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2014/09/08/saints-new-home-gets-a-name-chs-field/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saints played their first game at the park on May 18, 2015 against the [[Sioux City Explorers]] in an exhibition match. The first regular season game was against the [[Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks]] on May 21, 2015.&lt;ref name="opening day" /&gt; On August 2, 2016, CHS Field hosted the American Association All-Star Game. 

In July 2017, the field hosted the Minnesota [[American Legion Baseball]] State Tournament, which was won by Tri-City Red, with Ham Lake also advancing to the Central Plains Regional Tournament.  

==Ballpark features==

Beyond left field is a grassy picnic area known as "The Lawn" which can seat 1,000 people. Designed for groups, the picnic area offers a buffet-style selection of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group ticket information - The Lawn|url=http://saintsbaseball.com/groups/layer/layer/food-for-thought/lawn|website=saintsbaseball.com|publisher=St. Paul Saints|accessdate=21 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617190417/http://saintsbaseball.com/groups/layer/layer/food-for-thought/lawn#|archive-date=2015-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHS Field also boasts several environmentally-friendly features. An estimated twelve percent of the stadium's electricity will be generated by 300 [[solar panel]]s. A 27,000-gallon [[Rainwater harvesting|rain water collector]] supplies the park's sprinklers and toilets. Biking to the park is encouraged, with 24 bike racks placed adjacent to the park on Broadway Street. &lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt;

In [[combat sports]] such as [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]], a fighter's '''chin''' is a [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] term that refers to an ability to tolerate physical trauma to the chin or jaw without being knocked unconscious. The fictional [[Rocky Balboa]] character of the [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' franchise]] epitomizes the concept of a boxer with a ''granite chin''.

==Overview==
A fighter with a "good chin" refers to a fighter with the ability to absorb blows to the chin or jaw without being struck unconscious, which can also be called a "granite chin", an "iron chin" or similar. Generally, the jaw portion of the skull, and specifically the point of the chin, is the area most vulnerable to a knock-out blow and therefore having an exceptional tolerance to punishment in this area is a great advantage to a fighter.

A "bad chin", "suspect chin", or "glass jaw" refers to fighters with limited ability to absorb punishment to the chin or jaw. Many [[Club fighter|clubfighters]] and [[journeyman (boxing)|journeymen]] may have glass chins, although it may depend on [[Boxing weight classes|weight class]] or sometimes legs. Some boxing experts, such as [[Teddy Atlas]], believe it to be a mindframe. Additionally, some fighters have been known to have better chins as a result of moving up to a higher weight class. One example of this is [[Miguel Cotto]], who was seen as having a relatively weak chin at light welterweight but was harder to hurt once he moved up to welterweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Emen, Jake | date = 2009-08-28 | title = Manny Pacquiao vs. Miguel Cotto Preview &amp; Predictions | url = http://www.proboxing-fans.com/pacquiao-cotto-preview-predictions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chad Brassil Bunny.jpg|thumb|267px|A man playing Chubby Bunny]]

'''Chubby Bunny''' is an informal recreational and [[hazing]] [[game]] that involves the placement of an increasing number of [[marshmallow]]s or similar items such as cotton balls into one's own [[human mouth|mouth]] and stating a phrase that is intended to be difficult to say clearly with a filled mouth. The game is often played where marshmallows are readily available, such as around a [[campfire]]. Variations include similar-sounding phrases such as '''Fluffy Bunny''', '''Fuzzy Bunny''', and '''Chubby Monkey'''.

Although the origins of the game are unknown, a 1959 ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip shows [[Snoopy]]'s mouth being filled with an increasing number of marshmallows while Charlie Brown keeps count.{{Original research inline|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1959/02/28|title=Peanuts by Charles Schulz for Feb 28, 1959 - GoComics.com|date=28 February 1959|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
In the game, each participant usually places a marshmallow into their mouth and says 'chubby bunny'. If they are able to state the whole phrase, usually in a comprehensible manner that the other participants wholly concur to, they pass that round. Each successful player then adds an additional marshmallow to the ones already in his or her mouth and repeats the phrase. A player who fails to complete the phrase is eliminated from the game. The process continues until only one player remains. After the penultimate player loses the game, the winning player might have to place one more marshmallow into his or her mouth and may have to state the phrase once more. The winner of the game is the player who fits the most marshmallows into his or her mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/parental/chubbybunny.asp |title=Chubby Bunny Death |work=Snopes.com |first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson |date=2006-09-15 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A183520|title=Fluffy Bunnies&amp;nbsp;— the Game|date=1999-10-13|work =h2g2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some variants of the game require the winner to actually ingest the marshmallows.

== Cases of deaths ==
At least two people have died of [[asphyxiation|suffocation]] from choking on marshmallows.

On June 4, 1999, 12-year-old Catherine "Casey" Fish died after choking on four marshmallows while playing Chubby Bunny. The contest was scheduled for the annual Care Fair held at Hoffman Elementary School in [[Chicago]]'s [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]] area. It was to be supervised, but Casey and some of her friends began playing while the teacher was momentarily away. She collapsed, and was taken to Glenbrook Hospital, where she died a few hours later. Fish's parents subsequently sued the school district and appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to warn about the dangers of Chubby Bunny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/chubby_bunny|title= Glenview Elementary School District 34|accessdate=2007-05-21 |date=2005-06-05|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]], reposted by Online Legal Marketing Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesh.medill.northwestern.edu/mnschicago/archives/2005/05/chubbun_a_civil.html |title=Civil trial begins in 'Chubby Bunny' death |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Medill News Service |publisher=[[Medill School of Journalism]] |date=2005-05-26 |last=Keating |first=David J |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226175438/http://mesh.medill.northwestern.edu/mnschicago/archives/2005/05/chubbun_a_civil.html |archivedate=February 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pedsccm.org/RARE/Chubby_bunny.html|title= "The Chubby Bunny Game" May Be Hazardous To Your Patients' Lives|accessdate=2007-05-21 |date=1999-08-24|last=Hageman|first=Joseph R|work=PedsCCM.org|publisher=Illinois Pediatrician, reposted by PedsCCM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2006, Janet Rudd, 32, from [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] died in a Chubby Bunny competition at the [[Western Fair]]. [[St John Ambulance]] volunteers initially came to Rudd's aid prior to the arrival of Paramedics from Thames EMS. The paramedics arrived with equipment including a [[defibrillator]] and suction devices, but were unable to remove the blockage in the unconscious woman's throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2006/09/14/1839411-sun.html |title=Woman who choked on marshmallow dies |work=London Free Press |first=Joe |last=Matyas |accessdate=2008-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061019131144/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2006/09/14/1839411-sun.html |archivedate=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hockey match, Crystal Palace skating rink, Montreal, QC, 1881.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hockey match,&lt;br&gt;Crystal Palace skating rink, 1881]]
The '''Crystal Palace''' was an [[exhibition hall]] built for the Montreal Industrial Exhibition of 1860, originally located at the foot of Victoria Street (one block west of University) between [[Sainte Catherine Street|Sainte-Catherine]] and Cathcart Streets, then relocated to [[Fletcher's Field]]. It was used for temporary exhibitions, and in winter, housed an ice skating rink.

==Construction==
The building was designed by [[Montreal]] architect John William Hopkins. It had an iron framework, a tinned [[barrel-vaulted]] [[nave]] and two galleries, each twenty feet wide, extending all the way around the interior. Its design was inspired by [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]]. Its main facades were of iron and glass. Its side walls were of white brick with rose-coloured contrast, with the iron and wood elements painted to match the brick. Its [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] were subdivided by three [[arch]]es, with only the centre arch [[glazing (window)|glazed]]. Constructed in 20-foot modules, the Crystal Palace was intended to be 180 x 200 feet, but  was constructed with shorter [[transept]]s, reducing its dimensions to 180 x 120 feet.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sextondigital.library.dal.ca/jssac/PDFs/Bulletin/Vol_19/vol19_no1_OCR_150dpi_PDFA1b.pdf|last=Graham|first=Fern E.M.|title=The Crystal Palace in Canada|journal=Bulletin|date=March 1995|volume=19|issue=1|accessdate=25 December 2011|page=9|publisher=[[Society for the Study of Architecture in Canada]]|issn=0228-0744|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426071904/http://sextondigital.library.dal.ca/jssac/PDFs/Bulletin/Vol_19/vol19_no1_OCR_150dpi_PDFA1b.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1860 Industrial Exhibition==
The Industrial Exhibition displayed agricultural and industrial products from the then [[British North America]]. The displays ranged from minerals, native woods, seeds and grains, preserved birds and fish, oils and foodstuffs to textiles and leather goods, furniture, clothing, machinery, iron work, tools and crafts. As part of the exhibition the Art Association of Montreal, the future [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], organized a display of Canadian art. The [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] visited Montreal that year and officially opened the exhibition.

==Skating rink==
The large open space of the exhibition hall was suitable for other uses. In later years, the hall would house a natural ice skating rink in the winter, and was one of the first indoor skating rinks in Canada. The skating rink was used by [[McGill University]] students to play [[ice hockey]] and the rink is the site of the first known photograph of ice hockey players in hockey uniforms, taken in 1881.

The rink also housed the Crystal Skating Club and Crystal Hockey Club, more commonly known as the [[Montreal Crystals]] which played men's senior-level amateur hockey in the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]].

==Relocation and fire==
In 1878 it was dismantled and moved to Fletcher's Field, part of which is now known as [[Jeanne-Mance Park]]. In July 1896, the Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire, as London's original [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bootsnall.com/namericatravelguides/montreal/feb02wonder.shtml |title=Montréal's Eighth Wonder of the World |accessdate=2008-02-19 |last=Goldman |first=Norman |publisher=BootsnAll:The Ultimate Source for the Independent Traveller}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=ab776de7-b136-480c-8837-c239f2e8917e Gazette article, "Flames devoured one of the city's most glittering landmarks"]&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the Crystal Palace, between Mont-Royal Avenue and Saint-Joseph Boulevard, was developed for housing a few years after the fire.

The original downtown location later was home to the Palace Theatre, a movie house, and today contains an alley named Ruelle Palace.

'''De Grolsch Veste''' ({{IPA-nl|də ˈɣrɔls ˌfɛstə}},&lt;ref&gt;''Veste'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|ˈvɛstə|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-en|The [[Grolsch]] Fortress}}, previously known as ''Arke Stadion'' {{IPA-nl|ˈɑrkə ˌstaːdijɔn|}}) is the stadium of [[Association football|football]] club [[FC Twente]]. It is located in [[Enschede]], Netherlands, at the Business &amp; Science Park, near the [[University of Twente]]. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of 30,205 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences around the stands. It hosted the final of the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/womenseuro/news/newsid=2285476.html|title=Women's EURO 2017 schedule announced|first=|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
De Grolsch Veste replaced the old [[Diekman Stadion]] as [[FC Twente]]'s home ground on 22 March 1998. Plans had been afoot to expand and to renovate the old and now demolished Diekman Stadion. However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the [[FC Twente]] fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of previous [[FIFA]] regulations which imposed a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post.

The cost of the construction is estimated to have been around 33 million [[Dutch guilder|guilders]] and it took fourteen months to complete, with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed in such a way that future expansions would be possible without the necessity to tear down entire stands.

The first match played at the stadium was a 3–0 victory by the home team against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on 10 May 1998 in an [[Eredivisie]] match. The first goal in the new stadium was scored in the 14th minute by FC Twente player [[Chris De Witte]].

On 1 October 2006, the stadium was updated with two big flatscreen video-walls.

In May 2008 the Arke Stadion was renamed to De Grolsch Veste with beer brewery [[Grolsch]] as sponsor. The brewery is located in the club's hometown [[Enschede]]. The name "Veste" (fortress) is a reference to [[Groenlo]], a former fortified town that was often besieged and where [[Grolsch]] was first brewed.

On 5 September 2009 for the first time ever an international (friendly) match was played in the [[FC Twente]] stadium when the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] beat [[Japan]] 3–0.

===Expansion===
In 2006 plans were unfolded to increase the stadium capacity to 24,000 seats. The expansion started in January 2008 and was completed in September 2008, just in time for the start of the 2008–2009 season.

[[FC Twente]] is aiming to start a new phase in the stadium expansion in the summer of 2011 which will result in a capacity of 32,000 seats.

As part of the combined [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] bid&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebid.org/?lang=nl&lt;/ref&gt; to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the stadium was one of five stadiums in the Netherlands selected by the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] to host games. This would mean that the stadium capacity needed to be expanded to the minimum required seating of 44,000.

The city of [[Enschede]] announced on 11 September 2009 that it would officially be a candidate city and that it would fully support [[FC Twente]]'s ambition to expand the stadium capacity to the minimum required seating of 44,000. In December 2009, [http://www.iaa-architecten.nl/ IAA Architecten] released computer generated images of the proposed 44,000+ stadium with an arched 3rd tier, to complete the main stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i-aa.nl/ventura/?888_1257,fc_twente_village_enschede.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710010717/http://www.i-aa.nl/ventura/?888_1257,fc_twente_village_enschede.htm |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roof collapse===
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}
The Grolsch Veste was expanded during the summer of 2011. On 7 July, when working on the construction of the stand, the roof suddenly collapsed, killing two workers and injuring 14 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14063640|title=Dutch roof collapse kills workers|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse was probably caused by too much weight on the unfinished roof. After an investigation of a month, the roof was taken away and work continued. [[FC Twente]] played the first few competition matches partly without a roof. The new stadium was officially opened on 29 October with a competition match against [[PSV Eindhoven]] (2-2). A year after the accident, a monument was unveiled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9214">[[File:Kevin Faulk.jpg|thumb|right|A fair catch of a punt in American football]]
A '''fair catch''' is a feature of [[American football]] and several other [[football|codes of football]], in which a player attempting to catch a ball kicked by the opposing team – either on a [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]] or [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]] – is entitled to catch the ball without interference from any member of the kicking team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/faircatch&lt;/ref&gt; A ball caught in this manner becomes [[dead ball|dead]] once caught, i.e., the player catching the ball is not entitled to run with the ball in an attempt to gain yardage, and the receiving team begins its [[Glossary of American football#drive|drive]] at the spot where the ball was caught. A player wishing to make a fair catch signals his intent by extending one arm above his head and waving it while the kicked ball is in flight. The kicking team must allow the player an opportunity to make the catch without interference.

The primary reason for the fair catch rule is to protect the receiver.  A receiver directs his attention toward the incoming punt and cannot focus on the defenders running towards him.  He is quite vulnerable to injury and is also at risk for fumbling or muffing the kicked ball if the punter intentionally makes a high short kick to allow defenders time to hit the receiver. A second reason for a fair catch, on a punted ball, is to prevent the ball from rolling toward the receiving team's goal and being downed deep in the team's own territory.

The [[XFL]] removed the fair catch in an effort to attract fans who disliked the rule. [[Canadian football]] and [[arena football]] also do not have fair catch rules, with the XFL and Canadian football preferring a five-yard "no-yards" rule instead.

In [[rugby union]] and [[Australian rules football]], a loose equivalent to a fair catch is called a ''mark''; see [[mark (rugby)]] and [[mark (Australian football)]] for more information (however in Australian Rules Football the player is not protected from the opposition team while attempting a mark). Fair catches featured in some extinct forms of football, and they have been abolished in other modern codes. In [[Rugby League]] the defensive player attempting to catch the ball cannot be tackled whilst in the air, though the attacking players can contest the ball by attempting to catch it themselves. A player who successfully catches the ball is able to be tackled only once they have landed on the ground. A player who does not leave the ground in attempting to catch the ball is able to be tackled as soon as the ball is caught.

== American football ==

In American football, a member of the team receiving a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] or [[Kickoff (American football)|kick]], may signal for a "fair catch". This is the receiver's choice in which he gives up the right to advance the ball in exchange for protection from being tackled when he is focusing on the incoming ball and thus vulnerable to serious injury.

To signal a fair catch the receiver must raise one arm fully above his head and wave it from side to side while the ball is in flight. If the receiver fails to give a proper signal (arm not fully extended) the receiving team is penalized five yards for an invalid fair catch signal, marked from the spot of the signal, and the player is not protected from being tackled.

An opponent tackling or making any contact with a receiver who has given a fair catch signal is guilty of a personal foul carrying a 15-yard penalty.  If the interference is deemed flagrant, the kicking team member can also be ejected from the game.

If the receiver attempts to advance the ball after signalling for a fair catch he is penalized five yards for "delay of game", because the fair caught ball becomes dead once caught.

Regardless of whether a fair catch signal is made, no opponent may interfere with anyone attempting to catch the kicked ball, his path to the ball, or with the flight of the ball.  This is the foul of "Kick Catching Interference" which is a "personal foul" carrying a 15-yard penalty.  If the interference is deemed flagrant, the kicking team member can also be ejected from the game.

A player signaling for a fair catch is not required to catch the ball; however, after making the signal, he may not initiate contact with any member of the kicking team until the ball is touched by another player. If he does he will be penalized 15 yards for [[unsportsmanlike conduct]]. If the ball hits the ground or a member of the kicking team, the fair catch is off and rules for kicked balls apply. If the receiver "muffs" the ball (touches it, but then fails to obtain control of the ball), then the ball can be recovered by either team once the ball touches the ground.

A fair catch may be followed by a [[snap (football)|snap]] or a type of free kick &amp;mdash; the [[fair catch kick]] &amp;mdash; at his team's choice, and an expired playing period may be extended if the free kick is chosen.  The [[NCAA]] abolished the fair catch from its version of American football in 1950, but restored it in 1951, minus the option of kicking from the mark of the catch, which is retained in rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations and the [[National Football League]]. 

If the kicking team commits kick catching interference on a returner who has given a valid fair catch signal, the receiving team retains the right to a fair catch kick from the yard line where the ball is spotted following the penalty. 

The fair catch signal can be used as a legal form of deception: If the receiver has no intention of actually fielding the ball, but wishes it to roll into the [[end zone]] for a [[touchback]], he may signal for a fair catch in front of where the ball will land, making the kicking team think it will not reach the end zone.

A fair catch on a kickoff return is used primarily on short kickoffs to prevent a ball kicked high in the air from being recovered by the kicking team. Since the 2018 college football season, fair catches are now commonly employed on kickoffs that do not reach the end zone, but are perceived (for whatever reason) as having little potential for a successful return. This was the result of an NCAA rule change which treats a fair catch on a kickoff between the receiving team's goal line and 25-yard line as a touchback, with the ball being placed on the 25.

== Other games ==
{{see also|Mark (rugby)|Mark (Australian rules football)}}
Various forms of football descended from certain English school football games of the 19th century have had a fair catch. It was abolished early in the development of soccer, then in the middle of the 20th century by [[Canadian football]], and slightly later by [[rugby league]]. Forms of football retaining a form of fair catch (also called "[[Mark (rugby)|mark]]") include American (outdoor), [[rugby union]], and [[Australian rules football|Australian rules]]. The American-invented intramural games [[Speedball (American ball game)|speedball]] and [[speed-a-way]] have some of the flavor of the original fair catch, which was to allow handling of the ball in games where handling was otherwise forbidden. Australian rules, speedball, and speed-a-way do not require that the kick be from an opponent. American football requires that the catcher signal in advance, as did Canadian football before that game abolished the fair catch. Rugby union requires a player to signal a fair catch by catching the ball and shouting "Mark!".

In some forms of football a player fielding an opponent's kick must be given a certain circular unobstructed space around him in which to do so by either some or all opponents. In rugby union, rugby league, and Canadian football this applies only against members of the kicking team who are offside, and applies whether the ball is in the air, bouncing, or rolling.  In Arena Football, there is no fair catch; however all members of the kicking team must refrain from penetrating the five-yard line in coverage, but only while the ball is in the air.

The various games differ as to the conditions under which a fair catch will be awarded &amp;mdash; for example, whether the ball must be caught "cleanly", i.e. without juggling.  Rugby union requires a clean catch.  American football allows the ball to be juggled, but not to be intentionally batted forward to improve the position of the catch (as for a free kick at goal).  Australian rules is most generous, allowing unlimited hand play with the ball before it is caught, and allowing the kick to be from any other player, regardless of team (however, the ball must have travelled 15 metres) and the ball can even be dropped so long as the player is deemed to have sufficient control of its fall.  In the 19th century in rugby, and into the 20th in American and Canadian football, a fair catch was allowed from certain kicks of a teammate—a punt-out or punt-on.

'''Memorial Stadium''' is an outdoor athletic stadium in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], used mostly for American football, ultimate and soccer, located in the northeast corner of the [[Seattle Center]] grounds. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 12,000; this was temporarily expanded to 17,000 during 1974–75, while the [[Seattle Sounders (1974–83)|Seattle Sounders]], of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]], played at Memorial Stadium, before moving to the newly constructed [[Kingdome]]. Similarly, an [[USL First Division|A-League]] reincarnation of the Sounders franchise played at Memorial Stadium, before moving to [[CenturyLink Field|Qwest/CenturyLink Field]]. It currently hosts [[Seattle School District]] high school football games and adult recreational leagues, and is the home field for [[Seattle Reign FC]] of the [[National Women's Soccer League]]&lt;ref name=Reign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundersfc/2014/02/06/reign-fc-confirms-its-new-home-will-be-seattle-memorial-stadium/ |title=Reign FC confirms its new home will be Seattle Memorial Stadium |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |at=Sounders FC Blog |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seattle Cascades (AUDL)|Seattle Cascades]] of the [[American Ultimate Disc League]].

==History==
[[File:Leon H. Brigham Field (2891578894).jpg|thumb|left|Leon H. Brigham Field on Memorial Stadium scoreboard]]
The stadium was designed by Seattle architect George W. Stoddard, also known for his work on the [[Green Lake Aqua Theater]] and the south stands of [[Husky Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George W. Stoddard|url=http://www.dahp.wa.gov/learn-and-research/architect-biographies/george-w|website=Washington State Department of Archaeology &amp; Historic Preservation|accessdate=13 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714115056/http://www.dahp.wa.gov/learn-and-research/architect-biographies/george-w|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium opened on September 26, 1947, during a "jamboree" featuring eight of the city's high school football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duff |first=Jim |date=September 25, 1947 |title=High School Jamboree Set For Tomorrow Night; Eight High Schools To See Action In Memorial Stadium |page=21 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial Stadium was dedicated later that year in memory of the Seattle youth who gave their lives in World War II. A memorial wall at the east end is inscribed with the names of over 700 fallen individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecenter.com/locations/detail.aspx?id=59 |title=Live At Seattle Center |publisher=Seattlecenter.com |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the stadium hosted first widespread local television broadcast in the Puget Sound region, the Turkey Day high school football game between [[West Seattle High School|West Seattle]] and [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]].&lt;ref name=PIthanksgiving&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNerthney|first1=Casey|title=P-I archive: Seattle's biggest Thanksgiving football games|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2010/11/25/p-i-archive-seattles-biggest-thanksgiving-football-games/|website=Seattle P-I|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was the venue for much of the opening ceremonies for the [[Century 21 Exposition]], a [[World's Fair]] held in Seattle in 1962. In 1967, it became the first high school stadium in the country to install [[artificial turf]].&lt;ref name=PImemorable&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guzman|first1=Monica|title=Memorable moments from Memorial Stadium|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2008/02/26/memorable-moments-from-memorial-stadium/|website=Seattle P-I|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wcptocp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XFdYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6867%2C1140705 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |title=Husky coach puts team on "carpet" |date=October 19, 1967 |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the scoreboard was replaced and the field was rededicated as "Leon H. Brigham Field", in tribute to the long-time high school football coach who pushed to build Memorial Stadium while serving as the Seattle School District's first Director of Athletics.&lt;ref name=TimesWatson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Emmett|title=Dynamic Coach Leon Brigham Was Years Ahead Of His Time|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921126&amp;slug=1526823|accessdate=13 June 2014|publisher=Seattle Times|date=26 November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnfafootball.org/leonbrigham.htm |title=Leon Brigham |publisher=Gnfafootball.org |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Seattle School District and the city of Seattle announced plans to build a new high school and stadium at Seattle Center in response to major population growth in downtown Seattle. While no timetable has been set for construction, and no site has yet been chosen, the current Memorial Stadium site was seen as a likely location for the new project because the city and school district had agreed in 2009 that the current stadium should be torn down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/city-and-school-district-will-partner-to-build-high-school-stadium-in-seattle-center/ |title=Seattle and school district will partner to build high school, stadium at Seattle Center |first=Scott |last=Greenstone |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=August 4, 2017 |accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Tenants==
The facility is not operated by the Seattle Center itself, but is owned by the Seattle School District and still serves as the "home field" for some high school football games played within the district. Memorial Stadium also hosted the first AAA (now 4A) state championship game for [[high school football]] in 1973, the first year of the state playoff system.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IJJYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UvgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5055%2C3051984  Spokane Daily Chronicle]'' – State poises for opening of playoffs – November 9, 1973 – p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The top-ranked Wenatchee Panthers were upset by the [[Kentridge High School|Kentridge]] Chargers, 26–24. Entering the title game, Wenatchee had given up just seven points all season and had been the top team in the state polls for four years.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5qdYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qPgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4860%2C2673792 Spokane Daily Chronicle]'' – Kentridge stops Panthers' reign – November 24, 1973 – p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as hosting two iterations of the Sounders franchise, Memorial Stadium has served as home to several other pro and semi-pro sports teams. The [[Seattle Majestics]], a [[women's American football]] team, played home games at Memorial Stadium from 2007 to 2009 before moving to [[French Field (Kent, Washington)|French Field]] in nearby Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Steve|title=Seattle Majestics: Real women, playing real football|url=http://www.federalwaymirror.com/sports/42222052.html|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=Federal Way Mirror|date=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 2014 season, Memorial Stadium became the home to Seattle's NWSL soccer team, Seattle Reign FC. The stadium's capacity is limited to 6,000 for Reign matches.&lt;ref name=Reign /&gt; As of 2015, the AUDL's Seattle Cascades use the stadium for the majority of their home games. In addition, the stadium hosts adult recreational league soccer and flag football.

Memorial Stadium serves as the finish for the Amica Insurance [[Seattle Marathon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlemarathon.org/amica-insurance-seattle-marathon/#marathon-course-info-maps {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123202436/http://www.seattlemarathon.org/amica-insurance-seattle-marathon/ |date=November 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is also used periodically for concerts, particularly in connection with festivals held at the Center, like [[Bumbershoot]].&lt;ref name="PImemorable" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010349160_memorialstadium25m.html Seattle Times]'' – Seattle Center, schools reach pact to tear down Memorial Stadium – November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">'''Le Mondial la Marseillaise à Pétanque''' is an international tournament of [[pétanque]]. It is held every year in July in [[Marseille]], the biggest city in the south of [[France]].  The central location of the event is in the [[Parc Borély]], but it now extends to many other parks and boulodromes in and around the city.  In 2016, the 55th Mondial attracted around 15,000 participants and 150,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mondialapetanque.com/, the official website of the event&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mondial was first held in July 1961 with the support of the daily newspaper ''La Marseillaise'', after which the event is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondialapetanque.com|title="Mondial la Marseillaise à Pétanque" - 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost from the beginning it was strongly suppored by Paul Ricard, the founder of '''Ricard''', the company famous for the Ricard brand of [[pastis]].  For many years Michel Montana has been ''Président de l'association du Mondial La Marseillaise à Pétanque'' and the guiding spirit behind the event.

Note that the name of the even is Mondial "à" Pétanque, not Mondial "de" Pétanque.  The word "pétanque" comes from the provençal expression ''à pèd tanca'' which means "on planted feet". In French, one says "on planted feet" (''à pieds planté'') just as one says "on one's knees" (''à genoux''). So the name of the event is Mondial "à" Pétanque&amp;mdash; not Mondial "de" Pétanque.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.20minutes.fr/marseille/1641347-20150628-pourquoi-faut-parler-mondial-petanque-petanque, ''Pourquoi il faut parler du Mondial « à » Pétanque et pas « de » Pétanque''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16990">'''Muscle fatigue''' is the decline in ability of a [[muscle]] to generate [[force]]. It can be a result of vigorous [[Physical exercise|exercise]] but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of [[muscle contraction]]. There are two main causes of muscle fatigue: the limitations of a [[nerve]]’s ability to generate a sustained [[Action potential|signal]] (neural fatigue) and the reduced ability of the [[muscle fiber]] to contract (metabolic fatigue).

==Muscle contraction==
{{main|Muscle contraction}}
Muscle cells work by detecting a [[Action potential|flow]] of electrical impulses from the [[brain]] which signals them to [[Muscle contraction|contract]] through the release of [[calcium]] by the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]].  Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves.

==Nervous fatigue==
[[Nerve]]s are responsible for controlling the contraction of muscles, determining the number, sequence and force of muscular contraction.  Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring [[pathological]] nervous fatigue, is seldom an issue. But in extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, nervous fatigue (enervation), in which the nerve signal weakens, can be a limiting factor in untrained individuals.

In novice [[strength training|strength trainers]], the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve’s ability to sustain a high-frequency signal.  After a period of maximum contraction, the nerve’s signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes.  There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply ‘stop listening’ and gradually cease to move, often [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|going backwards]].  As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] following the workout.

Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with its greatest force.  It is this neural training that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit.  Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrilar or sarcoplasmic [[Muscle hypertrophy#Strength training|hypertrophy]] and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.

==Metabolic fatigue==
Though not universally used, ‘metabolic fatigue’ is a common term for the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of two main factors:
# Shortage of fuel ([[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]]) within the [[muscle fiber]]
# Accumulation of substances ([[metabolite]]s) within the muscle fiber, which interfere either with the release of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) or with the ability of calcium to stimulate muscle contraction.

===Substrates===
[[Substrate (biochemistry)|Substrates]] within the muscle serve to power muscular contractions.  They include molecules such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), [[glycogen]] and [[Phosphocreatine|creatine phosphate]].  ATP binds to the [[myosin]] head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ that results in contraction according to the [[Sliding filament mechanism|sliding filament model]].  Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds.  Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of [[glucose]], used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing [[lactic acid]] as a metabolic byproduct.

Substrate shortage is one of the causes of metabolic fatigue. Substrates are depleted during exercise, resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions.  In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.

===Metabolites===
Metabolites are the substances (generally waste products) produced as a result of muscular contraction.  They include [[chloride]], [[potassium]], [[lactic acid]], [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[reactive oxygen species]], and [[inorganic phosphate]].  Accumulation of metabolites can directly or indirectly produce metabolic fatigue within muscle fibers through interference with the release of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or reduction of the sensitivity of contractile molecules [[actin]] and [[myosin]] to calcium.

====Chloride====
Intracellular [[chloride]] partially inhibits the contraction of muscles. Namely, it prevents muscles from contracting due to "false alarms", small stimuli which may cause them to contract (akin to [[myoclonus]]).  This natural brake helps muscles respond solely to the conscious control or [[stretch reflex|spinal reflexes]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but also has the effect of reducing the force of conscious contractions.

====Potassium====
High concentrations of [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) also causes the muscle cells to decrease in efficiency, causing cramping and fatigue. Potassium builds up in the [[t-tubule]] system and around the muscle fiber as a result of [[action potentials]]. The shift in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; changes the membrane potential around the muscle fiber. The change in membrane potential causes a decrease in the release of [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name="Silverthorne2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dee Unglaub Silverthorn|title=Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach|year=2009|publisher= Pearson|edition = 5th|isbn= 0321559800|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lactic acid====
It was once believed that [[lactic acid]] build-up was the cause of muscle fatigue.&lt;ref name="pmid3471061"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sahlin K | title = Muscle fatigue and lactic acid accumulation | journal = Acta Physiol Scand Suppl | volume = 556 | issue = | pages = 83–91 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3471061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assumption was lactic acid had a "pickling" effect on muscles, inhibiting their ability to contract.  Though the impact of lactic acid on performance is now uncertain, it may assist or hinder muscle fatigue.

Produced as a by-product of [[lactic acid fermentation|fermentation]], lactic acid can increase intracellular acidity of muscles.  This can lower the sensitivity of contractile apparatus to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; but also has the effect of increasing [[cytoplasm]]ic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration through an inhibition of the [[sodium-calcium exchanger|chemical pump]] that [[Active transport|actively transports]] calcium out of the cell.  This counters inhibiting effects of potassium on muscular action potentials.  Lactic acid also has a negating effect on the chloride ions in the muscles, reducing their inhibition of contraction and leaving potassium ions as the only restricting influence on muscle contractions, though the effects of potassium are much less than if there were no lactic acid to remove the chloride ions.  Ultimately, it is uncertain if lactic acid reduces fatigue through increased intracellular calcium or increases fatigue through reduced sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Lactic acid is now used as a measure of endurance training effectiveness and VO2 max.&lt;ref name="pmid26136542"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lundby C, Robach P | title = Performance Enhancement: What Are the Physiological Limits? | journal = Physiology (Bethesda) | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–92 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26136542 | doi = 10.1152/physiol.00052.2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Pathology==
Muscle weakness may be due to problems with the [[neuropathy|nerve supply]], [[neuromuscular disease]] (such as [[myasthenia gravis]]) or problems with muscle itself. The latter category includes [[polymyositis]] and other [[myopathy|muscle disorders]].

==Molecular mechanisms==
Muscle fatigue may be due to precise molecular changes that occur ''in vivo'' with sustained exercise. It has been found that the [[ryanodine receptor]] present in skeletal muscle undergoes a [[conformational change]] during exercise, resulting in "leaky" channels that are deficient in [[calcium]] release. These "leaky" channels may be a contributor to muscle fatigue and decreased exercise capacity.&lt;ref name="pmid18268335"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellinger AM, Reiken S, Dura M, Murphy PW, Deng SX, Landry DW, Nieman D, Lehnart SE, Samaru M, LaCampagne A, Marks AR | title = Remodeling of ryanodine receptor complex causes "leaky" channels: a molecular mechanism for decreased exercise capacity | journal = Proc.

==Effect on performance==
Fatigue has been found to play a big role in limiting performance in just about every individual in every sport.  In research studies, participants were found to show reduced voluntary force production in fatigued muscles (measured with concentric, eccentric, and isometric contractions), vertical jump heights, other field tests of lower body power, reduced throwing velocities, reduced kicking power and velocity, less accuracy in throwing and shooting activities, endurance capacity, anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power, mental concentration, and many other performance parameters when sport specific skills are examined.&lt;ref name="pmid21425889"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knicker AJ, Renshaw I, Oldham AR, Cairns SP | title = Interactive processes link the multiple symptoms of fatigue in sport competition | journal = Sports Med | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 307–28 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21425889 | doi = 10.2165/11586070-000000000-00000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18608847"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery PG, Pyne DB, Hopkins WG, Dorman JC, Cook K, Minahan CL | title = The effect of recovery strategies on physical performance and cumulative fatigue in competitive basketball | journal = J Sports Sci | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 1135–45 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18608847 | doi = 10.1080/02640410802104912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9459539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linnamo V, Häkkinen K, Komi PV | title = Neuromuscular fatigue and recovery in maximal compared to explosive strength loading | journal = Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol | volume = 77 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 176–81 | date = 1998 | pmid = 9459539 | doi = 10.1007/s004210050317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19834352"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smilios I, Häkkinen K, Tokmakidis SP | title = Power output and electromyographic activity during and after a moderate load muscular endurance session | journal = J Strength Cond Res | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 2122–31 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 19834352 | doi = 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a5bc44  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9459539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linnamo V, Häkkinen K, Komi PV | title = Neuromuscular fatigue and recovery in maximal compared to explosive strength loading | journal = Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol | volume = 77 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 176–81 | date = 1998 | pmid = 9459539 | doi = 10.1007/s004210050317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16720888"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Girard O, Lattier G, Micallef JP, Millet GP | title = Changes in exercise characteristics, maximal voluntary contraction, and explosive strength during prolonged tennis playing | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 521–6 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16720888 | pmc = 2465109 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2005.023754  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromyography==
[[Electromyography]] is a research technique that allows researchers to look at muscle recruitment in various conditions, by quantifying electrical signals sent to muscle fibers through motor neurons.  In general, fatigue protocols have shown increases in EMG data over the course of a fatiguing protocol, but reduced recruitment of muscle fibers in tests of power in fatigued individuals.  In most studies, this increase in recruitment during exercise correlated with a decrease in performance (as would be expected in a fatiguing individual).&lt;ref name="pmid21284370"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carneiro JG, Gonçalves EM, Camata TV, Altimari JM, Machado MV, Batista AR, Guerra Junior G, Moraes AC, Altimari LR | title = Influence of gender on the EMG signal of the quadriceps femoris muscles and performance in high-intensity short-term exercise | journal = Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 50 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 326–32 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21284370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12576411"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark BC, Manini TM, Thé DJ, Doldo NA, Ploutz-Snyder LL | title = Gender differences in skeletal muscle fatigability are related to contraction type and EMG spectral compression | journal = J.

Median power frequency is often used as a way to track fatigue using EMG. Using the median power frequency, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the first window may be the first second, the second window might be at second 15, and the third window could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. Some reasons why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22067242"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jakobsen MD, Sundstrup E, Andersen CH, Zebis MK, Mortensen P, Andersen LL | title = Evaluation of muscle activity during a standardized shoulder resistance training bout in novice individuals | journal = J Strength Cond Res | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 2515–22 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22067242 | doi = 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31823f29d9  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21986694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sundstrup E, Jakobsen MD, Andersen CH, Zebis MK, Mortensen OS, Andersen LL | title = Muscle activation strategies during strength training with heavy loading vs. repetitions to failure | journal = J Strength Cond Res | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 1897–903 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 21986694 | doi = 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318239c38e  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21696871"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardozo AC, Gonçalves M, Dolan P | title = Back extensor muscle fatigue at submaximal workloads assessed using frequency banding of the electromyographic signal | journal = Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon) | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 971–6 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21696871 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2011.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23211923"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollman JH, Hohl JM, Kraft JL, Strauss JD, Traver KJ | title = Does the fast Fourier transformation window length affect the slope of an electromyogram's median frequency plot during a fatiguing isometric contraction? | journal = Gait Posture | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–4 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23211923 | doi = 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2012.10.028  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oakland Baseball Park 1913.jpeg|thumb|Oakland Baseball Park from The San Francisco Call on February 16, 1913]]
'''Oaks Park''', formally known as the '''Oakland Baseball Park''', and at times nicknamed '''Emeryville Park''', was a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Emeryville, California]].  It was primarily used for [[baseball]], and was the home field of the [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]] [[Pacific Coast League]] baseball team.  It opened in 1913 and held 7,000 people.  The Oaks played there until 1955.
[[File:OaksBallparkPlaque2.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Plaque commemorating Oakland Ball Park.]]

The ballpark was located within the city limits of Emeryville, between Oakland and Berkeley. The site was on the block bounded by 45th Street (north, first base); [[San Pablo Avenue]] (east, third base); Park Avenue (south, left field); and Watts Street (west, right field). The stadium did not front directly on San Pablo where a strip of various small commercial buildings stood, now replaced by a single one-story commercial building with several chain businesses.

Oaks Park was highly accessible, as a major [[streetcar line]] ran on San Pablo Avenue, and a station serving several of the [[Key System]]'s transbay commuter rail lines existed a few blocks south at Yerba Buena Avenue.

The Oaks had been playing most of their home games (except Thursdays and Sunday mornings) at [[Recreation Park (San Francisco)|Recreation Park]] in San Francisco, starting when that new ballpark opened in 1907. Even after moving back to Oakland, the Oaks would play a number of games each year in San Francisco. PCL founding father [[J. Cal Ewing]] owned both the Oaks and the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] from 1903 until sometime in the 1920s, at which point the Oaks began playing all their games in Oakland.

The park was not well maintained in its later years, causing a steep decline in attendance. These factors forced the Oaks to move to Vancouver in 1956. That move proved prescient, as the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] moved to San Francisco two years later and would have likely displaced the Oaks in any event.

Until recently, the site of the park was partly an empty, fenced-off lot, with [[Pixar|Pixar Studios]] overlapping it where Watts Street used to run through.  Currently{{when|date=March 2018}} it is part of the Phase II of Pixar Studios expansion and will be a parking lot with a public bicycle path and park on the San Pablo side of the property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">'''Open-hand strikes''' include various techniques used in the [[martial arts]] to attack or defend without curling the hand into a fist.  The most famous of these techniques is probably the so-called "[[karate chop]]", which is also described as a knife-hand strike (''shuto uchi'') although there are many other techniques.

Some of these are:
# techniques that use the edge of the hand closest to the little finger or use the opposite edge of the hand:  A knife-hand strike may be delivered along an arc somewhere midway between vertical and horizontal, usually with the aim of numbing an attacker's forearm. 
# techniques that use the other edge of the hand (ridge hand strike) are more difficult to execute since care has to be taken to position the thumb so that it will not be injured. Performing this move in a way that is powerful will generally involve striking with the palm facing down. And so doing will mean that, e.g., the person using this strike will attack the left side of his opponent's body with the right knife hand, or ''vice versa''.
# spear-hand attacks are performed by keeping the extended fingers tightly compressed together and thrusting directly into some target of relatively small diameter, such as the throat.  In many types of karate it is referred to as a "nukite".
# the back of the hand (back hand strike - haishu uchi), with the fingers loosely curled, can be used in an upward-arcing strike to the [[groin]].
# the cupped hands can be used in unison to attack the ears, potentially damaging the opponent's eardrums. This is one application of the palm strike. 
# In a palm strike, the heel of the hand can be used to strike a target without fear of damaging the knuckles.  This is referred to in Okinawan styles as a Teisho or Shotei strike.

One of the greatest advantages of an open-hand strike is the ability to quickly grab the opponent to perform a follow-up, such as a throw or a pull into another strike.  The extra control this affords as compared to a punch is worth the larger risk of damage to the hand or fingers.

'''Potter County Memorial Stadium''' is a baseball-only [[stadium]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. It was most recently home to the [[Texas AirHogs]], a professional baseball team and member of the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball|American Association]], and the [[West Texas A&amp;M Buffaloes]] [[college baseball|baseball]] team, which is a member of the [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] [[Lone Star Conference]]. It was home to the [[Amarillo Dillas]] of [[United League Baseball]] until 2010.  It broke ground in 1948, and opened in 1949. It is nicknamed ''Dilla Villa'', dating back prior to [[Amarillo National Bank]]'s purchase of naming rights when the Dillas made their first appearance in Amarillo in 1994.

Following the 2016 season it was announced the AirHogs would not be returning to Amarillo citing “deplorable” field conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.amarillo.com/news/local-news/2016-10-13/going-going-gone#|date=October 13, 2016|title=Going, going, gone: Amarillo loses its minor league team|first1=Lance|last1=Lahnert|first2=Donald R.|last2=Winslow|publisher=Amarillo Globe-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Dilla era==
The Potter County Memorial Stadium was home to several [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] baseball clubs before hosting the modern Amarillo Dillas squad. In PCMS's first season to host baseball, the Amarillo Gold Sox were in business. The Gold Sox would spend 1959&amp;ndash;1965 and 1976&amp;ndash;1982 hosting AA professional baseball in the [[Texas League]]. The Gold Sox had also played in Class A and B leagues in 1955&amp;ndash;1958.

==Stadium features==
There are several features of the Amarillo National Bank Dilla Villa that are architecturally unique. The stadium however is one of the few classic stadiums left from the older baseball era and unfortunately is dealing with its share of difficulties.

===Seating===
The Amarillo National Dilla Villa seats 8,500 people, with three levels of seating. It features 17 field level box seat sections. Situated just above the box seats, are the club level seats. These seats range from sections A to M, and house the better majority of the stadiums seats. The stadium features two general admission bleacher sections on the first and third base sides. Directly behind home plate in the upper level are 4 levels of luxury boxes used for groups and parties. On either side of the home plate luxury boxes are sections of the blue fold down seats, the only covered seats that are fold down. Aside from the main grandstand, metal bleachers and box seats sit further down the third base line, and a party deck further down the first base line.

[[File:Dillavilla2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dilla Villa against Edinburg in 2007.]]

===Concourse===
The Dilla Villa houses one of the few non-major league stadiums in the country to have an upper and lower level concourse. The lower level concourse is the major one, leading to the main grandstand. It also houses 5 concession stands, 2 bars, and a souvenir shop. The upper level concourse is only accessible from the upper level, or from two staircases at the front of the ballpark. The concourse houses a beer stand, a concession stand, and the stadiums' bathrooms. No smoking is allowed in the ballpark, but there is a designated section behind the metal bleachers along the third base line.

===Problems===
The Potter County Memorial Stadium underwent a major renovation in the winter of 2005, replacing many of the badly needed renovations. The Central League's Dillas left behind many problems that the United League's Dillas successfully tackled. [[File:Potter County Memorial Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Before the renovations in 2006.]] Numerous seats in the stands were broken, cracked, or were stolen. Bleachers in the upper section had been separated and the paint was chipped. The grass was in poor shape, and the field itself was in bad shape. The backstop behind home plate was wooden, and was also rotting, and there were also numerous holes in the nets. Despite easily redoing these problems for the United League team, problems have begun to plague the Dillas.

====Scoreboard====
The Dillas were left with a barely active, older electronic scoreboard, which was in use back in the early 1990s. They made do with the scoreboard until the 2007 season, in which they bought a smaller, standard scoreboard just displaying score, inning, and strike-ball-out counts. Before the 2008 season began, a circuit board was stolen out of the scoreboard, which made it inoperable. The manufacturer would not sell the Dillas a new one because the scoreboard had never been paid for. Nonpayment of the scoreboard was due to the [[bankruptcy]] of the ULB's President Bradley Wendt.

====Electricity====
Several problems have existed with the field lighting fixtures and the concourse lighting at the Dilla Villa. Problems became apparent after a game between the Dillas and the Coyotes was cancelled after hurricane-like weather blew in. That night, two of the transformers powering the Dilla Villa exploded. Afterwards, three subsequent games were cancelled due to light failures at the stadium.

==New stadium==
Rumors of a new ballpark being built along the [[Interstate 27]] and Hollywood Road parts of Amarillo have been spurred by the serious advancement in the revitalization of downtown [[Amarillo, Texas]]. Several case studies were conducted on whether or not a new ballpark would be feasible in downtown Amarillo. The study revealed that a multipurpose event venue such as a ballpark would be a feasible investment. Some rendering of a possible downtown set-up have shown a ballpark just south of the [[Amarillo Civic Center]] at 8th Avenue and Buchanan St. A ballpark, along with many other projects, have become serious discussion and construction could take place as soon as 2016.

The '''Republic of Ireland national beach soccer team''' has represented the [[Republic of Ireland]] in international [[beach soccer]] competitions, under the control of the [[Football Association of Ireland]], the governing body for football in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. After competing in the 2001 and 2002 seasons in the [[Euro Beach Soccer League]] and [[Euro Beach Soccer Cup|Cup]], the team has been inactive since. 

A number of notable former [[association footballers]] took part in the time the team was active, including former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United]] forward, [[Frank Stapleton]], and former [[Blackburn Rovers]] manager, [[Owen Coyle]] who in 2015 recalled his participation with fondness whilst commenting on the difficulty of adapting to a sand surface having played his career on grass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/owen-coyle-hoping-scotland-and-ireland-can-qualify-1-3795711&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5204">'''Skishing''' is a variant on [[seawater|saltwater]] shorefishing that involves wearing a buoyant [[wetsuit]] and swimming out from shore with flippers to fish with rod and reel (typically a [[surfcasting]] rod), often using live eels. It is practiced as a means of getting further out to sea in order to increase the chances of catching a fish and can be dangerous. The term skishing is a [[portmanteau]] of water-skiing and fishing because when hooked the stripers pull the angler through the water.&lt;ref&gt;"Skishing; Extreme bass fishing, in which anglers don wetsuits and flippers and, with a rod tucked under and arm, swim a couple of hundred yards offshore, typically on moonlit nights, to cast live eels while drifting with the current. The term is a cross between skiing and fishing, because when you hook a big striper, it typically pulls you along as if you were skiing." [https://books.google.com/books?id=HscDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Skishing%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Skishing%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false Skishing] Best Life Nov 2006 page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Skishing has been described as extreme surfcasting.&lt;ref&gt;John Waldman [https://books.google.com/books?id=_bAWeHAHih8C&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Skishing%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Skishing%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false 100 Weird Ways to Catch Fish] Skishing Page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

One enthusiast of skishing believes that "hard core" surf casters aren't fond of the activity and consider it cheating.&lt;ref&gt;David Dibenedetto [https://books.google.com/books?id=nOeP_sCyFAgC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Skishing%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Skishing%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false New York: Gone Skishing] On the Run: An Angler's Journey Down the Striper Coast page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Skishing was the subject of an article in ''Forbes'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Skishing"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/1027/202.html "Skishing"] ''Forbes'', 27 October 2008. "Combine fishing, swimming and water skiing and you get a most peculiar sport."&lt;/ref&gt; The activity was invented by Paul Melnyk, a cabinet maker from [[Montauk, New York]]. Melnyk, has explained that the activity is similar of skiing because "if you hook a fish over thirty pounds, it will generally take you for a ride".&lt;ref&gt;Anne H. Soukhanov. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/05/wordwatch.htm Word Watch]". ''The Atlantic Online''. May 2000. Retrieved on August 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of skishing on Stripercoast Surfcasters&lt;ref name="Skishing"&gt;http://www.stripercoastsurfcasters.us/forum/showthread.php?t=628&lt;/ref&gt; web forum as told by Jacob Freeman.

" It really has to be experienced to be understood, but it's definitely not for everyone. I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not at least a little crazy. But for me, skishing is to surfcasting, as a hurricane is to a windy day.

To be immersed in the element that holds your quarry, bass sometimes swimming so close to you that you can kick them, feeling the raw power of a big bass pull you around, wrestling one on one with a big fish in their element is unreal. They don't give up when they're still in the water, and you can't lift a big bass out of the water when you're swimming, so it can become a friggen wrestling match until you get your hook out if the fish is still green. I always crush the barbs of my hooks for an easier release anyway, so sometimes you can just give them some slack and they'll release themselves if it's just a lip hook. With an 11' rod, you really have a lot more leverage than most would think, and with some practice you can horse a fish in (or pull yourself closer to it) rather quickly.

Skishing also provides the surfcaster with access to many very fishy areas that are not accessible from shore or frequented by boats due to the hazardous rocks and reefs. How many times have you been standing on a rock or on the beach and the fish are busting beyond your casting range? That's frustrating. Skishing lets you get out to where they are."

SKISHING description by Paul Melnyk - Montauk, N.Y.: "It was an extraordinary feeling for me to be floating weightless in this dynamic sea, and I felt as thought I had shed every pound of excess baggage as I rode the tide . . . Fighting a substantial fish while swimming is a unique experience. A balance must be achieved between the hunter and the prey. Any variation to this equilibrium causes a loss of control as the fish pulls. I was kicking hard to keep myself upright, fighting the fish while using my whole body as leverage. . . A swarm of splashing bodies soon surrounded me." &lt;ref&gt;[Montauk Confidential: A Fisherman's Memoir by Paul Melnyk June 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium''', previously known as '''Pacific Memorial Stadium''', was a 28,000-seat outdoor [[multi-purpose stadium]] in the [[Western United States|western]] [[United States]], located on the campus of the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] in [[Stockton, California]]. The home venue of the [[Pacific Tigers]] was constructed in 1950 for [[Pacific Tigers football|football]] and later hosted women's [[College soccer|soccer]]; it was closed in 2012 and demolished two years later.

==Construction==
Pacific Memorial Stadium was built {{Years or months ago|1950}} in 1950 after the successful fund drive which netted $165,000.  Most of this money was through the sale of pre-ordered tickets (scrip), which were usable over a 10-year period.  Construction began on the earth-filled structure in May 1950.  Astonishingly, it was finished on time for the home opener (fifth game of the season) on October 21, a build time of less than six months.

The stadium originally seated 35,975 with room for expansion to over 44,000, but renovations reduced the capacity to a configuration of 28,000. It was the venue for a 1997 friendly match between the [[Brazil National Football Team]] and the [[Honduras National Football Team]]. Notably [[Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima]] commonly or simply known as Ronaldo, scored 6 goals as Brazil ran out 8–2 winners.
==Upgrades==
The [[Pacific Club]], which was added to the east-side of the stadium in 1973, was donated by [[Alex Spanos]] at a cost of $250,000.  It sat up to 300, featuring glass walls and a great view of the stadium.  When not in use for sporting events, it also held many university functions and gatherings.  The scoreboard in the north end zone was erected in 1982 at a cost of $140,000 and measured {{convert|35|by|17|ft}}.

Thanks to donations from athletic boosters, lighting power at the stadium was upgraded from 35 to 75 [[foot-candle|footcandles]] in August 1986.

==Renaming==
Pacific Memorial Stadium was officially renamed in 1988, to Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium on October 15, to honor [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]].  He ended his coaching career at "College of the Pacific" in 1946 and donated the land for the stadium to be built in 1950. Stagg is widely regarded as a pioneer in the development of sport, not only in football, but also in basketball and baseball.

==Closure==
On February 26, 2012, the university announced it would close Stagg Memorial Stadium to conduct a feasibility study to assess needed repairs, upgrades and changes required to make the facility meet modern standards in conjunction with a financial assessment to determine if the stadium could be repaired or if it should be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifictigers.com/genrel/Stagg_Stadium_to_Close_While_University_Conducts_Feasiblity_Study|title=Stagg Stadium to Close While University Conducts Feasiblity Study|publisher=Pacifictigers.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition==
The university began removal of Stagg Memorial Stadium on February 24, 2014, to make room for new athletics facilities, including a dedicated tennis center with 12 courts and a clubhouse, and new fields for soccer and field hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/Newsroom/2014/February-2014/Stagg-Stadium-removal-to-begin.html|title=Stagg Stadium removal to begin; new Athletics facilities coming this fall|publisher=Pacific.edu|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Pacific field hockey home game on the new turf field at University of the Pacific was played on September 12, 2014 versus the [[University of Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://calendar.pacific.edu/event/field_hockey_vs_albany#.VLMQY6bfZHA|title=Field Hockey first home game on new field|work=University of the Pacific|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groundbreaking ceremony for the Eve Zimmerman Tennis Center was held on October 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/Newsroom/2014/October-2014/Former-Tiger-Tennis-ace-helps-celebrate-new-tennis-complex.html|title=Former Tiger Tennis ace helps celebrate new tennis complex|publisher=Pacific.edu|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
{{main|Pacific Tigers football}}
The stadium was home to the [[Pacific Tigers football]] program, beginning in 1950, until it was discontinued following the [[1995 Pacific Tigers football team|1995]] season.  For many years it was also the home football field for nearby [[Stagg High School (Stockton, California)|Stagg High School]].  The stadium was the sole home to the [[Pacific Tigers women's soccer|women's soccer]] team until its closure in 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3630">[[File:Steghose gold1.JPG|thumb|Stirrup pants designed as sportswear.]]
'''Stirrup pants''' (or stirrup leggings) are a type of close-fitting ladies' pant that tapers at the ankle, similar to leggings, except that the material extends to a band, or strap, that is worn under the arch of the foot to hold the pant leg in place. The band of material is often elasticized to prevent the material around the foot from tearing. Stirrup pants were originally sportswear for women, and remain sportswear for horse riding and skiing. However, they have come in and out of fashion during the 20th and early 21st centuries, peaking in popularity as street fashion during the 1980s.

==History==
Stirrup pants were first worn as jodhpurs for horse riders. The purpose of the strap under the foot was to hold the pant legs in place in the boots of the rider. As ladies moved away from riding sidesaddle, they began wearing riding breeches in the 1920s in a similar style to those worn by men. By 1934, [[Jodhpurs]] as riding pants with foot straps were being advertised in the United States mail order catalogue for [[Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum|first=Stella|title=Everyday Fashions of the Thirties As Pictured in Sears Catalogs|year=1986|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25108-0|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse riding  breeches are still made with an elastic foot strap in some designs. Stirrup pants for skiing were introduced at the [[1936 Winter Olympic Games]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hewitt, Valerie |author2=Ann Kellogg |author3=Lynn Payne |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History, 1900 to the Present: Volume 1, 1900-1949|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33395-8|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirrup stretch pants were a mainstay of ski wear for both men and women during most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s.  In the 1960s this style was used for women's and girls' stirrup pants. They were popular for several years as shown in clothing catalogs of the day, such as J.C. Penny, Sears, and Montgomery Ward.

Stirrup pants became a popular casual fashion for women in Europe and America from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. In 1985, Linda Pender wrote in ''Cincinnati Magazine'' that stirrup pants were "being touted as ''the'' wardrobe basic of the year, and ''every''body is buying them". On the one hand, the style was promoted as being "easy to wear" and giving "most figures a long, lean line"; on the other hand, a salesclerk pointed out to Pender that the style was not flattering unless the wearer was "slim and fit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pender|first=Linda|title=Cruel Pants: The unkindest cut of all|newspaper=Cincinnati Magazine|date=October 1985|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leggings in general became fashionable streetwear during the 1980s, as did sweatshirts, leg warmers, and other items that originated in sports and dance studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condra, Jill. Ed.|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History: Volume 3, 1801 to the Present|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33665-2|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 2010 on, stirrup pants, stretch or not, have become just another style of pants for use by women and men for sports, running or general wear.

'''Street Soccer USA''' is a [[non-profit organization]] under the umbrella of HELP USA that promotes the growth and development of a national network of grassroots soccer programs. As of 2010, SSUSA has 18 teams across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://avidsoccer.com/blog/index.php/2010/06/15/epl-soccer-stars-demonstrate-that-ending-homelessness-is-a-team-sport-by-training-homeless-teens-in-la/comment-page-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Street Soccer USA is the United States base partner of the [[Homeless World Cup]] and the host of the [[Street Soccer USA Cup]] every year. The tournament began in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2006, and was moved to [[Washington D.C.]] in 2008 and has since been hosted in New York City - Times Square, San Francisco - Civic Center Plaza and Philadelphia Art Museum Steps. Street Soccer USA was started as part of the [[Urban Ministry Center]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]

==History==
Lawrence Cann, a young social entrepreneur, founded Art Works Football Club in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2004.  In just a few years, the program grew to a 16 city league of programs across the country and Street Soccer USA was born and later became its own 501(c)3 organization in 2010.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Additionally, Street Soccer USA is the official partner of the [[Homeless World Cup]] founded by Mel Young, and responsible for organizing the United States participation in the annual Homeless World Cup.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Since 2005, SSUSA has brought a team of homeless soccer players to the annually-hosted Homeless World Cup.

'''University of Denver Arena''' was a 5,200-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in the [[Western United States|western]] [[United States]], in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. It was home to the [[University of Denver]] [[Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey|Pioneers ice hockey]] team, and also hosted several [[Frozen Four]]s.  It was razed in 1997 to make room for the $75 million [[Magness Arena]], part of the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness, which opened in 1999.

The structure was originally a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] drill hall in [[Idaho Panhandle|northern]] [[Idaho]], built in the early 1940s at [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] at [[Lake Pend Oreille]].&lt;ref name=fgfdurin&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y69WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1ugDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3886%2C4423831 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |last=Missildine|first=Harry|title=Farragut furnished DU rink|date=May 27, 1963|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was donated after [[World War II]] and reassembled on the DU campus in 1948–49 to house the new ice hockey program and served for nearly half a century.

The arena was refurbished in 1972–73 when the roof needed repairs, and 14 seven-ton steel trussess were added to shore up the roof. Additional patchwork renovations were added in the 1990s, prior to razing the building in 1997. The best known features of the arena were the steep bleacher balcony at the south end, and the 1970s rainbow painted on the north end wall. Famous hockey games held there include the NCAA ice hockey finals in 1961, 1964, and 1976.

'''Velòdrom d'Horta''' is a [[velodrome]] located in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It was the [[Cycling at the 1992 Summer Olympics|track cycling]] venue for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and was also the venue for the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in [[1984 UCI Track Cycling World Championships|1984]].

The velodrome, designed by Esteve Bonell and Francesc Rius, was built in 1984 as the first of Barcelona's construction projects in preparation for the bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics in 1986. It was the first velodrome built to new FIAC rules permitting a {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} track if surfaced with wood. The building won the FAD architecture prize in 1985.

It was the last permanent open-air velodrome used for Olympic Track Cycling events (Atlanta's velodrome at Stone Mountain in 1996 was temporary). Olympic velodromes have been built with a roof since 2000.
