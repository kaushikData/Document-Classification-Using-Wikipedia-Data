'''5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid''' ('''5-HETE''', '''5(''S'')-HETE''', or '''5''S''-HETE''') is an [[eicosanoid]], i.e. a metabolite of [[arachidonic acid]]. It is produced by diverse cell types in humans and other animal species. These cells may then metabolize the formed 5(''S'')-HETE to [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] (5-oxo-ETE), 5(''S''),15(''S'')-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S''),15(''S'')-diHETE), or 5-oxo-15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE). 

5(''S'')-HETE, 5-oxo-ETE, 5(''S''),15(''S'')-diHETE, and 5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE, while differing in potencies, share a common mechanism for activating cells and a common set of activities. They are therefore a family of structurally related metabolites. Animal studies and a limited set of human studies suggest that this family of metabolites serve as [[hormone]]-like [[autocrine signalling|autocrine]] and [[paracrine signalling]] agents that contribute to the up-regulation of acute [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[allergic]] responses. In this capacity, these metabolites may be members of the [[innate immune system]]. 

''[[In vitro]]'' studies suggest that 5(''S'')-HETE and/or other of its family members may also be active in promoting the growth of certain types of cancers, in simulating bone reabsorption, in signaling for the secretion of [[aldosterone]] and [[progesterone]], in triggering [[parturition]], and in contributing to other responses in animals and humans. However, the roles of 5(''S'')-HETE family members in these responses as well as in inflammation and allergy are unproven and will require much further study. 

Among the 5(''S'')-HETE family members, 5(''S'')-HETE takes precedence over the other members of this family because it was the first to be discovered and has been studied far more thoroughly. However, 5-oxo-ETE is the most potent member of this family and therefore may be its critical member with respect to [[physiology]] and [[pathology]]. 5-OxoETE has gained attention in recent studies. 
 
== Nomenclature ==
5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid is more properly termed 5(''S'')-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid or 5(''S'')-HETE) to signify the (''S'') [[Chirality (chemistry)|configuration]] of its 5-[[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] residue as opposed to its 5(''R'')-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (i.e., 5(''R'')-HETE) [[stereoisomer]]. Since 5(''R'')-HETE was rarely considered in the early literature, 5(''S'')-HETE was frequently termed 5-HETE. This practice occasionally continues. 5(''S'')-HETE's [[IUPAC]] name, (5''S'',6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'')-5-hydroxyicosa-6,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid, defines 5(''S'')-HETE's structure unambiguously by notating not only its ''S''-hydroxyl chirality but also the [[cis–trans isomerism]] geometry for each of its 4 [[double bond]]s; E signifies trans and Z signifies cis double bond geometry. The literature commonly uses an alternate but still unambiguous name for 5(''S'')-HETE viz., 5''(S)''-hydroxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.

== History of discovery ==
The Nobel laureate, [[Bengt I. Samuelsson]], and colleagues first described 5(''S'')-HETE in 1976 as a metabolite of arachidonic acid made by rabbit [[neutrophils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borgeat P, Hamberg M, Samuelsson B | title = Transformation of arachidonic acid and homo-gamma-linolenic acid by rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Monohydroxy acids from novel lipoxygenases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 251 | issue = 24 | pages = 7816–20 | date = December 1976 | pmid = 826538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological activity was linked to it several years later when it was found to stimulate human neutrophil rises in cytosolic calcium, [[chemotaxis]], and increases in their cell surface adhesiveness as indicated by their aggregation to each other.&lt;ref name="pmid1668115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossi AG, O'Flaherty JT | title = Bioactions of 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate and its interaction with platelet-activating factor | journal = Lipids | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 1184–8 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1668115 | doi=10.1007/bf02536528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a previously discovered arachidonic acid metabolite made by neutrophils, [[leukotriene B4]] (LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), also stimulates human neutrophil calcium rises, chemotaxis, and auto-aggregation and is structurally similar to 5(''S'')-HETE in being a 5-(''S'')-hydroxy-eicosateraenoate, it was assumed that 5-(''S'')-HETE stimulated cells through the same [[cell surface receptor]]s as those used by (LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) viz., the [[leukotriene B4 receptor]]s. However, further studies in neutrophils indicated that 5-(''S'')-HETE acts through a receptor distinct from that used by LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as well as various other neutrophil stimuli. This 5(''S'')-HETE receptor is termed the [[oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]] (abbreviated as (OXER1).&lt;ref name="W Powell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Taylor JS, Thomas MJ | title = Receptors for the 5-oxo class of eicosanoids in neutrophils | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 49 | pages = 32535–41 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9829988 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.49.32535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biochemistry, biology and chemistry of the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-ETE | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 44 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 154–83 | date = Mar 2005 | pmid = 15893379 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2005.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5''(S)''-HETE Production ==
5(S)-HETE is a product of the cellular metabolism of the n-6 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], arachidonic acid (i.e. 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), by [[ALOX5]] (also termed arachidonate-5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, 5-LO, and 5-LOX). ALOX5 metabolizes arachidonic acid to its [[hydroperoxide]] derivative, [[arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide]] i.e. 5''S''-hydroperoxy-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(''S'')-HpETE). 5-(''S'')-HpETE may then be released and rapidly converted to 5(''S'')-HETE by ubiquitous cellular [[peroxidase]]s:
&lt;center&gt;
Arachidonic acid) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 5(''S'')-HpETE → 5(''S'')-HETE&lt;/center&gt;
Alternatively, 5(''S'')-HpETE may be further metabolized to its [[epoxide]], 5(6)-oxido-eicosatetraenoic acid viz., [[leukotriene A4]] (i.e. ''S'',6''S''-oxido-7''E'',9''E'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid). Leukotriene A4 may then be further metabolized either to [[leukotriene B4]] by [[leukotriene A4 hydrolase]] or to [[leukotriene C4]] by [[leukotriene C4 synthase]]. Finally, leukotriene C4 may be metabolized to [[leukotriene D4]] and then to [[leukotriene E4]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rådmark O, Werz O, Steinhilber D, Samuelsson B | title = 5-Lipoxygenase, a key enzyme for leukotriene biosynthesis in health and disease | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 331–9 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25152163 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative amounts of these metabolites made by specific cells and tissues depends in large part on the relative content of the appropriate enzymes.

The selective synthesis of 5(''S'')-HETE (i.e. synthesis of 5(''S'')-HETE without concurrent synthesis of 5(''R'')-HETE) by cells is dependent on, and generally proportionate to, the presence and levels of its forming enzyme, ALOX5. Human ALOX5 is highly expressed in cells that regulate [[innate immunity]] responses, particularly those involved in [[inflammation]] and [[allergy]]. Examples of such cells include [[neutrophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[B lymphocytes]], [[monocytes]], [[macrophages]], [[mast cells]], [[dendritic cells]], and the monocyte-derived [[foam cells]] of [[atherosclerosis]] tissues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; ALOX5 is also expressed but usually at relatively low levels in many other cell types. The production of 5''(S'')-HETE by these cells typically serves a physiological function. However, ALOX5 can become overexpressed at high levels in certain types of human cancer cells such as those of the prostate, lung, colon, colorectal and pancreatic as a consequence of their [[malignant transformation]]. In these cells, the ALOX5-dependent production of 5''(S)''-HETE appears to serve a pathological function viz., it promotes the growth and spread of the cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osher E, Weisinger G, Limor R, Tordjman K, Stern N | title = The 5 lipoxygenase system in the vasculature: emerging role in health and disease | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 252 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 201–6 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16647809 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28125014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore GY, Pidgeon GP | title = Cross-Talk between Cancer Cells and the Tumour Microenvironment: The Role of the 5-Lipoxygenase Pathway | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | page = 236| year = 2017 | pmid = 28125014 | pmc = 5343774 | doi = 10.3390/ijms18020236 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishayee K, Khuda-Bukhsh AR | title = 5-lipoxygenase antagonist therapy: a new approach towards targeted cancer chemotherapy | journal = Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 709–19 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23752617 | doi = 10.1093/abbs/gmt064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22002716"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider C, Pozzi A | title = Cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 277–94 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22002716 | pmc = 3798028 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-011-9310-3 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

5(''S'')-HETE may also be made in combination with 5(''R'')-HETE along with numerous other ''(S,R)''-hydroxy [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s as a consequence of the non-enzymatic oxidation reactions. Formation of these products can occur in any tissue subjected to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="pmid24056189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 651–65 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24056189 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001 | pmc=5710732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7258296"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Thomas MJ, Lees CJ, McCall CE | title = Neutrophil-aggregating activity of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids | journal = The American Journal of Pathology | volume = 104 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–62 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7258296 | pmc = 1903737 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5''(S)''-HETE metabolism ==
In addition to its intrinsic activity, 5(''S'')-ETE can serve as an intermediate that is converted to other bioactive products. Most importantly, [[5-Hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase]] (i.e. 5-HEDH) converts the 5-hydroxy residue of 5''(S)''-HETE to a [[ketone]] residue to form [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] (i.e. 5-oxo-6''E'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoate, abbreviated as 5-oxo-ETE). 5-HEDH is a reversibly acting [[NADP+|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[NADPH]]-dependent enzyme that catalyzes to following reaction:

&lt;center&gt;
5''(S)''-HETE + [[NADP+|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; 5-oxo-ETE + [[NADPH]]&lt;/center&gt;

5-HEDH acts bi-directionally: it preferentially oxygenates 5''(S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE in the presence of excess NADH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; but preferentially reduces 5-oxo-ETE back to 5(''S'')-HETE in the presence of excess NADPH. Since cells typically maintain far higher levels of NADPH than NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, they usually make little or no 5-oxo-ETE. When undergoing [[oxidative stress]], however, cells contain higher levels of NADH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; than NADPH and make 5-oxo-ETE preferentially. Additionally, [[in vitro]] studies indicate that cells can transfer their 5''(S'')-HETE to cells that contain high levels of 5-NEDH and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore convert the transferred 5''(S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE. It is suggested that 5-oxo-ETE forms preferentially [[in vivo]] under conditions of [[oxidative stress]] or conditions where [[ALOX5]]-rich cells can transfer their 5''(S)''-HETE to cells epithelial, endothelial, dendritic, and certain (e.g. prostate, breast, and lung) cancer cells which display little or no ALOX5 activity but have high levels of 5-NEDH and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Since 5-oxo-ETE is 30- to 100-fold more potent than 5(''S'')-HETE, 5-HEDH main function may be to increase the biological impact of 5-HETE production.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;

*An [[acyltransferase]] to [[ester]]ify 5(''S'')-HETE into their membrane [[phospholipids]]. This reaction may serve to storing 5(''S'')-HETE for its release during subsequent cell stimulation and/or alter the properties of cell membranes in functionally important ways. 
*A [[cytochrome P450]], probably [[CYP4F3]], to metabolize 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-(''S''),20-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5,20-diHETE).

*[[ALOX15]] to metabolize 5(''S'')-HETE to 5-(''S''),15-(''S'')-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5,15-diHETE). 5,15-diHETE is ~3- to 10-fold weaker than 5(''S'')-HETE in stimulating cells.

== Mechanism of action ==
=== The OXER1 receptor ===
5-(''S'')-HETE family members share a common receptor target for stimulating cells that differs from the receptors targeted by the other major products of ALOX5, i.e., [[leukotriene B4]], [[leukotriene C4]], [[leukotriene D4]], [[leukotriene E4]], [[lipoxin]] A4, and [[lipoxin]] B4. It and other members of the 5-(''S'')-HETE family stimulate cells primarily by binding and thereby activating a dedicated [[G protein-coupled receptor]], the [[oxoeicosanoid receptor 1]] (i.e. OXER1, also termed the OXE, OXE-R, hGPCR48, HGPCR48, or R527 receptor).&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Rossi AG | title = 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate stimulates neutrophils by a stereospecific, G protein-linked mechanism | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 268 | issue = 20 | pages = 14708–14 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8392058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  OXER1 couples to the [[G protein]] complex composed of the [[Gi alpha subunit]] (Gαi) and [[G beta-gamma complex]] (Gβγ); when bound to a 5-(''S'')-HETE family member, OXER1 triggers this G protein complex to dissociate into its Gαi and Gβγ components with Gβγ appearing to be the component responsible for activating the signal pathways which lead to cellular functional responses.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  The cell-activation pathways stimulated by OXER1 include those mobilizing calcium ions and activating [[MAPK/ERK]], [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases]], cytosolic [[phospholipase A2]], [[PI3K]]/[[Akt]], and [[protein kinase C]] beta and epsilon.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 651–65 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24056189 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001 | pmc=5710732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative potencies of 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-15(''S'')-HETE, 5-(''S'')-HETE, 5-(''S''),15-(''S'')-diHETE, 5-oxo-20-hydroxy-ETE, 5-(''S''),20-diHETE, and 5,15-dioxo-ETE in binding to, activating, and thereby stimulating cell responses through the OXER1 receptor are ~100, 30, 5-10, 1-3, 1-3, 1, and &lt;1, respectively.&lt;ref name="W Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Cordes JF, Lee SL, Samuel M, Thomas MJ | title = Chemical and biological characterization of oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1201 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–15 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7803484 | doi = 10.1016/0304-4165(94)90083-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other receptors ===
Progress in proving the role of the 5-HETE family of agonists and their OXER1 receptor in human physiology and disease has been made difficult because mice, rats, and the other rodents so far tested lack OXER1. Rodents are the most common [[in vivo]] models for investigating these issues. OXER1 is expressed in non-human primates, a wide range of other mammals, and various fish species and a model of allergic airways disease in cats, which express OXER1 and make 5-oxo-ETE, has recently been developed for such studies.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"/&gt; In any event, cultured mouse MA-10 [[Leydig cell]]s, while responding to 5-oxo-ETE, lack OXER1. It is suggested that this cell's, as well as mouse and other rodent, responses to 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by a receptor closely related to OXER11 viz., the mouse [[niacin receptor 1]], Niacr1. Niacr1, an [[ortholog]] of OXER1, is a G protein-coupled receptor for [[niacin]], and responds to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.003"/&gt; It has also been suggested that one or more of the mouse hydroxycarboxylic acid (HCA) family of the G protein-coupled receptors, HCA1 ([[GPR81]]), HCA2 ([[GPR109A]]), and HCA3 ([[GPR109B]]), which are G protein-coupled receptors for fatty acids may be responsible for rodent responses to 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.003"/&gt; It is possible that human cellular responses to 5-oxo-ETE and perhaps its analogs may involve, at least in isolated instances, one or more of these receptors.

=== PPARγ ===
5-Oxo-15(S)-hydroxy-ETE and to a lesser extent 5-oxo-ETE but not 5-(''S'')-HETE also bind to and activate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPARγ). Activation of OXER1 receptor and PPARγ by the oxo analogs can have opposing effects on cells. For example, 5-oxo-ETE-bound OXER1 stimulates while 5-oxo-ETE-bound PPARγ inhibits the proliferation of various types of human cancer cell lines.&lt;ref name="Biochim.

=== Other mechanisms ===
5-(''S'')-HETE acylated into the [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]s fraction of human neutrophil membranes is associated with the inhibition of these cells from forming [[neutrophil extracellular traps]], i.e. extracellular DNA scaffolds which contain neutrophil-derived antimicrobial proteins that circulate in blood and have the ability to trap bacteria. It seems unlikely that this inhibition reflects involvement of OXER1.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark SR, Guy CJ, Scurr MJ, Taylor PR, Kift-Morgan AP, Hammond VJ, Thomas CP, Coles B, Roberts GW, Eberl M, Jones SA, Topley N, Kotecha S, O'Donnell VB | title = Esterified eicosanoids are acutely generated by 5-lipoxygenase in primary human neutrophils and in human and murine infection | journal = Blood | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 2033–43 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21177434 | pmc = 3374621 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2010-04-278887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-Oxo-ETE relaxes pre-contracted human bronchi by a mechanism that does not appear to involve OXER1 but is otherwise undefined.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17499751"/&gt;

== Clinical significance ==

=== Inflammation ===
5(''S'')-HETE and other family members were first detected as products of arachidonic acid made by stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils ([[Polymorphonuclear neutrophil|PMN]]), a leukocyte blood cell type involved in host immune defense against infection but also implicated in aberrant pro-inflammatory immune responses such as arthritis; soon thereafter they found to be active also in stimulating these cells to migrate (i.e. chemotaxis), degranulate (i.e. release the anti-bacterial and tissue-injuring contents of their granules), produce bacteriocidal and tissue-injuring [[reactive oxygen species]], and mount other pro-defensive as well as pro-inflammatory responses of the [[Innate immune system]]. For example, the [[gram-negative bacterium]], [[Salmonella tryphimurium]], and the outer surface of gram negative bacteria, [[Lipopolysaccharide]], promote the production of 5-(''S'')-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE by human neutrophils. The family members stimulate another blood cell of the [[innate immunity]] system, the human [[monocyte]], acting synergistically with the pro-inflammatory [[CC chemokines]], [[monocyte chemotactic protein-1]] and monocyte chemotactic protein-3, to stimulate monocyte function.  5-Oxo-ETE also stimulates two other cell types that share responsibility with the PMN for regulating inflammation, the human [[lymphocyte]] and [[dendritic cell]]. And, in vivo studies, the injection of 5-oxo-ETE into the skin of human volunteers causes the local accumulation of PMN and monocyte-derived [[macrophages]].&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;  Furthermore, the production of one or more 5(''S'')-HETE family members as well as the expression of orthologs of the human OXER1 receptor occur in various mammalian species including dogs, cats, cows, sheep, elephants, pandas, opossums, and ferrets and in several species of fish; for example, cats undergoing experimentally induced asthma accumulate 5-oxo-ETE in their lung lavage fluid, feline leucocytes make as well as respond to 5-oxo-ETE by an oxer1-dependent mechanism; and an OXER1 ortholog and, apparently, 5-oxo-ETE are necessary for the inflammatory response to tissue damage caused by osmolarity insult in [[zebrafish]].&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Enyedi B, Kala S, Nikolich-Zugich T, Niethammer P | title = Tissue damage detection by osmotic surveillance | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1123–30 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23934216 | pmc = 3826879 | doi = 10.1038/ncb2818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cossette C, Gravel S, Reddy CN, Gore V, Chourey S, Ye Q, Snyder NW, Mesaros CA, Blair IA, Lavoie JP, Reinero CR, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline granulocytes | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26032638 | pmc = 4830392 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2015.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These results given above suggest that members of the 5-oxo-ETE family and the OXER1 receptor or its orthologs may contribute to protection against microbes, the repair of damaged tissues, and pathological inflammatory responses in humans and other animal species.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014" /&gt;  However, an OXER1 ortholog is absent in mice and other rodents; while rodent tissues do exhibit responsiveness to 5-oxo-ETE, the lack of an oxer1 or other clear 5-oxoETE receptor in such valued animal models of diseases as rodents has impeded progress in our understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of 5-oxo-ETE.&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"/&gt;

=== Allergy ===
The following human cell types or tissues that are implicated in allergic reactivity produce 5-HETE (stereoisomer typically not defined): alveolar macrophages isolated from asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients, [[basophils]] isolated from blood and challenged with anti-IgE antibody, [[mast cells]] isolated from lung, cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells, isolated human pulmonary vasculature, and allergen-sensitized human lung specimens challenged with specific allergen.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant GE, Rokach J, Powell WS | title = 5-Oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 89 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 98–104 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19450703 | pmc = 2906239 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2009.05.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, cultured human airway epithelial cell lines, normal bronchial epithelium, and bronchial smooth muscle cells convert 5-(''S'')-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE in a reaction that is greatly increase by oxidative stress, which is a common component in allergic inflammatory reactions.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt; Finally, 5-HETE is found in the [[bronchoalveolar lavage fluid]] of asthmatic humans and 5-oxo-ETE is found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of cats undergoing allergen-induced bronchospasm.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochem Pharmacol 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dworski R, Fitzgerald GA, Oates JA, Sheller JR | title = Effect of oral prednisone on airway inflammatory mediators in atopic asthma | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 149 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 953–9 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8143061 | doi = 10.1164/ajrccm.149.4.8143061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 5-HETE family of metabolites, 5-oxo-ETE is implicated as the most likely member to contribute to allergic reactions.  It has exceptionally high potency in stimulating the [[chemotaxis]], release of granule-bound tissue-injuring enzymes, and production of tissue-injuring reactive oxygen species of a cell type involved in allergic reactions, the human [[eosinophil granulocyte]].&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;  It is also exceptionally potent in stimulating eosinophils to activate cytosolic phospholipase A2 ([[PLA2G4A]]) and possibly thereby to form [[platelet-activating factor]] (PAF) as well as metabolites of the 5-HETE family.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Kuroki M, Nixon AB, Wijkander J, Yee E, Lee SL, Smitherman PK, Wykle RL, Daniel LW | title = 5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoate is a broadly active, eosinophil-selective stimulus for human granulocytes | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 157 | issue = 1 | pages = 336–42 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8683135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PAF is itself a proposed mediator of human allergic reactions which commonly forms concurrently with 5-HETE family metabolites in human leukocytes and acts synergistically with these metabolites, particularly 5-oxo-ETE, to stimulate eosinophils.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chilton FH, O'Flaherty JT, Walsh CE, Thomas MJ, Wykle RL, DeChatelet LR, Waite BM | title = Platelet activating factor.

The role of 5-HETE family agonists in the [[bronchoconstriction]] of airways (a hallmark of allergen-induced asthma) in humans is currently unclear.  5-HETE stimulates the contraction of isolated human bronchial muscle, enhances the ability of histamine to contract this muscle, and contracts guinea pig lung strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Copas JL, Borgeat P, Gardiner PJ | title = The actions of 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE on tracheobronchial smooth muscle | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–14 | date = February 1982 | pmid = 6952280 | doi = 10.1016/s0262-1746(82)80002-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-Oxo-ETE also stimulates contractile responses in fresh bronchi, cultured bronchi, and cultured lung smooth muscle taken from guinea pigs but in direct contrast to these studies is reported to relax bronchi isolated from humans.&lt;ref name="pmid17499751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin C, Sirois M, Echave V, Gomes MM, Rousseau E | title = Relaxing effects of 5-oxo-ETE on human bronchi involve BK Ca channel activation | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 311–9 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499751 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2007.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morin C, Rousseau E | title = Effects of 5-oxo-ETE and 14,15-EET on reactivity and Ca2+ sensitivity in guinea pig bronchi | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 82 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 30–41 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17164130 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2006.05.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mercier F, Morin C, Cloutier M, Proteau S, Rokach J, Powell WS, Rousseau E | title = 5-Oxo-ETE regulates tone of guinea pig airway smooth muscle via activation of Ca2+ pools and Rho-kinase pathway | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

=== Cancer ===
The 5-oxo-ETE family of agonists have also been proposed to contribute to the growth of several types of human cancers.  This is based on their ability to stimulate certain cultured human cancer cell lines to proliferate, the presence of OXER1 mRNA and/or protein in these cell lines, the production of 5-oxo-ETE family members by these cell lines, the induction of cell death (i.e. apoptosis) by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase in these cells, and/or the overexpression of 5-lipoxygenase in tissue taken from the human tumors.  Human cancers whose growth has been implicated by these studies as being mediated at least in part by a member(s) of the 5-oxo-ETE family include those of the prostate, breast, lung, ovary, and pancreas.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013. p 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim.

In an ''in vitro'' mixed culture system, 5-(''S'')-HETE is released by monocytes to stimulate, at sub-nanomolar concentrations, osteoclast-dependent bone reabsorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallwitz WE, Mundy GR, Lee CH, Qiao M, Roodman GD, Raftery M, Gaskell SJ, Bonewald LF | title = 5-Lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid stimulate isolated osteoclasts to resorb calcified matrices | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 268 | issue = 14 | pages = 10087–94 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 8486677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inhibits morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-induced bone-like nodule formation in mouse calvarial organ cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Traianedes K, Dallas MR, Garrett IR, Mundy GR, Bonewald LF | title = 5-Lipoxygenase metabolites inhibit bone formation in vitro | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 139 | issue = 7 | pages = 3178–84 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9645691 | doi = 10.1210/endo.139.7.6115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results allow that 5-(''S'')-HETE and perhaps more potently, 5-oxo-ETE contribute to the regulation of [[bone remodeling]].

=== Parturition ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15828">The '''Affect infusion model''' ('''AIM''') is a theoretical model in the field of human psychology. Developed by social psychologist [[Joseph Paul Forgas]] in the early 1990s, it attempts to explain how [[mood (psychology)|mood]] affects one's ability to process information. A key assertion of the AIM is that the effects of mood tend to be exacerbated in complex situations that demand substantial cognitive processing. In other words, as situations become more complicated and unanticipated, mood becomes more influential in driving evaluations and responses.

==Affect infusion==
Forgas defined the term ''affect infusion'' as "the process whereby affectively loaded information exerts an influence on and becomes incorporated into the judgmental process, entering into the judge's deliberations and eventually coloring the judgmental outcome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.39 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and judgment: The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1| pages = 39–66 | pmid = 7870863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a process that determines the degree to which mood can affect our judgement. According to the AIM, affect (mood and emotion) exerts a notable influence not only on information processing but on the resulting response behaviors as well. For example, if a person receives an inordinately large electric bill, they will respond differently if they have had a relaxing and stress-free day than they will if they have just been stuck in traffic for two hours. Under this latter circumstance, the person will experience high levels of affect infusion, as their agitated state will undoubtedly be made worse upon seeing the electric bill.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

An assumption of the AIM is that this effect will generally occur more strongly as the complexity of a situation increases. Highly complex situations can exhibit a number of qualities, such as the amount of effort needed to process the information, whether the situation is familiar or entirely new and how severely the situation affects the person. Some common activities that tend to produce high affect infusion include: choosing whether or not to drink or take drugs, selecting or getting to know a new partner, explaining a conflict or allocating rewards to a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.565 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1998 | title = On feeling good and getting your way: Mood effects on negotiator cognition and bargaining strategies | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 565–577 | pmid = 11407408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing strategies==
According to Forgas, the varying levels of affect infusion can be seen as a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], with four alternative processing strategies as markers along that continuum. These strategies represent the different degrees of severity in which mood exerts its influence. In identifying these strategies, two important differentiating factors are considered: 
* the information search strategies used to perform a task (open or restricted)
* the extent of the information considered in constructing a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.928 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J. P. | year = 1999 | title = On feeling good and being rude: Affective influences on language use and request formulations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 928–939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors related to the judgment target, context, and judger influence which processing strategy is selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.39 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J.P. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and judgment: The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1| pages = 39–66 | pmid = 7870863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Familiarity - Familiar targets are more likely to elicit either direct access or motivated processing.
* Importance - Unimportant judgments are more likely to encourage direct access processing or motivated processing when a specific motive exists.
* Atypical - If a target is complex or unusual it is more likely to trigger substantive processing, otherwise heuristic processing may be used.
* Cognitive capacity - If the individual has cognitive capacity substantive processing may be more likely.
* Affective state - Positive affect is more closely linked to heuristic processing, while negative affect is more closely associated with substantive processing.
* Motivation for accuracy - An individual who is motivated to be accurate will be more likely to use substantive processing.

===Direct access processing===
The least intensive of the four, direct access processing, involves reproducing a stored reaction, that is, repeating a response that has been given before to a similar situation. According to the AIM, the influence of mood on cognition will be least severe during this type of processing.

===Motivated processing===
Motivated processing usually involves specific and targeted search strategies with a direct informational goal in mind. This strategy also involves little influence from mood, as the individual in question will have a fairly clear idea of what information he or she needs (although it is higher on the continuum than direct access processing).

===Heuristic processing===
[[Heuristic]] processing assumes that affective processing, or emotional processing, occurs outside our awareness, with people simply making sense of their emotional reactions as they happen. Thus, affective experience provides people with information about themselves, including their tendencies and implicit judgments. This process is also known as the "affect-as-information" mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.45.3.513 | last1 = Schwarz | first1 = N. | last2 = Clore | first2 = G. L. | year = 1983 | title = Mood, misattribution, and judgments of well-being: Informative and directive functions of affective states | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 513–523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive processing===
Also called systematic processing, this strategy involves the most elaborate cognitive processing and appears highest on the continuum, as it is the most powerfully affected by mood. The reason substantive processing is most apt to be infused by affect is because mood can affect each stage in the cognition process: attention, encoding, retrieval, and association.

* Attention – To grapple with the amount of information that elicits substantive processing, people are likely to only focus on a subset of the entire information available. Mood-congruent information is more likely to be attended to than mood-incongruent information.
* Encoding – People spend more time encoding mood-congruent into a richer network of representations than mood incongruent information.
* Retrieval - Mood-congruent information is more likely to be retrieved from memory than other details.
* Association – Constructive social judgments require the interpretation of complex information. Affect can prime certain associations that influence subsequent interpretation.

Taken as a whole, Forgas has identified two overarching conditions under which mood is most likely to affect information processing: 
* situations that require cognition about difficult, peripheral subjects
* situations that require judgment of obscure, atypical subjects.

==Relationship to risk behavior==
Because mood itself is relatively complex, being the sum of many smaller emotional experiences with no single cause, pinpointing its real-world influence is no easy task. But scholars have used the AIM to examine a number of social phenomena with a variety of results. One area of research involving the AIM concerns the model's role in understanding an individual's propensity for risk taking. Since risky behavior can trigger a complex and varied set of emotional responses (elation, [[fear]], acceptance, etc.), a person's mood might be expected to play a substantial and unpredictable role in any choice to take heavy risks. If a person is in a good mood, he or she might be more likely to appraise the risk positively and be willing to accept any consequences in advance. But even if they are in a bad mood, they could be more likely to rebel against their cultural norms and take the risk anyway.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

This relationship has been examined in a particular experiment by attempting to manipulate a person's mood in order to produce infusion responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.22.2.310 | last1 = Chou | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Lee | first2 = T. M. C. | last3 = Ho | first3 = A. H. Y. | year = 2007 | title = Does mood state change risk taking tendency in older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 310–318 | pmid = 17563186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] is that the "risk taking tendency is greater for those individuals who are in a happy mood than for those who are in a sad mood".&lt;ref&gt;Chou, K. L., Lee, T. M. C., &amp; Ho, A. H. Y. (2007). p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this experiment were exposed to one of three priming movies (happy, sad, or neutral) and then measured on a risk-taking scale. The researchers divided the sample into two units of separation, one being age (old and young) and the other being mood valence (happy, neutral and sad). Not only did their data confirm their hypothesis for both younger and older participants, but it also confirmed the AIM as a legitimate instrument for studying the complexities of mood.

Another study examined how the AIM relates to a specific type of risk behavior: [[gambling]]. It investigated how mood affects an individual's sustained inclination to gamble, especially among non-regular gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.961116299.x | last1 = Hills | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Hill | first2 = S. | last3 = Mamone | first3 = N. | last4 = Dickerson | first4 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Induced mood and persistence at gaming | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 96 | issue = 11| pages = 1629–1638 | pmid = 11784459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers separated regular and non-regular gamblers and measured how their moods affected their experiences on the gaming floor. Specifically, they expected non-regular gamblers in a good mood to be more persistent than non-regular gamblers in a bad mood. This is because gambling, when it is a new and unfamiliar experience, complete with the bright lights and colors that are a feature of the average casino, requires a great deal of information processing, making it especially unattractive to someone in a bad mood. Their research confirmed this notion, but in addition, it was used to positively identify depression as a causal factor of addictive gambling, when the casino has become a familiar environment.

==Influence on interpersonal behavior==
In striving for a deeper understanding of the AIM, scholars have examined different types of behavior that can be expected when affect (mood and emotion) strongly influences information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1207/s15327965pli0903_2 | last1 = Forgas | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Vargas | first2 = P. | year = 1998 | title = Affect and behavior inhibition: The mediating role of cognitive processing strategies | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 205–210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is by no means an exact science, as the behavioral consequences of affect are usually indirect and varied, but they have been able to show that "affective states have a subtle and cognitively mediated influence on the ways people perform or inhibit complex strategic behaviors" (p.&amp;nbsp;206). In other words, emotion influences thinking and behavior in subtle ways. A person in a strongly positive mood may be more confident and use more direct interpersonal behaviors than they would if they were in a bad mood. They may feel 'untouchable' due to the many good things that have happened to them and approach complex situations with an increased level of assurance. As the research has shown, this effect becomes greater as a situation becomes more complex.

In this sense, the AIM is a potential instrument for propaganda campaigns that promote a link between positive affect and desired behavior. For example, many failed attempts to dissuade adolescents from smoking have involved morbid and gloomy advertisements that only serve to depress their viewers. According to the AIM, messages that establish a comfortable atmosphere and focus not on the consequences of smoking but on the benefits of not smoking would probably be more successful.

==The AIM as a research tool==
Along with a clearer understanding of the effect of mood on a person's information processing, the AIM also provides a guide by which researchers can design experiments to investigate the effect of sending persuasive messages to subjects. One important area of research involves the concept of 'mood congruence', or how the results of mood compare to the mood itself. It has been found that 'mood congruence' occurs when a person exhibits a positive relationship between his or her mood and a dependent variable; essentially, as the strength of the mood increases or decreases, so the performance measured by this variable increases or decreases correspondingly. Conversely, 'mood incongruence' occurs when a person exhibits a negative relationship between mood and the dependent variable; thus, as mood increases, performance decreases and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2007.00144.x | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Kirby | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = M. B. | year = 2007 | title = The influence of affect on goal choice and task performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 14–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction has been used to study the relationship between moods and personal goals. For those who are mood congruent, mood generally has a positive relationship with goal motivation, which presents a major opportunity to designers of public health information.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M., &amp; Brief, A. P. (1996). Motivational agendas in the workplace: The effects of feelings on focus of attention and work motivation. In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior'' (Vol. 18, pp. 75-109). Greenwich, CT: JAI.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this line of thought, establishing a positive mood state within the emotional feel of a message and then psychologically connecting that state to the desired behavior would be critical to the message's efficacy.

The AIM has also provided useful insights to other fields. In consumer research, the AIM has helped to explain how males and females differ in their processing of advertising under happy and sad mood states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9383">'''Agroecological restoration''' is the practice of re-integrating natural systems into agriculture in order to maximize [[sustainability]], [[ecosystem services]], and [[biodiversity]]. This is one example of a way to apply the principles of [[agroecology]] to an agricultural system.

== Overview ==
Farms cannot be restored to a purely natural state because of the negative economic impact on farmers, but returning processes, such as [[pest control]] to nature with the method of [[intercropping]], allows a farm to be more ecologically sustainable and, at the same time, economically viable. Agroecological restoration works toward this balance of sustainability and economic viability because conventional farming is not sustainable over the long run without the integration of natural systems and because the use of land for agriculture has been a driving force in creating the present world biodiversity crisis. Its efforts are complementary to, rather than a substitute for, [[biological conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;1.^ Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...biodiversity is just as important on farms and in fields as it is in deep river valleys or mountain cloud forests."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;[http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/51102/index.html  FAO, 15 October 2004]

Agriculture creates a conflict over the [[land use|use of land]] between wildlife and humans. Though the [[domestication]] of [[crop plants]] occurred 10,000 years ago, a 500% increase in the amount of pasture and crop land over the last three hundred years has led to the rapid loss of natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;^ Macdonald, Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the world community acknowledged the value of biodiversity in treaties, such as the 1992 landmark Convention on Biological Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;3.^ {{cite web | title=The future of agriculture depends on biodiversity | website=fao.org | url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2004/51102/index.html | access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reintegration ==
The reintegration of agricultural systems into more natural systems will result in decreased yield and produce a more complex system, but there will be considerable gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services.

===Biodiversity===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] estimates that more than 40% of earth’s land surface is currently used for agriculture. And because so much land has been converted to agriculture, habitat loss is recognized as the driving force in [[biodiversity loss]] (FAO). This biodiversity loss often occurred in two steps, as in the [[American Midwest]], with the introduction of [[mixed farming]] carried out on small farms and then with the widespread use of [[mechanized farming]] and [[monoculture]] beginning after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;4. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The decline in farmland biodiversity can now be traced to changes in farming practices and increased agricultural intensity.&lt;ref&gt;5.^ Benton et al., 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing heterogeneity===
[[Heterogeneity]] (here, the diversity or complexity of the landscape) has been shown to be associated with species diversity. For example, the abundance of butterflies has been found to increase with heterogeneity.  One important part of maintaining heterogeneity in the spaces between different fields is made up of habitat that is not cropped, such as grass margins and strips, scrub along field boundaries, woodland, ponds, and fallow land. These seemingly unimportant pieces of land are crucial for the biodiversity of a farm. The presence of field margins benefits many different taxa: the plants attract herbivorous insects, will which attract certain species of birds and those birds will attract their natural predators. Also, the cover provided by the no cropped habitat allows the species that need a large range to move across the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;6.^ Benton et al., 183&amp;ndash;184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monoculture===
In the absence of cover, species face a landscape in which their [[habitat fragmentation|habitat is greatly fragmented]]. The isolation of a species to a small habitat that it can’t safely wander from can create a [[genetic bottleneck]], decreasing the resilience of the particular population, and be another factor leading to the decline of the total population of the species.&lt;ref&gt;7.^ Macdonald et al., Key Topics in Conservation Biology, Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt; Monoculture, the practice of producing a single crop over a wide area, causes fragmentation. In conventional farming, monoculture, such as with rotations of corn and soybean crops planted in alternating growing seasons, is used so that very high yields can be produced. After the mechanization of farming, monoculture became a standard practice in corn-beans rotation, and had broad implications for the long-term sustainability and biodiversity of farms. Whereas organic fertilizers, had kept the soil’s nutrients fixed to the ecosystem, the introduction of monoculture removed the nutrients and farmers compensated for that loss by using inorganic fertilizers. It is estimated that humans have doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the nitrogen cycle, mostly since 1975. As a result, the biological processes that controlled the way crops used the nutrients changed and the leached nitrogen from farmland soils has become a source of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;8. Jackson et al., The Farm as Natural Habitat, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic farming===
[[Organic farming]] is defined in different legal terms by different nations, but its main distinction from conventional farming is that it prohibits the use of synthetic chemicals in crop and livestock production. Often, it also includes diverse [[crop rotation]]s and provides non-cropped habitat for insects that provide ecosystem services, such as pest control and [[pollination]].&lt;ref&gt;9.^ Zhang et al., 255&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is merely encouraged that organic farmers follow those kinds of wildlife friendly practices, and as a result there is a great difference between the ecosystem services that similarly sized but distinctly managed organic farms provide.&lt;ref&gt;10.^ Hole D.G. et al., 114&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review of the 76 studies concerning the relationship between biodiversity and organic farming listed three practices associated with organic farming that accounted for the higher biodiversity counts found in organic farms as compared to conventional farms. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"1. ''Prohibition/reduced use of [[chemical pesticides]] and inorganic fertilizers'' is likely to have a positive impact through the removal of both direct and indirect negative effects on arable plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.&lt;br /&gt;
2. ''Sympathetic management of non-crop habitats and [[field margin]]s'' can enhance diversity and abundance of arable plants, invertebrates, birds and mammals.&lt;br /&gt;
3. ''Preservation of mixed farming'' is likely to positively impact farmland biodiversity through the provision of greater habitat heterogeneity at a variety of temporal and spatial scales within the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;11.^ Hole D.G. et al., 120&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1563">[[Chemotaxis]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] are expressed in the surface membrane with diverse dynamics, some of them have long-term characteristics as they are determined genetically, others have short-term moiety as their assembly is induced ''ad hoc'' in the presence of the ligand. The diverse feature of the chemotaxis receptors and ligands provides the possibility to select chemotactic responder cells with a simple [[chemotaxis assay]]. By chemotactic selection we can determine whether a still not characterized molecule acts via the long- or the short-term receptor pathway. Recent results proved that [[chemokines]] (e.g. [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], [[RANTES]]) are working on long-term chemotaxis receptors, while vasoactive peptides (e.g. [[endothelin]]) act more on the short-term ones.  Term ''chemotactic selection'' is also used to design a technique which separates [[eukaryotic]] or [[prokaryotic]] cells upon their chemotactic responsiveness to selector ligands.

'''Dark matter''' is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] form of [[matter]] that is thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the [[universe]], and about a quarter of [[Universe#Composition|its total energy density]]. The majority of dark matter is thought to be non-[[baryon]]ic in nature, possibly being composed of some as-yet undiscovered [[subatomic particle]]s.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A small portion of dark matter could be baryonic. See [[Baryonic dark matter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its presence is implied in a variety of [[astrophysical]] observations, including [[gravitation]]al effects that cannot be explained unless more matter is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think dark matter to be ubiquitous in the universe and to have had a strong influence on its structure and evolution. The name dark matter refers to the fact that it does not appear to interact with observable [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[light]], and is thus invisible (or 'dark') to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], making it extremely difficult to detect using usual astronomical equipment.&lt;ref name="CERN Dark Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.cern/about/physics/dark-matter |title=Dark Matter |website=CERN Physics |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary evidence for dark matter is that calculations show that many [[galaxy|galaxies]] would fly apart instead of rotating, or would not have formed or move as they do, if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter.&lt;ref name="Siegfried"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Siegfried |first=T. |date=5 July 1999 |title=Hidden Space Dimensions May Permit Parallel Universes, Explain Cosmic Mysteries |url=http://www.physics.ucdavis.edu/~kaloper/siegfr.txt |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lines of evidence include observations in [[gravitational lensing]],&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trimble |first=V. |date=1987 |title=Existence and nature of dark matter in the universe |journal=[[Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=25 |pages=425–472 |bibcode=1987ARA&amp;A..25..425T |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.25.090187.002233 |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2hz008rs/qt2hz008rs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[cosmic microwave background]], from astronomical observations of the [[observable universe]]'s current structure, from the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of galaxies]], from mass location during [[galactic collision]]s,&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/a-history-of-dark-matter&lt;/ref&gt; and from the motion of galaxies within [[galaxy cluster]]s. In the standard [[Lambda-CDM]] model of cosmology, the total [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]] of the universe contains 5% [[Baryon#Baryonic matter|ordinary]] [[matter]] and [[energy]], 27% dark matter and 68% of an unknown form of energy known as [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="NASA Planck Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/planck/news/planck20130321.html |title=Planck Mission Brings Universe Into Sharp Focus |website=NASA Mission Pages |date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA Science Dark Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/ |title=Dark Energy, Dark Matter |website=NASA Science: Astrophysics |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P.

Because dark matter has not yet been observed directly, it must barely interact with ordinary [[baryonic]] matter and radiation. The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of [[elementary particle]] that has [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|not yet been discovered]], in particular, [[weakly-interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), or [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs).&lt;ref name="Copi 1995" /&gt; Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken, but none has yet succeeded.&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt; Dark matter is classified as cold, warm, or hot according to its [[velocity]] (more precisely, its [[Free streaming|free streaming length]]). Current models favor a [[cold dark matter]] scenario, in which [[structure formation|structures emerge]] by gradual accumulation of particles.

Although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by the scientific community, some astrophysicists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kroupa |first1=P. |display-authors=etal |date=2010 |title=Local-Group tests of dark-matter Concordance Cosmology: Towards a new paradigm for structure formation |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=523 |pages=32–54 |arxiv=1006.1647 |bibcode=2010A&amp;A...523A..32K |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201014892}}&lt;/ref&gt; intrigued by certain observations that do not fit the dark matter theory,&lt;ref name="physicsworldcorrelation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Cooper| title=Correlation between galaxy rotation and visible matter puzzles astronomers| url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/oct/07/correlation-between-galaxy-rotation-and-visible-matter-puzzles-astronomers}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue for various modifications of the standard laws of [[general relativity]], such as [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], [[tensor–vector–scalar gravity]], or [[entropic gravity]].

=== Early history ===
The hypothesis of dark matter has an elaborate history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Swart|first1=J. G.|last2=Bertone|first2=G.|last3=van Dongen|first3=J.|title=How dark matter came to matter|journal=Nature Astronomy|date=2017|volume=1|issue=59|pages=0059|doi=10.1038/s41550-017-0059|arxiv = 1703.00013 |bibcode = 2017NatAs...1E..59D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a talk given in 1884,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science-site.net/darkmatter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] estimated the number of dark bodies in the [[Milky Way]] from the observed velocity dispersion of the stars orbiting around the center of the galaxy. By using these measurements, he estimated the mass of the galaxy, which he determined is different from the mass of visible stars. Lord Kelvin thus concluded that "many of our stars, perhaps a great majority of them, may be dark bodies".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/a-history-of-dark-matter/|title=A history of dark matter|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 [[Henri Poincaré]] in "The Milky Way and Theory of Gases" used "dark matter", or "matière obscure" in French, in discussing Kelvin's work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1933, Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who studied [[groups and clusters of galaxies|galaxy clusters]] while working at the [[California Institute of Technology]], made a similar inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |journal=[[Helvetica Physica Acta]] |volume=6 |pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |date=1933 |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6 |pages=110–127}} See also {{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=86 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky applied the [[virial theorem]] to the [[Coma Cluster]] and obtained evidence of unseen mass that he called ''dunkle Materie'' ('dark matter'). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated that the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus mass must be hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together. This was the first formal inference about the existence of dark matter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Some details of Zwicky's calculation and of more modern values are given in {{Citation |first=M. |last=Richmond |title=Using the virial theorem: the mass of a cluster of galaxies |url=http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/gal_clus/gal_clus.html |accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due to an obsolete value of the [[Hubble constant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Katherine |last=Freese|title=The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=c2B8AgAAQBAJ}}|date=4 May 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same calculation today shows a smaller fraction, using greater values for luminous mass.

The first robust indications that the [[mass-to-light ratio]] was anything other than unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, [[Horace W. Babcock]] reported the rotation curve for the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda nebula]] (known now as the Andromeda Galaxy), which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode=1939LicOB..19...41B |doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1939LicOB.19.41B |title=The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula |journal=Lick Observatory Bulletins |volume=19 |pages=41–51|year=1939|last1=Babcock|first1=Horace W}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed it to either light absorption within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to missing matter.

At the same time that Rubin and Ford were exploring optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of new radio telescopes to map the 21&amp;nbsp;cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar atomic hydrogen ([[H I region|HI]]) often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, allowing the sampling of rotation curves—and thus of the total mass distribution—to a new dynamical regime.

== Technical definition ==
{{see also|Friedmann equations}}
In standard cosmology, matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], i.e., ''ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''. This is in contrast to radiation, which scales as the inverse fourth power of the scale factor '' ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; '', and a [[cosmological constant]], which is independent of ''a''. These scalings can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cubical box, doubling the length of the sides of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (''2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is larger because an increase in scale factor causes a proportional [[redshift]]. A cosmological constant, as an intrinsic property of space, has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University|author=Daniel Baumann|page=21−22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dark energy]] is a term often used nowadays as a substitute for cosmological constant. It is basically the same except that dark energy might depend on scale factor in some unknown way rather than necessarily being constant.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, "dark matter" means all components of the universe that are not visible but still obey ''ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''. In practice, the term "dark matter" is often used to mean only the non-baryonic component of dark matter, i.e., excluding "[[missing baryon problem|missing baryons]]." Context will usually indicate which meaning is intended.

=== Galaxy rotation curves ===
{{Main|Galaxy rotation curve}}
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|thumb|[[Galaxy rotation curve|Rotation curve]] of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). Dark matter can explain the 'flat' appearance of the velocity curve out to a large radius.]]
[[File:Comparison of rotating disc galaxies in the distant Universe and the present day.webm|thumb|Models of rotating disc galaxies in the present day (left) and ten billion years ago (right). In the present-day galaxy, dark matter—shown in red—is more concentrated near the center and it rotates more rapidly (effect exaggerated).]]

The arms of [[spiral galaxies]] rotate around the galactic center. The luminous mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the center to the outskirts. If luminous mass were all the matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it, similar to the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is a consequence of the [[shell theorem]] and the observation that spiral galaxies are spherically symmetric to a large extent (in 2D).&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Kepler's Second Law]], it is expected that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the center, similar to the Solar System. This is not observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Corbelli E. |author2=Salucci, P. | title=The extended rotation curve and the dark matter halo of M33|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2000|volume=311|issue=2|pages=441–447 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03075.x|arxiv = astro-ph/9909252 |bibcode = 2000MNRAS.311..441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distance from the center increases.

If Kepler's laws are correct, then the obvious way to resolve this discrepancy is to conclude that the mass distribution in spiral galaxies is not similar to that of the Solar System. In particular, there is a lot of non-luminous matter (dark matter) in the outskirts of the galaxy.

=== Velocity dispersions ===
{{main|Velocity dispersion}}
Stars in bound systems must obey the [[virial theorem]]. The theorem, together with the measured velocity distribution, can be used to measure the mass distribution in a bound system, such as elliptical galaxies or globular clusters. With some exceptions, velocity dispersion estimates of elliptical galaxies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Faber |first1=S. M. |last2=Jackson |first2=R. E. |date=1976 |title=Velocity dispersions and mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=204 |pages=668–683 |bibcode=1976ApJ...204..668F |doi=10.1086/154215}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not match the predicted velocity dispersion from the observed mass distribution, even assuming complicated distributions of stellar orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last1=Binny|first1=James|last2=Merrifield|first2=Michael|date=1998|title=Galactic Astronomy|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=712-713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with galaxy rotation curves, the obvious way to resolve the discrepancy is to postulate the existence of non-luminous matter.

=== Galaxy clusters ===
[[Galaxy clusters]] are particularly important for dark matter studies since their masses can be estimated in three independent ways:

* From the scatter in radial velocities of the galaxies within clusters
* From [[X-ray]]s emitted by hot gas in the clusters. From the X-ray energy spectrum and flux, the gas temperature and density can be estimated, hence giving the pressure; assuming pressure and gravity balance determines the cluster's mass profile. 
* [[Gravitational lens]]ing (usually of more distant galaxies) can measure cluster masses without relying on observations of dynamics (e.g., velocity).

Generally, these three methods are in reasonable agreement that dark matter outweighs visible matter by approximately 5 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cosmological Parameters from Clusters of Galaxies|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=49|issue=1|pages=409–470|doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081710-102514|arxiv=1103.4829|bibcode=2011ARA&amp;A..49..409A|year=2011|last1=Allen|first1=Steven W|last2=Evrard|first2=August E|last3=Mantz|first3=Adam B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravitational lensing ===

One of the consequences of [[general relativity]] is that massive objects (such as a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]]) lying between a more distant source (such as a [[quasar]]) and an observer should act as a lens to bend the light from this source. The more massive an object, the more lensing is observed.

Strong lensing is the observed distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes through such a gravitational lens. It has been observed around many distant clusters including [[Abell 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=A.

[[Weak gravitational lensing]] investigates minute distortions of galaxies, using statistical analyses from vast [[redshift survey|galaxy surveys]].

=== Cosmic microwave background ===
{{Main|Cosmic microwave background}}

Although both dark matter and ordinary matter are matter, they do not behave in the same way. In particular, in the early universe, ordinary matter was ionized and interacted strongly with radiation via [[Thomson scattering]]. Dark matter does not interact directly with radiation, but it does affect the CMB by its gravitational potential (mainly on large scales), and by its effects on the density and velocity of ordinary matter. Ordinary and dark matter perturbations, therefore, evolve differently with time and leave different imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

The cosmic microwave background is very close to a perfect blackbody but contains very small temperature anisotropies of a few parts in 100,000. A sky map of anisotropies can be decomposed into an angular power spectrum, which is observed to contain a series of acoustic peaks at near-equal spacing but different heights. 
The series of peaks can be predicted for any assumed set of cosmological parameters by modern computer codes such as CMBFast and CAMB, and matching theory to data, therefore, constrains cosmological parameters.&lt;ref name="Wayne Hu"&gt;The details are technical. See {{citeweb|author=Wayne Hu|title=Intermediate Guide to the Acoustic Peaks and Polarization|url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/intermediate.html|date=2001}} for an intermediate-level introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The first peak mostly shows the density of baryonic matter, while the third peak relates mostly to the density of dark matter, measuring the density of matter and the density of atoms.&lt;ref name="Wayne Hu" /&gt;

The CMB anisotropy was first discovered by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, though this had too coarse resolution to detect the acoustic peaks. 
After the discovery of the first acoustic peak by the balloon-borne [[BOOMERanG]] experiment in 2000, 
the power spectrum was precisely observed by [[WMAP]] in 2003-12, and even more precisely 
by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2013-15. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement]] |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck15" /&gt;

=== Structure formation ===
{{Main|Structure formation}}

Structure formation refers to the period after the Big Bang when density perturbations collapsed to form stars, galaxies, and clusters. Prior to structure formation, the [[FRW metric|Friedmann solutions]] to general relativity describe a homogeneous universe. Later, small anisotropies gradually grew and condensed the homogeneous universe into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Ordinary matter is affected by radiation, which is the dominant element of the universe at very early times. As a result, its density perturbations are washed out and unable to condense into structure.&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;{{citeweb|author=A. H. Jaffe|title=Cosmology 2012: Lecture Notes|url=http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/sites/default/files/cosmology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there were only ordinary matter in the universe, there would not have been enough time for density perturbations to grow into the galaxies and clusters currently seen.

Dark matter provides a solution to this problem because it is unaffected by radiation. Therefore, its density perturbations can grow first. The resulting gravitational potential acts as an attractive [[potential well]] for ordinary matter collapsing later, speeding up the structure formation process.&lt;ref name="Jaffe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|title="Constraints on the composite photon theory|author=L.

=== Bullet Cluster ===
{{Main|Bullet Cluster}}
If dark matter does not exist, then the next most likely explanation is that general relativity—the prevailing theory of gravity—is incorrect. The Bullet Cluster, the result of a recent collision of two galaxy clusters, provides a challenge for modified gravity theories because its apparent center of mass is far displaced from the baryonic center of mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Sky surveys and baryon acoustic oscillations ===
{{Main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}

Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are fluctuations in the density of the visible [[baryonic]] matter (normal matter) of the universe on large scales. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid of the early universe, and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Redshift-space distortions ===
Large galaxy [[redshift survey]]s may be used to make a three-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution. These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed [[redshift]]s; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding but more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. This effect causes superclusters to appear squashed in the radial direction, and likewise voids are stretched. Their angular positions are unaffected.
The effect is not detectable for any one structure since the true shape is not known, but can be measured by averaging over many structures assuming Earth is not at a special location in the Universe.

The effect was predicted quantitatively by Nick Kaiser in 1987, and first decisively measured in 2001 by the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=J. |title=A measurement of the cosmological mass density from clustering in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=Nature |year=2001 |volume=410 |issue=6825 |pages=169–73 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103143 |bibcode=2001Natur.410..169P |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1038/35065528 |pmid=11242069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results are in agreement with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

Dark matter can refer to any substance that interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g., stars and planets). Hence in principle it need not be composed of a new type of fundamental particle but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or neutrons.{{refn|name=BaryonicFootnote01|group=note|Astronomers define the term [[baryonic matter]] to refer to ordinary matter made of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s, including [[neutron stars]] and [[black holes]] from the collapse of ordinary matter.  Strictly speaking, electrons are [[lepton]]s not [[baryon]]s; but since their number is equal to the protons while their mass is far smaller, electrons give a negligible contribution to the average density of baryonic matter. Baryonic matter excludes other known particles such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrinos]]. Hypothetical primordial black holes are also generally defined as non-baryonic, since they would have formed from radiation, not matter.&lt;ref name=BaryonicSource01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Baryonic+Matter |title=Baryonic Matter |website=COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|access-date=9 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists think the dark matter is dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).

[[File:Fermi Observations of Dwarf Galaxies Provide New Insights on Dark Matter.ogv|thumb|[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi-LAT]] observations of dwarf galaxies provide new insights on dark matter.]]

=== Baryonic matter ===
{{Distinguish|Missing baryon problem}}
[[Baryon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) make up ordinary stars and planets. However, baryonic matter also encompasses less common [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, faint old [[white dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s, collectively known as [[massive compact halo object]]s (MACHOs), which can be hard to detect.{{sfn|Randall|2015|p=286}}

However, multiple lines of evidence suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of baryons:

* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars. 
* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7503-0405-4 |oclc=864166846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In contrast, [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] and other observations indicate that the total matter density is about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="planckesa2015" /&gt;
* Astronomical searches for [[gravitational microlensing]] in the [[Milky Way]] found that at most a small fraction of the dark matter may be in dark, compact, conventional objects (MACHOs, etc.); the excluded range of object masses is from half the Earth's mass up to 30 solar masses, which covers nearly all the plausible candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tisserand |first1=P. |last2=Le Guillou |first2=L. |last3=Afonso |first3=C. |last4=Albert |first4=J.

=== Non-baryonic matter ===

Candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such as [[axion]]s, [[sterile neutrino]]s, [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs), or [[supersymmetric]] particles. The three neutrino types already observed are indeed abundant, and dark, and matter, but because their individual masses—however uncertain they may be—are almost certainly tiny, they can only supply a small fraction of dark matter, due to limits derived from [[Observable universe|large-scale structure]] and high-[[redshift]] galaxies.&lt;ref name="bertone merritt" /&gt;

Unlike baryonic matter, nonbaryonic matter did not contribute to the formation of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the early universe ([[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]])&lt;ref name="Copi 1995" /&gt; and so its presence is revealed only via its gravitational effects, or [[weak lensing]]. In addition, if the particles of which it is composed are supersymmetric, they can undergo [[annihilation]] interactions with themselves, possibly resulting in observable by-products such as [[gamma rays]] and neutrinos (indirect detection).&lt;ref name="bertone merritt"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bertone |first1=G. |last2=Merritt |first2=D. |title=Dark Matter Dynamics and Indirect Detection |year=2005 |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]] |volume=20 |issue=14 |pages=1021–1036 |arxiv=astro-ph/0504422 |bibcode=2005MPLA...20.1021B |doi=10.1142/S0217732305017391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''It lacks an efficient means to lose energy:''&lt;ref name="curio" /&gt; Ordinary matter forms dense objects because it has numerous ways to lose energy. Losing energy would be essential for object formation, because a particle that gains energy during compaction or falling "inward" under gravity, and cannot lose it any other way, will heat up and increase [[velocity]] and [[momentum]]. Dark matter appears to lack means to lose energy, simply because it is not capable of interacting strongly in other ways except through gravity. The [[Virial theorem]] suggests that such a particle would not stay bound to the gradually forming object—as the object began to form and compact, the dark matter particles within it would speed up and tend to escape.
* ''It lacks a range of interactions needed to form structures:''&lt;ref name="siegel" /&gt; Ordinary matter interacts in many different ways. This allow it to form more complex structures. For example, stars form through gravity, but the particles within them interact and can emit energy in the form of [[neutrino]]s and [[electromagnetic radiation]] through [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] when they become energetic enough. [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can bind via the [[strong interaction]] and then form [[atom]]s with [[electron]]s largely through [[electromagnetic interaction]]. But there is no evidence that dark matter is capable of such a wide variety of interactions, since it only seems to interact through gravity and through some means no stronger than the [[weak interaction]] (although this is speculative until dark matter is better understood).

This question has been debated heavily during recent years. In 2016–2017 the idea of dense dark matter or dark matter being black holes, including [[primordial black hole]]s, made a comeback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |title=Is dark matter made of black holes? |journal=Science |date=9 February 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0721}}&lt;/ref&gt; following results of [[Gravitational wave|gravitation wave]] detection. These were again ruled out in December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2156252-ancient-black-holes-ruled-out-as-source-of-all-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt; but research and theories based on these still continue as at 2018, including approaches to dark matter cooling,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2160305-there-could-be-entire-stars-and-planets-made-out-of-dark-matter/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102|pmid=29481169|title=Collapsed Dark Matter Structures|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=120|issue=5|pages=051102|year=2018|last1=Buckley|first1=Matthew R|last2=Difranzo|first2=Anthony|arxiv=1707.03829|bibcode=2018PhRvL.120e1102B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question is by no means settled.

== Classification of dark matter: cold, warm or hot ==
Dark matter can be divided into ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Joseph |last=Silk|title=The Big Bang: Third Edition| url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XLwe1lUmz5kC| page=82}}| date=6 December 2000| publisher=Henry Holt and Company| isbn=978-0-8050-7256-3| chapter=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories refer to velocity rather than an actual temperature, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion—this is an important distance called the [[free streaming]] length (FSL). Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation. The categories are set with respect to the size of a [[protogalaxy]] (an object that later evolves into a dwarf galaxy): dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according as their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar (warm), or much larger (hot) than a protogalaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=N. |last1=Vittorio |author2=J. Silk |date=1984 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=285 |pages=L39–L43 |title=Fine-scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |doi=10.1086/184361 |bibcode=1984ApJ...285L..39V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Masayuki |last1=Umemura |author2=Satoru Ikeuchi |title=Formation of Subgalactic Objects within Two-Component Dark Matter |date=1985 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=299 |pages=583–592 |doi=10.1086/163726 |bibcode=1985ApJ...299..583U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixtures of the above are also possible: a theory of [[mixed dark matter]] was popular in the mid-1990s, but was rejected following the discovery of [[dark energy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cold dark matter leads to a bottom-up formation of structure while hot dark matter would result in a top-down formation scenario;{{Clarification needed|date=September 2018}} the latter is excluded by high-redshift galaxy observations.&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt;

=== Alternative definitions ===
These categories also correspond to [[fluctuation spectrum]] effects and the interval following the Big Bang at which each type became non-relativistic. Davis ''et al.'' wrote in 1985:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=M. |author2=Efstathiou, G. |author3=Frenk, C. S. |author4=White, S. D. M. |title=The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=292 |date=May 15, 1985 |pages=371–394 |doi=10.1086/163168 |bibcode=1985ApJ...292..371D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Candidate particles can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their effect on the [[Mixed dark matter|fluctuation spectrum]] (Bond ''et al.'' 1983). If the dark matter is composed of abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before recombination, then it may be termed "hot". The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ... A second possibility is for the dark matter particles to interact more weakly than neutrinos, to be less abundant, and to have a mass of order 1&amp;nbsp;keV. Such particles are termed "warm dark matter", because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description. [[Gravitino]]s and [[photino]]s have been suggested (Pagels and Primack 1982; Bond, Szalay and Turner 1982) ... Any particles which became nonrelativistic very early, and so were able to diffuse a negligible distance, are termed "cold" dark matter (CDM). There are many candidates for CDM including supersymmetric particles. | M. Davis, G. Efstathiou, C. S. Frenk, and S. D. M. White | The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter}}

Another approximate dividing line is that warm dark matter became non-relativistic when the universe was approximately 1 year old and 1 millionth of its present size and in the [[radiation-dominated era]] (photons and neutrinos), with a photon temperature 2.7 million K. Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2''ct'' (speed of light multiplied by time) in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2 light-years. A region of this size would expand to 2 million light-years today (absent structure formation). The actual FSL is approximately 5 times the above length, since it continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic. In this example the FSL would correspond to 10 million light-years, or 3 mega[[parsec]]s, today, around the size containing an average large galaxy.

The 2.7 million K photon temperature gives a typical photon energy of 250 electron-volts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for warm dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV–TeV mass [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than one year after the Big Bang and thus have FSLs much smaller than a protogalaxy, making them cold. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have FSLs much larger than a protogalaxy, thus qualifying them as hot.

=== Cold dark matter ===
{{Main|Cold dark matter}}
[[Cold dark matter]] offers the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations. It is dark matter composed of constituents with an FSL much smaller than a protogalaxy. This is the focus for dark matter research, as hot dark matter does not seem capable of supporting galaxy or galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates slowed early.

The constituents of cold dark matter are unknown. Possibilities range from large objects like MACHOs (such as black holes&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=M. R.

The 1997 [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] in 2013, claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many researchers remain skeptical, as negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the DAMA results.

Many [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] models offer dark matter candidates in the form of the WIMPy [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle]] (LSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Supersymmetric dark matter |journal=Physics Reports |date=1 March 1996 |pages=195–373 |volume=267 |issue=5–6 |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(95)00058-5 |first=Gerard |last=Jungman |first2=Marc |last2=Kamionkowski |first3=Kim |last3=Griest |arxiv=hep-ph/9506380 |bibcode=1996PhR...267..195J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, heavy sterile neutrinos exist in non-supersymmetric extensions to the [[Standard Model|standard model]] that explain the small [[neutrino]] mass through the [[seesaw mechanism]].

=== Warm dark matter ===
{{Main|Warm dark matter}}
[[Warm dark matter]] comprises particles with an FSL comparable to the size of a protogalaxy. Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies. Some researchers consider this a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass ~ 300 eV to 3000 eV.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

No known particles can be categorized as warm dark matter. A postulated candidate is the [[sterile neutrino]]: a heavier, slower form of neutrino that does not interact through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], unlike other neutrinos. Some modified gravity theories, such as [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]], require "warm" dark matter to make their equations work.

=== Hot dark matter ===
{{Main|Hot dark matter}}
[[Hot dark matter]] consists of particles whose FSL is much larger than the size of a protogalaxy. The [[neutrino]] qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment|detected in 1956]]. Neutrinos' [[Neutrino mass|mass]] is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; that of an [[electron]]. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to WIMPs.

The three known [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of neutrinos are the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau''. Their masses are slightly different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It is hard to determine an exact [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50 ''eV/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3 ''eV/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, observed neutrinos cannot explain dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/neutrinos.html |title=Neutrinos as Dark Matter |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=21 September 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because galaxy-size density fluctuations get washed out by free-streaming, hot dark matter implies that the first objects that can form are huge [[supercluster]]-size pancakes, which then fragment into galaxies. [[List of deep fields|Deep-field observations]] show instead that galaxies formed first, followed by clusters and superclusters as galaxies clump together.

== Detection of dark matter particles ==
If dark matter is made up of sub-atomic particles, then millions, possibly billions, of such particles must pass through every square centimeter of the Earth each second.&lt;ref name="Gaitskell 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaitskell |first=Richard J. |title=Direct Detection of Dark Matter |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |volume=54 |pages=315–359 |bibcode=2004ARNPS..54..315G |date=2004 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Number per second"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEUTRALINO DARK MATTER |url=http://www.picassoexperiment.ca/dm_neutralino.php |accessdate=26 December 2011}}

Although [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] are popular search candidates,&lt;ref name="bertone hooper silk" /&gt; the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]] (ADMX) searches for [[axion]]s. Another candidate is heavy [[hidden sector]] particles that only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.

These experiments can be divided into two classes: direct detection experiments, which search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within a detector; and indirect detection, which look for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays.&lt;ref name="bertone merritt" /&gt;

=== Direct detection ===
{{details|Weakly interacting massive particles#Direct detection}}
Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy recoils (typically a few [[keV]]s) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are passing through the Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy as, e.g., [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light or [[phonon]]s, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. To do this effectively, it is crucial to maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from [[cosmic ray]]s. Examples of underground laboratories with direct detection experiments include the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory|Stawell mine]], the [[Soudan mine]], the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]], the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] and the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]].

These experiments mostly use either cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these techniques focus strongly on their ability to distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].

Currently there has been no well-established claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drees|first1=M.|last2=Gerbier|first2=G.|title=Dark Matter|journal=Chin.

A few of the dark matter particles passing through the Sun or Earth may scatter off atoms and lose energy.

=== Collider searches for dark matter ===
An alternative approach to the detection of dark matter particles in nature is to produce them in a laboratory. Experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) may be able to detect dark matter particles produced in collisions of the LHC [[proton]] beams. Because a dark matter particle should have negligible interactions with normal visible matter, it may be detected indirectly as (large amounts of) missing energy and momentum that escape the detectors, provided other (non-negligible) collision products are detected.&lt;ref name="kane watson"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Kane, G. |author2=Watson, S. |title=Dark Matter and LHC:. what is the Connection? |journal=Modern Physics Letters A |year=2008 |volume=23 |pages=2103–2123 |doi=10.1142/S0217732308028314 |bibcode=2008MPLA...23.2103K |arxiv=0807.2244 |issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Constraints on dark matter also exist from the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider|LEP]] experiment using a similar principle, but probing the interaction of dark matter particles with electrons rather than quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=P.J.|last2=Harnik|first2=R.|last3=Kopp|first3=J.|last4=Tsai|first4=Y.|title=LEP Shines Light on Dark Matter|journal=Phys.

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{More|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Because dark matter remains to be conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. The most common method is to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The best-known theories of this class are [[MOND]] and its relativistic generalization [[tensor-vector-scalar gravity]] (TeVeS),&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The failures of the Standard Model of Cosmology require a new paradigm |author=Pavel Kroupa |display-authors=etal |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=4 |doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030 |arxiv = 1301.3907 |bibcode = 2012IJMPD..2130003K }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[f(R) gravity]]&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The dark matter problem from f(R) gravity viewpoint |author=Salvatore Capozziello |author2=Mariafelicia De Laurentis |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=October 2012|volume=524|issue=9–10|doi=10.1002/andp.201200109|bibcode = 2012AnP...524..545C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[entropic gravity]].&lt;ref name="physorgnewtheory"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= Delta Institute for Theoretical Physics | title=New theory of gravity might explain dark matter | url=https://phys.org/news/2016-11-theory-gravity-dark.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternatives to general relativity|Alternative theories]] abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alternatives to Dark Matter and Dark Energy|author=Phillip D.

A problem with alternative hypotheses is that the observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the "observational evidence" section above). Explaining any individual observation is possible but explaining all of them is very difficult. Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/|title=First test of rival to Einstein's gravity kills off dark matter|date=15 December 2016|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is that while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/05/09/dark-matter-vs-modified-gravity-a-trialogue/ |title=Dark Matter vs. Modified Gravity: a Trialogue |author-link=Sean M.

==In philosophy of science==

In [[philosophy of science]], dark matter is an example of an auxiliary hypothesis, an [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]] postulate that is added to a theory in response to observations that [[falsifiability|falsify]] it. It has been argued that the dark matter hypothesis is a [[conventionalism#Epistemology|conventionalist]] hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis that adds no empirical content and hence is unfalsifiable in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merritt |first1=David |title=Cosmology and convention |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |date=February 2017 |volume=57 |issue=2017 |pages=41–52 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2016.12.002|arxiv=1703.02389 |bibcode=2017SHPMP..57...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Die Musik''''' was a German music [[magazine]] established in 1901 by Bernhard Schuster (1870–1934). It was published semimonthly by Schuster &amp; Loeffler from Berlin and Leipzig. Schuster was its [[editor-in-chief]] from inception until July 1933, when the publication was taken over by the [[Third Reich]]. The final publication, under the name ''Die Musik,'' was February 1943.&lt;ref name="Sieb's dissertation" /&gt;

== History ==
First published in 1901, ''Die Musik'' ran semimonthly through September 1915, suspended publication due to [[World War I]]. In 1922, the publisher, Schuster &amp; Loeffler, merged with the Stuttgart firm [[Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt]] [[:de:Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt|(de)]]; and in October 1922, ''Die Musik'' (Vol. 25, Issue 1) resumed with Schuster as editor. A leaflet attached to the June 1933 issue marked its beginning as the official music journal of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt; The publication continued through 1943, changing its name in 1943 to ''Musik im Kriege'' ''(Music in War)'' and continued through 1944.

''Die Musik'' was the first German magazine to publish special issues called "Sonderhefte" — ''Wagner-Heft,'' February 1902. By 1932, ''Die Musik'' had published 120 special issues. Schuster stated that the 14 Beethoven and 15 Wagner issues equated to 8 to 10 yearbooks.&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Publisher's music library" /&gt;

According to essayist Stephen W. Brown, ''Die Musik'' was the most successful music periodical in Germany because it targeted readership, from laypeople, to musicians, to scholars. Brown commented that ''Die Musik'' was remarkable for its variety and attention to jazz, but was silenced for political reasons in 1934. Its importance in musicology is significant, especially considering, according to Brown, that the dominant periodicals for musicology of that era were German.&lt;ref name="Brown: Journal Essay" /&gt;

=== History during the Third Reich ===
According to the thesis of book by Erik Levi — ''Mozart and the Nazis: How the Third Reich Abused a Cultural Icon'' — the [[Third Reich]] embraced the artistic heritage as its domain.&lt;ref name="Levi" /&gt; Because ''Die Musik'' was the most prestigious German-language music magazine of the first half of the twentieth century, the [[Third Reich]] took a special interest in requisitioned as the offician bulletin of the [[Reichsjugendführer|RJF]].

In its new role, ''Die Musik'' spearheaded several Nazi initiatives, including one called "Organ des Amtes für Kunstpflege beim Beauftragten des Führers für die gesamte geistige und weltanschauliche Schulung der NSDAP", commonly known as "[[Amt Rosenberg]]".&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt;

=== Editors during the Third Reich ===
''Die Musik,'' under the editorship of Schuster, had been relatively apolitical. The editors during the [[Third Reich]] were Johannes Gunther (born 1901), Friedrich W. Herzog (born 1902–1976), and [[Herbert Gerigk]]. Schuster had been editor until July 1933. Gunther, of the [[Reichsjugendführer]], became editor in August 1933. On April 1, 1934, ''Die Musik'' became the official bulletin of the [[Reichsjugendführer]]. Herzog, one of 88 German writers who signed the "[[Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft]]", a pledge of allegiance to Hitler, became editor on July 1, 1934. [[Herbert Gerigk|Gerigk]], of the [[Reichsjugendführer]], was a chief collaborator in the Nazi music administration. Among other things, he co-authored the antisemitic ''[[Encyclopedia of Jews in Music|Lexikon der Juden in der Musik]]'' in 1941.&lt;ref name="Gerigk" /&gt; From September 1936 to June 1937, ''Die Musik'' was the official bulletin of the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. In October 1937, ''Die Musik'' became the official musical voice of the Department for Art Preservation under Reich leader [[Amt Rosenberg|Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Sieb's dissertation" /&gt;

In March 1943, ''Die Musik'' merged with ''Zeitschrift für Musik,'' ''Allgemeine Musikzeitung,'' and ''Neues Musikblatt'' to form ''[[Musik im Kriege]]'' ''[[:de:Musik im Kriege|(de)]],'' which resumed under its new name for the April/May 1943 issue with [[Herbert Gerigk|Gerigk]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt;

'''''Double Helix''''' (2004), a novel by [[Nancy Werlin]], is about 18-year-old Eli Samuels, who works for a famous [[molecular biologist]] named Dr. Quincy Wyatt.  There is a mysterious connection between Dr. Wyatt and Eli’s parents, and all Eli knows about the connection is that it has something to do with his mother, who has [[Huntington's disease]].  Because of the connection between Dr. Wyatt and the Samuels family, Eli's father is strongly against Eli working there.  The job is perfect, and the wages are great, but Eli can't help but notice that Dr. Wyatt seems to be a little ''too'' interested in him.  Later on, as Eli continues to work in the lab, he discovers with the help of Kayla Matheson, Dr. Wyatt's supposed "niece," that he and Kayla are the product of a highly [[unethical]] [[eugenics]] experiment.

==Characters==
* '''Eli Samuels''': Eli is 18 years old, 6′7″ (201 centimeters) tall. He's an A student, and is the salutatorian in high school. His mother has Huntington's disease, which he could have too.
* '''Jonathan Samuels''': Jonathan Samuels is Eli's father, who loved his wife. He has a problem with Eli working at Wyatt Transgenic's, because of things that went down in the past. He is initially completely unwilling to tell Eli anything about his mother's relationships with Dr. Wyatt.
* '''Dr. Quincy Wyatt''': Dr. Quincy Wyatt is a famed geneticist, who is considered to be on par with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], [[James Watson|Watson]], and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]. He offers Eli a job. He displays an unexplained interest in Eli.
* '''Vivian Fadiman''': Vivian Fadiman is Eli's girlfriend and [[Valedictorian]] at his high school. All she wants is to be part of his life and she supports him in everything he does. It's hard for her to understand why Eli hides major parts of his life from her. Eli is devoted to her, though they do go through some rough times.
* '''Kayla Matheson''': A year older than Eli, he gets to know her via Dr. Wyatt. He is attracted to her because of her beauty and athleticism.
* '''Ava Samuels''': Ava Samuels was Eli's mother and lived in a nursing home because of her [[Huntington's disease]]. She had a mysterious connection with Dr. Wyatt.

==Themes==
The story addresses a lot of recent scientific breakthroughs, and uses them as plot devices.  For instance, [[Human Genome Project|The Human Genome Project]], which documents all the genes and DNA in the human genetic makeup, is talked about when Dr. Wyatt explains his genetic testing to Eli for the first time.  [[Scientific American]] recently published an article detailing the possible uses for the information gathered from the Human Genome Project.  Modern advancements in gene studies currently can detect and, in some cases, even predict the presence of a genetic abnormality.  In Double Helix, this ability to detect flaws before birth was used to [[genetic engineering|genetically engineer]] a “more perfect son, devoid of flaws and with a proper chance to live free of [[Huntington's Disease|Huntington’s]].”

For some people, the biggest issue with genetic engineering is whether or not to seek out nd act on knowledge about genetic flaws. Double Helix attempts to explore the life saving and life destroying aspects of genetic engineering. The book proposes that, while Eli’s life was saved by avoiding the Huntington’s disease gene, his concept of life and self were destroyed when he found out he was genetically engineered to be a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugenicsonline.netfirms.com/issues.htm Eugenics Online Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229144845/http://www.eugenicsonline.netfirms.com/issues.htm |date=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nancywerlin.com/aboutwriting.htm :: Nancy Werlin | Resources for Writers ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120907041429/http://www.nancywerlin.com/aboutwriting.htm |date=September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/014240327X Amazon.com: Double Helix (Puffin Sleuth Novels): Books: Nancy Werlin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Earthquake Engineering Research Institute''' ('''EERI''') is a leading technical society in dissemination of earthquake risk and [[earthquake engineering]] research both in the U.S. and globally.  EERI members include researchers, geologists, geotechnical engineers, educators, government officials, and building code regulators.  Their mission, as stated in their 5-year plan published in 2006, has three points: "Advancing the science and practice of earthquake engineering; Improving understanding of the impact of earthquakes on the physical, social, economic, political, and cultural environment; and Advocating comprehensive and realistic measures for reducing the harmful effects of earthquakes".&lt;ref name= "plan"&gt;[http://www.eeri.org/site/images/about/strategic_plan.pdf EERI, ''Earthquake Engineering Research Institute Strategic Plan 2006-2010'', 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
In the 2006 5-year plan, the EERI has identified four main goals towards fulfilling their mission and planned strategies to carry them out.&lt;ref name = "plan" /&gt;

#"'''Enhance and expand educational materials and technical programs.'''"  They will hold two seminars per year on topics intended to interest a wide audience.  They will also post many of their publications online, such as their journal ''Earthquake Spectra''.  
# "'''Outreach and Advocacy'''"  They will continue to release their findings on earthquake risks, including the costs of potential disasters.  They hope to influence policymakers to increase funds for preventing these risks.  They hope also to include earthquake safety into the "green" building design movement.
#"'''Maintain a strong program of international activities.'''"  They serve as an inflow point in the U.S. for earthquake research from other countries.  They also serve as an outflow, translating their research into languages other than English.
#"'''Expand and broaden financial resource base.'''"  They wish to raise $1 million in donations by 2010, and increase worldwide membership to 3,000.  They wish to expand their programs and partnerships with other organizations with more workshops and seminars.  In February, 2010, the EERI entered a partnership with the Geo-Institute of [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], increasing their collaboration to reduce earthquake hazards.&lt;ref name = "team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeri.org/site/images/about/G-I-Agreement-signed.pdf|title=Geo-Institute of ASCE and Earthquake Engineering Research Institute Partnering Agreement, 2010.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EERI was formed in 1948 as an advising committee on the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]].   It quickly became its own independent, [[nonprofit organization]], with the purpose of studying why buildings fail under earthquake disasters, and what methods can prevent these failures.    At first they conducted their research in laboratories of different University or Government groups.  As the EERI grew, they began to more often send research funds to the Universities, and have the University conduct the research.  EERI focused more on identifying and investigating areas in need of research, and policymaking based on the university’s lab results.

In 1952 the EERI organized the first Conference on Earthquake Engineering, at [[UCLA]].  In 1955, they held the first World Conference on Earthquake Engineering.    In 1984, the 8th World Conference was held in [[San Francisco]].  This conference brought in scientists from 54 countries.

At first, membership to the EERI was limited to invite-only engineers and scientists.   
In 1973, they began to hire members by application, and increased their membership from 126 to 721 by 1978.  In 1991, EERI began receiving funding from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), to continue publishing information on how to reduce damage from earthquakes.

After a number of location changes, the EERI headquarters settled in [[Oakland]], [[California]].

Their quarterly journal, ''Earthquake Spectra'', covers current research on earthquake engineering and is available online or by subscription.   Its target audience is any geologist, seismologist, or related engineer.  EERI also publishes many other types of information, including a monthly newsletter, an oral history series, and field investigation reports.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/14_S07-005.PDF|author=Tubbesing, Susan K., and Thalia Anagnos|title=The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a Short History of the U.S. National Earthquake Engineering Society|publisher=Earthquake Engineering Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==California earthquake assessments==
EERI performs risk assessments on earthquake potential sites around the world.  This is a quick summary of two reports on California cities.

In 2006 an engineering firm related to the EERI has projected over $122 billion in damages, if a repeat of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] occurs.  This number includes damages to homes and structures, excluding fire damage.&lt;ref name = "sanfran"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11947095/ns/us_news-san_francisco_earthquake_1906/ Johnson, Alex. ''"Bay Area far from ready for the next ‘Big One’."'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The EERI lobbies for government funding to prevent natural disasters.  The money is best spent before loss of life and large-scale structural damage, though often it is not seen until afterward, as evidenced by Hurricane Katrina.  The EERI and the [[USGS]] have identified that a potential large earthquake in [[Los Angeles]] would cause more damage than Katrina at New Orleans, with up to $250 billion in total damages and 18,000 deaths.&lt;ref name = "katrina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9351829/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=Major quake could be worse than Katrina|date=15 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student involvement==
EERI has a student chapter in 29 colleges across the U.S. to further promote interest in [[earthquake engineering]].A few representatives from each chapter make up the Student Leadership Council (SLC).&lt;ref name = "history" /&gt;  Since 2008 the EERI and SLC have held the Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition, which was previously run by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER).  In this competition a team of undergraduate college students must design and construct a structure made of [[balsa wood]].  The structure is limited by many rules, such as a weight limit, the individual heights of each floor, total height limit, and more.  The structure is subjected to extra weight and placed on a shake table, which moves to simulate an earthquake.  An [[accelerometer]] is placed on top of the building to measure how fast the top of the building shakes.  Students’ structures are judged on a number of criteria, including the height of the structure, number of floors, the accelerometer readings, and whether the structure breaks.  Students will want to make a building close to the height limit because the higher floors are worth more points. The 8th annual competition is to be held in Portland, OR, March 7th through 10th, along with the 63rd EERI annual meeting.&lt;ref name = "compete"&gt;[https://slc.eeri.org/SDC2017BeforeTheCompetition.htm EERI Seismic Design Competition, ''2017 Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition Announcements'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[comparative religion]], the '''East Asian religions''' form a subset of the [[Eastern religions]]. This group includes Chinese religion overall, which further includes [[Ancestor veneration in China|Ancestral Worship]], [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and so-called [[Chinese salvationist religions|popular salvationist organisations]] (such as [[Yiguandao]] and [[Weixinism]]), as well as elements drawn from [[Mahayana Buddhism]] that form the core of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[East Asian Buddhism]] at large. The group also includes Japanese [[Shintoism]] and Korean [[Korean shamanism|Sindoism]] (both meaning "Ways of Gods" and identifying the indigenous shamanic religion and ancestor worship of such peoples), which have received influences from Chinese religions throughout the centuries. [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnamese Buddhism]] is also heavily Influenced by Ancestor Worship, and Mahayana Buddhism. Chinese salvationist religions have influenced the rise of Korean and [[Japanese new religions]]—for instance, respectively, [[Jeungsanism]], and [[Tenriism]]; these movements draw upon indigenous traditions but are heavily influenced by [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Chinese theology|theology]].
[[File:ChuaBaiDinh.jpg|thumb|300x300px|'''[[Bái Đính Temple]]'''  is a complex of Buddhist temples on Bai Dinh Mountain i'''n [[Gia Viễn District]], [[Ninh Bình Province]], [[Vietnam]].''' ]]
All these traditions, more or less, share core Chinese concepts of spirituality, divinity and world order, including [[Tao]] [[:wikt:道|道]] ("Way";  pinyin ''dào'', Japanese ''tō'' or ''dō'', and Korean ''do'') and [[Tian]] [[:wikt:天|天]] ("Heaven"; Japanese ''ten'', and  Korean ''cheon'').

Early Chinese philosophies defined the Tao and advocated cultivating the ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'', "virtue", which arises from the knowledge of such Tao.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 32. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient schools merged into traditions with different names or became extinct, such as [[Mohism]] (and many others of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]), which was largely absorbed into Taoism. East Asian religions include many theological stances, including [[polytheism]], [[nontheism]], [[henotheism]], [[monotheism]], [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]] and [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=中央研究院國際漢學會議論文集: 藝術史組|page=141|publisher=該院|year=1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIxCAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Asian religions have many Western adherents, though their interpretations may differ significantly from traditional East Asian religious thought and culture.

The place of East Asian religions among [[major religious groups]] is comparable to the [[Abrahamic religion]]s found in Europe and the Western World as well as across the Middle East and the Muslim World and [[Indian subcontinent religions|Indian religions]] across [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pp 71–72, 75–76. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Despite a wide variety of terms, the traditions described as "Far Eastern religions", "East Asian religions" or "Chinese religions" are recognised by scholars as a distinct religious family.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, J. J. M. ''Religion in China: Universism a Key to the Study of Taoism and Confucianism''. Pp 45–46. Kessinger Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-4658-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Edwin Olver. ''The Comparative Study of Religions of the East (excluding Christianity and Judaism).'' Pg 5. University of Michigan Press. 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syncretism]] is a common feature of East Asian religions, often making it difficult to recognise individual faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Satoshi. Translated by [[John Breen (scholar)|Breen, John]] and [[Mark Teeuwen]]. ''Shinto – A Short History''. Pg 9.  Routledge. 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-31179-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Mary Pat. Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths. Pg 164. I.B. Tauris. 1997. {{ISBN|1-86064-148-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further complications arise from the inconsistent use of many terms. "Tao religion" is often used for Taoism itself,&lt;ref&gt;Vrijhof, Pieter Hendrik &amp; Waardenburg, Jean Jacques. ''Official and Popular Religion: Analysis of a Theme for Religious Studies''. Pg 419. Walter de Gruyter. 1979. {{ISBN|90-279-7998-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being used for many Tao-based new religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;Beversluis, Joel Diederik. ''Sourcebook of the World's Religions: An Interfaith Guide to Religion and Spirituality''. Pg 41. New World Library. 2000. {{ISBN|1-57731-121-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Far Eastern religion" may be used to refer only to faiths incorporating the concept of Tao, may include Ch'an and Japanese Buddhism, and may even inclusively refer to all Asian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Mary Pat. Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths. Pp 164–165, 174–175. I.B. Tauris. 1997. {{ISBN|1-86064-148-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrop, Filmer Stuart Cuckow. ''The Meeting of East and West: An Inquiry Concerning World Understanding''. Pg 412. The Macmillan company. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, J. Isamu.''Buddhism: Buddhism, Taoism and Other Far Eastern Religions''. Zondervan. 1998. {{ISBN|0-310-48912-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tao and its virtue==
{{Main|Tao|De (Chinese)}}
The Tao may be roughly defined as the flow of reality, of the universe, or the force behind the natural order.&lt;ref&gt;Cane, Eulalio Paul. ''Harmony: Radical Taoism Gently Applied''. Pg 13. Trafford Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|1-4122-4778-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered, the Tao is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the Tao.&lt;ref&gt;Martinson, Paul Varo ''A theology of world religions: Interpreting God, self, and world in Semitic, Indian, and Chinese thought''. Pp 168–169. Augsburg Publishing House. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8066-2253-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[negative theology]] of Western scholars, the Tao is compared to what it is not.&lt;ref&gt;This concept of being unable to accurately describe the Tao is common among East Asian religions and Taoist writings. For example, "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name"; first lines of the ''Tao Te Ching''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be the source of both existence and non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'' and ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' for more information about "non-existence" and "existence" in East Asian religious thought.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tao is often associated with a "virtue" of being, the ''de'' or ''te''. This is considered the active expression of Tao.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pp 77–78, 88. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, those religions closer to Taoism explain ''de'' as "integrity" or "wholeness", while those faiths closer to Confucianism express this concept as "morality" or "sound character".&lt;ref&gt;Yao, Xinzhong. ''An Introduction to Confucianism''. Pp 155–156. Cambridge University Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-64430-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==

===Taoism===
[[File:Shangdi and Doumu altar in Chengxu Temple, Zhouzhuang, Jiangxi.jpg|thumb|Altar to [[Shangdi]] (上帝 "Highest Deity") and Doumu (斗母 "Mother of the [[Big Dipper|Great Chariot]]"), together representing the principle of the universe in masculine and feminine form in some [[Taoist schools|Taoist cosmologies]], in the [[Chengxu Temple]] of [[Zhouzhuang]], [[Jiangxi]].]]
{{Main|Taoism}}
Taoism consists of a wide variety of religious, philosophical and ritual orders. There are [[hermeneutic]] (interpretive) difficulties in the categorisation of Taoist schools, sects and movements.&lt;ref&gt;Mair (2001) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoism does not fall strictly under an umbrella or a definition of an [[organised religion]] like the [[Abrahamic traditions]], nor can it purely be studied as a variant of [[Chinese folk religion]], as much of the traditional religion is outside of the tenets and core teachings of Taoism. Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a way of life than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), pp. 3–4, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Taoist propriety and ethics place an emphasis on the unity of the universe, the unity of the material world and the spiritual world, the unity of the past, present and future, as well as on the [[Three Jewels of the Tao]] (love, moderation, humility).&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver. ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy ''. Pg 111. Routledge, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-17362-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of [[wu wei]] ("non-action"), spontaneity, relativity and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, Edward Gilman. ''Effortless Action: Wu-Wei as Conceptual Metaphor and Spiritual Ideal in Early China''. Oxford University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-513899-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pg 78. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Chinese Taoist schools accept polytheism, but there are differences in the composition of their pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Robert Alan. ''The Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion''. Pg 50. Blackwell Publishing. 2006. {{ISBN|0-631-23216-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the popular level, Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the head [[deity]]. Professionalised Taoism (i.e. priestly orders) usually presents Laozi and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 41. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worship of nature deities and ancestors is common in popular Taoism, while professional Taoists put an emphasis on [[internal alchemy]]. The Tao is never an object of worship, being treated more like the Indian concept of [[Atman (Buddhism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;LaFargue, Michael. ''Tao and Method: A Reasoned Approach to the Tao Te Ching''. Pg 283. SUNY Press. 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
{{Main|Confucianism}}
[[File:柳州市孔庙 Temple of Confucius in Liuzhou, Guangxi.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]].]]
Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is commonly associated with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]], but actually rejects legalism for [[ritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Yao, Xinzhong. ''An Introduction to Confucianism''. pp 191–192.  Cambridge University
Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-64430-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also endorses [[meritocracy]] as the ideal of [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Ninian. ''World Philosophies''. Pp 66. Routledge (UK). 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-22852-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism includes a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness.&lt;ref&gt;De Bary,William Theodore &amp; Tu, Weiming. ''Confucianism and Human Rights''. Pg 149. Columbia University Press. 1998. {{ISBN|0-231-10936-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism recognises the existence of ancestral spirits and deities, advocating paying them proper respect.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pp 46, 85. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic [[Neo-Confucianism]] was built.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Siu-chi. ''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods''. Pg 5. Greenwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-26449-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neo-Confucianism]] was developed in reaction to Taoism and Chan Buddhism. It was formulated during the [[Song dynasty]], but its roots may be traced to scholars of the [[Tang dynasty]]. It draw Buddhist religious concepts and Taoist [[yin yang]] theory, as well as the ''[[Yijing]]'', and placed them within the framework of classic Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Siu-chi. ''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods''. Pp 11–12, 63–64, 106. Greenwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-26449-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Neo-Confucianism's incorporation of elements of Buddhism and Taoism, its apologists still decried both faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 52–53. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Confucianism was an officially endorsed faith for over five centuries, deeply influencing all of East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Antony G. ''A Dictionary of Philosophy''. Pg 62. St. Martin's Griffin. 1984. {{ISBN|0-312-20923-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Confucianism]] is a [[modernist]] Confucianism, which accommodates modern science and democratic ideals, while remaining conservative in preserving traditional Neo-Confucianist positions. The influence of New Confucianism prompted since [[Deng Xiaoping]] became the leader of China in 1978 and helped cultural exchanges between China and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|author=Ruiping Fan|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TflW14YLLxUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shintoism===
[[File:2015-07-31Minazuki-Festival Kokuryo,Tamba,Hyogo-Japan 国領水無月祭り 8731.JPG|thumb|Makeshift Shinto shrine during the festival of Minazuki in a village of [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan.]]
{{Main|Shinto}}
Shintoism is the [[ethnic religion]] of Japan. Shinto literally means "Way of the Gods". Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values.&lt;ref&gt;Ono, Sakyo. ''Shinto: The Kami Way''. Pp 97–99, 103–104. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8048-3557-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoist influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self-mastery. [[Ritual cleanliness]] is a central part of Shinto life.&lt;ref&gt;Ono, Sakyo. ''Shinto: The Kami Way''. Pp 51–52, 108. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8048-3557-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shinto shrine|Shrines]] have a significant place in Shinto, being places for the veneration of the ''[[kami]]'' (gods or spirits).&lt;ref&gt;Markham, Ian S. &amp; Ruparell, Tinu . ''Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world''. pp 304–306 Blackwell Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-631-20674-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Folk", or "popular", Shinto features an emphasis on shamanism, particularly [[divination]], [[spirit possession]] and [[faith healing]]. "Sect" Shinto is a diverse group including mountain-worshippers and Confucian Shinto schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ono, Sakyo. ''Shinto: The Kami Way''. Pg 12. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8048-3557-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taoism and Confucianism==
The concepts of Tao and ''de'' are shared by both Taoism and Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, Ian S. &amp; Ruparell, Tinu. ''Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world''. Pg 254. Blackwell Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-631-20674-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of the [[Tao Te Ching]], the central book of Taoism, is assigned to [[Laozi]], who is traditionally held to have been a teacher of Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad D. ''A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation''. Pp 202, 210. Oxford University Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-19-513419-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars believe that the Tao Te Ching arose as a reaction to Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Mary Pat. ''Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths''. Pg 167. I.B. Tauris. 1997. {{ISBN|1-86064-148-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], reacting to the Confucian-[[Mohist]] ethical disputes casts Laozi as a prior step to the Mohists by name and the Confucians by implication. However, secular scholars usually consider Laozi and Zhuangzi to have been [[myth]]ological figures.&lt;ref&gt;Boltz, William G. "Lao tzu Tao te ching." ''Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide'', edited by Michael Loewe. pg 270. Berkeley: University of California, Institute of East Asian Studies. 1993. (Laozi)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birrell, Anne. ''Chinese Myths''. Pp 16–17. University of Texas Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-292-70879-3}}. (Zhuangzi)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Taoist texts reject Confucian emphasis on rituals and order, in favour of an emphasis on "wild" nature and individualism. Historical Taoists challenged conventional morality, while Confucians considered society debased and in need of strong ethical guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 39. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction with Indian and South Asian religions==
{{Main|East Asian Buddhism}}
[[Image:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|160px|A painting of Confucius presenting a young Buddha to Laozi.]]
The entry of [[Buddhism]] into China from India was marked by interaction and [[syncretism]] with Taoism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 46. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally seen as a kind of "foreign Taoism", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Prebish, Charles Pg 192"&gt;Prebish, Charles. ''Buddhism: A Modern Perspective.'' Pg 192. Penn State Press, 1975. {{ISBN|0-271-01195-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chan Buddhism was particularly modelled after Taoism, integrating distrust of scripture, text and even language, as well as the Taoist views of embracing "this life", dedicated practice and the "every-moment".&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. &amp; Knitter, Paul. ''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)''. Pp 68, 70–73, 167–168. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tang period]] Taoism incorporated such Buddhist elements as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture into tripartite organisation. During the same time, Chan Buddhism grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. &amp; Knitter, Paul. ''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)''. Pp 166–167, 169–172. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha's "[[Dharma]]" seemed alien and amoral to conservative and Confucian sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. &amp; Knitter, Paul. ''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)''. Pp 189–190, 268–269. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism promoted social stability, order, strong families, and practical living, and Chinese officials questioned how monastic lifestyle and personal attainment of enlightenment benefited the empire.&lt;ref name="Prebish, Charles Pg 192"/&gt; However, Buddhism and Confucianism eventually reconciled after centuries of conflict and assimilation.&lt;ref name="Moore, Charles Alexander Pp 133, 147"&gt;Moore, Charles Alexander. ''The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture''. Pp 133, 147. University of Hawaii Press. 1967. {{ISBN|0-8248-0075-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, Ian S. &amp; Ruparell, Tinu . ''Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world''. pp 248–249. Blackwell Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-631-20674-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They did share some similar values. All three embraced a [[humanism|humanist]] philosophy emphasising moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously.&lt;ref name="window"&gt;[http://www.asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html Windows on Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220182953/http://www.asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html |date=2009-02-20 }} Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University.&lt;/ref&gt; This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school.&lt;ref name="Moore, Charles Alexander Pp 133, 147"/&gt;

The '''Faculty of Political Science, [[Chulalongkorn University]]''', is regarded as one of the oldest modern higher education institutions in [[Thailand]]. It is the first faculty of political science in Thailand and is considered as one of the best according to the statistics of student who had highest score on admission system chose to study there for 4 years in a row (2010-2013).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1368077139&amp;grpid=03&amp;catid=19&amp;subcatid=1903&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of Thailand's leading institutions for [[political science]] training. Many senior government officials, politicians, diplomats and prominent academics are the graduates of the Faculty. Due to its logo and colour, the Faculty, students and its graduates are also called by the nickname, "Singh Dam" (Black Singha).

==History==
The Faculty of Political Science was originally established in 1899 as the School of Civil Servant Training by [[King Chulalongkorn]]. Students were selected from those who passed basic educational training and would be educated about [[public administration]] in the school. They were also required to do internship in different governmental agencies after completion and received certificate for specialised skill afterwards. This School had expanded and its graduates mostly worked as royal [[page (occupation)|page]] which allowed these young men to be close to the central authority and became accustomed to senior officials. As a general practice during that time, new government officials would start their career at the Department of Royal Pages before being promoted to work in other departments. Therefore, [[King Chulalongkorn]] renamed the School to the Royal Pages School to reflect this reality in 1902.

In 1910, [[King Vajiravudh]] viewed that training new graduates to work for the Ministry of Interior was not sufficient for increasing public services in other areas; therefore, he ordered and financially supported the expansion of the Royal Pages School to include many areas of trainings. The School was renamed again to "The Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn" on 1 January 1910. The general curriculum was four-year training of which the first three were for general education leaving the last year for internship. However, the School was upgraded and renamed [[Chulalongkorn University]] on 26 March 1916. The newly established [[Chulalongkorn University]] was then administered in 4 faculties, that is, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and the Faculty of Public Administration.
[[File:PolSciCUFront.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Samranraj Borirak Building, the first building of the faculty ]]

In 1929 after the promulgation of the new Civil Service Act the popularity of the Faculty of Public Administration decreased significantly. The Act did not require applicants to hold university qualification to apply for first level entry of public service. Holders of ordinary secondary school certificate (equivalent to Grade 11) could also enter to the same level, while the students choosing to enter the Faculty had to pass advanced secondary certificate (equivalent to Grade 12) plus 3 years at the university before starting their career. The nadir of its popularity could be seen by only 35 students enrolling in that year. Therefore, the Ministry of Education proposed to [[King Prajadhipok]] to discontinue the Faculty after the completion of its last class. The King initially endorsed the proposal. However, many government officials especially from the Ministry of Interior appealed to the King to reconsider his decision as they still saw the necessity and usefulness of producing graduates in this field. The committee for reconsidering this issue was set up and finally agreed that the Faculty should be continued on the proviso that its admission and curriculum must be revamped. The name of the Faculty was changed to the School of Civil Service and directly overseen by the Office of the President of Chulalongkorn University. In 1933, the Law School of the Ministry of Justice was incorporated into the School, thereafter renamed together the "Faculty of Law and Political Science.

Following the collapse of the absolute monarchy in 1932, the [[University of Moral and Political Science]] (later called [[Thammasat University]]) was established. Then, the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Chulalongkorn University was transferred to be under this new university. The Faculty of Law and Political Science was therefore temporarily disappeared from Chulalongkorn University's academic structure.

In 1948, the government viewed that there was still need for more graduates for public administration, then agreed to re-establish the Faculty of Political Science in Chulalongkorn University in that same year. The new phase of the Faculty of Political Science then began and has progressively developed until today.

The then Faculty of Political Science comprised 3 divisions, that is, Political Science Division, Public Finance Division, and Law Division. Later on, Public Finance Division was merged with Economics Division of the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy to become the Faculty of Economics in 1971. Also, Law Division was upgraded to the Faculty of Law in 1972. After these splits, the Faculty has mainly focused in teaching modern [[political science]] discipline.

==Academic Administration==
Currently, the Faculty of Political Science organises its academic disciplines into 4 departments, that is,&lt;br /&gt;
1. Department of [[Government]]&lt;br /&gt;
2. Department of [[International Relations]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Department of [[Public Administration]]&lt;br /&gt;
4. Department of [[Sociology]] and [[Anthropology]]

The Faculty offers undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) and postgraduate degrees ([[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] and [[PhD]]), including an international master programme in International Development Studies taught in English.

There are also a number of research centres under the Faculty including Policy and Management Development Institute (PMDI), Institute of Security and International Studies (ISIS), Public Enterprise Institute (PEI), Centre for Social Development Studies (CSDS), Institute of Local Government Initiatives (ILGI), and Thai Politics Research Centre (TPRC).

The Faculty has also run a prominent academic journal namely Journal of Social Science for over 35 years. The published articles are both written in Thai and English.

==Logo==
The black singha is used as a symbol of the dedicated leader. The black colour symbolises the colour of the neck of [[Shiva]] who drinks the poison churned up from the world ocean ([[Halahala]]) to protect and save all creatures. (In fact, the actual colour of Shiva's neck in Hindu mythology is deeply dark blue or "nila". That's why one of his names is Nilakantha or "having a blue-coloured neck". However, "nila" in Thai (normally pronounced "nin") becomes a simply black colour). Singha is a mythical animal that rules the [[Himmapan]] forest representing the great ruler or leader. These symbolic meanings convey the fact that the Faculty aims at producing qualified graduates who will be leading figures in the society in any respect with passion and dedication to help improve people's quality of life as their foremost principle.

'''Fisher's principle''' is an [[evolution]]ary model that explains why the [[sex ratio]] of most [[species]] that produce [[offspring]] through [[sexual reproduction]] is approximately 1:1 between [[male]]s and [[female]]s. [[A. W. F. Edwards]] has remarked that it is "probably the most celebrated argument in [[evolutionary biology]]".&lt;ref name=Edwards98&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/286141 | last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.W.F. | year = 1998 | title = Natural Selection and the Sex Ratio: Fisher's Sources | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 151 | issue = 6| pages = 564–569 | pmid = 18811377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher's principle was famously outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''&lt;ref name=Fisher30/&gt; (but has been incorrectly attributed to Fisher as original&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt;). Specifically, Fisher couched his argument in terms of [[parental expenditure]], and predicted that parental expenditure on both sexes should be equal.  Sex ratios that are 1:1 are hence known as "Fisherian", and those that are not 1:1 are "non-Fisherian" or "extraordinary" and occur because they break the assumptions made in Fisher's model.&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt;

==Basic explanation==
[[W.D. Hamilton]] gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on "Extraordinary sex ratios",&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:&lt;!-- this is a better explanation than Fisher's contorted text--&gt;

{{block indent|
# Suppose male births are less common than female.
# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.}}

In modern language, the 1:1 ratio is the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS).&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/246015a0 | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | last2 = Price | first2 = G.R. | year = 1973 | title = The logic of animal conflict | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v246/n5427/abs/246015a0.html | journal = Nature | volume = 246 | issue = 5427| pages = 15–18 | bibcode=1973Natur.246...15S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parental expenditure==
In Chapter 6 "Sexual Reproduction and [[Sexual selection|Sexual Selection]]", Fisher wrote under the heading "Natural Selection and the sex-ratio" (page 141)&lt;ref name=Fisher30&gt;[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher, R.A.]] 1930 ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; the explanation described by [[Eric Charnov]] and [[James J. Bull]] as being "characteristically terse" and "cryptic":&lt;ref name=BullCharnov88&gt;Bull, J. J., and E. L. Charnov, 1988 How fundamental are Fisherian

{{quote|In organisms of all kinds the young are launched upon their careers endowed with a certain amount of biological capital derived from their parents. This varies enormously in amount in different species, but, in all, there has been, before the offspring is able to lead an independent existence, a certain expenditure of nutriment in addition, almost universally, to some expenditure of time or activity, which the parents are induced by their instincts to make for the advantage of their young. Let us consider the reproductive value of these offspring at the moment when this parental expenditure on their behalf has just ceased. If we consider the aggregate of an entire generation of such offspring it is clear that the total reproductive value of the males in this group is exactly equal to the total value of all the females, because each sex must supply half the ancestry of all future generations of the species. From this it follows that the sex ratio will so adjust itself, under the influence of Natural Selection, that the total parental expenditure incurred in respect of children of each sex, shall be equal; for if this were not so and the total expenditure incurred in producing males, for instance, were less than the total expenditure incurred in producing females, then since the total reproductive value of the males is equal to that of the females, it would follow that those parents, the innate tendencies of which caused them to produce males in excess, would, for the same expenditure, produce a greater amount of reproductive value; and in consequence would be the progenitors of a larger fraction of future generations than would parents having a congenital bias towards the production of females.  Selection would thus raise the sex-ratio until the expenditure upon males became equal to that upon females.}}

==Development of the argument==
Fisher's principle is an early example of a model in which genes for greater production of either sex become equalized in the population, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations.

Fisher's principle is rooted in the concept of frequency-dependent selection, though Fisher's principle is not frequency-dependent selection ''per se''. Frequency-dependent selection, in this scenario, is the logic that the probability of an individual being able to breed is dependent on the frequency of the opposite sex in relation to its own sex. It was first described by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in [[The Descent of Man|1871]].

Fisher's principle extends frequency dependence to explain how natural selection can act on genes that affect the frequency of an individual's grandchildren without affecting the frequency of their children. Fisher predicted that parents will invest their resources equally between each sex of offspring, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations. As a result, those genes that cause parents to invest unequally in the sexes will tend to be selected against. Fisher was aware that in humans, more boys are born, whilst boys are also more likely to die in infancy. As a consequence, he reasoned that because parents tend to invest less in boys{{snd}} because more boys die before the end of the period of parental care{{snd}} there is a higher rate of male births to equalise parental investment in each sex.

Fisher's principle is also the precursor to [[evolutionary game theory]].  [[Robert MacArthur|R.H. MacArthur]] (1965) first suggested applying to sex ratios the language of [[game theory]],&lt;ref name=MacArthur65&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R. H.]] (1965). in: ''Theoretical and mathematical biology'' T. Waterman &amp; H. Horowitz, eds. Blaisdell: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and this was subsequently picked up by [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1967) who termed the equilibrium point the "[[unbeatable strategy]]".&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt;  Hamilton's unbeatable strategy was refined by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]] (1973) into their concept of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], i.e. one which cannot be invaded by a mutant strategy.&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73/&gt;

Fisher's concept of parental expenditure (now termed [[parental investment]]), developed particularly by [[Robert Trivers]] is now an important concept in [[ecology]].

==Fisher's sources==
Historical research by [[A.W.F. Edwards]]&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards00&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.2000.1482 | last1 = Edwards | first1 = A.W.F. | year = 2000 | title = Carl Düsing (1884) on The Regulation of the Sex-Ratio | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 255–257 | pmid = 11120652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the argument is incorrectly attributed to Fisher (the name is in common use and is unlikely to change). [[Charles Darwin]] had originally formulated a similar but somewhat confused argument in the first edition of ''[[The Descent of Man]]''&lt;ref name=Darwin71&gt;Darwin, C.R. 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' 1st ed John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt; but withdrew it for the second edition&lt;ref name=Darwin74&gt;Darwin, C.R. 1874 ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' 2nd ed John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} Fisher only had a copy of the latter, and quotes Darwin in ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref name=Fisher30/&gt;

Specifically, [[Carl Düsing]] of the [[University of Jena]] published this in three works between 1883–84,&lt;ref name=Edwards00/&gt; and this is essentially identical to Shaw and Mohler's later model.&lt;ref name=ShawMohler53&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/281794 | last1 = Shaw | first1 = R.F. | last2 = Mohler | first2 = J.D. | year = 1953 | title = The selective significance of the sex ratio | jstor = 2458523 | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 87 | issue = 837| pages = 337–342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading==
As "probably the most celebrated argument in [[evolutionary biology]]",&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt; Fisher's principle is a staple of [[popular science]] books on evolution.  For example, see:

* [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (2002) ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''.  (pages 648–649, 678, and 692 on sex ratio)
* [[Richard Dawkins]] (2004) "The Seal's Tale", ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'', A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. {{ISBN|0-618-00583-8}}

For those wishing more advanced treatment, see the 2002 book ''Sex Ratios: Concepts and Research Methods'' edited by Ian C.W. Hardy, (chapters 1 and 2 by Ido Pen and Franz J. Weissing.)

'''Green computing''', '''green ICT''' as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT", '''green IT''', or '''ICT sustainability''', is the study and practice of [[environmentally sustainable]] computing or IT.

The goals of green computing are similar to [[green chemistry]]: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] during the product's lifetime,  the [[recycling|recyclability]] or [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] of defunct products and factory waste. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004011859/http://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems |date=October 4, 2015 }}", IJCAET, 6(4), 440–459, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; to large-scale data centers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS9"/&gt;

Many corporate IT departments have green computing initiatives to reduce the environmental effect of their IT operations.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B.

In 1992, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] launched [[Energy Star]], a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of [[sleep mode]] among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the [[TCO Certification]] program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer display]]s; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, [[ergonomics]], and the use of hazardous materials in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCO takes the initiative in comparative product testing |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |date=May 3, 2008 |url=http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723060821/http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-date=July 23, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and industry initiatives==
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on "Green ICTs", i.e. information and communication technologies, the environment and climate change. The report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening ICTs themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation. In general, only 20% of initiatives have measurable targets, with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations.&lt;ref&gt;Full report: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|title=Towards Green ICT strategies: Assessing Policies and Programmes on ICTs and the Environment|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317103746/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Summary: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|title=Executive summary of OECD report|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102750/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Many [[governmental]] agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing. The [[Energy Star]] program was revised in October 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment, along with a tiered ranking system for approved products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPA Announces New Computer Efficiency Requirements |date=October 23, 2006 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |last=Jones |first=Ernesta |publisher=U.S. EPA |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212022429/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |title=How Important Will New Energy Star Be for PC Makers? |last=Gardiner |first=Bryan |date=February 22, 2007 |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826193654/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |archive-date=August 26, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, 26 US states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222713/http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |title= State Legislation on E-Waste |date=March 20, 2008 |publisher=Electronics Take Back Coalition |accessdate=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes either impose an "advance recovery fee" for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal.

In 2010, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) was signed into legislation by President Obama. The bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives (renewable energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc.) In January 2010, the U.S. Energy Department granted $47 million of the ARRA money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers. The projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software, improve power supply chain, and [[computer cooling|data center cooling technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141406/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Secretary Chu Announces $47 Million to Improve Efficiency in Information Technology and Communications Sectors |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
* [[Climate Savers Computing Initiative]] (CSCI) is an effort to reduce the electric power consumption of PCs in active and inactive states.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214140754/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archivedate=February 14, 2008 |title=Intel and Google Join with Dell, EDS, EPA, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, PG&amp;E, World Wildlife Fund and Others to Launch Climate Savers Computing Initiative |publisher=Business Wire |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSCI provides a catalog of green products from its member organizations, and information for reducing PC power consumption. It was started on 2007-06-12. The name stems from the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s Climate Savers program, which was launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215151042/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=What exactly is the Climate Savers Computing Initiative? |publisher=Climate Savers Computing Initiative |year=2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWF is also a member of the Computing Initiative.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch" /&gt;
* The [[Green Electronics Council]] offers the [[Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool]] (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of "greener" computing systems. The Council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a product's efficiency and sustainability attributes. Products are rated Gold, Silver, or Bronze, depending on how many optional criteria they meet. On 2007-01-24, President [[George W. Bush]] issued Executive Order 13423, which requires all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20(1-24-07).pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCuJd6am?url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20%281-24-07%29.pdf |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |title=President Bush Requires Federal Agencies to Buy EPEAT Registered Green Electronic Products |publisher=Green Electronics Council |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |title=Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management |publisher=The White House: Office of the Press Secretary |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831005045/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |archive-date=August 31, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Green Grid]] is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems. It was founded in February 2007 by several key companies in the industry&amp;nbsp;– [[AMD]], [[American Power Conversion|APC]], [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Rackable Systems]], [[SprayCool]] (purchased in 2010 by [http://www.parker.com/portal/site/Market-Tech/menuitem.e9f921bc8ae21676de92b210237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=e7bfa7bee4a70310VgnVCM10000048021dacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default Parker]), [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[VMware]]. The Green Grid has since grown to hundreds of members, including end-users and government organizations, all focused on improving [[data center infrastructure efficiency]] (DCIE).

==Approaches==
Modern [[Information technology|IT]] systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment (ROI). There are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption; "of the power management tools available, one of the most powerful may still be simple, plain, common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706131340/http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archivedate =July 6, 2010 |title=The common sense of lean and green IT |work=Deloitte Technology Predictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product longevity===
[[Gartner]] maintains that the PC manufacturing process accounts for 70% of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a PC.&lt;ref&gt;InfoWorld July 6, 2009;
{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121223HCFSDBIFBWETHVYUSDVFSDJB CFSDBVGZDGFCHGSDVYUFSDYVGASJDVG315/http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |archivedate=January 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fujitsu released a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;GreenIT.fr Feb. 2011; http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424020904/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 |date=April 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime. Another report from Gartner recommends to "Look for product longevity, including upgradability and modularity."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Mingay, Gartner: 10 Key Elements of a 'Green IT' Strategy;
{{cite web |url=http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730120749/http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, manufacturing a new PC makes a far bigger [[ecological footprint]] than manufacturing a new [[RAM]] module to upgrade an existing one.

===Data center design===
Data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy, accounting for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world’s total energy use in 2010 [1]. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings.&lt;ref name="https://energy.gov"&gt;“Best Practices Guide for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design”, prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy, Federal Energy Management Program, March 2011.[https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151305/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf |date=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center: from the IT equipment to the HVAC(Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment to the actual location, configuration and construction of the building.

The U.S. Department of Energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices:&lt;ref&gt;Koomey, Jonathon. “Growth in data center electricity use 2005 to 2010,” Oakland, CA: Analytics Press. August 1. {{cite web |url=http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111082558/http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information technology (IT) systems
* Environmental conditions
* Air management
* Cooling systems
* Electrical systems

Additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the U.S. Department of Energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat.&lt;ref&gt;Junaid Shuja, Abdullah Gani, Shahaboddin Shamshirband, Raja Wasim Ahmad, Kashif Bilal, Sustainable Cloud Data Centers: A survey of enabling techniques and technologies, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 195-214, ISSN 1364-0321, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.034&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data center’s space, and increase performance and efficiency.

In 2018, three new US Patents make use of facilities design to simultaneously cool and produce electrical power by use of internal and external waste heat. The three patents use silo design for stimulating use internal waste heat, while the recirculation of the air cooling the silo's computing racks. US Patent  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=4&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,510,486], uses the recirculating air for power generation, while sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,907,213], forces the recirculation of the same air, and sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 10,020,436], uses thermal differences in temperature resulting in negative power usage effectiveness.  Negative power usage effectiveness, makes use of extreme differences between temperatures at times running the computing facilities, that they would run only from external sources other than the power use for computing. 

===Software and deployment optimization===

====Algorithmic efficiency====
{{Main article|Algorithmic efficiency}}
{{Further|Analysis of algorithms}}
The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs.  Algorithm changes, such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero. &lt;!-- algorithmic efficiency personal example: I re-coded a SQL report query (that was run several times a day) that took 30 minutes to run in 15 seconds.  Impressive?  Sure!  Unusual?  Hardly.  I'm sure there are citeable examples.--&gt; In 2009, a study by a physicist at [[Harvard]] estimated that the average Google search released 7&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | title=Research reveals environmental impact of Google searches. | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | work=Fox News | date=January 12, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112195017/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | archive-date=January 12, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google disputed this figure, arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2&amp;nbsp;grams of CO₂.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | title=Powering a Google search | accessdate=October 1, 2009 | work=Official Google Blog | publisher=Google | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729054622/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | archive-date=July 29, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource allocation====
{{Main article|Resource allocation}}
Algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive. Researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs. The researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed. However, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; it reduces only the cost to the company using it. Nonetheless, a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way. A similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather; this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rear don |first= Marguerite |title= Energy-aware Internet routing coming soon |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |date= August 18, 2009 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110617075237/http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |archive-date= June 17, 2011 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available. Local availability of renewable energy, climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling, or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions.

Approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network/device management techniques are surveyed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Aruna Prem Bianzino |author2=Claude Chaudet |author3=Dario Rossi |author4=Jean-Louis Rougier|title=A Survey of Green Networking Research |arxiv= 1010.3880 |class=cs.NI|date= October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies, namely (i) Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), (ii) Interface Proxying, (iii) Energy Aware Infrastructure, and (iv) Max Energy Aware Applications.

====Virtualizing====
{{Main article|Platform virtualization}}
{{See also|Comparison of platform virtualization software}}
Computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for [[x86 architecture|x86]]-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] have also built proprietary [[x86 virtualization#Hardware support|virtualization enhancements]] to the x86 [[instruction set]] into each of their CPU product lines, in order to facilitate virtual computing.

New virtual technologies, such as [[Linux Containers]] can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a ore efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]], so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. &lt;ref&gt;Ismael Cuadrado-Cordero, Anne-Cécile Orgerie, Jean-Marc Menaud., [https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 “Comparative Experimental Analysis of the Quality-of-Service and Energy-Efficiency of VMs and Containers' Consolidation for Cloud Applications,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233816/https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 |date=June 28, 2018 }} International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2017), Sep 2017, Split, Croatia. pp.1-6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal servers====
{{Main article|Terminal server}}
Terminal servers have also been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a terminal connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with [[thin client]]s, which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include [[Terminal Services]] for Windows and the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP) for the [[Linux operating system]]. Software-based remote desktop clients such as [[Windows Remote Desktop]] and [[RealVNC]] can provide similar thin-client functions when run on low power, commodity hardware that connects to a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|title=Software or Hardware: The Future of Green Enterprise Computing|last=Kazandjieva|first=Maria|date=|work=|access-date=|last2=Heller|first2=Brandon|last3=Gnawali|first3=Omprakash|last4=Hofer|first4=Wanja|last5=Levis|first5=Philip|last6=Kozyrakis|first6=Christos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619190042/http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|archive-date=June 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power management===
{{Main article|Power management}}
The [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This allows a system to automatically turn off components such as [[computer display|monitors]] and [[hard drive]]s after set periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]], when most components (including the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor to an earlier Intel-Microsoft standard called [[Advanced Power Management]], which allows a computer's [[BIOS]] to control power management functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the CPU, which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called [[undervolting]]. Some CPUs can automatically undervolt the processor, depending on the workload; this technology is called "[[SpeedStep]]" on Intel processors, "[[PowerNow!]]"/"[[Cool'n'Quiet]]" on AMD chips, [[LongHaul]] on [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] CPUs, and [[LongRun]] with [[Transmeta]] processors.

====Data center power====
Data centers, which have been criticized for their extraordinarily high energy demand, are a primary focus for proponents of green computing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceGCS9"&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey Power Management Techniques for Data Centers: A Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114005435/http://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey |date=November 14, 2017 }}", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kurp, Patrick."Green Computing," ''Communications of the ACM''51(10):11.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[Greenpeace]] study, data centers represent 21% of the electricity consumed by the IT sector, which is about 382 billion kWh a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|title=CLICKING CLEAN: WHO IS WINNING  THE RACE TO BUILD  A GREEN INTERNET|last=Greenpeace|first=|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706161712/https://storage.googleapis.com/p4-production-content/international/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/35f0ac1a-clickclean2016-hires.pdf|archive-date=July 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization. Many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers, which results in lower energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211120149/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 11 February 2011|title= Is Green IT Over?|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|title= Towards Green Computing Application for Measuring the Sustainability of Data Centers: An Analytical Survey, Zohreh Gandomi, Salmiah Amin|publisher= SDIWC Digital Library|access-date= November 1, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402210100/http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. federal government has set a minimum 10% reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; With the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology, Google Inc. has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50% of that of the industry average.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Operating system support====
&lt;!-- Needs Mac and Linux coverage. Also, this may be too detailed for a summary--&gt;
Microsoft Windows, has included limited [[PC power management]] features since Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |title=Windows 95 Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311193319/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) and support for the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include power management. This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced [[Group Policy]], a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, power management was not one of those features. This is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown |title=Windows power-saving options are, bizarrely, stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127034201/http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown/ |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings.

This approach, which is not compatible with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |title=How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127051214/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |archive-date=November 27, 2006 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this section, while quite possibly true, sounded like OR so I cut it out. In fact, the treehugger source is basically a blog... can we do better? Any mainstream media coverage of criticism for this decision? --&gt; Microsoft significantly improved this in Windows Vista&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/CPA075_WH06.ppt |title=Windows Vista Power Management Changes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110818/http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/CPA075_WH06.ppt |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by redesigning the power management system to allow basic configuration by Group Policy. The support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for [[timer coalescing]], [[processor power management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/ProcPowerMgmtWin7.mspx |title=Windows 7 Processor Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015949/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/procpowermgmtwin7.mspx |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |title=Windows 7 Timer Coalescing |access-date=April 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416215821/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |archive-date=April 16, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and display panel brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.

====Power supply====
Desktop [[computer power supply|computer power supplies]]  are in general 70–75% efficient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/02/28/strong_showing/page38.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216144500/http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/02/28/strong_showing/page38.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 16, 2012 |title=Strong Showing: High-Performance Power Supply Units |last=Schuhmann |first=Daniel |date=February 28, 2005 |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=Tom's Hardware }}&lt;/ref&gt; dissipating the remaining energy as heat. A certification program called [[80 Plus]] certifies PSUs that are at least 80% efficient; typically these models are drop-in replacements for older, less efficient PSUs of the same form factor. As of July 20, 2007, all new Energy Star 4.0-certified desktop PSUs must be at least 80% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers |title=Computer Key Product Criteria |publisher=Energy Star |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |date=July 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074314/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=computers.pr_crit_computers |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent case study, [[Fusion-io]], manufacturer of solid state storage devices, managed to reduce the energy use and operating costs of [[MySpace]] data centers by 80% while increasing performance speeds beyond that which had been attainable via multiple hard disk drives in Raid 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Media Galleries Temporarily Disabled |url=http://community.fusionio.com/media/p/458/download.aspx |title=Media Galleries Temporarily Disabled - Fusion-io Community Forum |publisher=Community.fusionio.com |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, MySpace was able to retire several of their servers.

As hard drive prices have fallen, storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage IBM chief engineer talks green storage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502041656/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage |date=May 2, 2013 }}, SearchStorage - TechTarget&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video card====
A fast [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] may be the largest power consumer in a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html |title=Faster, Quieter, Lower: Power Consumption and Noise Level of Contemporary Graphics Cards |publisher=X-bit labs |date=July 30, 2006 |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904054636/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/power-noise.html |archivedate=September 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient [[video card|display]] options include:
* No video card - use a shared terminal, shared [[thin client]], or [[desktop sharing]] software if display required.
* Use motherboard video output - typically low 3D performance and low power.
* Select a GPU based on low idle power, average wattage, or [[performance per watt]].

====Display====
Unlike other display technologies, [[electronic paper]] does not use any power while displaying an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Heikenfeld | title = A critical review of the present and future prospects for electronic paper | journal = J.

They also contain significant amounts of lead. [[LCD monitor]]s typically use a [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode fluorescent bulb]] to provide light for the display. Some newer displays use an array of [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) in place of the fluorescent bulb, which reduces the amount of electricity used by the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/464080 |title=Cree LED Backlight Solution Lowers Power Consumption of LCD Displays |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207075733/http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/464080 |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fluorescent back-lights also contain mercury, whereas LED back-lights do not.

===Materials recycling===
{{Main article|Electronic waste | computer recycling | Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive}}

Recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead, mercury, and hexavalent chromium out of [[landfill]]s, and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured, saving further energy and emissions. Computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed, or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503011722/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |title=Reuse your electronics through donation » Earth 911 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=PC Magazine |volume=26 |issue=17 |date=September 4, 2007 |title=15 Ways to Reinvent Your PC |last=Delaney |first=John |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |access-date=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502215811/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1004542&amp;highlight= |title=Staples Launches Nationwide Computer and Office Technology Recycling Program |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Staples, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725070137/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |title=Goodwill Teams with Electronic Recyclers to Recycle eWaste |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Earth 911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and municipal or private recycling centers. Computing supplies, such as [[Ink cartridges|printer cartridges]], [[paper recycling|paper]], and [[battery recycling|batteries]] may be recycled as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ink cartridges#Refilled and 3rd party ink cartridges|Refilled ink cartridges]], [[paper recycling]], [[battery recycling]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawback to many of these schemes is that computers gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to [[developing countries]] where environmental standards are less strict than in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Green Tech: Reduce, Reuse, That's It |last=Segan |first=Sascha |journal=PC Magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |volume=26 |issue=19 |page=56 |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025050427/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2183977,00.asp |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition]] estimates that 80% of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as [[China]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash |last=Royte |first=Elizabeth |pages=169–170 |year=2006 |publisher=Back Bay Books |isbn=0-316-73826-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the collection rate of e-waste is still very low, even in the most ecology-responsible countries like France. In this country, e-waste collection is still at a 14% annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |title=e-waste take-back still very low |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |publisher=GreenIT.fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213031911/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |archive-date=February 13, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and credit card numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if there is more than one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |title=Green Computing and Privacy Issues |publisher=MySecureCyberspace |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028214220/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud computing===
{{Main article| Cloud computing }}
Cloud computing addresses two major ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and [[resource consumption]]. [[Virtualization]], [[Dynamic provisioning environment]], multi-tenancy, green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |title= Microsoft-backed research suggests big energy reductions from cloud |publisher= ZDNet |date= November 4, 2010 |accessdate= September 3, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073045/http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |archive-date= December 8, 2015 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common example includes [[Online shopping]] that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.&lt;ref name="Google Scholar Citations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=tWRIBtoAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=tWRIBtoAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC|title=Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.com.pk|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge Computing===
{{Main article| Edge computing }}
New technologies such as [[Edge computing| Edge]] and [[Fog computing]] are a solution to reducing energy consumption. These technologies allow redistributing computation near the use, thus reducing energy costs in the network.&lt;ref&gt;Cuadrado-Cordero, Ismael, [http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 “Microclouds: an approach for a network-aware energy-efficient decentralised cloud,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233846/http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 |date=June 28, 2018 }} PhD thesis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, having smaller data centers, the energy used in operations such as refrigerating and maintenance gets largely reduced. 

===Telecommuting===
{{Main article|Telecommuting}}
[[Teleconference|Teleconferencing]] and [[telepresence]] technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130237/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |format=PDF|title=EPA Office Building Energy Use Profile |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related initiatives, such as [[Hoteling]], reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|title=What Is Green IT?|access-date=March 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415091508/http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|archive-date=April 15, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.

[[Voice over Internet Protocol|Voice over IP (VoIP)]] reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing Ethernet copper. VoIP and phone extension mobility also made [[hot desking]] more practical.

===Telecommunication network devices energy indices===
The information and communication technologies (ICTs) energy consumption, in the USA and worldwide, has been estimated respectively at 9.4% and 5.3% of the total electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507123122/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption of ICTs is today significant even when compared with other industries. Some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices (network elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Virgilio |last1=Puglia |title=Energy indices for environmental sustainability |journal=International Journal of Technology Marketing |date=January 2013 |volume=8 |issue=1/2013 |url=http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530121855/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself. The target was to  allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect. These studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary.

As a complement to the TOP500, the unveiling of the Green500 ushered in a new era where supercomputers can be compared by performance-per-watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.green500.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826075608/http://www.green500.org/ |archive-date=August 26, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tsubame (supercomputer)|TSUBAME-KFC-GSIC Center]] by Tokyo Institute of Technology, Made in Japan was with a great advantage to the second, the Top 1 Supercomputer in the World with 4,503.17 MFLOPS/W and 27.78 Total Power (kW)++

Today a new supercomputer, [[L-CSC]] from the [[GSI Helmholtz Center]], Made in Germany emerged as the most energy-efficient (or greenest) supercomputer in the world. The L-CSC cluster was the first and only supercomputer on the list to surpass 5 gigaflops/watt (billions of operations per second per watt). L-CSC is a heterogeneous supercomputer that is powered by Dual Intel Xeon E5-260 and GPU accelerators, namely AMD FirePro™ S9150 GPUs. It marks the first time that a supercomputer using AMD GPUs has held the top spot. Each server has a memory of 256 gigabytes. Connected, the server via an Infiniband FDR network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3106">'''H-Soz-u-Kult''' (''Humanities – Sozial und Kulturgeschichte'') is an
online information and communication platform for [[historian]]s which disseminates academic news and publications.

The project is committed to the principles of [[open access]] and community network. Since its founding in 1996 the central editorial office is located at the History Department of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] of [[Berlin]]. H-Soz-u-Kult is part of [[H-Net]] and one of the most important online communication and information services for Historians in the [[DACH|German-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;Karsten Borgmann: ''[http://www.clio-online.de/site/mid__11386/ModeID__0/PageID__285/40208211/default.aspx Clio-online. Nutzungsanalyse von Online-Angeboten in den Geschichtswissenschaften. Ergebnisse einer Umfrage: Bekanntheit und qualitative Bewertung von Fachangeboten (1)]''. Clio-online, 18. September 2006 (08.29.2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is read by more than 20,000 [[Electronic mailing list|email subscribers]] in over 70 countries. In 2012, around one million page views by up to 210,000 unique visitors were registered per month on the website.&lt;ref&gt;http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/index.asp?type=informationen&amp;name=mediadaten&amp;pn=about&lt;/ref&gt;

H-Soz-u-Kult publishes a wide range of [[book review]]s, conference reports, job offers, scholarships, tables of contents of [[academic journal]]s, literature reports and other news from the historical science community. Most publications are in German but the number of English publications continually increases. The book reviews are the main emphasis of H-Soz-u-Kult – more than 12,000 reviews were accessible on its website in 2013. H-Soz-u-Kult’s main editorial office at the [[Humboldt University]] of Berlin is supported by a pro bono editorial staff which consists of over 40 researchers from almost all fields of historical science.

H-Soz-u-Kult is a part of [[Clio-online]], a partner in a wide range of other academic projects, and was supported by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] for many years. The editorial range has been augmented with contributions from the complementary forums history.transnational&lt;ref&gt;http://geschichte-transnational.clio-online.net/transnat.asp?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; and zeitgeschichte-online&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeitgeschichte-online.de/&lt;/ref&gt; since 2004 and infoclio.ch&lt;ref&gt;http://infoclio.ch/en&lt;/ref&gt; since 2009.

Current articles from the academic world can be accessed via H-Soz-u-Kult’s website, email and RSS-feeds. 

H-Soz-u-Kult is the official media partner of the [[German Union of Historians]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4988">'''Heisler charts''' are a graphical analysis tool for the evaluation of [[heat transfer]] in thermal engineering. They are a set of two charts per included geometry introduced in 1947 by M. P. Heisler&lt;ref&gt;Transactions ASME, 69, 227-236, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; which were supplemented by a third chart per geometry in 1961 by H. Gröber.  Heisler charts permit evaluation of the central temperature for transient [[heat conduction]] through an infinitely long plane wall of thickness 2&lt;var&gt;L&lt;/var&gt;, an infinitely long cylinder of radius r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and a sphere of radius r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Although Heisler-Gröber charts are a faster and simpler alternative to the exact solutions of these problems, there are some limitations.  First, the body must be at uniform temperature initially. Additionally, the temperature of the surroundings and the convective [[heat transfer coefficient]] must remain constant and uniform. Also, there must be no heat generation from the body itself.&lt;ref name ="Cengel"&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. (2007). Heat and Mass Transfer: A Practical Approach (3rd edition ed.). McGraw Hill. pp. 231-236. {{ISBN|978-0-07-312930-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/erlaurito/unsteady-state-basics-presentation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/17462198/Heat-conduction-in-cylinder&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infinitely long plane wall==
These first Heisler-Gröber charts were based upon the first term of the exact [[Fourier Series]] solution for an infinite plane wall:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T(x,t)-T_\infty}{T_i-T_\infty}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\left[\frac{4\sin{\lambda_n}}{2\lambda_n+\sin{2\lambda_n}}e^{-\lambda_n^2\frac{\alpha t}{L^2}}\cos{ \frac{\lambda_n x}{L}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is the initial temperature of the slab, ''T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the constant temperature imposed at the boundary, ''x'' is the location in the plane wall, ''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''π(n+1/2)'', and ''α'' is [[thermal diffusivity]]. The position ''x''=0 represents the center of the slab.

The first chart for the plane wall is plotted using 3 different variables. Plotted along the vertical axis of the chart is dimensionless temperature at the midplane, &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \frac{T(0,t)-T_\infty}{T_i-T_\infty}&lt;/math&gt;  . Plotted along the horizontal axis is the [[Fourier Number]], ''Fo=αt/L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' .  The curves within the graph are a selection of values for the inverse of the [[Biot Number]], where "''Bi = hL/k''.  ''k'' is the thermal conductivity of the material and ''h'' is the heat transfer coefficient."&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

&lt;ref name ="Lee"&gt;Lee Ho Sung, http://www.mae.wmich.edu/faculty/Lee/me431/ch05_supp_heisler.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chart is used to determine the variation of temperature within the plane wall for different Biot Numbers. The vertical axis is the ratio of a given temperature to that at the centerline ''&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;= \frac{T(x,t)-T_\infty}{T(0,t)-T_\infty}&lt;/math&gt; where the ''x/L'' curve is the position at which ''T'' is taken. The horizontal axis is the value of ''Bi&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''.


The third chart in each set was supplemented by Gröber in 1961 and this particular one shows the dimensionless heat transferred from the wall as a function of a dimensionless time variable. The vertical axis is a plot of ''Q/Q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', the ratio of actual heat transfer to the amount of total possible heat transfer before ''T=T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' . On the horizontal axis is the plot of ''(Bi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(Fo)'', a dimensionless time variable.

==Infinitely long cylinder==
For the infinitely long cylinder, the Heisler chart is based on the first term in an exact solution to a [[Bessel function]].&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

Each chart plots similar curves to the previous examples, and on each axis is plotted a similar variable.

==Sphere (of radius r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)==
The Heisler chart for a sphere is based on the first term in the exact [[Fourier series]] solution:

&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

These charts can be used similar to the first two sets and are plots of similar variables.

==Modern alternatives==
Currently there are programs that provide numerical solutions to the same problems, without using transcendental functions or infinite series. Examples of these programs can be found  [http://faculty.virginia.edu/ribando/modules/OneDTransient/index.htm here].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.virginia.edu/ribando/modules/OneDTransient/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''image''' (from {{lang-la|imago}}) is an artifact that depicts [[visual perception]], for example, a [[photo]] or a [[two-dimensional]] '''picture''', that has a similar appearance to some [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]—usually a physical object or a [[person]], thus providing a [[depiction]] of it. In context of image signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/MSP.2018.2832195|title = What is a Signal? &amp;#91;Lecture Notes&amp;#93;| journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine| volume=35| issue=5| pages=175–177|date = September 2018|last1 = Chakravorty|first1 = Pragnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Tourism in London795.jpg|thumb]]
Images may be two-[[dimensional]], such as a [[photograph]] or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a [[statue]] or [[hologram]]. They may be captured by [[optics|optical]] devices – such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the [[human eye]] or water.

The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a [[map]], a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]], a [[pie chart]], or a [[Painting (object)|painting]]. In this wider sense, images can also be ''rendered'' manually, such as by [[drawing]], the [[painting|art of painting]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], rendered automatically by [[printing]] or [[computer graphics]] technology, or [[Image development (visual arts)|developed]] by a combination of methods, especially in a [[pseudo-photograph]].

A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a [[camera obscura]], or a scene displayed on a [[cathode ray tube]].  A fixed image, also called a [[hard copy]],  is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as [[paper]] or [[textile]] by [[photography]] or any other digital process.

A [[mental image]] exists in an individual's mind, as something one remembers or imagines.  The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a [[graph theory|graph]], function, or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity. For example, [[Sigmund Freud]] claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of [[sound art]] have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis.
There are Two Types of Images
a. Still Image 
b. Moving Image

===Still or moving===
[[File:en-wikipedia.jpg|thumb]]
A ''still image'' is a single [[wikt:static|static]] image. This phrase is used in [[photography]], visual [[Electronic media|media]] and the [[computer industry]] to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a [[Standardization|standard]].

A ''moving image'' is typically a movie ([[film]]) or [[video]], including [[digital video]]. It could also be an [[animation|animated display]] such as a [[zoetrope]].

A [[still frame]] is a still image derived from one [[Film frame|frame]] of a moving one. In contrast, a [[film still]] is a photograph taken on the set of a movie or television program during production, used for promotional purposes.

== Imagery (literary term) ==
{{main|Imagery}}
In literature, imagery is a "mental picture" which appeals to the senses.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chris Baldick |date=2008 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA165 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=165– |isbn=978-0-19-920827-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed}} It can both be figurative and literal.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; &lt;!-- This paragraph needs an example of imagery--&gt;

A '''kerb crawler''' (or [[curb (road)|curb]] crawler) is a person who drives around areas known for [[street prostitution]] [[soliciting]] [[prostitution|prostitutes]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The act is known as "kerb crawling" because the person will typically drive very slowly along the [[kerb (road)|kerbside]]. 

Where prostitution is illegal, kerb crawlers are widely regarded as a [[public nuisance]]: they help keep street prostitutes in business in [[red-light district]]s and often [[solicit]] [[pedestrian]]s who are not prostitutes for sex. As a result, kerb-crawling is illegal in many [[jurisdiction]]s.

[[Sting operation]]s in which [[undercover police]] wait for kerb crawlers to [[proposition]] them are a common method for tackling kerb crawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Amelia |title=The policewomen who pose as prostitutes to trap kerb crawlers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/15/ukcrime.gender |website=The Guardian |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=15 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerb crawling is illegal in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution laws around the world |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/128029/at-a-glance-prostitution-laws/ |website=Global News |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="cps" /&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US Federal and State Prostitution Laws and Related Punishments |url=https://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000119 |website=prostitution.procon.org |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Ian |title=Research Projects |url=https://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/research-projects/prostitution |website=Imagining Urban Futures |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution in India and it's legal analysis |url=http://www.lawyersclubindia.com/articles/Prostitution-in-India-and-it-s-legal-analysis--9151.asp |website=Lawyers Club India |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police may also collect [[Vehicle registration plate|licence-plate number]]s of vehicles that appear to be kerb crawling and may contact their [[Vehicle registration|registered]] owners. 

Following the recommendations of the 1984 [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] report ''Prostitution on the Street'', the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Sexual Offences Act 1985]] introduced an offence of kerb crawling to persistently solicit women for the purposes of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Offences Act 1985 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/44/pdfs/ukpga_19850044_en.pdf |website=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=29 November 2018 |quote=Section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulnerable"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Phil |last2=Scoular |first2=Jane |editor1-last=Canter |editor1-first=D |editor2-last=Ioannou |editor2-first=M |editor3-last=Youngs |editor3-first=D |title=Safer Sex in the City: The Experience and Management of Street Prostitution |date=2010 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=0754626156 |pages=135-153 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1057567710373119 |language=en |chapter=Making the vulnerable more vulnerable?

==John schools==
{{main|John school}}
A John school is a form of educational intervention aimed at clients of [[prostitution|prostitutes]], who are informally known as 'johns' in North America. John schools are usually a [[diversion program]] for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for [[solicitation|soliciting]] the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation.

Whether the John school is a [[diversion program]] or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within [[red light districts]]. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with [[prostitution]], the [[sexually transmitted disease]] risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1998-11/s-boddy.html "John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution"] by Sharon Boddy, ''Peace and Environment News'', November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519,hunter,63812,5.html "School for Johns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918062417/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519%2Chunter%2C63812%2C5.html |date=2007-09-18 }} by Aina Hunter, ''[[Village Voice]]'', May 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies''' ('''MA-MISS''') is a miniaturized [[imaging spectrometer]] designed to provide imaging and spectra by reflectance in the [[near-infrared]] (NIR) wavelength region and determine the mineral composition and [[stratigraphy]]. The instrument is part of the science payload onboard the European [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s, and scheduled to [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in 2021. MA-MISS is essentially inside a drill on the Rover, and will take measurements of the sub-surface directly.

MA-MISS will help on the search for biosignatures by studying minerals and ices ''in situ'' before the collection of samples. The instrument is integrated within the Italian [[core drill]] system called DEEDRI, and it will be dedicated to ''in situ'' studies of the mineralogy inside the excavated holes in terms of visible and infrared spectral reflectance.&lt;ref name='Vago 2017'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2016.1541 Ma_MISS on ExoMars: Mineralogical Characterization of the Martian Subsurface].

==Objectives==

The [[ExoMars|ExoMars programme]] is an [[astrobiology]] project focused on the search for [[biosignature]]s in the subsurface of Mars, and to better understand the geological evolution and [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] of Mars. The study of the Martian subsurface will provide important constraints on the nature, timing and duration of alteration and sedimentation processes on Mars, as well as on the complex interactions between the surface and the atmosphere. The stated objectives of the MA-MISS experiment are: &lt;ref name='Vago 2017'/&gt; 
*Determine the composition of subsurface materials.
*Map the distribution of subsurface [[Water on Mars|water]] and {{chem|CO|2}} ices.
*Characterize grain size.
*Reconstruct a [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] column for clues on subsurface geological processes.

{{Sociology|state=collapsed}}
'''Marxist sociology''' is the study of [[sociology]] from a [[Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism itself can be recognized as both a [[political philosophy]] and a [[sociology]], particularly so far as it attempts to remain [[Scientific method|scientific, systematic]], and objective rather than purely [[normative]] and [[:wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]]. Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]."&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ Marxist Sociology], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology would come to facilitate the developments of [[critical theory]] and [[cultural studies]] as loosely distinct disciplines.

== Concepts and issues ==

Key concepts of Marxist sociology include [[historical materialism]], [[Mode of production|modes of production]], and the relation between [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labour]].&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt; Marxist sociology is primarily concerned with, but not limited to, the relations between society and economics.&lt;ref name="section"/&gt; Marxist Sociology is also concerned with the way in which police forces are used to control indigenous polulations, enslaved peoples, and the laboring poor in the name of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1028737741|title=Police : a field guide|last=1968-|first=Correia, David,|others=Wall, Tyler,|isbn=9781786630148|location=London|oclc=1028737741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key questions asked by Marxist sociologists include:&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;
* How does capital control workers?
* How does a mode of production influence the [[social class]]?
* What is the relation between workers, capital, [[State (polity)|the state]] and [[culture]]?
* How do economic factors influence inequalities such as those relating to [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]?
*What role do police play within Marxist Socialism?

Within the field of [[sociological theory]], Marxist sociology is recognized as one of the major [[sociological paradigm]]s and is associated with conflict theory and critical theory. Unlike [[Marxism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]], Marxist sociology has put relatively little weight on creating [[class revolution]],&lt;ref name="black"/&gt; pursuing instead the development of an objective, [[Political economy|politico-economic]] study of society rather than a critical philosophy of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt; It may be seen as a field of [[economic sociology]].

== Historical development ==
{{hatnote|References for this section:&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictbot"&gt;Tom B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist thought'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1991 (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-631-18082-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4QwNP_K1pYC&amp;pg=PA506 p. 505-08 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. Much of the development in the field of Marxist sociology occurred on the outskirts of academia, pitting Marxist against "[[bourgeois]]" sociology.

For a while, this division was reinforced by the Marxism-inspired [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], which led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]]; soon, however, sociology found itself a victim of the [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union#Sociology|suppression of "bourgeois" science]] in the communist states. While, after several decades, sociology was reestablished in communist states, two separate currents of thought evolved within Marxist sociology: [[Soviet Marxism]], developed in the communist states (primarily the [[Soviet Union]]) of the 20th century, serving the state's interests and significantly crippled by forced adherence to the [[dogma]] of [[historical materialism]]; and the more independent school centered on the studies of Marxism in [[Western world|the West]]. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]].

Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see, for example, [[Sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see, for example, [[Sociology in China]]).

'''Max Horkheimer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɔːr|k|ˌ|h|aɪ|m|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhɔɐ̯kˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who was famous for his work in [[critical theory]] as a member of the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of social research. Horkheimer addressed [[authoritarianism]], militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of [[mass culture]] using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include ''[[Eclipse of Reason (Horkheimer)|Eclipse of Reason]]'' (1947), ''Between Philosophy and Social Science'' (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with [[Theodor Adorno]], ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;"Horkheimer, Max". ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences''. Craig Calhoun, ed. Oxford University Press 2002. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. College of the Holy Cross. 14 October 2009 &lt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t104.e767]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
On February 14, 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy [[Orthodox Jewish]] family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of [[Stuttgart]], where Max was born.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Berendzen, J.C., "Max Horkheimer", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/horkheimer/]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max's closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, who was his father's personal secretary. Eight years Max's senior, a gentile, and of an economically lower class, Riekher (whom Max called "Maidon") was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/horkheimer/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Berendzen|first=J.C.|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"&gt;Reason, Nostalgia, and Eschatology in the Critical Theory of Max Horkheimer Brian J. Shaw The Journal of Politics, Vol. 47, No. 1 (Feb., 1985), pp. 160–181.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horkheimer was denied service on medical grounds.

===Education===
In the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical,&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Horkheimer enrolled at [[Munich University]]. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Horkheimer, Max - Oxford Reference|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001/acref-9780199532919-e-330|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released, Horkheimer moved to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] under the respectable [[Hans Cornelius]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There, he met [[Theodor Adorno]], several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt [[psychology]], Horkheimer, with Cornelius's direction, completed his doctorate in [[philosophy]] with a 78-page dissertation titled ''The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment'' (''Zur Antinomie der teleologischen Urteilskraft'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sica 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan. ''Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to The Present''. Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Horkheimer was [[habilitation|habilitated]] with a dissertation entitled ''Kant's Critique of Judgement as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy'' (''Über Kants Kritik der Urteilskraft als Bindeglied zwischen theoretischer und praktischer Philosophie''). Here, he met [[Friedrich Pollock]] who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed ''[[Privatdozent]].'' Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.&lt;ref name="Sica 2005"/&gt;

===Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung)===
In 1926 Horkheimer was an "unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt." Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]]. In the same year, when the [[Institute for Social Research]]'s (now known as Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) directorship became vacant, after the departure of [[Carl Grünberg]], Horkheimer was elected to the position "by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman".&lt;ref name="Sica, Alan 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan., ed. 2005. Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to the Present. Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute had had its beginnings in a [[Marxist]] study group started by [[Felix Weil]], a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the Institute.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Horkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise.&lt;ref name="Callinicos, Alex T 2007"&gt;Callinicos, Alex T. 2007. Social Theory: A Historical Introduction. 2nd ed. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he changed Frankfurt from an orthodox Marxist school to a heterodox school for critical social research .&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray. ed. 2003. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Ltd. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year publication of the Institute's ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' began, with Horkheimer as its editor.&lt;ref name="marxists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/o.htm#horkheimer-max |title=Glossary of People: Ho |publisher=marxists.org|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the Institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis.

During the time between Horkheimer's being named Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930, the Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In the midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis' rise, Horkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the Institute out of Germany.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Horkheimer's ''[[venia legendi]]'' was revoked by the new [[Nazi]] government because of the Marxian nature of the Institute's ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. When Hitler was named the Chancellor in 1933,&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; the Institute was thus forced to close its location in Germany. He emigrated to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] and then to [[New York City]] the following year, where Horkheimer met with the president of [[Columbia University]] to discuss hosting the Institute. To Horkheimer's surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the Institute.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6063 |title=Biography of Horkheimer at MIT Press |publisher=mitpress.mit.edu |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008093915/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6063 |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George. 2011. Sociological Theory. 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1934 Horkheimer accepted an offer from Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their buildings.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

In 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]] district of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]].'' In 1942, Horkheimer assumed the directorship of the Scientific Division of the American Jewish Committee. In this capacity, he helped launch and organize a series of five Studies in Prejudice, which were published in 1949 and 1950. The most important of these was the pioneering study in social psychology entitled The Authoritarian Personality, itself a methodologically advanced reworking of some of the themes treated in a collective project produced by the Institute in its first years of exile, Studies in Authority and Family.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Martin. "Max Horkheimer (1895-1973)." ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'' 47 (1973): 219-20. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3129918&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science'' as a continuation of the ''Zeitschrift.'' In 1949, he returned to Frankfurt where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the Institute, while Adorno became director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/horkheimer.htm Biography of Horkheimer at University of Haifa]&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno were seen as the fathers of the Institute.

===Later years===
Horkheimer continued to teach at the University until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and was later named honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/horkheimer/|title=Max Horkheimer (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to America in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]].

===Legacy===
He remained an important figure until his death in [[Nuremberg]] in 1973. Max Horkheimer with the help of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, Otto Kirchheimer, Frederick Pollock and Neumann developed "Critical Theory". According to Larry Ray "Critical Theory" has "become one of the most influential social theories of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray (eds.). 2003. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Ltd. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horkheimer's thought==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Horkheimer's work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In this, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both [[neo-Kantianism]] (with its focus on concepts) and ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' (with its focus on expression and [[World disclosure|world-disclosure]]). Horkheimer did not think either was wrong, but insisted that the insights of each school on their own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures, and individual realities, concluding that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the market place. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

===Critical theory===
Through [[critical theory]] (a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society), Horkheimer "attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism" and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture.&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; Horkheimer helped to create Critical Theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in "pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism".&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; Horkheimer developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980"&gt;Held, David. 1980. Introduction to Critical Theory: Horkheimer to Habermas. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convinced of the need to "examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind"&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that "the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence" was necessary along with a society that could "satisfy common needs".&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; To satisfy these needs, it would need to engage with the social conditions within which people lived and in which their concepts and actions were formed. It reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a "critique of bourgeois society through which 'ideology critique' attempted to locate the 'utopian content' of dominant systems of thought".&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996"&gt;Elliott, Anthony and Larry Ray, ed. 1996. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980"/&gt;

Horkheimer's book, ''Eclipse of Reason'', published in 1947, is broken into five sections: Means and Ends, Conflicting Panaceas, The Revolt of Nature, The Rise and Decline of the Individual, and On the Concept of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com" /&gt; The 'Eclipse of Reason focuses on the concept of reason within the history of [[western philosophy]], which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking while also linking positivist and instrumental reason with the rise of fascism.&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996" /&gt; He distinguishes between [[objectivity (science)|objective]], [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Instrumental rationality|instrumental]] reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant – the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be "reasonable" in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be "good for something else". This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes [[ideology]]. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). Because subjective/instrumental reason rules, the [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] of a society, for example [[democratic ideals]], become dependent on the "interests" of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. In his writing Horkheimer states, "Social power is today more than ever mediated by power over things. The more intense an individual's concern with power over things, the more will things dominate him, the more will he lack any genuine individual traits, and the more will his mind be transformed into an automation of formalized reason."&lt;ref&gt;Sica, Alan 2005. "Social Thought : From the Enlightenment to The Present." (p. 542-546). Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Horkheimer admits that objective reason has its roots in Reason ("[[Logos]]" in Greek) of the subject. He concludes, "If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate – in short, the emancipation from fear – then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render."&lt;ref&gt;Eclipse of Reason, Seabury Press, 1974 [1941]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuzj9LLrKlgC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=max+horkheimer#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Eclipse of Reason| isbn=9780826400093| last1=Horkheimer| first1=Max| date=1974-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Horkheimer outlined how the [[Nazis]] had been able to make their agenda appear "reasonable", but also issued a warning about the possibility of a similar occurrence happening again. Horkheimer believed that the illnesses of modern society are caused by misunderstanding reason: if people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to solve problems they may have.

Despite the explicit common referrals to "subjective" reason in the book, his frequent connecting of it with [[relativism]] could be an indication that by "subjective reason" Horkheimer also means "relativist reason".

==== Between philosophy and social science ====
"Between Philosophy and Social Science" appeared between 1930 and 1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: "Materialism and Morality", "The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research", "On the Problem of Truth", "Egoism and the Freedom Movement", "History and Psychology", "A New Concept of Ideology", "Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology", and "The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy". It also included "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research", "Egoism and Freedom Movements" and "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History". The essays within "Between Philosophy and Social Science" were Horkheimer's attempts to "remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the [[commodification]] of everything".&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957"&gt;W. G. Regier MLN, Vol. 110, No. 4, Comparative Literature Issue (Sep., 1995), pp. 953-957 Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. In one of his writings, he states, "When we speak of an individual as a historical entity, we mean not merely the space-time and the sense existence of a particular member of the human race, but in addition, his awareness of his own individuality as a conscious human being, including recognition of his own identity.".&lt;ref&gt;Sica, Alan. 2005. "Social Thought : From the Enlightenment to The Present". (p. 542-546). Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer was a strong believer in individuals becoming aware of themselves and their conscious as human beings. This is important to Horkheimer because for workers, he is aware of individuals losing their identity in products, which affects the power an individual may have of him/herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. 2010. "Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings." (p. 208-212). Westview Press, A Member of the Perseus Books Group&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research" was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer's inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well.&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt;

"Egoism and Freedom Movements" and "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained "what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving.&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt;

The volume also looks at the individual as the "troubled center of philosophy." Horkheimer expressed that "there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time".&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt; To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself.

==== ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' ====
Max Horkheimer and [[Theodor Adorno]] collaborated to publish ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', which was originally published in 1944. The inspiration for this piece came from when Horkheimer and Adorno had to flee Germany, because of Hitler, and go to New York. They went to America and "absorbed the popular culture"; thinking that it was a form of totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. 2008. "Slamming Society: Critical Theory and Situationism." p.106 in ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Don Mills&lt;!--publisher--&gt;; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Dialectic of Enlightenment's main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the "self-destruction of enlightenment".&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996" /&gt; The work criticized popular culture as "the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing" (Lembert). Along with that, Horkheimer and Adorno had a few arguments; one being that these mass-produced products only appear to change over time. Horkheimer and Adorno stated that these products were so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They expressed, "the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 [1944]). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products within the same area are acceptable.&lt;ref name="Lembert, Charles 2010"&gt;Lembert, Charles. 2010. ''Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings''. 4th ed. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar patterns found in the content of popular culture (films, popular songs and radio) have the same central message; "it's all linked to "the necessity of obedience of the masses to the social hierarchy in place in advanced capitalist societies".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. 2008. "Slamming Society: Critical Theory and Situationism." p. 107 in ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Don Mills&lt;!--publisher--&gt;; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These products appeal to the masses and encourage conformity to the consumers. In return, capitalism remains in power while buyers continue to consume from the industry. This is dangerous because the consumers' belief that the powers of technology are liberating, starts to increase. To support their claim, Horkheimer and Adorno, "proposed an antidote: not just thinking the relations of things, but also, as an immediate second step, thinking through that thinking, self-reflectively". In other words, technology lacks self-reflectivity. Nonetheless, Horkheimer and Adorno believed that art was an exception because it "is an open-ended system with no fixed rules"; thus, it could not be an object of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Noel and Stuart Sim., ed. 1997. The A Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists. Prentice Hall: London. pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Perry Anderson]] sees Horkheimer's attempt to make the Institute purely academic as "symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a 'Western Marxism' divorced from the working-class movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the 'product of defeat'" because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggerhaus, author of ''The Frankfurt School'' believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Lukács and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, "Social Theory", Alex Callinicos claims that ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent.&lt;ref name="Callinicos, Alex T 2007"/&gt; Charles Lemert discusses in his book ''Social Theory'' that in writing ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.&lt;ref name="Lembert, Charles 2010"/&gt;

'''Muskingum University''' is a private liberal arts college located in [[New Concord, Ohio]], United States. It is located approximately sixty miles east of the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Chartered in 1837 as Muskingum College, the institution is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].

Collectively, the university's alumni are referred to as the "Long Magenta Line" and students (both past and present) are known simply as "Muskies" while its athletic teams are called the "Fighting Muskies". [[New Concord, Ohio]] is located in far eastern [[Muskingum County, Ohio|Muskingum County]], which derives its name from the [[Muskingum River]]. Muskingum offers more than 40 academic majors. Graduate programs are offered in education and management information systems, strategy and technology. Muskingum's campus consists of 21  buildings, a football stadium and a small lake, which all sit atop {{convert|225|acre|km2}} of rolling hills overlooking New Concord.

==History==
In 1827, the [[National Road]] (now [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|US 40]]) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as [[Zane's Trace]]. A year later, the village of [[New Concord, Ohio]] was established by Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterians]]. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the ''"Friends of Education"'' in New Concord, led by New Concord residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held. A year later, the [[Ohio General Assembly]] authorized the creation of a college in [[New Concord, OH]] after being petitioned by the ''"Friends of Education"'' committee. On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened. Muskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854. In 1958, the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]] and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] merged by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel on Muskingum's campus. In 2001, the school's women's [[softball]] team captured the [[NCAA]] Division III National Championship, the school's first national title.

==Academics==
Muskingum has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association of College and Secondary Schools since 1919. "The school up on the hill," as it is sometimes called by locals, offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology, [[Master of Arts in Education]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] graduate degrees. The university offers 44 [[academic major]]s along with a large number of [[Minor (law)|minors]], 9 pre-professional programs (including [[pre-law]] and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure, all of which must be pursued within a strong [[liberal arts]] curriculum, known at Muskingum as the ''"Liberal Arts Essentials"'' (LAEs) (see below). Among Muskingum's strongest undergraduate academic programs are its science division, math program, education department, and English department. Muskingum is often proclaimed as a "best value" in education, by combining strong academics with low tuition, by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' and similar publications. In their 2008 ''America's Best College's'' guide, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' ranked Muskingum the "31st Best Master's Level University" in the Midwest academically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824025705/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com:80/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php |archivedate=2007-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "4th Best Value" among Midwest Master's Level Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/bvunivmas_mw_brief.php |title=Best Colleges &amp;#124; College Rankings &amp;#124; US News Education - US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Most of Muskingum's academic buildings are clustered around a traditional quad near the southern part of the campus. The quad is bordered by Montgomery Hall and the College Library to the south, Caldwell Hall, Cambridge Hall and the Student/Faculty Center to the west, the Recreation Center and John Glenn Gym to the north and Boyd Science Center to the east. Brown Chapel sits on the southeastern corner of the quad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Fraternities and sororities==
More than one in every four undergraduate students at Muskingum are members of fraternities or sororities. The university has seven active fraternities on campus: [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Phi Mu Alpha]], Ulster (local), M.A.C.E. (local), and Stag (local). Phi Kappa Tau and Kappa Sigma started as local organizations (Alban and Sphinx respectively) while other national organizations came on as colonies. The University also has five sororities: Chi Alpha Nu (local), FAD (local), Delta Gamma Theta (local), [[Theta Phi Alpha]], and [[Alpha Sigma Alpha]].

==Athletics==
Muskingum competes athletically in the [[NCAA]] as a Division III school and as one of the first and longest affiliated members of the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] (OAC). M.U.'s teams compete under the name the ''Fighting Muskies''. Its mascot is the Fighting Muskie (''[[muskellunge]]''), the largest member of the pike family.

Rather than using the traditional magenta, Muskies athletics wear black and red. The school's main athletic rival is fellow OAC competitor the [[Marietta College]] Pioneers (which ironically was originally called the Muskingum Academy when established in 1797). Muskingum fields teams in [[American football]], women's [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], women's [[softball]], [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] and men's and women's indoor [[Track and field|track]], outdoor track, [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], lacrosse, and [[golf]].

Collectively, Muskingum's alumni are referred to as the "Long Magenta Line".  Muskingum College's favorite son is former [[astronaut]] and U.S. senator [[John Glenn]], who graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/bios/glennbio.html|title=Biography - John H. Glenn|last=DeFelice|first=David|date=2015-04-03|language=en|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn also has an honorary degree from Muskingum from 1961, but the B.S. is an earned degree. John Glenn announced his retirement from the [[United States Senate]] in Brown Chapel on live national television in 1997. Upon his retirement, Glenn donated his archives to the [[Ohio State University]], with special conditions that Muskingum students would benefit from the collection at any time.  Muskingum received national media attention once again in 1998, when the 77-year-old Glenn returned to space aboard the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]], becoming the oldest person ever in space.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[File:Iron Lung ward-Rancho Los Amigos Hospital.gif|thumb|upright|Children’s ward at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in 1954, showing more than 100 persons being helped to breathe by the [[Iron lung]]]]

There have been many attempts to manage head injuries throughout history including [[Trepanning|trepanned]] skulls found from ancient Egypt and descriptions of treatments to decrease brain swelling in ancient Greek text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbakis|first1=Georgia|last2=Bleck|first2=Thomas|title=The Evolution of Neurocritical Care|journal=Crit Care Clin|date=2014|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2014.06.001|pmid=25257734|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749070414000475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive care begin with centers to treat the [[poliomyelitis]] outbreak during the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wijdicks|first1=EF|title=The history of neurocritical care.|journal=Handb Clin Neurol|date=2017|volume=140|pages=3–14|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-63600-3.00001-5|pmid=28187805|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444636003000015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early respiratory care units utilized a negative and [[positive pressure]] unit called the “Iron Lung” to aid patients in respiration and greatly decreased the [[mortality rate]] of Polio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbakis|first1=Georgia|last2=Bleck|first2=Thomas|title=The Evolution of Neurocritical Care|journal=Crit Care Clin|date=2014|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2014.06.001|pmid=25257734|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749070414000475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Bjørn Aage Ibsen]], a physician in Denmark, "birthed the intensive care unit”, when he used [[tracheostomy]] and [[positive pressure]] manual ventilation to keep polio patients alive in the setting of an influx of patients and limited resources (only one iron Lung).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wijdicks|first1=Eelco|title=The history of neurocritical care|journal=n Handbook of Clinical Neurology|date=2017|volume=140|pages=3–14|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-63600-3.00001-5|pmid=28187805|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444636003000015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walter Dandy, ca. 1915.jpg|thumb|upright| '''Walter Edward Dandy''' (April 6, 1886 – April 19, 1946) was an [[United States|American]] [[neurosurgeon]] and scientist.]]

The first neurological intensive care unit was created by Dr. Dandy Walker at Johns Hopkins in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbakis|first1=Georgia|last2=Bleck|first2=Thomas|title=The Evolution of Neurocritical Care|journal=Crit Care Clin|date=2014|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2014.06.001|pmid=25257734|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749070414000475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Walker realized that some surgical patient could use specialized postoperative neurosurgical monitoring and treatment. The unit Dr. Walker created showed a benefit to postoperative patients, than neurologic patients came to the unit. Dr. Safar created the first intensive care unit in the United States in Baltimore in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbakis|first1=Georgia|last2=Bleck|first2=Thomas|title=The Evolution of Neurocritical Care|journal=Crit Care Clin|date=2014|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2014.06.001|pmid=25257734|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749070414000475}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the benefit of specialized care in respiratory and cardiac ICUs led to the [[Society of Critical Care medicine]] being formed. This body created standards for extensive, difficult medical problems and treatments. Over time the need for specialized monitoring and treatments led to neurologic intensive care units.

Modern neurocritical care began to develop in the 1980s. The [[Neurocritical care society]] was founded in 2002. In 2005, Neurocritical care was recognized as a neurological subspecialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korbakis|first1=Georgia|last2=Bleck|first2=Thomas|title=The Evolution of Neurocritical Care|journal=Crit Care Clin|date=2014|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2014.06.001|pmid=25257734|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749070414000475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

The doctors who practice this type of medicine are called neurointensivists, and can have medical training in many fields, including neurology, anesthesiology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, or neurosurgery.  Common diseases treated in neurointensive care units include [[strokes]], ruptured [[aneurysms]], brain and [[spinal cord injury]] from trauma, [[seizure]]s (especially those that last for a long period of time- [[status epilepticus]], and/or involve trauma to the patient, i.e., due to a stroke or a fall), swelling of the brain ([[Cerebral edema]]), infections of the brain ([[encephalitis]]) and the brain's or spine's meninges ([[meningitis]]), [[brain tumor]]s (especially malignant cases; with neurological [[oncology]]), and weakness of the muscles required to breathe (such as the [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]).  Besides dealing with critical illness of the nervous system, neurointensivists also treat the medical complications that may occur in their patients, including those of the heart, lung, kidneys, or any other body system, including treatment of infections.

==Neurointensive care centers==

Neurological Intensive care units are specialized units in select [[tertiary care center]]s that specialized in the care of critical ill neurological and post neurological surgical patients. The goal of NICUs are to provide early and aggressive medical interventions including managing pain, airways, ventilation, anticoagulation, elevated ICP, cardiovascular stability and [[secondary brain injury]].  Admission criteria includes: Impaired consciousness, impaired ability to protect airway, progressive respiratory weakness, need for mechanical ventilation, seizure, Radiologic evidence of elevated ICP, monitoring of neurologic function in patients that are critically ill. Neuro-ICU have been seeing increasing use at [[Tertiary referral hospital]]. One of the main reasons why Neuro-ICUs have seen increased use is the use of therapeutic hypothermia which has been shown to improve long-term neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zacharia|first1=BE|last2=Vaughan|first2=KA|last3=Bruce|first3=SS|last4=Grobelny|first4=BT|last5=Narula|first5=R|last6=Khandji|first6=J|last7=Carpenter|first7=AM|last8=Hickman|first8=ZL|last9=Ducruet|first9=AF|last10=Sander Connolly|first10=E|title=Epidemiological trends in the neurological intensive care unit from 2000 to 2008.|journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience|date=2012|volume=19|issue=12|pages=1669–72|doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2012.04.011|pmid=23062793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurointesive care team==

Most neurocritical care units are a collaborative effort between neurointensivists, [[neurosurgeons]], [[neurologists]], [[radiologists]], [[pharmacists]], physician extenders (such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants), critical care nurses, respiratory therapists, rehabilitation therapists, and social workers who all work together in order to provide coordinated care for the critically ill neurologic patient.

==Neurointensive care procedures==

'''[[Hypothermia]]''':
One third to half of people with [[coronary artery disease]] will have an episode where their heart stops. Of the patients who have their heart stopped seven to thirty percent leave the hospital with good neurological outcome (conscious, normal brain function, alert, capable of normal life). Lowering patients body temperature between 32 -34 degrees within six hours of arriving at the hospital doubles the patients with no significant brain damage compared to no cooling and increases survival of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrich|first1=Jasmin|last2=Holzer|first2=Michael|last3=Havel|first3=Christof|last4=Müllner|first4=Marcus|last5=Herkner|first5=Harald|title=Hypothermia for neuroprotection in adults after cardiopulmonary resuscitation|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2016|volume=2|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004128.pub4|pmid=26878327|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004128.pub4/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SC-Heerenveen-supporters.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fans at a [[soccer]] match ([[SC Heerenveen]]) are often part of the parasocial interaction.]]
'''Parasocial interaction''' ('''PSI''') is a term coined by Horton and Wohl in 1956 to refer to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television. Viewers or listeners come to feel and consider media personalities almost as friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305809|title=Parasocial interaction - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305809|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSI is described as an [[illusion]]ary [[experience]], such that media audiences interact with [[persona]]s (e.g., talk show host, [[celebrities]], characters, [[Influencer marketing|social media influencers]]) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. 

==Evolution of the term==
Parasocial interaction was first described from the perspective of media and [[communication studies]]. In 1956, Horton and [[Richard Wohl|Wohl]]  explored the different interactions between [[mass media]] users and media figures and determined the existence of a parasocial relationship, where the user acts as though they are involved in a typical [[social relationship]].&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mass communication and para-social interaction: Observation on intimacy at a distance. | journal=Psychiatry | year=1956 | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=215–229 | last=Horton | first=D. | last2=Wohl | first2=R. | doi=10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, parasocial interaction has existed before mass media, when citizen would establish a bond with political figures, gods or even spirits. Since then, the term has been adopted by psychologists, in furthering their studies of the social relationships that emerge between consumers of mass media and the figures they see represented there. Initially, Horton and Wohl viewed parasocial interactions as abnormalities resulting from a lack of time spent with others.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Perse and Rubin (1989) contested this view, finding that parasocial interactions occurred as a natural byproduct of time spent with media figures.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perse|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rubin|first2=Rebecca|title=Attribution in social and parasocial relationships|journal=Communication Research|date=1989|volume=16|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1177/009365089016001003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originating from a psychological topic, extensive research of PSI has been performed in the area of [[mass communication]] with manifold results.&lt;ref name="MBB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=The television audience: a revised perspective | encyclopedia=Sociology of Mass Communication | publisher=Longman | editor=McQuail, D. | year=1972 | location=London | last=McQuail | first=D. | last2=Blumler | first2=J. | last3=Brown | first3=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWR"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Gratification Discrepancies and News Program Choice | journal=Communication Research | year=1981 | month= | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=451–478 | doi=10.1177/00936502810080040 | last=Palmgreen | first=P. | last2=Wenner | first2=W.

M. | last2=R. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists began to show their interest in the concept in the 1980s, and researchers began to develop the concept extensively within the field of communication science.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Parasocial interaction: A review of the literature and a model for future research. | author=Giles, D. C. | journal=Media Psychology | year=2002 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=279–305 | doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0403_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important questions about social psychology were raised concerning the nature of these relationships that are problematic for existing theories in those fields. The concept of parasocial interaction and detailed examination of the behavioral phenomena that it seeks to explain have considerable potential for developing psychological theory.

==Parasocial relationships==

The concepts development of PSI and PSR are interpreted and employed in a different ways in various literature. When it is applied in the use-and-gratifications approaches, the two concepts are typically treated interchangeably, with the regard primarily to a special type of "interpersonal involvement" with media figures that includes different phenomena such as interaction and identification (Rubin, Perse, &amp; Powell, 1985). In contrast to the U&amp;G approaches, research in other domains such as media psychology and semiotics, argue for a clear distinction between the two terms (Klimmt, Hartmann, &amp; Schramm, 2006). PSI specifically means the one-sided process of media person perception during media exposure; whereas PSR stands for a cross-situational relationship that a viewer or user holds to a media person, which includes specific cognitive and affective components. Schmid &amp; Klimmt (2011) further argue that PSI and PSR are progressive states such that what begins as a PSI has the potential to become a PSR. In sum, the terms, definitions, and models explicating PSI and PSR differ across scientific backgrounds and traditions.

==As a subset of social interaction==
Studying social interaction, and by extension parasocial interaction (PSI), follows a social cognitive approach to defining individual cognitive activity. Accordingly, there are similar psychological processes at work in both parasocial relationships and face-to-face interactions. However, the parasocial relationship does not follow the process of the typical long-term relationship. The media user remains a stranger to the media figure, whereas this "strangeness" would gradually evaporate in typical social interaction.

=== Scientific research ===

The research of PSI obtain significant interest after the advent of the uses and gratifications approach to mass communication research in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="MBB" /&gt; In a study of early soap opera, McQuail et al. (1972) identified two essential functions of PSI: companionship and personal identity. Rosengren and Windahl (1972) further argued that PSI could be identified in the process of viewers' interacting with media figures, but such interaction did not produce identification. This is an important distinction, because identification has a longer history than PSI. Subsequent research has indicated that PSI is evident when identification is not present (Chory-Assad &amp; Yanen, 2005; de Bruin, Suijkerbujk, &amp; Jansz, 2006). During last several decades, PSI has been documented in the research analyzing the relationship between audience members and television newscasters, TV and radio talk-show hosts, sitcom characters and other TV celebrities or performers (Palmgreen, Wenner, &amp; Rayburn, 1980; Rubin &amp; Perse, 1987, Sood &amp; Rogers, 2000; Park &amp; Lennon, 2004; Spitzberg &amp; Cupach, 2007). Research has also been conducted on how a favorable PSI can be facilitated between celebrities and their followers on social media, specifically through the interactions followers have with the celebrities posts on social media (Kim &amp; Song, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.083|title = Celebrity's self-disclosure on Twitter and parasocial relationships: A mediating role of social presence| journal=Computers in Human Behavior| volume=62| pages=570–577|year = 2016|last1 = Kim|first1 = Jihyun| last2=Song| first2=Hayeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different PSI scales have been employed in these studies, PSI was clearly documented with each persona (Hataway, 2008).

Noticing the importance of media in the area of psychological research, Giles (2002) asserted that  there is a need for PSI research to move away from the field of mass communication and into the field of psychology.&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt; Studies in this area is commonly conducted by focusing a key psychological issue for PSI: concerning the similarity between parasocial relations and ordinary social relations (Turner, 1993; Gleich, 1996; McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000; Giles, 2002; Jin &amp; Park, 2009). For example, Turner (1993) adopted the idea of homophily (i.e., the tendency for friendships to form between people that are alike in some designated respect) to examine the interpersonal and psychological predictors of parasocial interaction with television performers. The author found that one dimension of homophily (i.e., attitude) was the best predictor of parasocial interaction. Hataway (2008) indicated that although there seems to be prevailing to analyze PSI in the domain of social psychology, a solid connection to psychological theory and developmental theory has been missing. Hataway (2008) further suggested that more psychological research is needed in order to develop parasocial theory. Specific issues cited were "how parasocial relationships are derived from parasocial interaction and the way those relationships further influence media usage as well as a social construction of reality, and how parasocial interaction is cognitively produced" (p.&amp;nbsp;18). He saw that the majority of PSI research has been conducted by mass communication scholars as a weakness and called for psychologists to refer to Giles (2002) for directions of studies.

Another important consideration for the study of PSI at a psychological level is that there is a form of PSI existing even in interpersonal social situation. People may use fundamentally the same cognitive processes in both interpersonal and mediated communication (Perse &amp; Rubin, 1989). Giles (2002) also suggested that the element of direct interaction occurred in mediated interaction, such as talking to a presenter or celebrity guest, may continue in social interaction, with a cartoon character or a fictional protagonist in the mind.&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt; This may finally constitute a new way of interpreting social interaction. A further consideration is application of social cognitive approaches in individual levels. It is traditionally accepted that this approach is inadequate by itself for the study of relationships (Duck, 1994). However, a number of growing literature on the role of imagination in social interaction (Taylor, 1999; Gleason, Sebanc, &amp; Hartup, 2000; Eyal &amp; Cohen, 2006) suggests that some imaginative activity (e.g., imaginary friends) may be an influential factor in the outcome of real social interaction. PSI is nowadays regarded as an extension of normal social cognition, specifically in terms of the use of the imagination. Current PSI literature commonly acknowledge that the psychological processes acting at the individual level parallel those used in ordinary social activity and relationship building.

=== Studies with children and adolescents ===

Parasocial interaction is best explored across a lifespan, which explains the growing focus on parasocial interaction in children and adolescents. Studies have found that sex-role stereotyping is common in children's parasocial relationships with media figures, though boys most overwhelmingly chooses male characters, while young girls are less likely to prefer one gender over another. Additionally, sex-role stereotyping is more common in children ages 5–6, but decreases in children age 10-11. Existing literature also intimates that attachments, parasocial or otherwise, established in early childhood, are highly influential on relationships created later in life. Many studies have focused on adolescent girls because they are more likely to form a strong bond with a media figure and be influenced in terms of lifestyle choices.

=== Sports ===

==== Team association ====

[[Social identity theory]] says that people become motivated to behave in ways that boost their self-esteem. Having high [[self-esteem]] creates the perception that a person is intelligent, likable, and a good person. In regards to sports teams, fans create a connection within their team to attach themselves to a particular victory or championship.

====Player====

In 2012, Evan Frederick ([[University of Southern Indiana]]), Choong Hoon Lim, Galen Clavio, and Patrick Walsh ([[Indiana University]]) conducted a study on perceived parasocial relationships of Twitter users and athletes. "Analysis of the data revealed a sense of heightened interpersonal closeness based on the interaction style of the athlete. Followers of the social athlete were driven by [[interpersonal]] constructs" (p.&amp;nbsp;481).

====Branding====

In 2007, Brett Boyle and Peter Magnusson, from [[Saint Louis University]] published a study titled "Social Identity and Brand Equity Formation: A Comparative Study of Collegiate Sports Fans". The authors empirically tested fans of a University men's basketball team. According to the study students, alumni, and the general public were all a part of building brand/team equity through means of heightened social identification factors.

==Positive consequences in childhood==

=== Identity formation ===

The primary effect is that of learning: consistent with Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, much evidence shows that children learn from positive and negative televised role models, and acquire norms and standards for conduct through media outlets such as television and video games. This is supported by a study by Cynthia Hoffner with children aged 7–12, which showed that the gender of children's favorite televised characters was strongly correlated to the gender of the children. Furthermore, the research showed "wishful identification" with parasocial relationships, namely, that boys preferred intelligence, while girls preferred attractiveness when picking favorite characters. These alternatives are both enhanced and mitigated by their separation from reality. 
On one hand, parasocial interactions are particularly appealing to adolescents in the throes of identity formation and increasing autonomy from parents because these relationships provide idealized figures with whom the adolescent can envision total acceptance. The lack of actual contact with these idealized figures can offer positive social interactions without risk of rejection or consequent feelings of unworthiness. One cannot know everything about a media figure or icon, allowing adolescents to attach fantasized attributes onto these figures in order to meet their own specific wants or needs. On the other hand, entities far removed from reality tend to be less influential on children.

A study by Rosaen and Dibble examined correlation between realism of favorite television character and strength of parasocial relationships. Results showed a positive correlation between social realism (how realistic the character is) and strength of parasocial relationships. Results also show age-related differences among children. Older children tended to prefer more realistic characters, while younger children generally had more powerful parasocial relationships with any character. Age, however, did not impact the correlation between social realism and strength of parasocial interaction, which suggests that more real characters are grounds for more powerful parasocial relationships in children of all ages.

=== Learning through the media ===

The ability to learn from parasocial relationships is directly correlated to the strength of the relationship, as has been shown in work by [[Sandra L. Calvert]] and colleagues. In a study by Lauricella, Gola, and Calvert (2011), eight 21-month-old infants were taught seriation sequencing by one of two characters. One character, Elmo, is iconic in American culture and therefore socially meaningful, and the other, DoDo, although popular with children in Taiwan, is less well known in American media. Children were better able to learn from the socially meaningful character (Elmo) than from the character who was less easily recognized (DoDo). Furthermore, children could become better able to learn from less socially-relevant characters such as DoDo, by developing a parasocial relationship with that character. Accordingly, after children were given DoDo toys to play with, their ability to learn from that character increased. In a later study, this effect was found to be greatest when children showed stronger parasocial relationships: Children's success on the seriation task, and therefore their ability to learn from a less familiar character, was greatest for children who exhibited more emotional nurturing behaviors toward the DoDo toy during play (Gola, Richards, Lauricella, &amp; Calvert, 2013).

Personalization of a character makes a child more likely to nurture the character, and thus more likely to form a parasocial relationship that would improve learning from videos featuring the character (Calvert, Richards, &amp; Kent, 2014). In place of DoDo and Elmo, Calvert et al. (2014) gave children Scout and Violet dolls. These interactive plush toy dogs can be programmed to say a child's name and have particular favorites (i.e., a favorite food, color, and song). 18-month-old children were given either personalized toys ( matched for gender, programmed to say the child's name, and programmed to have the same favorites as the child) or non-personalized toys (the opposite gender, programmed to call the children "Pal" and have random favorites). At the end of the study, children who had received personalized dolls were better able to learn from their characters than were children who had received non-personalized toys. Children also nurtured personalized toys more than non-personalized toys. It seems that perceived similarities increase children's interest and investment in the characters, which motivates the development of parasocial relationships and helps improve later screen-based learning.

==Negative consequences in childhood==

In the past two decades, people have become increasingly interested in the potential negative impacts media has on people's' behavior and cognition. Many researchers have begun to look more closely at how people's relationships with various media outlets affect behavior, self-perception and attachment styles, and specifically in regards to creating parasocial relationships.

=== Body image ===

Further research has examined these relationships with regard to body image and self-perception. Interest in this more narrow area of research has increased as body image issues have become more prevalent in today's society.

A study was conducted to examine the relationship between media exposure and adolescents' body image. Specifically, researchers looked at parasocial relationships and the different motivations for self-comparison with a character. This study surveyed 391 7th and 8th grade students and found that media exposure negatively predicted body image. In addition to the direct negative impact, the study indicated that parasocial relationships with favorite characters, motivations to self-compare, and engagement in social comparison with characters amplified the negative effects on kids' body images. Furthermore, the researchers found that making social comparisons with favorite characters distorted actual, or ideal, body image and self-perception. Studies have been done exploring these effects across gender.

A study examined the parasocial relationships between men and superheroes; the study looked at muscular vs. non-muscular superheroes and men who either did or did not develop a one-sided psychological bond with a superhero character. The results from this study indicated a significant impact on body image, particularly when exposed to muscular superhero characters. The research found that men who formed a parasocial relationship with a muscular superhero had poor self-perception and felt negatively about their own bodies after exposure to the muscular character.

=== Aggression ===

Further studies have looked into parasocial relationships and more specifically at the impacts on violent and aggressive behavior. A study done by Keren Eyal and Alan M. Rubin examined aggressive and violent television characters and the potential negative impacts they may have on viewers. The study was based on social cognitive theory and looked at trait aggression in viewers and identification and parasocial interaction with aggressive characters. The researchers measured trait aggression in each of the participants and compared that to the level of identification with aggressive characters.The study found that more aggressive viewers were more likely to identify with aggressive characters and further develop parasocial relationships with the aggressive characters.

Parasocial interaction has been linked to psychological [[attachment theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = T. | last2 = Leets | first2 = L. | year = 1999 | title = Attachment styles and intimate television viewing.

In parasocial interaction there is no "normal" [[social interaction]]; it is a very one-sided relation. The knowledgeable side has no direct control over the actions of the side it observes, and it is very difficult for it to contact and influence it.

=== Parasocial breakup ===

While much research focuses on the formation and maintenance of parasocial relationships, other research has begun to focus on what happens when a parasocial relationship is dissolved. Eyal and Cohen define parasocial breakup as "a situation where a character with whom a viewer has developed a PSR goes off the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eyal|first1=K.|last2=Cohen|first2=J.|title=When Good "Friends" Say Goodbye: A Parasocial Breakup Study|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2006|volume=50|issue=3|pages=502–523|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem5003_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyal and Cohen (2006) found that the [[distress (medicine)|distress]] that media consumers experienced after a parasocial breakup was quite similar to that of a social relationship. However, the emotional distress experienced after the parasocial breakup was weaker than that of the real life interpersonal relationship. Lather and Moyer-Guse (2011) also considered the concept of parasocial breakup, but in a more temporary sense. While the study focused on parasocial breakups as a result of the writers' strike from 2007-2008, the researchers found that media consumers still experienced different levels of emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lather|first1=J.|last2=Moyer-Guse|first2=E.|title=How do we react when our favorite characters are taken away? An examination of a temporary parasocial breakup|journal=Mass Communication and Society|date=2011|volume=14|issue=2|pages=196–215|doi=10.1080/15205431003668603}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study, like previous studies, showed that parasocial relationships operate very similarly to real-life relationships.

==On the Internet==
Though most literature has focused on parasocial interaction as a television and film phenomenon, new technologies, namely the [[Internet]], have necessitated a closer look at such interactions. The applications of PSI to computer-mediated environments are continuously documented in literature in last decade (Ballantine and Martin 2005; Goldberg and Allen 2008; Labrecque, 2014). Many researchers concluded that, just as parasocial relationships are present in television and radio, they are also present in online environments such as blogs and other [[social networking]] sites. Through an exploration of followers on politicians' blogs, Thorson and Rodgers (2006) found that parasocial interacting with the politician influences people's opinions about the politician, and promotes them to vote for the politician. Social media is designed to be a new channel through which parasocial interaction/relationship can be formed. Research has shown that interacting with individuals through blogs and social media such as Twitter can influence the perceptions of those individuals (Thorson &amp; Rodgers, 2006; Frederick, et al., 2012). As Internet users become more active on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, followers often feel more engaged with them, making the parasocial relationships stronger.

In 1998, John Eighmey, from [[Iowa State University]], and Lola McCord, from the [[University of Alabama]], published a study titled "Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the [[World Wide Web]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296397000611 |title=Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the World Wide Web |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=187–194 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-03-26 |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(97)00061-1|year=1998 |last1=Eighmey |first1=John |last2=McCord |first2=Lola }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, they observed that the presence of parasocial relationships constituted an important determinant of [[Website visitor tracking|website visitation rates]]. "It appears," the study states, "that websites projecting a strong sense of personality may also encourage the development of a kind of parasocial relationship with website visitors."

In 1999, John Hoerner, from the [[University of Alabama]], published a study titled "Scaling the Web: A Parasocial Interaction Scale for World Wide Web Sites",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Df2BgZD9lxQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=scaling+the+web:+a+parasocial+Interaction+Scale+for+World+Wide+Web+Sites | title = Advertising and the World Wide Web | isbn = 9781410602060 |last1=Schumann |first1=David W |first2=Esther |last2=Thorson |date=1999-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a method for measuring the effects of parasocial interaction on the Internet. The study explained that [[website]]s may feature "personae" that host to the visitors to the sites in order to generate public interest. Personae, in some cases, are nothing more than the online representations of the actual people, often prominent public figures, but sometimes, according to the study, will be the fictional creations of the sites' webmasters. Personae "take on many of the characteristics of a [real-life] companion, including regular and frequent appearances, a sense of immediacy...and the feeling of a face-to-face meeting." Additionally, the study makes the point that, even when no such personae have been created, parasocial relationships might still develop. Webmasters might foster parasocial interactions through a conversational writing style, extensive character development and opportunities for email exchange with the website's persona.

Hoerner used the Parasocial Interaction (PSI) scale, developed by Rubin, Perse, and Powell (1985), and modified the scale to more accurately assess parasocial interactions on the Internet. They used the scale to gauge participants' reactions to a number of different websites, and, more generally, to determine whether or not parasocial interaction theory could be linked to Internet use. The study concluded, first, that parasocial interaction is not dependent on the presence of a traditional persona on a website; data showed that websites with described "strong personae" did not attract significantly more hits than other websites selected by the study conductors. "The literal, mediated personality from the newscast or soap opera of the past [around which the original PSI-scale was framed] is gone. The design metaphor, flow of the web experience, and styles of textual and graphic presentations of the information all become elements of a website persona and encourage parasocial interaction by the visitor/user with that persona."

The study also confirmed the accuracy of the "PSI web scale" as a way to gauge consumer parasocial interaction with websites.

In recent years, companies and brands have taken this opportunity to use celebrities to aide in impacting such key elements of the company-consumer relationship as brand image and brand awareness (Jansen et al. 2009). For example, Katy Perry currently serves as the top most followed individual on Twitter for having over 109 million followers. The more followers one has on Twitter,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|title=Twitter|date=2018-06-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter&amp;oldid=847306583|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the greater perceived social influence one has.

It is no coincidence that to be "trending" (i.e., phrases or topics that are tagged at a greater rate than others) on Twitter at any given point in time is equivalent to having one's movie become a box-office hit or one's hit single rank on the Billboard chart; in other words, Twitter can be utilized as a form of social capital (Jin 2013; Li and Bernoff 2011; Putnam 2000).

In a 2014 journal article Seung-A Annie Jin and Joe Phua discussed how they conducted studies to determine multiple hypothesis based on the number of followers a celebrity had in correlation to the trust that imparted onto a consumer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Seung-A Annie|last2=Phua|first2=Joe|date=2014-04-03|title=Following Celebrities' Tweets About Brands: The Impact of Twitter-Based Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Consumers' Source Credibility Perception, Buying Intention, and Social Identification With Celebrities|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.827606|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was done in terms of a celebrity endorsing a product and the consumer's likely to purchase the product after seeing the promotion. Consumers perceived the celebrity with a high number of followers as being more physically attractive, trustworthy, and competent. A high number of followers on the celebrity endorser's profile also significantly increased consumers' intention to build an online friendship with the celebrity. The study found that if a celebrity with a higher number of followers was found to be more trustworthy and the consumer exhibited significantly higher postexposure product involvement and buying intention as opposed to those who were exposed to a celebrity with a lower follower count.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Social media networks inherit at least one key attribute from the Internet, in that they offer open accessibility for all users. Philip Drake and Andy Miah argue that the Internet, and therefore social networks and blogs, downsize the gatekeeping processes that exist in other mass media forms. They further state that this means that online information can spread unfiltered and thus does not rest on strict framework conditions such as those on television or in newspapers. This, however, remains subject to an ongoing debate within research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Philip|last2=Miah|first2=Andy|date=2010-03-01|title=The Cultural Politics of Celebrity|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/cultural-politics/article-abstract/6/1/49/8002/The-Cultural-Politics-of-Celebrity|journal=Cultural Politics|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=49–64|doi=10.2752/175174310X12549254318746|issn=1743-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/apps/doc/A244276463/PPCM?u=tusc49521&amp;sid=PPCM&amp;xid=3bee8234|title=E-Resource Login|website=link.galegroup.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through presence on social media platforms, stars and celebrities attempt on the one hand to participate in the production of their image; on the other hand, they must remain present in these media in order to stay on the media’s and consequently on the audience’s agenda.

The audience’s consumption and reception symbolizes the necessary “fuel” to keep the economic enterprise of celebrity going.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Redmond|first=Sean|title=Introduction: What's in a Reader?|date=2007|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/books/stardom-and-celebrity/n1.xml|work=Stardom and Celebrity: A Reader|pages=1–11|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|access-date=2018-07-09|last2=Holmes|first2=Su}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outlining the interdependency between celebrity status and the audience, Wippersberg (2007) emphasizes that a celebrity can only become and remain a celebrity if the audience embraces and thus perceives the individual celebrity as a celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Peters|first=Birgit|date=1996|pages=101–118|publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-97067-1_7|isbn=9783531127842|title=Prominenz|chapter=Der Einfluß massenmedialer Rahmenbedingungen auf Entstehung und Erscheinungsbild von Prominenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most celebrities, aware of the rising importance of social media (for their audience), now themselves actively use these networks, by running their own profiles and making raw and real-time information and content available to the social media community and fans. It allows them to promote themselves and their “products” (i.e. music, albums, movies, shows) by directly communicating with their audience. Nowadays a fan can more easily to get “in touch” with celebrities (as fan mails don’t need to be hand-written and sent though regular mail anymore) by way of comments on photos or videos posted by the celebrity themselves. Often, and dependent upon the celebrity and their personal management of their social profiles, the celebrity may respond to a comment of a random fan or follow. The development of parasocial relationships between the audience/fans and celebrities is facilitated. The process also calls into question the one-way nature of parasocial interaction because celebrities, on the outer surface seem to try to get more and more in contact with their audiences. Researchers now raise the question of how social media, i.e., social networks, have modified these parasocial interactions between the celebrities and their audience.

==Future research==

One direction for future PSI concerns the advancement of methodology. As theories become more defined and complex, experiments seem to be necessary to be employed in testing hypotheses. Because the meanings of perception and emotion take up much of what parasocial interaction/relationship research interest, the cause and effect is hard to be distinguished and potential spuriousness is difficult to be avoided (Oliver &amp; Raney, 2014). For example, whether similarity precedes PSI and whether mediated interaction create a sense of similarity requires experimental validation (Murphy, Frank, Moran, &amp; Patnoe-Woodley, 2011).

Cohen (2001) also suggested that different types of relationships are encouraged to be analyzed by different genres, which particularly challenges scholars in examine the mediated relationship in those reality TVs (e.g., Survivor) (Nabi, Stitt, Halford, &amp; Finnerty. 2006). These prototypical reality shows which are built around narratives, displaying a lot of emotions which seem to invite [[empathy]] and identification, and also demonstrating the characters' skills as to develop [[fandom]]. Ratings and audience responses provide strong evidence that those reality shows create significant mediated relationship, but future inquiries should examine whether this new kind of mediated interaction/relationship evolves or do these interactions/relationships conform to existing patterns (Oliver &amp; Raney, 2014).

The influence of media in childhood has received little attention from [[developmental psychologist]]s, even though children have a high degree of exposure to media. While many studies and experiments have explored the nature of parasocial relationships, there are many opportunities for future research. For example, a potential future area of research could be the issue of reruns, where the relationships have outcomes which are already known or well-established. In addition, another area of research could focus on production techniques or televisual approaches. This would include techniques such as chiaroscuro or flat lighting, the strategic placement of close-ups or establishing shots, deductive or inductive shot sequences, hip hop editing, or desaturation. These techniques have long been theorized to have some sort of influence on the formation of parasocial relationships, but their influence has yet to be determined.

The prevailing use of social media and its impact on mediated relationships also requires further study of PSI (Branch, Wilson, &amp; Agnew, 2013). Different social media platforms provide channels through which celebrities communicate with their followers easily, making parasocial interaction/relationships seem less unidirectional and perhaps more satisfying and intense (Labrecque, 2014). As such, whether social media has made PSI more a part of everyday life needs further exploration. Baek, Bae, and Jang (2013) also mentioned that technological development have been raising questions regarding the role of PSI in our social lives, as media content is available in more places and times. Our mediated friends are never too far away, instead, they actually rest in our pockets and sleep in our beds. Whether this means that we spend more time and effort on cultivating these relationships and will be less dependent on real social relationships, needs further exploration (Labrecque, 2014).

Other concerns include the continuity of media figures representation across various media outlets, and the notion of parasocial interaction as compensation for lack of social outlets. Popstars, for example, may not only appear on television, but on several different television or radio programs, as either a chat guest or a performer; further repeated viewings of these stars would intensify visual aspects of parasocial interaction with that star. Most research has typically characterized media users as a television viewer who is often solitary and in need of social interaction. The different types of user-figure interaction can be addressed by conceptualizing parasocial interaction as an extension of ordinary social interaction. Through close examination of social encounters that are significant for parasocial relationships, we can continue to distinguish between parasocial interaction an isolated activity and longer-term interaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1138">'''Plasmogamy''' is a stage in the [[sexual reproduction]] of [[fungi]], in which the [[cytoplasm]] of two parent cells (usually from the [[mycelia]]) fuses together without the fusion of [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]], effectively bringing two [[haploid]] nuclei close together in the same cell. This state is followed by [[karyogamy]], where the two nuclei fuse together and then undergo [[meiosis]] to produce spores.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = fungus (biology) :: Sexual reproduction | encyclopedia = Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/222357/fungus/57957/Sexual-reproduction |accessdate = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedon|first=Stephen|title=Plasmogamy|url=http://www.biologyaspoetry.com/terms/plasmogamy.html|work=Biology as Poetry|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dikaryotic state that comes after plasmogamy will often persist for many generations before the fungi undergoes karyogamy. In lower fungi however, plasmogamy is usually immediately followed by karyogamy.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2209">A '''platform-specific model''' is a model of a software or business system that is linked to a specific technological platform (e.g. a specific [[programming language]], [[operating system]], [[document file format]] or [[database]]). Platform-specific models are indispensable for the actual implementation of a system.

For example, a need to implement an online shop. The system will need to store information regarding users, goods, credit cards, etc. The designer might decide to use for this purpose an [[Oracle database]]. For this to work, the designer will need to express concepts (e.g. the concept of a user) in a [[relational model]] using the [[Oracle database|Oracle]]'s [[SQL]] dialect. This [[Oracle database|Oracle]]'s specific [[relational model]] is an example of a ''Platform-specific model''.

The term ''platform-specific model'' is most frequently used in the context of the [[model-driven architecture|MDA]] approach. This '''MDA''' approach corresponds the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] vision of [[Model Driven Engineering]]. The main idea is that it should be possible to use a [[Model Transformation Language|MTL]] to transform a [[Platform-independent model]] into a Platform-specific model. In order to achieve this transformation, one can use a language compliant to the newly defined [[QVT]] standard. Examples of such languages are [[AndroMDA]], [[VIATRA]] or [[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]].

'''Polycerates''' (meaning "many-horned") are animals with more than two [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].

==Cattle==
[[Cattle]] can have as many as six horns, and occasionally more. Because horns are no longer widely utilized by humans as drinking vessels, musical instruments or in jewellery, farmers prefer to raise polled (hornless) cattle. The lack of horns reduces injuries to humans and other cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mary C; Sherman, David M. (1994). Goat Medicine. {{ISBN|9780812114782}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sheep==

[[File:Tascam Portastudio 244.jpg|thumb|Tascam Portastudio 244]]

The [[TASCAM]] '''Portastudio''' was the world's first four-track recorder based on a standard [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassette]] tape. The term ''portastudio'' is exclusive to TASCAM, though it is generally used to describe all self-contained cassette-based multitrack recorders dedicated to music production. The Portastudio, and particularly its first iteration, the Teac 144, is credited with launching the home-recording wave, which allowed musicians to cheaply record and produce music at home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02X2M-BP2OsC&amp;pg=PA180|page=180|title=The Guitar Player Book: 40 Years of Interviews, Gear, and Lessons from the World's Most Celebrated Guitar Magazine|first=Michael|last=Molenda|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2007|isbn=9780879307820}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is cited as one of the most significant innovations in music production technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhCUBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|page=84|title=Music in the Marketplace: A Social Economics Approach|first=Samuel|last=Cameron|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317934738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teac 144 Portastudio made its debut in 1979, at the annual meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]]. It was followed by several other models by TASCAM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEK2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|page=207|title=Japanoise: Music at the Edge of Circulation|first=David|last=Novak|publisher=Duke UP|year=2013|isbn=9780822397540}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually by several other manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reverb.com/news/the-tascam-portastudio-through-the-ages|title=The Tascam Portastudio Through the Ages|website=reverb.com|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time it enabled musicians to record affordably several instrumental and vocal parts on different tracks of the built-in four-track recorder and later blend all the parts together, while transferring them to another standard, two-channel stereo tape deck ([[remix]] and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]]) to form a stereo recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbA-0fAi20cC&amp;pg=PA31|title=TASCAM: 30 Years of Recording Evolution|first=Randy|last=Alberts|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2003|isbn=9780634011566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tascam Portastudio 244, introduced in 1982, improved upon the previous design with overall better sound quality and more features, including: dbx noise reduction, dual/concentric sweepable EQ's, and the ability to record on up to 4 tracks simultaneously. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/tascam-244-portastudio/2770|title=TASCAM Portastudio 244 Review|publisher=Home Studio Recording Magazine, December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, these machines were typically used by musicians to record [[Demo (music)|demos]], although they are still used today in [[lo-fi]] recording. The analog portastudios by TASCAM (a division of [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]]) and similar units by [[Fostex]], [[Akai]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]], [[Marantz]], and others generally recorded on high-bias cassette tapes. Most of the machines were four-track, but there were also six-track and eight-track units. Some newer digital models record to a [[hard disk]], allowing for digital effects and up to 32 tracks of audio.

==Function==
The Portastudio supported the bouncing of content between tracks, such as creating a mix of three tracks and recording the sum onto the fourth track. By carefully balancing the volume and equalization, this could be done multiple times to create very lush tracks, reminiscent of the complex four-track production of late-sixties Beatle compositions. A limitation was the introduction of tape hiss, which was a particular issue with early models. This was eliminated with more recent digital models.

Unlike standard audio cassette machines that recorded a pair of stereo channels per side, the cassette-based Portastudios recorded four channels in one direction. If you played back a standard two-sided stereo cassette, the second two channels would play in reverse. One interesting (but unpublished) feature was that you could record a track in reverse by flipping the cassette, then flip it back and record additional material. Thanks to the speed control, it was also possible to create a classic flanging effect by recording one track, then recording a second copy of the same track while varying the pitch control, creating a sweeping sound at points where the two tracks converged.

An additional feature was support for external signal processing during recording and on final output.

The '''Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research''' ('''PIK''') is a German government-funded research institute addressing crucial scientific questions in the fields of global change, climate impacts, and [[sustainable development]]. Ranked among the top environmental [[think tank]]s worldwide, it is one of the leading research institutions and part of a global network of scientific and academic institutions working on questions of global environmental change. It is a member of the [[Leibniz Association]], whose institutions perform research on subjects of high relevance to society.

== History ==

PIK was founded in 1992 by its current director, [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]]. About 400 people work at the institute that is located on [[Potsdam]]'s historic [[Telegrafenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pik-potsdam.de/institute/organization ''PIK Research Portal'' – Organization]. Web site of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Visited on August 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the natural and social sciences analyze the earth system and develop strategies and solution pathways for a sustainable development.

== Partners ==

PIK provides information to international organizations like the [[World Bank]] as well as to regional bodies like the [[Federal Government of Germany]] and the [[European Commission]]. PIK scientists also contribute to the reports of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC). The IPCC working group Climate Change mitigation is coordinated by the institute's deputy director and chief economist [[Ottmar Edenhofer]].

In 2007, PIK initiated a biennial Nobel Laureates' Symposium series on global sustainability. The fourth annual symposium is scheduled for April 22, 2015 and will be held in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;[http://www.nobelcause.org/ Nobel Laureates' Symposium series website]&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the first time that the Laureates' Symposium will be held outside Europe and will be focused on the rapid urbanization East Asia and Pacific region.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;

In 2010, PIK collaborated with the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]] to found Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Innovation Community).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climate-kic.org/networks/academic-partners/ ''Climate-KIC'' – Academic Partners].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10892">The  '''Proto-Ionians''' are the hypothetical earliest speakers of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialects]] of [[Ancient Greek]], chiefly in the works of Jean Faucounau. The relation of Ionic to the other Greek dialects has been subject to some debate. It is mostly grouped with [[Arcadocypriot]] as opposed to [[Doric Greek|Doric]], reflecting two waves of migration into Greece following the [[Proto-Greek]] period, but sometimes also as separate from Arcadocypriot on equal footing with Doric, suggesting three distinct waves of migration.

==Position of Ionic Greek==

Mainstream Greek linguistics separates the [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]] into two large genetic groups, one including [[Doric Greek]] and the other including both [[Arcadocypriot]] and [[Ionic Greek]]. But alternative approaches proposing three groups are not uncommon; Thumb and Kieckers (1932) propose three groups, classifying Ionic as genetically just as separate from Arcadocypriot as from Doric. Like a few other linguists (Vladimir Georgiev, C. Rhuijgh, P. Léveque, etc.),
The bipartite classification is known as the "Risch–Chadwick theory", named after its two famous proponents, Ernst Risch and [[John Chadwick]].{{ref|Chadwick}}

The "Proto-Ionians" first appear in the work of [[Ernst Curtius]] (1887), who believed that the [[Attic-Ionic]] dialect group was due to an "Ionicization" of Attica by immigration from Ionia in historical times. Curtius hypothesized that there had been a "Proto-Ionian" migration from the Balkans to western Anatolia in the same period that brought the [[Arcadocypriot|Arcadic]] dialect (the successor of the [[Mycenean Greek]] stage yet undiscovered in the time of Curtius) to mainland Greece.{{ref|Hallm}} Curtius' hypothesis was endorsed by George Hempl in 1920.{{ref|Hempl}} Hempl preferred to call these hypothetical, early Anatolian Greeks "Javonians". Hempl attempted to defend a reading of [[Hittite cuneiform]] as Greek, in spite of the  establishment of the [[Hittite language]] as a separate branch of Indo-European by Hrozný in 1917.

==Faucounau==
{{Notability|date=April 2009}}
The tripartite theory was revived by amateur linguist Jean Faucounau. In his view, the first Greek settlers in their historical territory were the (Pelasgic) "proto-Ionians", who were separated around 3000 BC from both the proto-[[Dorians]] and the proto-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]]. Faucounau traces this three-wave model to similar views put forward by [[Paul Kretschmer]] in the 1890s and the 1900s (''i.e.'', before the decipherment of [[Linear B]]), with a modification: the (proto-Ionic) First wave came by sea, the "Proto-Ionians" settling first in the Cycladic Islands, then in Euboea and Attica. The last two waves are the generally accepted arrival of the Mycenaean Greeks (the linguistic predecessors of the Arcadocypriot speakers) in around 1700 BC and the [[Dorian invasion]] around 1100 BC.

Following Georgiev{{ref|Georgiev1}}{{ref|Georgiev2}}, Faucounau makes three arguments for the proto-Ionic language{{ref|Faucouneau}}. The first is the explanation of certain Mycenaean forms as [[loan word|loan-words]] from the proto-Ionians already present in Greece: he asserts that [[digamma]] is unexpectedly absent from some Mycenaean words,{{ref|digamma}} the occasional resolution of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Syllabic consonant|vocalic ''r'']] to ''-or/ro-'' instead of ''-ar/ra-''; ''to-pe-za'' for τράπεζα,{{ref|trapeza}} and the explanation of Mycenaean ''pa-da-yeu'' as Greek παδάω/πηδάω{{ref|LSJ}}, "spring leap, bound", which he interprets as both [[cognate]] with, and having the same meaning as, [[modern English|English]] ''paddle''.{{ref|paddle}}.

The second argument is a refinement of a long-established argument in [[archaeoastronomy]], developed most recently by Michael Ovenden,{{ref|Ovenden}} which considers the motion of the North Pole with respect to the fixed stars, because of the [[precession]] of the [[equinox]]es. Ovenden concluded, from the slant of the [[constellation]]s in the present sky and the hypothesis that [[Aratus]] and [[Hipparchus]] (insofar as his work survives) correctly and completely represent immemorial tradition, that the constellations we now use had been devised when the Pole was in [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], about 2800 BC. He also concluded that the inventors probably lived between 34°30' and 37°30' N., north of most ancient civilizations, and so were likely to be the Minoans.

Dr. Crommelin, FRAS, has disputed this latitude, arguing that the constellation makers could only see to 54° S, but that this was compatible with latitudes as low as the 31°N of [[Alexandria]]; stars which only skirt the southern horizon by a few degrees are not effectively visible. Assuming a Greek latitude would render [[Canopus]] and [[Fomalhaut]] invisible. Crommelin estimates the constellators at 2460 BC; [[Richard Anthony Proctor|R. A. Proctor]] has estimated 2170 BC. [[E. W. Maunder]] 2700 BC.{{Ref|Crommelin}}

Faucounau's addition to this is the argument that Crete is also too far south, that the names of the constellations are (Ionic) Greek, not Minoan, and therefore that the constellation makers must be the proto-Ionians in the [[Cyclades]].{{ref|Crete}}  The south coast of Crete follows 35°N latitude; [[Syros]], which he identifies as a center of proto-Ionian civilization,{{ref|syros}} is at 37°20'.{{ref|Atlas}} On this basis, he identifies the proto-Ionians with the archaeological [[Cyclades|Early Cycladic II]] culture: after all, they made round "[[frying pans]]," and one of them with an incised spiral, and the Phaistos Disc is round with an incised spiral.{{Ref|pan}}

His third argument depends on Herodotus's somewhat obscure use of the word [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] for various peoples, Greek-speaking and otherwise, around the Aegean basin. Faucounau claims that the word, which he derives idiosyncratically from πελαγος, "sea",{{ref|pelagos}} means the descendants of the proto-Ionians. Some of them lost their language because they settled among foreigners; others, such as the Athenians, preserved their language - Attic, apparently, arises from a mixture of proto-Ionian and other dialects. He does not explain why Homer speaks of [[Dodona]], inland in north-western Greece, as Pelasgian (Il, 16,233); nor why no place in historic [[Ionia]] is called Pelasgian.

He adds to the above arguments with archaeological facts. For example, the Treaty of [[Alaksandu]] between [[Wilusa]] and the [[Hittite empire]] bore a Greek name at a time when there was no Mycenaean pottery at Troy. Faucounau considers that all these arguments are an indirect confirmation of his own decipherment claim of the [[Phaistos Disk]] as proto-Ionic.

Faucounau's "Proto-Ionic Disk Language" has most of the properties of [[Homeric Greek]], including loss of [[Labial–velar consonant|labiovelars]] and even of [[digamma]] (both are preserved intact in the Mycenaean of the 14th century BC). Digamma, in Faucounau's reading of the Phaistos Disk, has in some instances passed to ''y'', a sound shift not known from any other Greek dialect, but suspected in Ionic (e.g. Ion. païs v/etym. paus). For Faucounau, the [[Pelasgian]]s, the [[Troy|Trojans]], the [[Carians]] and the [[Philistines]] are all descended from the Proto-Ionians.

Faucounau's work on this subject has received two scholarly notices. [[Paul Faure (archeologist)|Paul Faure]], as below, writes warmly of many parts of the Proto-Ionian theory. He declines to address the decipherment, and omits the Celts; he also dates the Middle Cycladic culture only from 2700 BC, not 2900. Yves Duhoux expresses his disbelief in the decipherment, but does not mention the wider theory, except to deny that the Disc came from Syros. Faucounau's paper on the statistical problem of how many glyphs are likely to be omitted from a short text has never been cited. Most of it addresses the long-solved case in which the glyphs are equally likely.

'''''Science and Civilisation in China''''' (1954–[2016]) is a series of books initiated and edited by British [[biochemist]], [[historian]] and [[sinologist]] [[Joseph Needham| Joseph Needham, Ph.D]] (1900–1995). Needham was a well-respected scientist before undertaking this encyclopedia and was even responsible for the "S" in [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/20/archives/joseph-needham-the-real-thing.html|title=Joseph Needham, the Real Thing|last=Boston|first=Richard|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with the [[history of science and technology in China]]. To date there have been seven volumes in twenty-seven books. The series was on the Modern Library Board's [[Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction|100 Best Nonfiction]] books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Library, 1999. [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnonfiction.html 100 Best Nonfiction."]&lt;/ref&gt; Needham's work was the first of its kind to praise Chinese scientific contributions and provide their history and connection to global knowledge in contrast to eurocentric historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Stefan Gaarsmand|date=2013|title=Chinese Influences or Images?: Fluctuating Histories of How Enlightenment Europe Read China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|journal=Journal of World History|volume=24|issue=3|pages=623–660|doi=10.1353/jwh.2013.0076|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Needham—along with an international team of collaborators—initiated the project to study the science, technology, and civilisation of ancient China. This project produced a series of volumes published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The project is still  continuing under the guidance of the Publications Board of the [[Needham Research Institute]] (NRI), chaired by [[Christopher Cullen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nri.cam.ac.uk/science.html|title=Science and Civilisation in China|publisher=Needham Research Institute|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 of the encyclopedia was the first body of work to describe Chinese improvements to [[cartography]], [[geology]], [[seismology]] and [[mineralogy]]. It also includes descriptions of nautical technology, sailing charts, and wheel-maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779676|title=Science and civilisation in China|last=1900-1995,|first=Needham, Joseph,|others=Wang, Ling, 1917-1994., Métailie, Georges., Huang, H. T.|isbn=052105799X|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=779676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Needham's transliteration of [[Chinese characters]] uses the [[Wade-Giles]] system, though the aspirate apostrophe (e.g., ''ch'i'') was rendered 'h' (viz. ''chhi''; traditional Chinese: 氣; Mandarin Pinyin: ''[[qì]]''). However, it was abandoned in favor of the [[pinyin]] system by the NRI board in April 2004, with Volume 5, Part 11 becoming the first to use the new system.&lt;ref&gt;volume 5, part 11, page xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Joseph Needham with Chinese History and Sciences scholars, 1988.jpg|thumb|Joseph Needham, in 1988, surrounded by Chinese History and Sciences scholars.]]

=== Development ===
[[Joseph Needham]]’s interest in the history of Chinese science developed while he worked as an Embryologist at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Needham had already published works relating to the history of science, including his 1934 book titled ''[[A History of Embryology]]'', and was open to expanding his historical scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=92 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s first encounter with Chinese culture occurred in 1937 when three Chinese medical students arrived to work with him at the Cambridge Biochemical Laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=409 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham’s interest in Chinese civilization and scientific progress grew as a result and led him to learn Chinese from his students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two of those students,[[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], and [[Lu Gwei-djen]], would later become his collaborators on ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brook |first1=Timothy |title=The Sinology of Joseph Needham |journal=Modern China |date=1996 |volume=22 |issue=3 |page=341 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com.oca.ucsc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/009770049602200304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, China’s eastern universities were forced to relocate to the west as a result of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winchester|first1=Simon|date=2008|title=The man who unveiled China|url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7203|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese academics sought the help of the British government in an effort to preserve their intellectual life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1942, Needham was selected and appointed as a diplomat by the British government and tasked with traveling to China and assessing the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=880 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years there, Needham discovered that the Chinese had developed techniques and mechanisms which were centuries older than their European counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Needham became concerned with the exclusion of China in the history of science and began to question why the Chinese ceased to develop new techniques after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Publication ===
Armed with his new-found knowledge, Needham returned to Cambridge in 1948 and began working on a book with one of the Chinese medical students he met in Cambridge, [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]], who was now a professor at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Multhauf |first1=Robert |title=Joseph Needham (1900-1995) |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 1996 |volume=37 |page=883 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3107121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he planned on releasing only one volume of his findings through the Cambridge University Press, but later changed his mind and proposed up to eleven volumes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1954, Needham published the first volume of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', which was well received and was followed by other volumes which focused on specific scientific fields and topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Gregory |title=Joseph Needham-A Publication History |journal=Chinese Science |date=1997 |issue=14 |page=93 |url=https://www-jstor-org.oca.ucsc.edu/stable/pdf/43290409.pdf |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needham, along with his collaborators, was personally involved in all of the volumes of Science and Civilization, up until Needham’s death in 1995.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Needham’s death, Cambridge University established an institution named after Needham, The [[Needham Research Institute]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winchester |first1=Simon |title=The man who unveiled China |journal=Nature |date=2008 |volume=454 |issue=7203 |page=411 |url=https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/204462222?accountid=14523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the institution continue Needham’s work and have published 8 additional volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'', since his death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Summaries==
There have been two summaries or condensations of the vast amount of material found in ''Science and Civilisation''. The first, a one-volume [[popular history]] book by [[Robert K. G. Temple|Robert Temple]]  entitled ''The Genius of China'', was completed in a little over 12 months to be available in 1986 for the visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to China. This addressed only the contributions made by China and had a "warm welcome" from Joseph Needham in the introduction, though in the ''Beijing Review'' he criticized that it had "some mistakes ... and various statements that I would like to have seen expressed rather differently".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|journal=Beijing Review|url=http://www.robert-temple.com/articles/beijing_review.pdf|title=East-West: Bridging the Scientific Chasm|author=Ling Yuan|date=Mar 23, 1987|accessdate=2011-02-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A second was made by [[Colin Ronan]], a writer on the history of science, who produced a five volume condensation ''The Shorter Science and Civilisation: An abridgement of Joseph Needham's original text'', between 1980 and his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Colin Ronan|title=The Shorter Science and Civilisation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980–95}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes cover:
# China and Chinese science
# Mathematics, astronomy, meteorology and the earth sciences
# Magnetism, nautical technology, navigation, voyages
# Mechanical engineering, machines, clockwork, windmills, aeronautics
# Civil engineering, roads, bridges, hydraulic engineering

==Reception==

=== Criticism from Scholars ===
''Science and Civilisation in China '' is highly regarded among scholars because of its extensive comparative coverage of Chinese innovations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Finlay, Robert. "China, the West, and World History in Joseph Needham's Science and Civilisation in China." ''Journal of World History'', vol. 11 no. 2, 2000, pp. 265-303. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/jwh.2000.0035&lt;/ref&gt; Needham spent a large amount of time translating, and decoding primary sources for ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of his efforts helped to confirm that scientific advancements, and analytical ingenuity were abundant in [[China]] in early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, Peter C."Joseph Needham's Problematic Legacy." ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 47 no. 1, 2006, pp. 175-178. ''Project MUSE'', doi:10.1353/tech.2006.0092&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, beginning with his first volume, some scholars in the [[Science|scientific]], [[history of science]], and [[sinology]] fields criticized Needham’s work for being too comparative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his work, Needham wrote that numerous Chinese inventions ended up in the west, including the [[Compass|magnetic compass]], and the [[Clock|mechanical clock]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham also wrote that once these inventions reached [[Europe]], they had a great impact on social life, and helped to stimulate the economy, as well as usher in the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other scholars criticized his [[Marxism|Marxist]] background, his understanding of Chinese culture, and his methodology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dr. of History Roger Hart wrote "A Post-Needham Critique" in an East Asia journal accusing Needham of attributing scientific achievements to Chinese civilization in contrast to evidence by exaggerating claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Roger|date=1999|title=Beyond Science and Civilization: A Post-Needham Critique|jstor=43150558|journal=East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|volume=16|pages=88–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor of Volume 6, [[Nathan Sivin]] and Needham's research collaborator [[Lu Gwei-djen]] include updated research to support some of Needham's claims. However, Sivin is critical of Needham suggesting more research is required citing his assumptions of Taoisms' role in promoting scientific feats in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/obo/9780199920082-0006|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=2013-04-22|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Acclaim ===
Needham's ''Science and Civilisation in China'' did not receive criticism from scholars in other fields of study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Groff Conklin]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1955 said that Vol. 1 "presents a richly patterned tapestry of the development of civilization in the Far East", and that "it is for everyone who is intrigued by the unknown, whether future (science fiction) or past (scientific history)".&lt;ref name="conklin195503"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Jonathan Spence]] wrote in a 1982 [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article "this work is the most ambitious undertaking in Chinese studies during this century".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/books/the-china-the-west-knew-nothing-about.html|title=THE CHINA THE WEST KNEW NOTHING ABOUT|last=Spence|first=Jonathan|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times obituary for Needham stated that those educated in China hail Dr. Needham's encyclopedia and compare him to [[Charles Darwin]] in terms of importance regarding scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/obituaries/joseph-needham-china-scholar-from-britain-dies-at-94.html|title=Joseph Needham, China Scholar From Britain, Dies at 94|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Arun Bala, the author of ''[[The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science]],'' Needham postulates that scientific knowledge may evolve to more closely resemble Chinese philosophical views of nature; signifying his belief in Chinese inherent wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bala|first=Arun|date=2006|title=The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230601215|doi=10.1057/9780230601215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Needham Question ==

=== Origins ===
After his extensive research of Chinese innovations, [[Joseph Needham]] became concerned with the question: Why did modern science stop developing in China after the 16th century?&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Needham believed this was due to [[China]]’s sociopolitical system which was not affected by Chinese inventions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[China]] did not have a structure in which merchants could profit off of their inventions, unlike the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once Chinese inventions reached [[Europe]], they revolutionized their sociopolitical system, which used the inventions to dominate political rivals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Needham, Chinese innovations, such as [[gunpowder]], the [[compass]], [[paper]], and [[printing]], helped transform European [[Feudalism]] into [[Capitalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of the 15th century, [[Europe]] was actively financing scientific discoveries, and nautical exploration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[paradox]] of this conclusion was that [[Europe]] surpassed [[China]] in scientific innovations, using Chinese technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Re-formulation ===
After several volumes of ''Science and Civilisation in China'' had been published, Needham was questioned about his theory of the origin of science in the West.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Needham, troubled by past criticism and dismissal of his work as [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, declined to publicly state his relationship to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, in Needham’s work ''[[The Grand Titration]],'' he re-framed his question as: ''“why, between the first century BC and the fifteenth century AD, Chinese civilization was much more efficient than occidental in applying human natural knowledge to practical human needs”''&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. “Science and Society in East and West.” In ''The Grand Titration: Science and Society in East and West''. By Joseph Needham, 190–217. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1969a.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformulation of the question, changed the narrative of ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially, the question centered around [[China]]’s failure to develop scientifically after the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The focus shifted towards an examination of China’s accomplishments prior to development in Europe, this focus was addressed throughout ''Science and Civilisation in China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0006.xml#obo-9780199920082-0006-bibItem-0003|title=The Needham Question|last=Sivin|first=Nathan|date=|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued Debate ===
Needham's attempt to uncover the reasoning behind China's rise and fall as an elite scientific and technologically advanced nation has been expounded upon and debated for decades including [[Justin Yifu Lin]]'s [[University of Chicago Press|University of Chicago]] journal article "The Needham Puzzle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=January 1995|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/452150|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sediment transport''' is the movement of solid particles ([[sediment]]), typically due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the [[fluid]] in which the sediment is entrained. Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are [[clastic]] rocks ([[sand]], [[gravel]], [[boulders]], etc.), [[mud]], or [[clay]]; the fluid is air, water, or ice; and the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they  are resting. Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in [[river]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[sea]]s, and other bodies of water due to [[current (fluid)|currents]] and [[tide]]s. Transport is also caused by [[glacier]]s as they flow, and on terrestrial surfaces under the influence of [[wind]]. Sediment transport due only to gravity can occur on sloping surfaces in general, including [[hill]]slopes, [[escarpment|scarp]]s, [[cliff]]s, and the [[continental shelf]]—continental slope boundary.

Sediment transport is important in the fields of [[sedimentary geology]], [[geomorphology]], [[civil engineering]] and [[environmental engineering]] (see [[#Applications|applications]], below). Knowledge of sediment transport is most often used to determine whether [[erosion]] or [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] will occur, the magnitude of this erosion or deposition, and the time and distance over which it will occur.

===Aeolian===
{{main|Aeolian processes}}
''Aeolian'' or ''eolian'' (depending on the parsing of [[æ]]) is the term for sediment transport by [[wind]]. This process results in the formation of [[Capillary wave|ripples]] and [[sand dunes]]. Typically, the size of the transported sediment is fine [[sand]] (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm) and smaller, because [[air]] is a fluid with low [[density]] and [[viscosity]], and can therefore not exert very much [[Shear strength|shear]] on its bed.

[[Bedform]]s are generated by aeolian sediment transport in the terrestrial near-surface environment. [[Ripple marks|Ripples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-8252(0)90029-U|title=Eolian ripples as examples of self-organization in geomorphological systems|year=1990|last1=Anderson|first1=R|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=29|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dune]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2005.05.005|title=Aeolian dune field self-organization – implications for the formation of simple versus complex dune-field patterns|year=2005|last1=Kocurek|first1=Gary|last2=Ewing|first2=Ryan C.|journal=Geomorphology|volume=72|page=94|bibcode = 2005Geomo..72...94K }}&lt;/ref&gt; form as a natural self-organizing response to sediment transport.

Aeolian sediment transport is common on beaches and in the arid regions of the world, because it is in these environments that vegetation does not prevent the presence and motion of fields of sand.

Wind-blown very fine-grained [[dust]] is capable of entering the upper atmosphere and moving across the globe. Dust from the [[Sahara]] deposits on the [[Canary Islands]] and islands in the [[Caribbean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(01)00067-8|title=Saharan dust storms: nature and consequences|year=2001|author=Goudie, A|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=56|page=179|bibcode=2001ESRv...56..179G|last2=Middleton|first2=N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dust from the [[Gobi desert]] has deposited on the [[western United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6458&lt;/ref&gt; This sediment is important to the soil budget and ecology of several islands.

Deposits of fine-grained wind-blown [[glacier|glacial]] sediment are called [[loess]].

===Fluvial===
In [[geology]], [[physical geography]], and sediment transport, [[fluvial]] processes relate to flowing [[water]] in natural systems. This encompasses rivers, streams, [[periglacial]] flows, [[flash floods]] and [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s. Sediment moved by water can be larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of [[sand]] and [[gravel]] size, but larger floods can carry [[cobbles]] and even [[boulders]].

Fluvial sediment transport can result in the formation of [[ripple marks|ripple]]s and [[dune]]s, in [[fractal]]-shaped patterns of erosion, in complex patterns of natural river systems, and in the development of [[floodplain]]s.

[[File:Laysan beach.jpg|thumb|left|Sand [[Ripple marks|ripples]], [[Laysan Beach]], [[Hawaii]]. Coastal '''sediment transport''' results in these evenly spaced ripples along the shore. [[Monk seal]] for scale.]]

===Coastal===
{{main|Coastal sediment transport}}
Coastal sediment transport takes place in near-shore environments due to the motions of waves and currents. At the mouths of rivers, coastal sediment and fluvial sediment transport processes mesh to create [[river delta]]s.

Coastal sediment transport results in the formation of characteristic coastal landforms such as [[beach]]es, [[barrier islands]], and capes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashton|first1=Andrew|last2=Murray|first2=A. Brad|last3=Arnault|first3=Olivier|journal=Nature|volume=414|pages=296–300|year=2001|doi=10.1038/35104541|issue=6861|pmid=11713526|title=Formation of coastline features by large-scale instabilities induced by high-angle waves|bibcode = 2001Natur.414..296A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A [[glacier]] joining the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt, Switzerland]]. These glaciers transport [[sediment]] and leave behind [[lateral moraines]].]]

===Glacial===
As glaciers move over their beds, they entrain and move material of all sizes. Glaciers can carry the largest sediment, and areas of glacial deposition often contain a large number of [[glacial erratics]], many of which are several metres in diameter. Glaciers also pulverize rock into "[[glacial flour]]", which is so fine that it is often carried away by winds to create [[loess]] deposits thousands of kilometres afield. Sediment entrained in glaciers often moves approximately along the glacial [[flowline]]s, causing it to appear at the surface in the [[ablation zone]].

===Hillslope===
In hillslope sediment transport, a variety of processes move [[regolith]] downslope. These include:
*[[Soil creep]]
*[[Tree throw]]
*Movement of  soil by burrowing animals
*Slumping and landsliding of the hillslope

These processes generally combine to give the hillslope a profile that looks like a solution to the [[diffusion equation]], where the diffusivity is a parameter that relates to the ease of sediment transport on the particular hillslope. For this reason, the tops of hills generally have a parabolic concave-up profile, which grades into a convex-up profile around valleys.

As hillslopes steepen, however, they become more prone to episodic [[landslide]]s and other [[mass wasting]] events. Therefore, hillslope processes are better described by a nonlinear diffusion equation in which classic diffusion dominates for shallow slopes and erosion rates go to infinity as the hillslope reaches a critical [[angle of repose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roering|first1=Joshua J.|last2=Kirchner|first2=James W.|last3=Dietrich|first3=William E.|title=Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=35|page=853|year=1999|doi=10.1029/1998WR900090|bibcode=1999WRR....35..853R|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debris flow===

Large masses of material are moved in [[debris flow]]s, [[hyperconcentrated flow|hyperconcentrated]] mixtures of mud, clasts that range up to boulder-size, and water. Debris flows move as [[granular flow]]s down steep mountain valleys and washes. Because they transport sediment as a granular mixture, their transport mechanisms and capacities scale differently from those of fluvial systems.

==Applications==
[[File:IsfjordenSediment.JPG|thumb|Suspended sediment from a stream emptying into a fjord ([[Isfjord, Svalbard|Isfjorden]], Svalbard, Norway).]]

Sediment transport is applied to solve many environmental, geotechnical, and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for [[coastal engineering]]. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, also referred to as the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J., Walker, T.R., Hill P.S., Lintern, D.G. (2013) BEAST-A portable device for quantification of erosion in intact sediment cores. Methods in Oceanography. DOI: 10.1016/j.mio.2013.03.001&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement of sediment is important in providing habitat for fish and other organisms in rivers. Therefore, managers of highly regulated rivers, which are often sediment-starved due to dams, are often advised to stage short floods to refresh the bed material and rebuild bars. This is also important, for example, in the [[Grand Canyon]] of the [[Colorado River]], to rebuild shoreline habitats also used as campsites.

Sediment discharge into a reservoir formed by a dam forms a reservoir [[River delta|delta]]. This delta will fill the basin, and eventually, either the reservoir will need to be dredged or the dam will need to be removed. Knowledge of sediment transport can be used to properly plan to extend the life of a dam.

Geologists can use inverse solutions of transport relationships to understand flow depth, velocity, and direction, from sedimentary rocks and young deposits of alluvial materials.

Flow in culverts, over dams, and around bridge piers can cause erosion of the bed. This erosion can damage the environment and expose or unsettle the foundations of the structure. Therefore, good knowledge of the mechanics of sediment transport in a built environment are important for civil and hydraulic engineers.

When suspended sediment transport is increased due to human activities, causing environmental problems including the filling of channels, it is called [[siltation]] after the grain-size fraction dominating the process.

==Initiation of motion==
{{howto|date=February 2016}}

===Stress balance===

For a fluid to begin transporting sediment that is currently at rest on a surface, the boundary (or bed) [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; exerted by the fluid must exceed the critical shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; for the initiation of motion of grains at the bed. This basic criterion for the initiation of motion can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\tau_c&lt;/math&gt;.

This is typically represented by a comparison between a [[dimensionless]] shear stress (&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*&lt;/math&gt;)and a dimensionless critical shear stress (&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;). The nondimensionalization is in order to compare the driving forces of particle motion (shear stress) to the resisting forces that would make it stationary (particle density and size). This dimensionless shear stress, &lt;math&gt;\tau*&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[Shields parameter]] and is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Shields, A. (1936) Anwendung der Ähnlichkeitsmechanik und der Turbulenzforschung auf die Geschiebebewegung; In Mitteilungen der Preussischen Versuchsanstalt für Wasserbau und Schiffbau, Heft 26 ([http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:61a19716-a994-4942-9906-f680eb9952d6/Shields.pdf Online]; PDF; 3,8&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho_f)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

And the new equation to solve becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

The equations included here describe sediment transport for [[clastic]], or [[granular]] sediment. They do not work for [[clays]] and [[muds]] because these types of [[Flocculation|floccular]] sediments do not fit the geometric simplifications in these equations, and also interact thorough [[electrostatic]] forces. The equations were also designed for [[fluvial]] sediment transport of particles carried along in a liquid flow, such as that in a river, canal, or other open channel.

Only one size of particle is considered in this equation. However, river beds are often formed by a mixture of sediment of various sizes. In case of partial motion where only a part of the sediment mixture moves, the river bed becomes enriched in large gravel as the smaller sediments are washed away. The smaller sediments present under this layer of large gravel have a lower possibility of movement and total sediment transport decreases. This is called armouring effect.&lt;ref&gt;Saniya Sharmeen and Garry R. Willgoose1, 
The interaction between armouring and particle weathering for eroding landscapes, ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'' 31, 1195–1210 (2006)

&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of armouring of sediment or decreasing rates of sediment erosion can be caused by carpets of microbial mats, under conditions of high organic loading.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T.R., Grant, J. (2009) Quantifying erosion rates and stability of bottom sediments at mussel aquaculture sites in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Journal of Marine Systems. 75: 46-55. doi:10.1016/j.jmarsys.2008.07.009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical shear stress===

[[File:Shields diagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Original Shields diagram, 1936]]
The Shields{{fix|Diagram, citation}} diagram empirically shows how the dimensionless critical shear stress (i.e. the dimensionless shear stress required for the initiation of motion) is a function of a particular form of the particle [[Reynolds number]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p&lt;/math&gt; or Reynolds number related to the particle. This allows us to rewrite the criterion for the initiation of motion in terms of only needing to solve for a specific version of the particle Reynolds number, which we call &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p*&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=f\left(\mathrm{Re}_p*\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can then be solved by using the empirically derived Shields curve to find &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; as a function of a specific form of the particle Reynolds number called the boundary Reynolds number. The mathematical solution of the equation was given by [[Subhasish Dey|Dey]].&lt;ref&gt;Dey S. (1999) Sediment threshold. ''Applied Mathematical Modelling'', Elsevier, Vol. 23, No. 5, 399-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particle Reynolds Number===

In general, a particle Reynolds Number has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p=\frac{U_p D}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic particle velocity, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the grain diameter (a characteristic particle size), and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic viscosity, which is given by the dynamic viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, divided by the fluid density, &lt;math&gt;{\rho_f}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho_f}&lt;/math&gt;

The specific particle Reynolds number of interest is called the boundary Reynolds number, and it is formed by replacing the velocity term in the Particle Reynolds number by the [[shear velocity]], &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt;, which is a way of rewriting shear stress in terms of velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;u_*=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_b}{\rho_f}}=\kappa z \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bed shear stress (described below), and &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Kármán constant]], where

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = {0.407}&lt;/math&gt;.

The particle Reynolds number is therefore given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p*=\frac{u_* D}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Bed shear stress===

The boundary Reynolds number can be used with the Shields diagram to empirically solve the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f\left(\mathrm{Re}_p*\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

which solves the right-hand side of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to solve the left-hand side, expanded as

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho_f)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;,

we must find the bed shear stress, &lt;math&gt;{\tau_b}&lt;/math&gt;. There are several ways to solve for the bed shear stress. First, we develop the simplest approach, in which the flow is assumed to be steady and uniform and reach-averaged depth and slope are used. Due to the difficulty of measuring shear stress ''in situ'', this method is also one of the most-commonly used. This method is known as the [[depth-slope product]].

====Depth-slope product====
{{main|Depth-slope product}}

For a river undergoing approximately steady, uniform equilibrium flow, of approximately constant depth ''h'' and slope angle θ over the reach of interest, and whose width is much greater than its depth, the bed shear stress is given by some momentum considerations stating that the gravity force component in the flow direction equals exactly the friction force.&lt;ref name="Chanson"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title= The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow: An Introduction |publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann, 2nd edition, Oxford, UK, 630 pages |year=2004  |isbn=978-0-7506-5978-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a wide channel, it yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

For shallow slope angles, which are found in almost all natural lowland streams, the [[small-angle formula]] shows that &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the slope. Rewritten with this:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h S&lt;/math&gt;

====Shear velocity, velocity, and friction factor====

For the steady case, by extrapolating the depth-slope product and the equation for shear velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h S&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_*=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\tau_b}{\rho}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;,

We can see that the depth-slope product can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho u_*^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;u*&lt;/math&gt; is related to the mean flow velocity, &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;, through the generalized [[Darcy-Weisbach friction factor]], &lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor divided by 8 (for mathematical convenience).&lt;ref name="whipple roughness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-163-surface-processes-and-landscape-evolution-fall-2004/labs/roughnes_handout.pdf|title=Hydraulic Roughness|last=Whipple|first=Kelin|year=2004|work=12.163: Surface processes and landscape evolution|publisher=MIT OCW|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inserting this friction factor,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho C_f \left(\bar{u} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

====Unsteady flow====
For all flows that cannot be simplified as a single-slope infinite channel (as in the [[depth-slope product]], above), the bed shear stress can be locally found by applying the [[Shallow water equations|Saint-Venant equations]] for [[continuity equation|continuity]], which consider accelerations within the flow.

===Example===

====Set-up====

The criterion for the initiation of motion, established earlier, states that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}=\frac{\tau_{c}}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; is a function of boundary Reynolds number, a specific type of particle Reynolds number.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f \left(Re_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a particular particle Reynolds number, &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; will be an emprical constant given by the Shields Curve or by another set of empirical data (depending on whether or not the grain size is uniform).

Therefore, the final equation that we seek to solve is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}=f \left(Re_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Solution====

We make several assumptions to provide an example that will allow us to bring the above form of the equation into a solved form.

First, we assume that the a good approximation of reach-averaged shear stress is given by the depth-slope product. We can then rewrite the equation as

:&lt;math&gt;{\rho g h S}=0.06{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Moving and re-combining the terms, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={\frac{(\rho_s-\rho)}{\rho}(D)}\left(f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right) \right)=R D \left(f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[submerged specific gravity]] of the sediment.

We then make our second assumption, which is that the particle Reynolds number is high. This is typically applicable to particles of gravel-size or larger in a stream, and means that the critical shear stress is a constant. The Shields curve shows that for a bed with a uniform grain size,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.06&lt;/math&gt;.

Later researchers{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} have shown that this value is closer to

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.03&lt;/math&gt;

for more uniformly sorted beds. Therefore, we will simply insert

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and insert both values at the end.

The equation now reads:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}=R D \tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;

This final expression shows that the product of the channel depth and slope is equal to the Shield's criterion times the submerged specific gravity of the particles times the particle diameter.

For a typical situation, such as quartz-rich sediment &lt;math&gt;\left(\rho_s=2650 \frac{kg}{m^3} \right)&lt;/math&gt; in water &lt;math&gt;\left(\rho=1000 \frac{kg}{m^3} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the submerged specific gravity is equal to 1.65.

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{(\rho_s-\rho)}{\rho}=1.65&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the equation above,

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}=1.65(D)\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

For the Shield's criterion of &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.06&lt;/math&gt;. 0.06 * 1.65 = 0.099, which is well within standard margins of error of 0.1. Therefore, for a uniform bed,

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={0.1(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

For these situations, the product of the depth and slope of the flow should be 10% of the diameter of the median grain diameter.

The mixed-grain-size bed value is &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.03&lt;/math&gt;, which is supported by more recent research as being more broadly applicable because most natural streams have mixed grain sizes. Using this value, and changing D to D_50 ("50" for the 50th percentile, or the median grain size, as we are now looking at a mixed-grain-size bed), the equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={0.05(D_{50})}&lt;/math&gt;

Which means that the depth times the slope should be about 5% of the median grain diameter in the case of a mixed-grain-size bed.

==Modes of entrainment==

The sediments entrained in a flow can be transported along the bed as [[bed load]] in the form of sliding and rolling grains, or in suspension as [[suspended load]] advected by the main flow.&lt;ref name="Chanson" /&gt; Some sediment materials may also come from the upstream reaches and be carried downstream in the form of [[wash load]].

===Rouse number===

The location in the flow in which a particle is entrained is determined by the [[Rouse number]], which is determined by the density ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and diameter ''d'' of the sediment particle, and the density ''ρ'' and kinematic viscosity ''ν'' of the fluid, determine in which part of the flow the sediment particle will be carried.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-163-surface-processes-and-landscape-evolution-fall-2004/lecture-notes/4_sediment_transport_edited.pdf|title=IV.

:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{w_s}{\kappa u_\ast}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the Rouse number is given by ''P''. The term in the numerator is the (downwards) sediment the sediment [[Terminal velocity|settling velocity]] ''w''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which is discussed below. The upwards velocity on the grain is given as a product of the [[von Kármán constant]], ''κ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.4, and the [[shear velocity]], ''u''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;.

The following table gives the approximate required Rouse numbers for transport as [[bed load]], [[suspended load]], and [[wash load]].&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore_loose_ends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_20.pdf|title=Lecture 20—Some Loose Ends|last=Moore|first=Andrew|work=Lecture Notes: Fluvial Sediment Transport|location=Kent State|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settling velocity===
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|Streamlines around a sphere falling through a fluid. This illustration is accurate for [[laminar flow]], in which the particle [[Reynolds number]] is small. This is typical for small particles falling through a viscous fluid; larger particles would result in the creation of a [[turbulence|turbulent]] wake.]]

The settling velocity (also called the "fall velocity" or "[[terminal velocity]]") is a function of the particle [[Reynolds number]]. Generally, for small particles (laminar approximation), it can be calculated with [[Stokes' Law]]. For larger particles (turbulent particle Reynolds numbers), fall velocity is calculated with the turbulent [[Drag (physics)|drag]] law. [[William E. Dietrich|Dietrich]] (1982) compiled a large amount of published data to which he empirically fit settling velocity curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietrich|first=W. E.|year=1982|title=Settling Velocity of Natural Particles|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1615–1626|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jvenditt/geog413_613/readings/1982_Dietrich_settling_velocity.pdf|doi=10.1029/WR018i006p01615|bibcode=1982WRR....18.1615D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson and Church (2006) analytically combined the expressions for Stokes flow and a turbulent drag law into a single equation that works for all sizes of sediment, and successfully tested it against the data of Dietrich.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, R. I., and M. Church (2006), A Simple Universal Equation for Grain Settling Velocity, Journal of Sedimentary Research, 74(6) 933-937, {{doi|10.1306/051204740933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation is

:&lt;math&gt;w_s=\frac{RgD^2}{C_1 \nu + (0.75 C_2 R g D^3)^{(0.5)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sediment settling velocity, ''g'' is acceleration due to gravity, and ''D'' is mean sediment diameter. &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinematic viscosity]] of [[water]], which is approximately 1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s for water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C.

&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are constants related to the shape and smoothness of the grains.

The expression for fall velocity can be simplified so that it can be solved only in terms of ''D''. We use the sieve diameters for natural grains, &lt;math&gt;g=9.8&lt;/math&gt;, and values given above for &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. From these parameters, the fall velocity is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;w_s=\frac{16.17D^2}{1.8\cdot10^{-5} + (12.1275D^3)^{(0.5)}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram==
[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|300px|The [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] Hjulström curve]]
In 1935, [[Filip Hjulström]] created the [[Hjulström curve]], a graph which shows the relationship between the size of sediment and the velocity required to erode (lift it), transport it, or deposit it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Rivers,%20Floods/Long%20profile/Hjulstrom.htm The long profile – changing processes: types of erosion, transportation and deposition, types of load; the Hjulstrom curve]. coolgeography.co.uk. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The graph is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].

[[Åke Sundborg]] later modified the Hjulström curve to show separate curves for the movement threshold corresponding to several water depths, as is necessary if the flow velocity rather than the boundary shear stress (as in the Shields diagram) is used for the flow strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-090-special-topics-an-introduction-to-fluid-motions-sediment-transport-and-current-generated-sedimentary-structures-fall-2006/lecture-notes/ch9.pdf Special Topics: An Introduction to Fluid Motions, Sediment Transport, and Current-generated Sedimentary Structures; As taught in: Fall 2006]. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. 2006. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This curve has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity ''deceleration'' and erosion is caused by flow ''acceleration''. The dimensionless Shields diagram is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers.

==Transport rate==
[[File:Stream Load.gif|thumb|500px|right|A schematic diagram of where the different types of sediment load are carried in the flow. [[Dissolved load]] is not sediment: it is composed of disassociated [[ion]]s moving along with the flow. It may, however, constitute a significant proportion (often several percent, but occasionally greater than half) of the total amount of material being transported by the stream.]]

Formulas to calculate sediment transport rate exist for sediment moving in several different parts of the flow. These formulas are often segregated into [[bed load]], [[suspended load]], and [[wash load]]. They may sometimes also be segregated into [[bed material load]] and wash load.

===Bed Load===
Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and hopping (or [[saltation (geology)|saltating]]) over the bed, and moves at a small fraction of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the [[bed material load]] (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.

Bed load transport rates are usually expressed as being related to excess dimensionless shear stress raised to some power. Excess dimensionless shear stress is a nondimensional measure of bed shear stress about the threshold for motion.

:&lt;math&gt;(\tau^*_b-\tau^*_c)&lt;/math&gt;,

Bed load transport rates may also be given by a ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress, which is equivalent in both the dimensional and nondimensional cases. This ratio is called the "transport stage" &lt;math&gt;(T_s \text{ or } \phi)&lt;/math&gt; and is an important in that it shows bed shear stress as a multiple of the value of the criterion for the initiation of motion.

:&lt;math&gt;T_s=\phi=\frac{\tau_b}{\tau_c}&lt;/math&gt;

When used for sediment transport formulae, this ratio is typically raised to a power.

The majority of the published relations for bedload transport are given in dry sediment weight per unit channel width, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; ("[[breadth]]"):

:&lt;math&gt;q_s=\frac{Q_s}{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the difficulty of estimating bed load transport rates, these equations are typically only suitable for the situations for which they were designed.

====Notable bed load transport formulae====

=====Meyer-Peter Müller and derivatives=====

The transport formula of Meyer-Peter and Müller, originally developed in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer-Peter|first=E|author2=Müller, R.|title=Formulas for bed-load transport|year=1948|series=Proceedings of the 2nd Meeting of the International Association for Hydraulic Structures Research|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed for well-[[sorting (sediment)|sorted]] [[particle size (grain size)|fine]] [[gravel]] at a transport stage of about 8.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt; The formula uses the above nondimensionalization for shear stress,&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;,

and [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Einstein's]] nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = \frac{q_s}{D \sqrt{\frac{\rho_s-\rho}{\rho} g D}} = \frac{q_s}{Re_p \nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

Their formula reads:

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = 8\left(\tau*-\tau*_c \right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

Their experimentally determined value for &lt;math&gt;\tau*_c&lt;/math&gt; is 0.047, and is the third commonly used value for this (in addition to Parker's 0.03 and Shields' 0.06).

Because of its broad use, some revisions to the formula have taken place over the years that show that the coefficient on the left ("8" above) is a function of the transport stage:&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="f-l"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Luque|first=R|author2=van Beek, R|year=1976|title=Erosion and transport of bedload sediment|journal=Jour.

The variations in the coefficient were later generalized as a function of dimensionless shear stress:&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wiberg_smith"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1989)115:1(101)|title=Model for Calculating Bed Load Transport of Sediment|year=1989|last1=Wiberg|first1=Patricia L.|first2=J.|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=115|page=101|last2=Dungan Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wilcock and Crowe=====

In 2003, [[Peter Wilcock (scientist)|Peter Wilcock]] and Joanna Crowe (now Joanna Curran) published a sediment transport formula that works with multiple grain sizes across the sand and gravel range.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:2(120)|title=Surface-based Transport Model for Mixed-Size Sediment|year=2003|last1=Wilcock|first1=Peter R.|last2=Crowe|first2=Joanna C.|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=129|page=120|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their formula works with surface grain size distributions, as opposed to older models which use subsurface grain size distributions (and thereby implicitly infer a surface grain [[sorting (sediment)|sorting]]).

Their expression is more complicated than the basic sediment transport rules (such as that of Meyer-Peter and Müller) because it takes into account multiple grain sizes: this requires consideration of reference shear stresses for each grain size, the fraction of the total sediment supply that falls into each grain size class, and a "hiding function".

The "hiding function" takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause "equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones.&lt;ref name="parker_etal_1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=G.|author2=Klingeman, P. C. |author3=McLean, D. G. |year=1982|title=Bedload and Size Distribution in Paved Gravel-Bed Streams|journal=Journal of the Hydraulics Division|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]]|volume=108|issue=4|pages=544–571|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?8200331}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the "equal mobility" portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe /&gt;

Their model is based on the transport stage, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with several grain sizes simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each grain size class, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{c,D_i}&lt;/math&gt;, to be equal to a "reference shear stress", &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ri}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe/&gt;

They express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; (with the "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" indicating nondimensionality and the "&lt;math&gt;_i&lt;/math&gt;" indicating that it is a function of grain size):

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = \frac{R g q_{bi}}{F_i u*^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; per unit channel width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that is present on the bed.

They came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; 1.35&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 0.002 \phi^{7.5}&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq 1.35&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 14 \left(1 - \frac{0.894}{\phi^{0.5}}\right)^{4.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes large.

=====Wilcock and Kenworthy =====

In 2002, [[Peter Wilcock (scientist)|Peter Wilcock]] and Kenworthy T.A. , following Peter Wilcock (1998),&lt;ref name=Wilcock_Science&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.280.5362.410|last1=Wilcock|first1=P. R.|title=Two-fraction model of initial sediment motion in gravel-bed rivers|journal=Science|date=1998|issue=280|pages=410–412|bibcode = 1998Sci...280..410W }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a sediment bed-load transport formula that works with only  two sediments fractions, i.e. sand and gravel fractions.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2001WR000684|title=A two-fraction model for the transport of sand/gravel mixtures|year=2002|last1=Wilcock|first1=Peter R.|last2=Kenworthy|first2=T.|journal=Water Resour. Res.|volume=38|page=1194|issue=10|bibcode = 2002WRR....38.1194W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Wilcock and Kenworthy T.A. in their article recognized  that a mixed-sized sediment bed-load transport model using only two fractions offers practical advantages in terms of both computational and conceptual modeling by taking into account the nonlinear effects of sand presence in gravel beds on bed-load transport rate of both fractions. In fact, in the two-fraction bed load formula appears a new ingredient with respect to that of Meyer-Peter and Müller that is the proportion &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; of fraction &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt; on the bed surface where  the subscript &lt;math&gt;_i &lt;/math&gt; represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction. The proportion &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of  sand content &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, physically represents the relative influence of the mechanisms controlling sand and gravel transport, associated with the change from a clast-supported to matrix-supported gravel bed. Moreover, since &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; spans between 0 and 1, phenomena that vary with &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; include the relative size effects producing ‘‘hiding’’ of fine grains and ‘‘exposure’’ of coarse grains.
The ‘‘hiding’’ effect takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones.&lt;ref name="parker_etal_1982"/&gt; As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt;

Their model is based on the transport stage,''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with only two fractions simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each of the two grain size classes, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ri}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;_i &lt;/math&gt; represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction . The critical shear stress that represents the incipient motion for each of the two fractions is consistent with established values in the limit of pure sand and gravel beds and shows a sharp change with increasing sand content over the transition from a clast- to matrix-supported bed.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy/&gt;

They express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; (with the "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" indicating nondimensionality and the ‘‘&lt;math&gt;_i&lt;/math&gt;’’ indicating that it is a function of grain size):

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = \frac{R g q_{bi}}{F_i u*^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; per unit channel width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that is present on the bed.

They came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; \phi^'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 0.002 \phi^{7.5}&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq \phi^'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = A \left(1 - \frac{\chi}{\phi^{0.5}}\right)^{4.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes large and the symbols &lt;math&gt;A,\phi^',\chi&lt;/math&gt; have the following values:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 70 ,\phi^'=1.19 ,\chi=0.908, \text{laboratory}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;A = 115, \phi^'=1.27 ,\chi=0.923, \text{field}&lt;/math&gt;
In order to apply the above formulation, it is necessary to specify the characteristic grain sizes &lt;math&gt;D_s&lt;/math&gt; for the sand portion and &lt;math&gt;D_g&lt;/math&gt; for the gravel portion of the surface layer, the fractions &lt;math&gt; F_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; F_g&lt;/math&gt; of sand and gravel, respectively in the surface layer, the submerged specific gravity of the sediment R and shear velocity associated with skin friction &lt;math&gt; u_*&lt;/math&gt; .

===== Kuhnle ''et al.''=====
For the case in which sand fraction is transported by the current over and through an immobile gravel bed, Kuhnle ''et al.''(2013),&lt;ref name=Kuhnle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhnle|first1=R. A.|last2=Wren|first2=D. G.|last3=Langendoen|first3=E. J.|last4=Rigby|first4=J. R.|title=Sand Transport over an Immobile Gravel Substrate|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|date=2013|volume=139|issue=2|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000615}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011),&lt;ref name=Pellachini&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellachini|first1=Corrado|title=Modelling fine sediment transport over an immobile gravel bed|date=2011|publisher=Unitn-eprints|location=Trento|url=http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/605/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle ''et al.'' (2013)&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt; applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002)&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt; formula to their experimental data and found out that predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became near the top of the gravel layer.&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt; They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured sand bed load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002)&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt; formula  was larger than that available for transport within the gravel bed because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt;
To overcome this mismatch, following Pellachini (2011),&lt;ref name=Pellachini/&gt; they assumed that the variability of the bed shear stress available for the sand to be transported by the current would be some function of the so-called "Roughness Geometry Function" (RGF),&lt;ref name=Nikora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikora|first1=V|last2=Goring|first2=D|last3=McEwan|first3=I|last4=Griffiths|first4=G|title=Spatially averaged open-channel flow over rough bed|journal=J. Hydraul. Eng.|date=2001|volume=127|issue=2|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:2(123)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents the  gravel bed elevations distribution. Therefore, the sand bed load formula follows as:&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^*_s = 2.29*10^{-5} A(z_s)^{2.14}\left(\frac{\tau_b}{\tau_{cs} } \right)^{3.49}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;q^*_s = \frac{q_s}{[(s-1)gD_s]^{0.5}\rho_sD_s}&lt;/math&gt;
the subscript &lt;math&gt;_s&lt;/math&gt; refers to the sand fraction, s represents the ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_s/\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sand fraction density, &lt;math&gt; A(z_s)&lt;/math&gt; is the RGF as a function of the sand level &lt;math&gt; z_s&lt;/math&gt; within the gravel bed,  &lt;math&gt; \tau_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bed shear stress available for sand transport and &lt;math&gt; \tau_{cs}&lt;/math&gt; is the critical shear stress for incipient motion of the sand fraction, which was calculated graphically using the updated Shields-type relation of Miller ''et al.''(1977)&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M.C.|last2=McCave|first2=I.N.|last3=Komar|first3=P.D.|title=Threshold of sediment motion under unidirectional currents.|journal=Sedimentology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1977.tb00136.x|bibcode = 1977Sedim..24..507M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspended load===
{{Main|suspended load}}
Suspended load is carried in the lower to middle parts of the flow, and moves at a large fraction of the mean flow velocity in the stream.

A common characterization of suspended sediment concentration in a flow is given by the Rouse Profile. This characterization works for the situation in which sediment concentration &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; at one particular elevation above the bed &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; can be quantified. It is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c_s}{c_0} = \left[\frac{z \left(h-z_0\right)}{z_0\left(h-z\right)}\right]^{-P/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the elevation above the bed, &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of suspended sediment at that elevation, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the flow depth, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the Rouse number, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; relates the eddy viscosity for momentum &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt; to the eddy diffusivity for sediment, which is approximately equal to one.&lt;ref name="harris_sus_sed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vims.edu/~ckharris/MS698_03/lecture_09.pdf|title=Lecture 9: Suspended Sediment Transport II|last=Harris|first=Courtney K.|date=March 18, 2003|work=Sediment transport processes in coastal environments|accessdate=23 December 2009|location=[[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528054103/http://www.vims.edu/~ckharris/MS698_03/lecture_09.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{K_s}{K_m} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;

Experimental work has shown that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ranges from 0.93 to 1.10 for sands and silts.&lt;ref name="moore_sus_sed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_21.pdf|title=Lecture 21—Suspended Sediment Transport|last=Moore|first=Andrew|work=Lecture Notes: Fluvial Sediment Transport|accessdate=25 December 2009|location=Kent State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rouse profile characterizes sediment concentrations because the Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling under the weight of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.

===Bed material load===
Bed material load comprises the bed load and the portion of the suspended load that is sourced from the bed.

Three common bed material transport relations are the "Ackers-White",&lt;ref name="ackers-white"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackers|first=P.|author2=White, W.R. |year=1973|title=Sediment Transport: New Approach and Analysis|journal=[[Journal of the Hydraulics Division]]|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]]|volume=99|issue=11|pages=2041–2060|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?7300122}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Engelund-Hansen", "Yang" formulae. The first is for [[sand]] to [[Granule (geology)|granule]]-size gravel, and the second and third are for sand&lt;ref name="bm_eval"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ariffin|first=J. |author2=A.A. Ghani |author3=N.A. Zakaira |author4=A.H. Yahya|date=14–16 October 2002|title=Evaluation of equations on total bed material load|journal=International Conference on Urban Hydrology for the 21st Century|location=[[Kuala Lumpur]]|url=http://redac.eng.usm.my/html/publish/2002_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Yang later expanded his formula to include fine gravel. That all of these formulae cover the sand-size range and two of them are exclusively for sand is that the sediment in sand-bed rivers is commonly moved simultaneously as bed and suspended load.

====Engelund-Hansen====

The bed material load formula of Engelund and Hansen is the only one to not include some kind of critical value for the initiation of sediment transport. It reads:

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = \frac{0.05}{c_f} \tau*^{2.5} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_s*&lt;/math&gt; is the Einstein nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width, &lt;math&gt;c_f&lt;/math&gt; is a friction factor, and &lt;math&gt;\tau*&lt;/math&gt; is the Shields stress. The Engelund-Hansen formula is one of the few sediment transport formulae in which a threshold "critical shear stress" is absent.

===Wash load===
Wash load is carried within the water column as part of the flow, and therefore moves with the mean velocity of main stream. Wash load concentrations are approximately uniform in the water column. This is described by the endmember case in which the Rouse number is equal to 0 (i.e. the settling velocity is far less than the turbulent mixing velocity), which leads to a prediction of a perfectly uniform vertical concentration profile of material.

===Total load===
Some authors have attempted formulations for the total sediment load carried in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=C|title=Unit stream power equations for total load|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|page=123|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90092-1|bibcode = 1979JHyd...40..123Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailard|first1=James A.|title=An Energetics Total Load Sediment Transport Model For a Plane Sloping Beach|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=86|page=10938|year=1981|doi=10.1029/JC086iC11p10938|bibcode=1981JGR....8610938B}}&lt;/ref&gt; These formulas are designed largely for sand, as (depending on flow conditions) sand often can be carried as both bed load and suspended load in the same stream or shoreface.

In one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first [[ejaculation]] occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2126">[[File:'Moses' by Michelangelo JBU310.jpg|thumb|"[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]" by Michelangelo]]

'''Terribilità''', the spelling in modern Italian, or '''terribiltà''', as [[Michelangelo]]'s 16th century contemporaries tended to spell it, is a quality of provoking  terror (the literal meaning), awe, or a sense of the sublime, in the viewer, that is ascribed to his art.  It is perhaps especially applied to his [[sculpture]]s, such as his figures of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] or in [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].

[[Pope Julius II]] was apparently the first to describe Michelangelo as a ''uomo terribile'' ("terror-inducing man"), apparently describing his difficult character as much as his art. This ''terribilità'', also references the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonics]] of humanists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had known Michelangelo in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lleó Cañal, Vicente, Revista de Libros:Tintoretto 2, 2 Abril 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's friend and collaborator [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] reported in a letter to him of 15 October 1520 on a private audience with [[Pope Leo X]].  After praising Michelangelo's work, the pope continued "But he is ''terribile'', as you see; one cannot deal with him".  Sebastiano responded "that your ''terribile'' character did not harm anyone, and that you appear ''terribile'' for love of the great works you carry out."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition handlist for "Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano", 2017, National Gallery.

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

{{Crossdressing}}

'''Transvestic fetishism''' is a psychiatric diagnosis applied to those who are thought to have an excessive sexual or erotic interest in [[cross-dressing]]; this interest is often expressed in [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] behavior.  It differs from cross-dressing for entertainment or other purposes that do not involve [[sexual arousal]], and is categorized as a [[paraphilia]] in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-paraphillic"&gt;{{Cite book

| last= American Psychiatric Association
| year= 2013
| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

| pages=685–705
| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sexual arousal in response to donning sex-typical clothing is [[homeovestism]].)

== Description ==
Males with late onset gender dysphoria "frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement," which could include transvestic fetishism. "Habitual fetishistic tranvestism developing into [[autogynephilia]]" is given a risk factor for [[gender dysphoria]] to develop. &lt;ref&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], [[DSM-5|5th ed.]], p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some male transvestic fetishists collect women's [[clothing]], e.g. [[panties]], [[nightgown]]s, [[babydoll]]s, [[bridal gown]]s, [[Slip (clothing)|slips]], [[brassiere]]s, and other types of [[nightwear]], [[lingerie]], [[stockings]], [[pantyhose]], [[shoes]], and [[boots]], items of a distinct feminine look and feel. They may dress in these feminine garments and take photographs of themselves while living out their fantasies. 

According to DSM-IV, this fetishism was limited to [[heterosexual]] men; however, DSM-5 does not have this restriction, and opens it to women and men with this interest, regardless of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf DSM-5 Documents: Paraphilic Disorders Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two key criteria before a psychiatric diagnosis of "transvestic fetishism" is made:&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individuals must be sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing.
# Individuals must experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior.

'''Tyndale House''' is an independent biblical studies [[library]] with a Christian foundation. Founded in 1944, it aims to provide specialist resources in support of research into the [[Old Testament]], [[New Testament]] and relevant historical backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Noble, ''Tyndale House and Fellowship: The first sixty years'', IVP, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1844740956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Tyndale House is a residential centre for biblical studies in [[Cambridge]].  As such, it has many readers who are doctoral students from the [[University of Cambridge]] studying either in the [[Faculty of Divinity, Cambridge|Faculty of Divinity]] or the [[Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, Cambridge|Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies]]. In addition, Tyndale House also houses students and scholars from around the world working at postgraduate level. Scholars who have spent time at Tyndale House include [[John Stott]], [[D. A. Carson]], [[Wayne Grudem]], [[J. I. Packer]] and [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]].

The academic society associated with Tyndale House is the [[Tyndale Fellowship]], an international fellowship of Christians who are engaged in biblical and theological research.  The ''[[Tyndale Bulletin]]'' is the journal of Tyndale House and of the Tyndale Fellowship, and is published twice a year.

In 2013 Tyndale House launched the online Bible software the [[STEP Bible]]. 

In 2017 Tyndale House published an edition of the Greek New Testament with [[Cambridge University Press]] and Crossway Books.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thegreeknewtestament.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics==
The '''Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics (KLICE)''' is an independent [[evangelical]] organisation that promotes the study and understanding of [[Christian ethics]], both in research and in public discourse. KLICE was founded in 2006, and is based at Tyndale House, supported by the Kirby Laing Foundation (established by [[John Laing (businessman)|John Laing]]). The current director is Rev. Dr. Craig G. Bartholomew, who was the H Evan Runner Professor of Philosophy and Professor of Religion and Theology at [[Redeemer University College]] in [[Ancaster, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.klice.co.uk/index.php/director|title=www.klice.co.uk|website=www.klice.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KLICE's activities include research, publication, collaborative projects, and running conferences and seminars. KLICE states that its vision is "to contribute a Christian perspective to public debates about ethics in the UK."

Three times a year KLICE publishes articles on various ethical subjects under the name ''Ethics in Brief''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klice.co.uk/index.php/resources/ethics-in-brief ''Ethics in Brief'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Director of KLICE was Jonathan Chaplin, who held his position from 2006 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klice.co.uk/index.php/about/people People], KLICE&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Helsinki''' ({{lang-fi|Helsingin yliopisto}}, {{lang-sv|Helsingfors universitet}}, {{lang-la|Universitas Helsingiensis}}, abbreviated '''UH''') is a university located in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] since 1829, but was founded in the city of [[Turku]] (in Swedish ''Åbo'') in 1640 as the ''[[Royal Academy of Åbo]]'', at that time part of the [[Swedish Empire]]. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes.

As of 1 August 2005, the university complies with the harmonized structure of the Europe-wide [[Bologna Process]] and offers Bachelor, Master, [[Licenciate]], and [[Doctorate|Doctoral degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/tutkinnonuudistus/materiaalit/raportit/Bologna_review_20041122.pdf|title=Bologna Process at the University of Helsinki|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172641/http://www.helsinki.fi/tutkinnonuudistus/materiaalit/raportit/Bologna_review_20041122.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to degree programmes is usually determined by entrance examinations, in the case of bachelor's degrees, and by prior degree results, in the case of master and postgraduate degrees.  Entrance is particularly selective (circa 15% of the yearly applicants are admitted). It has been ranked a top 100 university in the world according to the 2016 ARWU, QS and THE rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Institution.jsp?param=University%20of%20Helsinki |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118045130/http://www.shanghairanking.com/Institution.jsp?param=University%20of%20Helsinki |archive-date=18 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings|title=World University Rankings|work=Top Universities|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-of-helsinki?ranking-dataset=133819|title=World University Rankings 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is bilingual, with teaching by law provided both in Finnish and Swedish. Since Swedish, albeit an official language of Finland, is a minority language, Finnish is by far the dominating language at the university. Teaching in English is extensive throughout the university at Master, Licentiate, and Doctoral levels, making it a ''de facto'' third language of instruction.

Remaining true to its traditionally strong [[Humboldtian model of higher education|Humboldtian]] ethos, the University of Helsinki places heavy emphasis on high-quality teaching and research of a top international standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Helsingin Sanomat'', International Edition – Metro, 2.3.2006. "Assay finds research at University of Helsinki is of high international standard".[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Assay+finds+research+at+University+of+Helsinki+is+of+high+international+standard/1135218988844]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of various prominent international university networks, such as [[Europaeum]], [[Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe|UNICA]],&lt;ref&gt;UNICA = "Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe".&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Utrecht Network]], and is a founding member of the [[League of European Research Universities]].

{{For|the early history (1640-1809)|Royal Academy of Turku}}

===Royal Academy of Åbo 1640–1828===
{{main|Royal Academy of Turku}}
The first predecessor of the university, [[Katedralskolan i Åbo|The Cathedral School of Åbo]], was presumably founded in 1276 for education of boys to become servants of the Church. As the university was founded in 1640 by [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] (1626–1689) in [[Turku]] (Sw. Åbo), as the [[Royal Academy of Turku|Åbo Kungliga Akademi]] ({{lang-la|Regia Academia Aboensis}}), the senior part of the school formed the core of the new university, while the junior year courses formed a grammar school. It was the third [[university]] founded in the [[Swedish Empire]], following [[Uppsala University]] and the [[Academia Gustaviana]] in [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (predecessor to the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Estonia]]).

The second period of the university's history covers the period when Finland was a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire, from 1809 to 1917. As Finland became part of the Russian Empire in 1809, [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] expanded the university and allocated substantial funds to it. Following the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, higher education within the country was moved to Helsinki, the new administrative heart of the Grand Duchy, in 1828, and renamed the ''Imperial Alexander University in Finland'' in honour of the late benefactor of the university. In the capital the primary task of the university was to educate the Grand Duchy’s civil servants.

The university became a community subscribing to the new [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] ideals of science and culture, studying humanity and its living environment by means of scientific methods. The new statutes of the university enacted in 1828 defined the task of the university as promoting the development of “the Sciences and Humanities within Finland and, furthermore, educating the youth for the service of the Emperor and the Fatherland”.

The Alexander University was a centre of national life that promoted the birth of an independent Finnish State and the development of Finnish identity. The great men of 19th century Finland, [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]], [[Elias Lönnrot]] and [[Zachris Topelius]], were all involved in the activities of the university. The university became a major center of Finnish cultural, political, and legal life in 19th century Finland, and became a remarkable ''primum mobile'' of the nationalist and liberal cultural movements, political parties, and student organisations.

In the 19th century university research changed from being collection-centred to being experimental, empirical, and analytical. The more scientific approach of the university led to specialisation and created new disciplines. As the scientific disciplines developed, Finland received ever more scholarly knowledge and highly educated people, some of whom entered rapidly evolving industry or the government.

===University of Helsinki 1919–present===
The third period of the university's history began with the creation of the independent Republic of Finland in 1917, and with the renaming of the university as the ''University of Helsinki''. Once Finland gained her independence in 1917 the university was given a crucial role in building the nation state and, after [[World War II]], the welfare state. Members of the academic community promoted the international relations of the new state and the development of its economic life. Furthermore, they were actively involved in national politics and the struggle for equality.

In the [[interwar period]] the university was the scene of a conflict between those who wanted to advance the usage of Finnish language in the university, to the detriment of Swedish and those who opposed such move.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Universitetsadresserna |title=Universitetsadresserna |last=Sundman |first=Lasse  |date=24 April 2011 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer [[Väinö Tanner (geographer)|Väinö Tanner]] was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish language usage.&lt;ref name=UppslagsverketFi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-TannerVaeinoe |title=Tanner, Väinö |last=Lindberg |first=Johan  |date=5 August 2011 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] initiated a campaign collecting 153 914 signatures in defense of the Swedish language that were handed to the parliament and government in October 1934.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt; On an international front academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representations of Finland in their respective countries warning about a weakening of the Nordic unity that would result from diminishing the role of Swedish in the University of Helsinki.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt;

In the 20th century, scholarly research at the University of Helsinki reached the level of the European elite in many disciplines. This was manifested, among other things, by international recognitions granted to its professors, such as the [[Fields Medal]] received by the mathematician [[Lars Ahlfors]] (1936), the Nobel Prize in Chemistry granted to Professor [[A.I. Virtanen]] (1945) and the Nobel Prize in Medicine shared by Professor [[Ragnar Granit]] (1967).

After World War II, University research focused on improving Finnish living conditions and supporting major changes in the structure of society and business. The university also contributed to the breakthrough of modern technology.{{vague|date=December 2011}}{{examples|date=December 2011}}

The progress of scientific development created many new disciplines and faculties at the University of Helsinki. At present the university comprises 11 faculties, 500 professors and almost 40,000 students. The university has established as its goal to further its position as one of Europe’s top multidisciplinary research universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/yliopistonhistoria/english/imperal.htm|title=University of Helsinki|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

[[File:Main Auditorium, Helsinki University.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Main Auditorium, University of Helsinki]]
The university is located on four main [[campus]]es. Originally, the entire university was located in the very centre of Helsinki, but due to the rapid growth of the university since the 1930s, premises have been built and acquired in other areas.

===City Centre Campus===
The historical [[City Centre Campus]] has been the hub of activity ever since the university moved from Turku to Helsinki in the early 19th century. The campus has a central location and reflects the architectural style of this part of the city. The university buildings in the city center house the Faculties of Theology, Law, Arts, Behavioural Sciences and Social Sciences plus administrative functions. Most of the buildings on the campus have a major architectural significance ranging from the dominating Neo-Classical, through the Jugendstil, to 20th century Modernism.
[[File:Helsinki--Psyc Department.jpg|thumb|Minerva, Department of Teacher Education]]
The City Centre Campus, extending around the historical centre of Helsinki, Senate Square, and Kruununhaka city district, is the administrative heart of the University of Helsinki and has the largest concentration of faculties in Helsinki.

After the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, Emperor Nicholas I ordered the Royal Academy of Turku be moved to the new capital city of the Grand Duchy of Finland, Helsinki, where the Imperial Alexander University in Finland began to operate the next year. Helsinki was to become Finland's window to the world; a European city to which the university belonged as an integral part. [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], architect, was given the assignment of designing an Empire-style main building next to Senate Square, facing the Imperial Senate. The main building was completed in 1832. Thanks to the lessons learnt from the fire of Turku, the library was built separate from other premises. The library and several faculty buildings in the campus were also designed by Engel.

[[File:HU-main-building-1944b.jpg|thumb|University Main Building on fire after Soviet bombings in 1944.]]
The main building as well as other buildings of the campus were badly damaged during the [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|Soviet bombings in World War II]] but rebuilt after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museo.helsinki.fi/yliopiston_historia/pommitus.htm|title=Helsingin suurpommitukset ja yliopisto|author=Kati Heinämies|language=fi|publisher=Helsinki University Museum Arppeanum|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan concerning the concentration of university facilities dating back to the 1980s, aimed to achieve a closer unity between facilities. The City Centre Campus does not stand out from the rest of the urban environment but is a part of the city, in line with the old university tradition. The university facilities still form a functional and coherent whole, consisting not only of historically valuable buildings, but also of facilities for 20,000 students and 3,000 teachers and other staff.

===Kumpula Campus===
The [[Kumpula Campus]], housing the Faculty of Science, is located four kilometers north from the centre of Helsinki near tram lines 6 and 8. The campus houses the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, and Geosciences and Geography.

The university departments were located in Kumpula for the first time in 1978 when the City of Helsinki leased the area for the university. A planning competition for the city plan for the area was held a year earlier. In the 1980s, the Accelerator Laboratory of the Department of Physics was quarried into Kumpula rock and the construction of Kumpula Botanical Garden began in 1987. It was not, however, until the 1990s when the construction work proper began, transforming the area into a significant campus.
[[File:Kumpula Campus Physicum.jpg|thumb|Kumpula Campus Physicum]]
The Chemicum, the building housing the Department of Chemistry and VERIFIN (Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention), and the Physicum, which provides facilities for physics, geology and geography are located on Kumpula campus surrounding a square named after the Finnish Nobel prize winner, A. I. Virtanen. Kumpula Campus Library is also located in the Physicum. The Kumpula Sports Centre is planned for the recreational use of both university staff and students and citizens of Helsinki alike. Completed in 2004, the Exactum provides facilities for seismology, computer science and mathematical subjects, as well as administrative services.

The campus comprises two main parts: the Botanical Garden, surrounding the old building stock of Kumpula manor and the modern new building stock located a couple of hundred metres north of the manor. The greenness of the area makes the dynamic campus stand out as a unique, distinctive complex. The campus offers study and research facilities for 6,000 students and 1,000 teachers. The Finnish Meteorological Institute moved to the area in 2005. That building is known as Dynamicum.

===Meilahti Campus===
[[File:Kaisaniemi Botanical Garden Water lily room 2011-08-05 1.jpg|thumb|Kaisaniemi Botanical Garden Water lily room 2011-08-05 1]]
The [[Meilahti Campus]], with the Faculty of Medicine, is a part of the [[Meilahti]] Hospital District on the edge of the city centre. Just a few kilometres from the City Centre Campus, the Meilahti area has been transformed into a cradle of top research on medicine, 'Medilahti'. Established in the 1930s, the Women's Clinic was accompanied by Finland's leading hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) in 1966. The same year saw the completion of facilities for theoretical subject departments on Haartmaninkatu street. The building is now being renovated and extended. The latest completed facilities in the campus include the National Library of Health Sciences Terkko and the research and teaching centre Biomedicum, which accommodates 1,200 researchers.

The Ruskeasuo premises, including the Department of Dentistry, Institute for Oral Health, Department of Public Health and Department of Forensic Medicine, also belong to the Meilahti campus. The Meilahti and Ruskeasuo areas form a close-knit complex providing a meeting place for medical education, international top-level research and nursing. The campus is a workplace for 2,000 students and 1,500 teachers.

Thanks to the years-long project to combine the teaching facilities of the Faculty of Medicine, Meilahti is now a functional unity of medicine and health care. The atmosphere in the campus inspires people in their studies, research and international co-operation.

Although the Meilahti campus is intertwined with the rest of Meilahti district, it succeeds in forming a clear-cut campus area with its hospital-type building stock.

===Viikki Campus===
The [[Viikki Campus]] is located in the semi-suburban greenspace of the [[Viikki]] area, some 8 kilometres north-east of the city centre. It houses the Faculties of Agriculture and Forestry, Biosciences, Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy. It is an important concentration in the field of biosciences, even by European standards. Indeed, it is often called the bioscience campus or the “green campus”.

In addition to biosciences, the campus is home to a wide range of other life science researchers and students in such fields as environmental science, veterinary medicine, food research and economics. Numerous international research groups also work on the Viikki Campus. The Viikki Campus is the location of four faculties, two independent institutes and the Viikki Science Library.

It also attracts an increasing number of businesses to the Helsinki Business and Science Park. The Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute and the Finnish Food Safety Authority, Evira, have also moved to Viikki and negotiations are under way to relocate MTT Agrifood Research Finland to Viikki to complement the Department of Economics and Management.

The Viikki Campus unites a multidisciplinary science community of more than 6,500 students and 1,600 teachers, a residential area emphasising ecological values and the natural surroundings, including recreational areas and nature reserves, and forms a unique whole. The campus also has the Viikinlahti conservation area, which is particularly popular among bird watchers.

==Libraries and museums==

===The National Library of Finland===
The [[National Library of Finland]] is the foremost research library in Finland and the main branch of the University of Helsinki's library system. The National Library of Finland is the oldest and largest scholarly library in Finland as well as one of the largest independent institutes at the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the collection, description, preservation and accessibility of Finland’s printed national heritage and the unique collections under its care. The National Library also serves as a national service and development centre for the library sector and promotes national and international cooperation in the field.

===The Helsinki University Main Library===
[[File:Kaisa-talo3.jpg|thumb|150px|The new Main Library in Kaisa House.|right]]
The Main Library of the university is used by students for research and studying. Located a few blocks down the street from the university's main building in the city center, the new Main Library was opened in 2012 in the Kaisa House. The new library merged the undergraduate library and four dispersed faculty libraries of the city center campus to a collection of approximately 1.5 million books.&lt;ref name="ht-kaisa-library"/&gt; The architecture of the new building, designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, has been praised&lt;ref name="ht-kaisa-library"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/4356-new-university-library-a-wonder-of-design-and-learning-2.html|title=New university library a wonder of design and learning|work=Helsinki Times|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/16082012/kaupunki/Valo+tulvii+Kaisa-kirjastoon/a1345006266956|title=Valo tulvii Kaisa-kirjastoon|last=Salmela|first=Marja|work=Helsingin Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=Light floods Kaisa Library|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/library/contact-us/for-media/main-library-in-kaisa-house/|title=Pääkirjasto Kaisa-talossa|publisher=Helsinki University Library|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Helsinki University Museum===
The [[Helsinki University Museum]] is the museum of the University of Helsinki and was located until June 2014 on ''Snellmanninkatu'' off the north-east corner of Senate Square. Museums main exhibition moved to the University Main Building in 2015.

Helsinki University Museum was established in 2003 by merging the former University Museum specialising in the history of the University of Helsinki, the Museum of Medical History, the Museum of the History of Veterinary Medicine, the Museum of the History of Dentistry and the Collections of Craft Science. To complement the new conglomeration of museums, the Mineral Cabinet, which today belongs to the Finnish Museum of Natural History, returned to its original location in the Arppeanum building. Each year the museum also holds one or two temporary exhibitions in a specially designed area. Museums exhibition in Arppeanum Building was closed in June 2014. New main exhibition was opened in the Main Building in March 2015.

The University Museum is in charge of the preservation and conservation of the university’s valuable museum collections and property: old tuition and research equipment, furniture and works of art. The museum maintains an index register of all valuables that are kept in the facilities of the university. The museum also provides library, archive and photographic services pertaining to the history of the university and the history of medical science.

===Finnish Museum of Natural History===
[[File:Helsingin Luonnontieteellinen museo.JPG|thumb|200px|Museum of Natural History.|right]]
The [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]] is a research institution under the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the national botanical, zoological, geological and paleontological collections consisting of samples from around the world. The collections serve scientific, public informational and educational purposes.

==Student life==

===Student Union===
[[File:Helsinki Old Student House.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Vanha Ylioppilastalo|The Old Student House]] (Student Union), Aleksanterinkatu.]]
The [[Student Union of the University of Helsinki]] (''Helsingin yliopiston ylioppilaskunta'', HYY) was founded in 1868. It currently has 32,000 members and is one of the world's wealthiest student organizations, with assets of several hundred million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/25/business/worldbusiness/25iht-small.t.html |title=HYY of Helsinki Runs a $200 Million Enterprise : University Student Union Plays Business Tycoon |first=Barry |last=James |date=25 May 1998 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it owns a good deal of property in the city centre of Helsinki. The union has been at the centre of student politics from the 19th Century nationalist movements, through the actions of the New Left in the 1960s, up to the present. Its governing assembly consists of parties which are connected to faculty organisations, the [[Nations at Finnish universities#Student nations at Helsinki University|Student Nations]], and the mainstream [[List of political parties in Finland|political parties]].

===Student nations===
The [[Nations in Finnish universities#Student nations at Helsinki University|student nations]] are student organisations that provide extra-curricular activities to students. Along with the faculty-based organisations, the nations provide one of the main nodes of student social life. The nations at University of Helsinki have a special legal status in the Universities Act. There are 15 nations at the university, each one representing a historic region or province of Finland, with four of these representing [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] regions.  Membership is optional.

{{Other uses|Vertex (disambiguation)}}

A '''vertex''' (plural '''vertices''') in [[computer graphics]] is a data structure that describes certain attributes, like the position of a point in 2D or 3D [[space]], at multiple points on a surface.

==Application to 3D models==

[[3D models]] are most-often represented as triangulated [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] forming a [[triangle mesh]]. Non triangular surfaces can be converted to an array of triangles through [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tessellation]]. Attributes from the vertices are typically interpolated across mesh surfaces.

==Vertex attributes==

The vertices of triangles are associated not only with spatial position but also with other values used to [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the object correctly.  Most attributes of a vertex represent vectors in the space to be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]. These vectors are typically 1 (''x''), 2 (''x, y''), or 3 (''x, y, z'') dimensional and can include a fourth [[Homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous coordinate]] (''w''). These values are given meaning by a [[Material (computer graphics)|material]] description. In [[realtime rendering]] these properties are used by a [[vertex shader]] or [[vertex pipeline]].

Such attributes can include:

{{term|Position}}
{{defn|2D or 3D coordinates representing a position in space}}

{{term|Color}}
{{defn|Typically diffuse or specular [[RGB]] values, either representing surface colour or [[precomputed lighting]] information.}}

{{term|Reflectance}}
{{defn|of the surface at the vertex, e.g. [[specular exponent]], metallicity, fresnel values.}}

{{term|Texture coordinates}}
{{defn|Also known as [[UV coordinates]],these control the [[texture mapping]] of the surface, possibly for multiple layers.}}
{{term|normal vectors|content=[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]}}
{{defn|These define an approximated curved surface at the location of the vertex, used for lighting calculations (such as [[Phong shading]]), [[normal mapping]], or [[displacement mapping]], and to control subdivision.}}
{{term|tangent vectors|content=[[tangent vectors]]}}
{{defn| These define an approximated curved surface at the location of the vertex, used for lighting calculations (such as [[Phong shading]]), [[normal mapping]], or [[displacement mapping]], and to control subdivision.}}

{{term|[[Weight maps|Blend weights]]}}
{{term|[[Weight maps|Bone weights]]}}
{{defn|[[Weighting]] for assignment to bones to control deformation in [[skeletal animation]].}}

{{term|Blend shapes}}
{{defn|Multiple position vectors may be specified to be blended over time, especially for [[facial animation]].}}

'''VisualFEA''' is a finite element analysis program running on MS Windows and Mac OS X platforms. The program is being developed and distributed by Intuition Software, Inc. in South Korea, and is used chiefly for structural and geotechnical analysis.  The strongest point of the program is its intuitive and user-friendly usage based on graphical pre- and postprocessing capabilities.  VisualFEA has educational functions for teaching and learning structural mechanics and finite element analysis through graphical simulation. Thus, this program is widely used in college courses related to structural mechanics and finite element method.

==Overview==
VisualFEA is a full-fledged finite element analysis program with many easy-to-use but powerful features, which can be classified largely into four parts: finite element processing, pre-processing, post-processing and educational simulation.  All the functions are integrated into a single executable module, which is a characteristic of the program distinguished from other finite element analysis programs generally composed of multiple modules.  The whole procedure from pre-processing to analysis, and to post-processing can be completed on the spot without launching one program after another, or without pipelining data from one program to another.

==Processing==
VisualFEA can solve the following types of problems.
* Mechanical analysis
:Truss, frame, plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, plate bending, shell and 3D solid 
:Linear, material nonlinear or geometric nonlinear analysis
:Static or dynamic analysis
:Construction staged analysis
:Geotechnical analysis (consolidation, slope stability analysis)
* Heat conduction analysis
:Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume
:Steady state or transient analysis
:Linear or nonlinear material model
:Fire damage analysis
* Seepage analysis
:Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume
:Steady state or transient analysis
:Confined or unconfined boundary condition
* Coupled analysis
:Heat conduction coupled mechanical analysis
:Seepage coupled mechanical analysis

==Pre-processing==
A finite element model in VisualFEA consists of various objects: curve, primitive surface, node, element and mesh. VisualFEA has its own CAD-like capabilities of creating graphical objects without aid of external programs. VisualFEA can create structured or unstructured meshes in two- or three-dimensional space using the following mesh generation schemes.
* Mapping scheme (lofting, tri-mapping, transfinite mapping, isoparametric mapping)  
* Sweeping scheme (extrusion, translation, rotation, twisting)
* Auto mesh scheme (triangulation, tetrahedronization)
* Mesh treatment (mesh carving, mesh operation, intersection, distortion)
The program has the function to save the generated mesh data in text format for use by other application programs. Other pre-processing capabilities include the following items.
* Definition and assignment of boundary conditions, material properties and element joints, etc.
* Node number or element number optimization
* Handling of element orientation, local coordinate axes

==Post-processing==
VisualFEA has various functions of visualizing the numerical data generated by solving the analysis models.  The most frequently used graphical representation of the data are the contour and vector images.  There are many other forms of graphical representation available in VisualFEA.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Interactive visualization of elasto-plastic behavior through stress paths and yield surfaces in finite element analysis, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 47(2011), pp496-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* Iso-surface
* Sliced plane, parallel plane, cross plane
* Diagram (bending moment diagram, shear force diagram, etc.)
* Curve plotting
* Data probing
* Animation

==Educational Simulation==
VisualFEA can be used as a tool for computer-aided education of structural mechanics and finite element method.  The tools are operated with the user-created modeling data and their ensuing analysis results on the basis of finite element technology.  They are devised to promote the understanding, and to stimulate the interest in the subjects by substantiating the conceptual principles and visually exhibiting the complex computational processes with the aid of interactive computer graphics.  The topics covered by the educational functions are as follows.
* Mathematical relationships of internal forces in rigid frames.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Frame analysis, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp387-409&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geometric properties of an arbitrarily defined member section
* Stresses on the member sections
* Moving load
* Mohr circle and its application to elasto-plastic yielding.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu and Y.T.Park, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Mohr's circle and its application, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp494-508&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress path and yield surface
* Buckling
* Stiffness assembly and solution process in the finite element analysis.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, Interactive simulation of finite element equation processing for educational purposes, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp157-169, DOI 10.1002/cae.21586&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shape function and interpolation
* Eigen value analysis.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu, Interactive simulation of eigenmodes for instruction of finite element behavior, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp872-886, DOI 10.1002/cae.21659&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concept of adaptive analysis

==VisualFEA/CBT==
VisualFEA/CBT is an educational version of the program&lt;ref&gt;R.D.Cook and Intuition Software, VisualFEA and General User Manual, John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; published by [http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-WILEYASIA2_SEARCH_RESULT.html?query=visualfea John Wiley and Son's Inc.] as a companion program to a textbook&lt;ref&gt;R.D.Cook, D.S.Malkus, M.E.Plesha, R.J.Witt, Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, 4th ed., John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; on finite element method. The program has the limitation of 3000 nodes that can be handled.

[[File:Freest Peenestrom Windwatt.JPG|thumb|A ''windwatt'' in the [[Peenestrom]] near [[Kröslin|Freest]]]]
[[File:Windwatt.jpg|thumb|A ''windwatt'' that appeared in [[Eckernförde]] as a result of [[Cyclone Xaver]]]]
A '''''windwatt''''' is a [[mudflat]] exposed as a result of wind action on water. They occur especially in the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]] on Germany's [[Baltic Sea]] coast. The term is German.&lt;ref name="nordmole"&gt;[http://www.nordmole.de/stadt-und-land/ostsee/82-was-ist-windwatt.html ''Was ist Windwatt?''] at www.nordmole.de. Accessed on 17 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Wadden Sea]] along Europe's [[North Sea]] coast, the shallow water zones of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park are largely unaffected by [[Tide|oceanic tides]]. When there are strong winds in a certain direction, however, water is driven out of the lagoons (the so-called ''[[bodden]]'') into the [[Baltic Sea]], so that several particularly shallow areas of mud become exposed and dry out. The water flows back when the wind turns again.&lt;ref name="nordmole"/&gt; 
These ''windwatts'' are a major source of food for [[migrating birds]] in the [[autumn]]. For the [[Crane (bird)|Crane]], which cross Western Pomeranian bodden country during migration, the ''windwatts'' are one of the most important resting areas in Western Europe.
