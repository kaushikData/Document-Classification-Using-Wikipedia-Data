'''Abandonware''' is a [[Product (business)|product]], typically [[software]], ignored by its owner and manufacturer, and for which no support is available. Although such software is usually still under [[copyright]], the owner may not be tracking copyright violations.

In [[intellectual rights]] context, abandonware is a software (or hardware) special case of the general concept of ''[[orphan works]]''.

==Definition==
Definitions of "abandoned" vary, but in general it is like any item that is abandoned – it is ignored by the owner, and as such product support and possibly copyright enforcement are also "abandoned". It can refer to a product that is no longer available for legal purchase, over the age where the product creator feels an obligation to continue to support it, or where [[operating systems]] or [[Computer hardware|hardware]] platforms have evolved to such a degree that the creator feels continued support cannot be financially justified. In such cases, copyright and support issues are often ignored. Software might also be considered abandoned when it can be used only with [[Obsolescence|obsolete technologies]], such as [[Apple II series|pre-Macintosh]] Apple computers. A difference between ''abandonware'' and a ''discontinued product'' is that the manufacturer has not officially 'discontinued' the software, but only ended their official efforts at technical support.

Abandonware may be [[computer software]] or physical devices which are usually computerised in some fashion, such as [[personal computer games]], [[Office suite|productivity applications]], [[utility software]], or [[mobile phones]].

===Types===
The term "abandonware" is broad, and encompasses many types of old software.
;Commercial software unsupported but still owned by a viable company: The availability of the software depends on the company's attitude toward the software. In many cases, the company which owns the software rights may not be that which originated it, or may not recognize their ownership. Some companies, such as [[Borland]], make some software available online,&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt; in a form of [[freeware]]. Others do not make old versions available for [[Freeware|free use]] and do not permit people to copy the software. Many abandonware websites have been set up to archive and make available copies of unsupported and discontinued [[operating systems]] made by [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], as well as rare development builds of such operating systems that have been leaked by the media or technicians working for said companies &amp;mdash; the latter is popular among [[retrogaming]] and computing enthusiasts, who value the availability of these operating systems for the ease of access they provide. After [[Windows XP]] support was discontinued in April 2014, numerous websites started providing the operating system for free. The operating system's usage and popularity thus prevented it from being entirely abandoned.
;Commercial software owned by a company no longer in business: When no owning entity of a software exists, all activities (support, distribution, [[Intellectual property|IP]] activities etc.) in relationship to this software have ceased. If the rights to a software are non-recoverable in legal limbo ("orphaned work"), also the software's rights can not be bought by another company, there can not be copyright enforcement etc. An example of this is [[Digital Research]]'s original [[PL/I]] compiler for [[DOS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpm.z80.de/ The Unofficial CP/M Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184144/http://www.cpm.z80.de/ |date=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered for many years without owner (now probably owned by [[Novell]]).
;[[Shareware]] whose author still makes it available: Finding historical versions, however, can be difficult since most shareware archives remove past versions with the release of new versions. Authors may or may not make older releases available. Some websites collect and offer for download old versions of shareware, freeware, and (in some cases) commercial applications. In some cases these sites had to remove past versions of software, particularly if the company producing that software still maintains it, or if later software releases introduce [[digital rights management]], whereby old versions could be viewed as DRM circumvention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
;Unsupported or unmaintained shareware
;[[Open-source software|Open source]] and freeware programs that have been abandoned: In some cases, source code remains available, which can prove a historical artifact. One such case is [[PC-LISP]], still found online, which implements the [[Franz Lisp]] dialect. The DOS-based PC-LISP still runs well within emulators and on [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Implications==
If a software product reaches [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] and becomes abandonware, users are confronted with several potential problems: missing purchase availability (besides used software) and missing [[technical support]], e.g. compatibility fixes for newer hardware and operating systems. These problems are exacerbated if software is bound ("[[dongle]]") to physical media with a limited life-expectancy ([[floppy disc]]s, [[optical media]] etc.) and backups are impossible because of [[copy protection]] or copyright law. If a software is distributed only in a [[Digital distribution|digital]], [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-locked form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nothing-lasts-forever-confronting-the-problem-of-video-game-preservation |title=Nothing Lasts Forever: Confronting the Problem of Video Game Preservation |quote=''How game historians are working to ensure the future of archiving as the medium shifts to an all-digital format.'' |publisher=usgamer.net |first=Anthony John |last=Agnello |date=February 19, 2014 |accessdate=July 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151113/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nothing-lasts-forever-confronting-the-problem-of-video-game-preservation |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[SaaS]], the shutdown of the servers will lead to a public loss of the software. If the software product is without alternative, the missing replacement availability becomes a challenge for continued software usage.

Also, once a software product has become abandonware for a developer, even historically important software might get lost forever very easily, as numerous cases have shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6271/where_games_go_to_sleep_the_game_.php |title=Where Games Go To Sleep: The Game Preservation Crisis, Part 1 |first=John |last=Andersen |quote=''The existence of decaying technology, disorganization, and poor storage could in theory put a video game to sleep permanently -- never to be played again. Troubling admissions have surfaced over the years concerning video game preservation.

Certain game titles could not see a re-release due to various issues.

==Response to abandonware==

===Early abandonware websites===
As response to the missing availability of abandonware, people have distributed old software since shortly after the beginning of [[Personal computer|personal computing]], but the activity remained low-key until the advent of the [[Internet]]. While trading old games has taken many names and forms, the term "abandonware" was coined by Peter Ringering in late 1996.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"/&gt; Ringering found classic game websites similar to his own, contacted their webmasters, and formed the original ''Abandonware Ring'' in February 1997.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title =The Abandonware Ring FAQ | work = | publisher =The Official Abandonware Ring | year =2006 | url =http://www.abandonwarering.com/?Page=FAQ |accessdate=August 22, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328073919/http://www.abandonwarering.com/?Page=FAQ| archivedate= March 28, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This original [[webring]] was little more than a collection of sites linking to adventureclassicgaming.com. Another was a site indexing them all to provide a rudimentary search facility. In October 1997, the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] sent [[cease and desist]] letters to all sites within the Abandonware Ring, which led to most shutting down. An [[unintended consequence]] (called the [[Streisand effect]] in Internet [[wiktionary:parlance|parlance]]) was that it spurred others to create new abandonware sites and organizations that came to outnumber the original Ring members. Sites formed after the demise of the original Abandonware Ring include [[Abandonia]], Bunny Abandonware and [[Home of the Underdogs]]. In later years abandonware websites actively acquired and received permissions from developers and copyright holders (e.g. [[Jeff Minter]], [[Magnetic Fields (video game developer)|Magnetic Fields]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/games/permissions.php Permissions] on lemon64.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110814042804/http://www.c64gg.com/Mr_Chip_MF_DL.html Mr_Chip_MF_DL] on c64gg.com (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Gremlin Interactive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402114725/http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/ |archivedate=April 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for legal redistribution of abandoned works,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amigaforever.com/games/ Games] on [[Amiga Forever]] ''"The following is a list of the major sites which include thousands of downloadable Amiga games with permission of the copyright holders: Amiga Future, Amigaland, Ami Sector One, Back to the Roots, Borrowed Time, Dream17, Gremlin Graphics World, Games Coffer"''&lt;/ref&gt; an example is ''[[World of Spectrum]]'' who acquired the permission from many developers and successfully retracted a DMCA case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://slashdot.org/story/03/02/28/0747252/world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531080840/http://slashdot.org/story/03/02/28/0747252/world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa |date=May 31, 2012 }} on [[slashdot.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/07/games_anti_piracy_bot_fingers/ Games anti piracy bot fingers ZX Spectrum archive site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507033537/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/07/games_anti_piracy_bot_fingers/ |date=May 7, 2010 }} on [[theregister.com]] by John Lettice (7 Mar 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/#sofar ARCHIVE - COPYRIGHTS AND DISTRIBUTION PERMISSIONS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417235847/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/ |date=April 17, 2016 }} on worldofspectrum.org ''"Cases filed against World of Spectrum: IDSA / DMCA #922932 (14/2/2003 - result: case retracted)"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/publishers.html ARCHIVE - DISTRIBUTION PERMISSIONS - SOFTWARE HOUSES] on worldofspectrum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives===
Several websites archive abandonware for download, including old versions of applications which are difficult to find by any other means.

==Arguments for and against distribution==
Proponents of abandonware preservation argue that it is more ethical to make copies of such software than new software that still sells. Those ignorant of copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that abandonware is legal to distribute, although no software written since 1964 is old enough for copyright to have expired in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html |title=Copyright of Computer Programs | year=2002 | first=Lee |last=Hollaar |accessdate=August 7, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080711181121/http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html| archivedate= July 11, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually belong to someone else, though no one may be able to trace actual ownership, including the owners themselves.

Abandonware advocates also frequently cite historical preservation as a reason for trading abandoned software.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"/&gt; Older computer media are fragile and prone to rapid deterioration, necessitating transfer of these materials to more modern, stable media and generation of many copies to ensure the software will not simply disappear. Users of still-functional older computer systems argue for the need of abandonware because re-release of software by copyright holders will most likely target modern systems or incompatible media instead, preventing legal purchase of compatible software.

Those who oppose these practices argue that distribution denies the copyright holder potential sales, in the form of re-released titles, official emulation, and so on. Likewise, they argue that if people can acquire an old version of a program for free, they may be less likely to purchase a newer version if the old version meets their needs.

Some game developers showed sympathy for abandonware websites as they preserve their classical game titles.

==Law==
In most cases, software classed as abandonware is not in the [[public domain]], as it has never had its original copyright officially revoked and some company or individual may still own rights. While sharing of such software is usually considered copyright infringement, in practice copyright holders rarely enforce their abandonware copyrights for a number of reasons – chiefly among which the [[Digital obsolescence|software is technologically obsolete]] and therefore has no commercial value, therefore rendering copyright enforcement a pointless enterprise. By default, this may allow the product to de facto lapse into the public domain to such an extent that enforcement becomes impractical.

Rarely has any abandonware case gone to court, but it is still unlawful to distribute copies of old copyrighted software and games, with or without compensation, in any [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] signatory country.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/23/us-copyright-office-grants-abandonware-rights/ | title=US Copyright Office grants abandonware rights |first=Ross |last=Miller |accessdate = January 2, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128134926/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/23/us-copyright-office-grants-abandonware-rights/| archivedate= January 28, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement of copyright===
Old copyrights are usually left undefended. This can be due to intentional non-enforcement by owners due to software age or obsolescence, but sometimes results from a [[Corporation|corporate]] copyright holder going out of business without explicitly transferring ownership, leaving no one aware of the right to defend the copyright.

Even if the copyright is not defended, copying of such software is still unlawful in most jurisdictions when a copyright is still in effect. Abandonware changes hands on the assumption that the resources required to enforce copyrights outweigh benefits a copyright holder might realize from selling software licenses. Additionally, abandonware proponents argue that distributing software for which there is no one to defend the copyright is morally acceptable, even where unsupported by current law. Companies that have gone out of business without transferring their copyrights are an example of this; many hardware and software companies that developed older systems are long since out of business and precise documentation of the copyrights may not be readily available.

Often the availability of abandonware on the Internet is related to the willingness of copyright holders to defend their copyrights. For example, unencumbered games for [[Colecovision]] are markedly easier to find on the Internet than unencumbered games for [[Mattel]] [[Intellivision]] in large part because there is still a company that sells Intellivision games while no such company exists for the Colecovision.

===DMCA===
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) can be a problem for the preservation of old software as it prohibits required techniques. In October 2003, the US Congress passed 4 clauses to the DMCA which allow for reverse engineering software in case of preservation. {{quote|"3. Computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access. ...The register has concluded that to the extent that libraries and archives wish to make preservation copies of published software and videogames that were distributed in formats that are (either because the physical medium on which they were distributed is no longer in use or because the use of an obsolete operating system is required), such activity is a noninfringing use covered by section 108(c) of the Copyright Act."|Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/fedreg-notice-final.pdf Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928063920/http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/fedreg-notice-final.pdf |date=September 28, 2012 }} by LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Copyright Office 37 CFR Part 201 (Docket No. RM 2002-4E) (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 2006 the Library of Congress approved an exemption to the DMCA that permits the cracking of copy protection on software no longer being sold or supported by its copyright holder so that they can be archived and preserved without fear of retribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/index.html Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123031312/http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/index.html |date=November 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/abandonware-now-legal/1100-6162308/ |title=Abandonware now legal? - Changes in copyright rules let gamers break copy protection on old games--in some circumstances. |date=November 27, 2006 |first=Emma |last=Boyes |publisher=[[GameSpot]].com |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325120959/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/abandonware-now-legal/1100-6162308/ |archivedate=March 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US copyright law===
Currently, US copyright law does not recognize the term or concept of "abandonware" while the general concept "orphan works" is recognized (see [[Orphan works in the United States]]). There is a long-held concept of abandonment in [[trademark law]] as a direct result of the infinite term of trademark protection. Currently, a copyright can be released into the public domain if the owner clearly does so in writing; however this formal process is not considered abandoning, but rather releasing. Those who do not own a copyright cannot merely claim the copyright abandoned and start using protected works without permission of the copyright holder, who could then seek [[legal remedy]].

Hosting and distributing copyrighted software without permission is illegal. Copyright holders, sometimes through the [[Entertainment Software Association]], send [[cease and desist letter]]s, and some sites have shut down or removed infringing software as a result. However, most of the Association's efforts are devoted to new games, due to those titles possessing the greatest value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/01/49723?currentPage=1 | title = Abandonware: Dead Games Live On | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | last = King | first = Brad | date = January 19, 2002 | accessdate = April 2, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025232338/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/01/49723?currentPage=1 | archivedate = October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the original copyright holder may be barred from bringing a court action, via a civil doctrine known as [[laches (equity)|laches]], which requires litigants to bring a viable civil action within a reasonable amount of time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== EU law ===
In the EU in 2012 an "Orphan Works Directive" ([[Directive 2012/28/EU]]) was constituted and is transferred into the member's laws. While the terminology has ambiguities regarding software and especially video games, some scholars argue that abandonware software video games fall under the definition of ''audiovisual works'' mentioned there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |page=120 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035553/http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright expiration===
{{main|List of countries' copyright lengths}}
Once the copyright on a piece of software has expired, it automatically falls into [[public domain]]. Such software can be legally distributed without restrictions. However, due to the length of [[copyright terms]] in most countries, this has yet to happen for most software. All countries that observe the [[Berne Convention]] enforce copyright ownership for at least 50 years after publication or the author's death. However, individual countries may choose to enforce copyrights for longer periods. In the United States, copyright durations are determined based on authorship. For most published works, the duration is 70 years after the author's death. However, for anonymous works, works published under a pseudonym or works made for hire, the duration is 120 years after publication. In France, copyright durations are 70 years after the relevant date (date of author's death or publication) for either class.

However, because of the length of [[copyright enforcement]] in most countries, it is likely that by the time a piece of software defaults to public domain, it will have long become obsolete, irrelevant, or incompatible with any existing hardware. Additionally, due to the relatively short commercial, as well as physical, lifespans of most digital media, it is entirely possible that by the time the copyright expires for a piece of software, it will no longer exist in any form. However, since the largest risk in dealing with abandonware is that of distribution, this may be mitigated somewhat by private users (or organizations such as the Internet Archive) making private copies of such software, which would then be legally redistributable at the time of copyright expiry.

==Alternatives to software abandoning==
There are alternatives for companies with a software product which faces the end-of-life instead of abandoning the software in an unsupported state.

===Availability as freeware===
{{main|List of commercial video games released as freeware}}
Sometimes user-communities convince companies to voluntarily relinquish copyright on software, putting it into the public domain, or [[Software relicensing|re-license]] it as [[free software]] or as freeware. Transfer of public domain or freely licensed software is perfectly legal, distinguishing it from abandonware which still has full copyright restrictions.

[[Amstrad]] is an example which supports emulation and free distribution of [[Amstrad CPC|CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] hardware ROMs and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/comp.sys.amstrad.8bit/HtpBU2Bzv_U/HhNDSU3MksAJ |title=Amstrad ROM permissions |first=Cliff |last=Lawson |publisher=comp.sys.amstrad.8bit |quote=''1) What exactly do you have to do to use Sinclair ROMs in an emulator, such as acknowledgements etc?"

There are groups that lobby companies to release their software as freeware. These efforts have met with mixed results. One example is the library of educational titles released by [[MECC]]. MECC was sold to Brøderbund, which was sold to [[The Learning Company]]. When TLC was contacted about releasing classic MECC titles as freeware, the documentation proving that TLC held the rights to these titles could not be located, and therefore the rights for these titles are "in [[limbo]]" and may never be legally released.&lt;ref name="CanAbandonware"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savetz | first=Kevin | title =Can "Abandonware" Revive Forgotten Programs? | work = | publisher=byte.com |date=September 17, 2001 |url=http://www.savetz.com/articles/byte-abandonware.php?sort=date | accessdate = March 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191159/http://www.savetz.com/articles/byte-abandonware.php?sort=date | archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the copyright situation of vintage out-of-print software is lost or unclear is not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/lost-in-limbo-on-the-hunt-for-pc-gamings-abandoned-classics/ |quote=''The saga of No One Lives Forever's resurrection has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs.

Even though many of the games on this list were made by small, dedicated studios, they still relied on companies like EA to get to market. But as studios were swallowed or shut down, the rights of their beloved games often got lost in the shuffle.

===Support by source code release===
{{main|Source code escrow}}
{{see also|List of commercial video games with later released source code}} {{see also|List of commercial software with available source code}}
The problem of missing technical support for a software can be most effectively solved when the source code becomes available. Therefore, several companies decided to release the source code specifically to allow the user communities to provide further technical software support (bug fixes, compatibility adaptions etc.) themselves,&lt;ref name="homesource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=8516 |title=Homeworld Source Code Released |date=October 8, 2003 |first=Andy |last=Largent |publisher=insidemacgames.com |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |quote=''With the release of Homeworld 2 for the PC, Relic Entertainment has decided to give back to their impressive fan community by releasing the source code to the original Homeworld.'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012745/http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=8516 |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allegiancesource"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colayco |first=Bob |title=Microsoft pledges Allegiance to its fanbase |publisher=[[gamespot.com]] |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |date=February 6, 2004 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-pledges-allegiance-to-its-fanbase/1100-6087574/ |quote=''The release of the source code came in response to the enthusiasm of Allegiance's small-but-dedicated fanbase. Microsoft's Joel Dehlin commented that the development team has "been amazed at the level to which some of the Allegiance fans have remained hard-core.

With that in mind, we’re releasing the Allegiance source code to the community."'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210103542/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-pledges-allegiance-to-its-fanbase/1100-6087574/ |archivedate=December 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. by [[community patch]]es or [[source port]]s to new [[computing platforms]]. For instance, in December 2015 Microsoft released the [[Windows Live Writer]] [[source code]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-open-sources-live-writer-beloved-but-abandoned-blogging-tool/ Microsoft open-sources Live Writer, beloved but abandoned blogging tool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612020134/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-open-sources-live-writer-beloved-but-abandoned-blogging-tool/ |date=June 12, 2016 }} by Peter Bright on [[Ars Technica]] ''"Opening the app means that it'll get some much-needed maintenance."'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the community to continue the support.

[[Id Software]] and [[3D Realms]] are early proponents in this practice, releasing the source code for the [[game engine]]s of some older titles under a [[free software license]] (but not the actual game content, such as levels or textures). Also [[Falcon 4.0]]'s lead designer Kevin Klemmick argued in 2011 that availability of the source code of his software for the community was a good thing: {{quote

The [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] of drawing a possible lawsuit can discourage release of source code. Efforts to persuade [[IBM]] to release [[OS/2]] as [[open source software]] were ignored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/19298/_I_m_Glad_That_IBM_Declined_to_Release_the_OS_2_Source_ | title=I'm Glad That IBM Declined to Release the OS/2 Source |date= February 7, 2008 |first= Michael |last=Reed |publisher=OSNews LLC |accessdate= May 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221095812/http://www.osnews.com/story/19298/_I_m_Glad_That_IBM_Declined_to_Release_the_OS_2_Source_ |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since some of the code was co-developed by Microsoft.

Nevertheless, several notable examples of successfully opened commercial software exist, for instance, the web browser [[Netscape Communicator]], which was released by [[Netscape Communications]] on March 31, 1998.&lt;ref name="netscapeopensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401072854/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html |archivedate=April 1, 2007 |date=January 22, 1998 |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Netscape Communications Corporation]] |title=NETSCAPE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO MAKE NEXT-GENERATION COMMUNICATOR SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE FREE ON THE NET |quote=''BOLD MOVE TO HARNESS CREATIVE POWER OF THOUSANDS OF INTERNET DEVELOPERS; COMPANY MAKES NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR AND COMMUNICATOR 4.0 IMMEDIATELY FREE FOR ALL USERS, SEEDING MARKET FOR ENTERPRISE AND NETCENTER BUSINESSES ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was continued under the umbrella of the [[Mozilla Foundation]] and Netscape Communicator became the basis of several browsers, such as [[Mozilla Firefox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netscape-celebrates-first-anniversary-of-open-source-software-release-to-mozillaorg-73806207.html |title= MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Netscape Communications and open source developers are celebrating the first anniversary, March 31, 1999, of the release of Netscape's browser source code to mozilla.org |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |date=March 31, 1999 |quote=''[...]The organization that manages open source developers working on the next generation of Netscape's browser and communication software.

Another important example for open sourced general software is the office suite [[StarOffice]] which was released by [[Sun Microsystems]] in October 2000 as [[OpenOffice.org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2000101300221NWDTSW |title=StarOffice Code Released in Largest Open Source Project |date=October 13, 2000| first=Brian |last=Proffitt |quote=''Sun's joint effort with CollabNet kicked into high gear on the OpenOffice Web site at 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. PST this morning with the release of much of the source code for the upcoming 6.0 version of StarOffice.

There are also many examples in the video game domain: [[Revolution Software]] released their game ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'' as freeware and gave the engine's source code to the authors of [[ScummVM]] to add support for the game. Other examples are ''[[Myth II]]'',&lt;ref name="mythalive2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/06/10/mythdevelopers.html |title=Keeping the Myths Alive |first=Howard |last=Wen |date=June 10, 2004 |accessdate=December 22, 2012 |publisher=linuxdevcenter.com |quote=''[...]fans of the Myth trilogy have taken this idea a step further: they have official access to the source code for the Myth games.

'''''Aladdin''''' is a 1992 American [[animation|animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[fantasy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The film is the 31st [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], and was the fourth produced during the Disney film era known as the [[Disney Renaissance]]. It was produced and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], and is based on the Arabic [[Fairy tale|folktale]] [[Aladdin|of the same name]] from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and [[Les mille et une nuits|the French interpretation]] by [[Antoine Galland]]. The voice cast features [[Scott Weinger]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Linda Larkin]], [[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]], [[Frank Welker]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]] and [[Douglas Seale]]. The film follows Aladdin, an Arabian [[street children|street urchin]], who finds a magic lamp containing a [[Jinn|genie]]. In order to hide the lamp from the [[Grand vizier]], he disguises himself as a wealthy prince, and tries to impress the [[Sultan]] and his daughter.

Lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] first pitched the idea, and the screenplay went through three drafts before then-[[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] president [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] agreed to its production. The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]], and computers were used for [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|finishing the artwork]] and creating some animated elements. The musical score was written by [[Alan Menken]] and features six songs with lyrics written by Ashman and [[Tim Rice]], who took over after Ashman's death.

''Aladdin'' was released on November 25, 1992, to critical and commercial success, becoming the [[1992 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1992]] with an earn of over $504 million in worldwide box office revenue. Upon release, it became the first animated feature to reach the half–billion dollar mark, and was briefly the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Timeline of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film of all time]] until it was surpassed by ''[[The Lion King]]''. ''Aladdin'' garnered two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]s, as well as other accolades for its soundtrack which had the first and only number from a Disney feature to earn a [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] for the film's [[A Whole New World|theme song]] sung by [[Peabo Bryson]] and [[Regina Belle]]. The film's [[VHS]] release also set a sales record and grossed about $500{{nbsp}}million in the United States. {{nobreak|''Aladdin''{{'}}s}} success led to various derived works and other material inspired by the film, including two [[direct-to-video]] sequels, ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994) and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996); an animated television series of the [[Aladdin (animated TV series)|same name]]; and a [[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Broadway adaptation]]. A [[Aladdin (2019 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the film directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] will be released on May 24, 2019.

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
In the fictional city of Agrabah (which Disney places near the [[Jordan river]]), [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]], the [[Grand vizier]] of the [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#The Sultan|Sultan]], and his parrot [[Iago (Disney)|Iago]], seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders, but are told that only a "diamond in the rough" may enter. Jafar identifies a [[Street children|street urchin]] named [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]]. [[Princess Jasmine]], who refuses to marry a suitor, temporarily leaves the palace and meets Aladdin and his pet monkey, [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Abu|Abu]]. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and eventually fall in love. When the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders, Jasmine confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, only for Jafar to lie to her that Aladdin has been [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu from prison, and sends them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp. There, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp. Unaware to touch nothing but the lamp, Abu grabs a red jewel, and the cave collapses. Aladdin hands over the lamp to Jafar, who throws both Aladdin and Abu back down into the cave, though not before Abu manages to steal the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], who lives inside of it. The Genie tells Aladdin that he will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing themselves from the cave without using a wish, and he uses his first to become "Prince Ali Ababwa" in order to woo Jasmine.

At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. When Aladdin greets Jafar and the Sultan at the palace, Jasmine becomes angry at them. Refusing to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a flight on the magic carpet. When she deduces his identity, he convinces her that he dresses as a [[peasant]] to escape the stresses of royal life. After sending Jasmine home, Aladdin is tied up, gagged and thrown into the sea by Jafar, but he is rescued from drowning by the Genie with his second wish. Jafar tries to hypnotize the Sultan into agreeing to his marriage to Jasmine, but Aladdin intervenes, exposing his evil plot in the process; however, Jafar spots the lamp and thus discovers Aladdin's true identity. He flees to his lair, and orders Iago to retrieve the lamp from Aladdin.

Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin refuses to free the Genie in order to maintain his charade. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan, and become the world's most powerful sorcerer, exposing Aladdin's identity and exiling him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. However, they escape, and return to the palace, where Jafar tries to use his final wish to make Jasmine fall in love with him, but the Genie cannot grant the wish as it is beyond his power. Upon noticing Aladdin, Jasmine pretends the wish has been granted to distract Jafar, and Aladdin attempts to retrieve the lamp. Jafar notices Aladdin, traps Jasmine inside an [[hourglass]], and overpowers Aladdin and his friends with his magic. After Aladdin rescues Jasmine out of the hourglass, he tricks Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie; now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him.

With the palace and kingdom returned to normal, the Genie transports Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders, and advises Aladdin use his third wish to regain his royal title so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Realizing that he has to be himself, Aladdin decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.

*[[Robin Williams]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], a comedic [[jinn]]ī, with high power that can only be exercised when his master wishes it. Clements and Musker had written the role of the Genie for Robin Williams, and, when met with resistance, created a reel of a Williams [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] to animation of the Genie. The directors asked Eric Goldberg, Genie's supervising animator, to animate the character over one of Williams' old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, where Williams' stand-up about [[schizophrenia]] was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams "laugh his ass off" and convinced him to sign on for the role. Williams' appearance in ''Aladdin'' marks the beginning of a transition in animation to celebrity voice actors, rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/how-celebrities-took-over-cartoon-voice-acting/247481|title=How Celebrities Took Over Cartoon Voice Acting|author=Meslow, Scott|work=The Atlantic|date=October 28, 2011|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genie's supervising animator was [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]].

== Production ==

=== Script and development ===
In 1988, lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of [[Aladdin]]. Ashman had written a 40-page [[film treatment]] remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story, but envisioned as a campy 1930s-style musical with a [[Cab Calloway]]/[[Fats Waller]]-like Genie.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;{{cite news| title=What Would Walt Say? : The credits read Disney, but 'Aladdin' is a brand-new 'toon, an irreverent high-stakes gamble that veers sharply from tradition | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-08/entertainment/ca-4_1_walt-disney-studios | last=Rhodes | first=Joe | newspaper=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=November 8, 1992 | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with partner [[Alan Menken]], Ashman conceived several songs and added Aladdin's friends named Babkak, Omar, and Kasim to the story.&lt;ref name="Mouseunderglass"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koenig |first=David |title=Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation &amp; Theme Parks |location=[[Irvine, California]] |publisher=Bonadventure Press |pages=216–26 |isbn=978-0964060517 |year=1997}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 11, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; However, the studio was dismissive of Ashman's treatment and removed the project from development.

=== Design and animation ===

The animators designed each one based on a different geometrical shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people = John Musker, Ron Clements | title=Art Review |location= Aladdin: Platinum Edition (Disc 2) | medium = DVD | publisher = Walt Disney Home Video |date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A style guide, depicting above the characters, and below the geometrical shapes they follow. Notes on design, such as "High hip" for Jasmine and "Broad shoulders" for Jafar are scattered through the page. Atop the page is written "0514 – Aladdin Style"]]
One of the first issues that the animators faced during production of ''Aladdin'' was the depiction of Aladdin himself.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;Thomas, Bob: "Chapter 9: A New Tradition", pages 133–135. ''Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Director and producer [[John Musker]] explains: {{cquote|In early screenings, we played with him being a little bit younger, and he had a mother in the story. [...] In design he became more athletic-looking, more filled out, more of a young leading man, more of a teen-hunk version than before.&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;}}

He was initially going to be as young as thirteen, but that eventually changed to eighteen.&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; Aladdin was designed by a team led by supervising animator [[Glen Keane]], and was originally made to resemble actor [[Michael J. Fox]]. During production, it was decided that the design was too boyish and wasn't "appealing enough," so the character was redesigned to add elements derived from actor [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Calvin Klein]] models.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt;

The design for most characters was based on the work of caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]],&lt;ref name="diamond" /&gt; which production designer [[Richard Vander Wende]] also considered appropriate to the theme, due to similarities to the flowing and swooping lines found in [[Arabic calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disney's Aladdin The Making Of An Animated Film|last=Culhane|first=John|date=August 15, 1993|publisher=Disney Editions|isbn=978-1-56282-757-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jafar's design was not based on Hirschfeld's work because Jafar's supervising animator, [[Andreas Deja]], wanted the character to be contrasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N64/aladdin.64a.html|title=Aladdin animator used subtlety to design strong villain|date=November 20, 1992|publisher=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each character was animated alone, with the animators consulting each other to make scenes with interrelating characters. Since Aladdin's animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], and Jasmine's animator [[Mark Henn]] was in the Florida one at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]], they had to frequently phone, fax or send designs and discs to each other.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; The animators filmed monkeys at the [[San Francisco Zoo]] to study their movements for Abu's character.&lt;ref name=popup/&gt; Iago's supervising animator [[Will Finn]] tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.&lt;ref name=popup/&gt; Some aspects of the Sultan were inspired by the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]], to create a bumbling authority figure.&lt;ref name=popup/&gt; Andreas Deja, Jafar's supervising animator, tried to incorporate Jonathan Freeman's facial expressions and gesturing into the character.&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; Animator [[Randy Cartwright]] described working on the [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|Magic Carpet]] as challenging, since it is only a rectangular shape, who expresses himself through [[pantomime]] – "It's sort of like acting by [[origami]]".&lt;ref name=making/&gt; Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; After the [[character animation]] was done, the carpet's surface design was applied digitally.&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt;

For the scenery design, various architectural elements seen in 19th-century orientalist paintings and photographs of the [[Arab world]] were used for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emperor's Old Groove: Decolonizing Disney's Magic Kingdom|last=Ayres|first=Brenda|date=2003|publisher=P. Lang|year=|isbn=9780820463636|location=|pages=181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other inspirations for design were [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney's animated films]] from the [[Golden Age of American animation|1940s and 50s]] and the 1940 film ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''.&lt;ref name=making/&gt; The coloring was done with the computerized [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow.&lt;ref name=popup/&gt;&lt;ref name=diamond/&gt; [[Computer animation]] was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite video|location=''Aladdin'' Platinum Edition, Disc 2|title=Diamond in the Rough: The Making of Aladdin|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Video|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg suggested actors such as [[John Candy]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Eddie Murphy]], Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks in the shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' and ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]''. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]]: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines.&lt;ref name="diamond" /&gt; It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = James Lipton (host) |date = 2001 | title = Inside the Actors Studio: Robin Williams | medium = Documentary | publisher = Bravo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]], the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

The producers added many [[in-joke]]s and references to Disney's previous works in the film, such as a "cameo appearance" from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers.&lt;ref name="comm1"&gt;[[Ron Clements]], [[John Musker]], Amy Pell.''Aladdin'' [[audio commentary]] – ''The Filmmaker's''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], [[Sebastian (The Little Mermaid)|Sebastian]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', and [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]] make brief appearances,&lt;ref name="popup"&gt;{{cite video|title=Pop Up Fun Facts|location=''Aladdin'' Platinum Edition Disc 1|medium=DVD|date=2004|publisher=Walt Disney Home Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film—[[Goofy]] hat, Hawaiian shirt, and sandals—are a reference to [[The Magic of Disney Animation|a short film]] that Robin Williams did for the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] tour in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="comm1"/&gt;

=== Robin Williams' conflicts with the studio ===
In gratitude for his success with [[Touchstone Pictures]]' ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', Robin Williams voiced the Genie for [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]] scale pay ($75,000) instead of his asking fee of $8 million, on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing, and his (supporting) character not take more than 25% of space on advertising artwork, since Williams' film ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'' was scheduled for release one month after ''Aladdin''{{'}}s debut. For financial reasons, the studio went back on the deal on both counts, especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25% of the image, but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller. The [[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney Hyperion]] book ''Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film'' listed both of Williams' characters "The Peddler" and "The Genie" ahead of main characters, but was forced to refer to him only as "the actor signed to play the Genie".&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312562,00.html |title=Disney's Got A Brand-New Baghdad 1 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 4, 1992 |accessdate=March 16, 2007 |first=Steve |last=Daly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806042954/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C312562%2C00.html |archivedate=August 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312562_2,00.html |title=Disney's Got A Brand-New Baghdad 2 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 4, 1992 |accessdate=March 16, 2007 |first=Steve |last=Daly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025122146/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C312562_2%2C00.html |archivedate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312562_3,00.html |title=Disney's Got A Brand-New Baghdad 3 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 4, 1992 |accessdate=March 16, 2007 |first=Steve |last=Daly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025122132/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C312562_3%2C00.html |archivedate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney, while not using Williams's name in commercials as per the contract, used his voice for the Genie in the commercials and used the Genie character to sell toys and fast food tie-ins, without having to pay Williams additional money; Williams unhappily quipped at the time: "The only reason [[Mickey Mouse]] has three fingers is because he can't pick up a check." Disney attempted to assuage Williams by sending him a [[Pablo Picasso]] painting worth more than $1 million at the time, but this move failed to repair the damaged relationship, as the painting was a self-portrait of the artist as Vincent van Gogh which apparently really "clashed" with the Williams' wilder home decor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Aly|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/robin-williams-disney-feud-picasso-gift-2014-11|title=Robin Williams Once Got So Upset With Disney That The Company Sent Him A $1 Million Picasso Peace Offering|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams refused to sign on for ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' so it was [[Dan Castellaneta]] that voiced the Genie.

{{Quote box|width =33%|quote="The original story was sort of a winning the lottery kind of thing.

The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 94% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 69 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 8.1/10.

Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' performance as Genie,&lt;ref name="RTfresh" /&gt; with [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' declaring that children "needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7DC1138F932A25752C1A964958260|title=Disney Puts Its Magic Touch on 'Aladdin'|work=The New York Times|first=Janet|last=Maslin | authorlink = Janet Maslin | date=November 11, 1992|accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.

Some aspects of the film were widely criticized.

He criticized what he saw as the film's use of ethnic stereotypes, writing: "Most of the Arab characters have exaggerated facial characteristics – hooked noses, glowering brows, thick lips – but Aladdin and the princess look like white American teenagers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ebert, Roger | authorlink = Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/aladdin-1992| title=Aladdin review|date=November 25, 1992|accessdate=March 17, 2007 |work=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an insert in the ''Lady and the Tramp'' Diamond Edition release case, ''Aladdin'' was going to be released on [[Blu-Ray|Blu-ray Disc]] as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=8139|title=Disney Teases 2012 Blu-ray Slate|work=Blu-ray.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/2013/02/review-peter-pan-diamond-edition-blu-ray-soars-with-outstanding-nine-old-men-bonus-feature-gorgeous-digital-restoration/ |title=Review: "Peter Pan" Diamond Edition Blu-ray soars with outstanding "Nine Old Men" bonus feature, gorgeous digital restoration |quote=Celebrating its 60th anniversary, Disney has released the timeless classic animated film “Peter Pan” onto Blu-ray for the first time with an impressive trip to Neverland given “Diamond Edition” treatment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Peter-Pan-Blu-ray/55001/#Review |title=Peter Pan Blu-ray Review |quote=Pardon the nostalgic digression, but Walt Disney's fourteenth animated feature, now celebrating its 60th anniversary, has the look and whimsy of a much younger production.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013.

=== Controversies ===
One of the verses of the opening song "Arabian Nights" was altered following complaints from the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC). The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from ''"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face,"'' in the original release to ''"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense."'' The change first appeared on the 1993 video release.&lt;ref name="adc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283|title=Arab Stereotypes and American Educators|publisher=[[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]]|accessdate=March 16, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405005650/http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283| archivedate= April 5, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release, but the re-release uses the edited lyric. The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line. The subsequent line, "''It's barbaric, but hey, it's home,''" was left intact. The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adamjacobs.net/aladdin-gets-big-changes-broadway-debut/|title=Aladdin gets big changes for Broadway debut|first=Gregory|last=Miller|publisher=New York Post|date=2014-03-09|accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Aladdin'' in a list of the most controversial films in history, due to this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224,00.html |title=The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=March 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314000859/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C1202224%2C00.html |archivedate=March 14, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine. They criticized the characters' Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents, in contrast to the other characters in the film, which are dark-skinned, have foreign accents and grotesque facial features, and appear villainous or greedy.&lt;ref name="adc" /&gt;

Concerns were also raised to another scene. When Aladdin is attacked by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony, Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as ''"Good teenagers, take off your clothes,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/info/aladwsj.htm |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001072715/http://www.snopes.com/disney/info/aladwsj.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |title=Take Off Your Clothes! |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 25, 1995 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |publisher=[[Snopes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which they considered a [[subliminal message|subliminal reference]] to [[promiscuity]]. However, according to the commentary track on the 2004 DVD, while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger [[Ad libitum#Drama|ad-libbed]] during the scene, they claimed "we did not record that, we would not record that," and said the line was ''"Good tiger, take off and go..."'' and the word "tiger" is overlapped by Rajah's snarl.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Clements and John Musker, "Filmmaker's Commentary". ''Aladdin: Platinum Edition'' DVD, Disc 1, Bonus Features, Backstage Disney, Walt Disney Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the word tiger, a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack.  Because of the controversy, Disney removed the line on the DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/aladdin.asp|title=Disney (Take Off Your Clothes!)|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=March 24, 2007}}. The source compiles and cites four major newspaper references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between ''Aladdin'' and [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]' unfinished film ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'' (also known as ''Arabian Knight'' under [[Miramax Films]] and ''The Princess and the Cobbler'' under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdsnapshot.com/January07Review/ThiefAndCobbler.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141735/http://www.dvdsnapshot.com/January07Review/ThiefAndCobbler.html|archivedate=December 16, 2008 |title=The Thief and the Cobbler review|publisher=DVD snapshot|author=Savino, Cris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/26/movies/film-review-a-late-finisher-about-old-araby.html|title= A Late Finisher About Old Araby |work=The New York Times|date=August 26, 1995 | first=Caryn | last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Aladdin'' was released prior to ''The Thief and the Cobbler'', ''The Thief and the Cobbler'' initially began production much earlier in the 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://movies.tvguide.com/movie-news/Best-Animated-Movie-7953.aspx | title=The Best Animated Movie You've Never Heard Of|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=November 28, 2006|accessdate=March 17, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615171326/http://movies.tvguide.com/movie-news/Best-Animated-Movie-7953.aspx|archivedate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in ''The Thief and the Cobbler'' being labeled a rip-off of ''Aladdin''.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

== Live-action adaptations ==
=== Live-action prequel spin-off ===
On July 15, 2015, the studio announced the development of a live-action comedy adventure prequel called ''Genies''. The film was being written by [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon]], while [[Tripp Vinson]] was on board to produce via his Vinson Films banner. It was intended to serve as a lead to the live-action ''Aladdin'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aladdin-live-action-prequel-works-808895|title='Aladdin' Live-Action Prequel in the Works at Disney (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, Disney revealed it had originally planned to use Robin Williams' unused lines from the 1991–92 recording sessions for the film, but his will prohibited the studio from using his likeness for twenty-five years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robin Williams’ will prevents use of outtakes for ‘Aladdin’ sequel|last=Putnam|first=Lindsay|url=https://nypost.com/2015/11/08/robin-williams-will-prevents-use-of-outtakes-for-aladdin-sequel/|newspaper=[[The New York Post]]|date=November 8, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, it was reported that Disney was developing a [[Disney Live Action Remakes|live-action adaptation]] of ''Aladdin'' with [[Guy Ritchie]] signed on to direct the film.

The film was released on 31 October 2013 to positive reviews and became successful at the box-office.

==Plot==
The film starts with Ashok Kumar aka AK ([[Ajith Kumar]]) setting bombs in three places and informing the police about them. Before the police arrive, the bombs are set off. AK, along with his lady love Maya ([[Nayanthara]]), threatens her old college mate [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] Arjun ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]), Who is thus forced to hack one system after another. AK then threatens Sriram Raghavan ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) by trying to kill his child so he can extract the truth about black money. AK murders Sriram. Arjun, who is particularly irritated by the things happening around him, complains about AK's misdeeds to Inspector Prakash ([[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]]). When AK gets closer to achieving his goals, Arjun gives him away to the police, and both are arrested. Arjun is later released after his true identity is revealed.

Later, Maya, who had escaped from the scene, tracks Arjun and his girlfriend Anitha ([[Taapsee Pannu]]) and tells them AK's original motive. AK is revealed to be a former member of an [[Anti Terrorist Squad (India)|Anti-Terrorist Squad]] who is on a mission to expose a scam regarding faulty bulletproof jackets that are provided to security forces, which resulted in many bloody deaths including that of his best friend and colleague [[Assistant Commissioner of Police (India)|Assistant Commissioner]] Sanjay ([[Rana Daggubati]]). It turns out that Union Home Minister Mahadev Rane ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]) and his associates Milind Virekar ([[Atul Kulkarni]]) and Ramya Radhakrishnan ([[Suman Ranganathan]]) are the people involved in the scam. Ramya kills Sanjay's pregnant wife and her parents by poisoning, while Maya, who is also poisoned, and Mango ([[Five Star Krishna]]), who was placed on a railway track, survive the attack. Arjun, who hears the flashback,&lt;ref&gt;''Aarambam'' (DVD): clip from 1.11.41 to 1.48.24&lt;/ref&gt; decides to help them.

AK and Arjun arrive at Dubai to meet Deeksha ([[Akshara Gowda]]), Mahadev's daughter. Arjun enters a bank in the guise of a service engineer, opening an account so AK can transfer all of the minister's money into his account. Maya kills Ramya by pushing her off a building. Deeksha later finds out their plan but is later threatened at gunpoint by AK. AK, Arjun, and Maya later arrive in Mumbai but come to know that Mahadev has kidnapped Anitha. AK tactfully kidnaps Deeksha and Durrani ([[Murali Sharma]]) in Kashmir. Mahadev arrives at Kashmir with Anitha. Here, Durrani and Deeksha get killed in the mayhem, while Anitha is saved. AK kidnaps Mahadev, ties him to various bombs, and questions his corrupt activities. Prakash, who arrives there, calls AK to defuse the bombs. AK advises Prakash to think from the point of view of a common man, instead of a policeman, to think whether it is right on his part to save a corrupt person. Prakash later changes his mind and asks the other policemen to leave him. Mahadev is killed in the blast. Arjun and Anitha get married, while AK transfers all the illegal money of the minister to Reserve Bank without revealing his appearance. Arjun and Anitha later get kidnapped in Jordan during their honeymoon trip, only to know that AK has brought them for another mission.

===Development===
In September 2011, producer [[A. M.

''Arrambam'' opened to positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/518558/20131031/arrambam-review-roundup-ajith-aarambam-arya-arambam.htm |title='Arrambam' Review Roundup: Stylish Entertainer; Real Treat for Ajith Fans&amp;nbsp;— International Business Times |publisher=Ibtimes.co.in |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Behindwoods'' stated, "Director Vishnuvardhan, writer duo Subha and editor Sreekar Prasad have to be commended for managing to keep the audiences hooked to their seats for a majority of the movie with very few drag moments. With a running time of more than two and a half hours, the screenplay is taut and crisp enough to keep the crowd arrested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/arrambam/arrambam-review.html |title=Arrambam (aka) Aarambam review |publisher=Behindwoods |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sify]]'' said, "'Arrambam' lives up to the expectations and is a satisfying thrill ride for its variety in providing no-holds barred entertainment. Ajith' terrific screen presence and powerful dialogue delivery, smart writing, charismatic cast and action which is fast-paced are smartly packaged by director Vishnuvardhan." About the performances, the critic said, "Ajith himself gives a low-key, well-nuanced performance as Ashok, the conscience of this film; Arya is superb as the happy-go-lucky Arjun and his comedy scene in college with Nayan is a rocker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/arrambam-review-tamil-15042307.html |title=Movie Review : Arrambam|publisher=Sify |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indiaglitz'' commented, "Simple, elegant and class but richly crafted to keep you tuned to the screen&amp;nbsp;–  'Arrambam' is an interesting story in a gripping screenplay." Talking about the technical aspects, the website says, "Om Prakash has canned every frame with passion. Cohesion and continuity is edgy and distinctly better only as the film progresses. Srikar Prasad has however done a commendable job in putting the pieces of action together in thorough entertainment. Background score adds volume to the story, supporting it substantially well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/review/15849.html |title=Arrambam Tamil Movie Review|publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baradwaj Rangan]] of ''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote, "''Arrambam'' is a feet-hands-face movie&amp;nbsp;— the kind of hero-centric film made for fans. Vishnuvardhan manages a reasonable balance. Fans are likely to be delighted with a narrative that pumps up their hero’s strengths (coolness; good comebacks, including a terrific punch line about fingerprints) and downplays his failings (dramatics)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/mission-to-mass/article5313603.ece | title=Arrambam: Mission to "mass" | work=The Hindu| accessdate=5 November 2013 | author=Baradwaj Rangan}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Suganth of ''[[The Times of India]]'' rated it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, "''Arrambam'' is a very familiar tale of corruption, betrayal and revenge, served up with a dash of style. Vishnuvardhan has taken a leaf out of a real-life incident and with the help of his co-writers SuBa, has spun an action thriller that, for the most parts, keeps moving at a fast clip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M.

''Arrambam'' is not bad but the problem with it is that it lacks creative touch" and noted the film for its similarities to the film ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]''. But the reviewer praises Ajith Kumar's acting: "This is the third time in a row Ajith has played the anti-hero with elan. He is unarguably one of the more stylish actors in the industry and he has proved it time and again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/Arrambam-a-one-man-aspirational-film/2013/11/01/article1868438.ece | title='Arrambam', a one-man aspirational film | publisher=The New Indian Express | date=1 November 2013 | accessdate=5 November 2013 | last=Pudipeddi | first=Haricharan | agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'' wrote, "The film will not disappoint the average viewer despite not living up to the hype and hoopla".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131104/entertainment-movie-reviews/article/movie-review-%E2%80%98arrambam%E2%80%99 |title=Movie Review: ‘Arrambam’ |work=Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. Saraswathi of ''[[Rediff]]'' rated it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, "''Arrambam'' is a stylish and fast-paced action thriller set in the backdrop of the 26/11 Mumbai serial bomb blasts, that is unfortunately let down by its uninspired and mediocre storyline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-aarambam-is-a-delight-for-ajith-fans-south/20131101.htm |title=Review: Aarambam is a delight for Ajith fans|publisher=Rediff|date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bangalore Mirror]]'' wrote, "From the start to the end, Aarambam is an out-and-out Ajith film&amp;nbsp;— a perfect Diwali gift for Thala's fans across the world.

What’s missing is any real sensitivity to the material; Vishnuvardhan stages his set pieces with style, but the uneasy mixture of genre styles places ''Arrambam'' firmly in the file marked disposable entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://film.list.co.uk/article/56186-arrambam/ | title=Review: Aarambam | publisher=The List | date=6 November 2013 | accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrying himself at ease in the contradicting roles he plays in both the halves of the film, Ajith proves his worth once again as an excellent actor." and added, "Nayanthara who comes around as his ally has added the right amount spice wherever required. The actress seems to have distinctly matured from her 'Billa' days, though. The romance that Arya and Taapsee share is cute, bubbly and keeps the movie going forward on a lighthearted note. Though Rana Dagubatti and Kishore are cast on brief roles, their characters are pivotal and support the crux of the story strongly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/telugu/review/17842.html Aata Arambam Telugu Movie Review&amp;nbsp;].

'''Babtie, Shaw and Morton''' was a firm of [[civil engineering|civil engineer]]s based in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, and noted for its work on [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s and [[reservoir]]s. It took its name following the 1906 merger of Babtie &amp; Bonn (a partnership founded by John Babtie and Carl Bonn in 1897) and Shaw &amp; Morton (founded by William Shaw and Hugh Morton).&lt;ref&gt;''Babtie, Shaw &amp; Morton'', Dictionary of Scottish Architects, 2008, http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''John Taylor Babtie'', Dictionary of Scottish Architects, 2008, http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100564&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable design projects include the [[Backwater Reservoir]], [[Kielder Water]],&lt;ref&gt;North Tyne, Kielder Reservoir http://www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk/kdr.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding dock in [[Belfast]].

[[James Arthur Banks]] and [[William George Nicholson Geddes]] both became President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] while partners in the firm.

The Babtie Group acquired consulting engineers Harris &amp; Sutherland in 1997, then also Allott &amp; Lomax in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nce.co.uk/allott-and-lomax-deal-fills-gap-in-babtie-portfolio/818923.article&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3,500-strong Babtie Group was acquired by [[Jacobs Engineering Group]] in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobs buys Babtie consultancy for £90m'', Financial Times, 16 August 2004 - http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2d0cbf2e-f112-11d8-95b8-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1jTSLEMxI&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6475">'''Camuliana''', '''Camulia''' or '''Kamoulia''' was an ancient town or perhaps village in [[Cappadocia]], located northwest of Caesarea, today [[Kayseri]] in [[Turkey]].  It is mostly mentioned in connection with the '''Image of Camuliana''', an ''[[acheiropoieton]]'' or "icon not made by hands" of the face of [[Christ]], which was one of the earliest of this class of miraculously created icons to be recorded; this is also sometimes referred to simply as the "'''Camouliana'''".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 88; Mango, 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bishopric ==

The [[episcopal see]] of Camuliana is of relatively late origin, since it did not yet exist in the time of [[Basil the Great]] 329–379. However, four of its bishops are named in the acts of various councils: Basil in the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553); a George in the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680); another George in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787); and a third George in the [[Photius|Photian]] [[Council of Constantinople (879)]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 393-394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&amp;dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&amp;nbsp;440&lt;/ref&gt; A seal indicates that there was also a bishop named Michael in the 10th or 11th century.

No longer a residential bishopric, Camuliana is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 857&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image of Camuliana==
The image of Christ that appears in Camuliana is mentioned in the early 6th century by [[Zacharias Rhetor]], his account surviving in a fragmentary [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version, and is probably the earliest image to be said to be a miraculous imprint on cloth in the style of the [[Veil of Veronica]] (a much later legend) or [[Shroud of Turin]].  In the version recorded in Zacharias's chronicle, a pagan lady called Hypatia was undergoing Christian instruction, and asking her instructor "How can I worship him, when He is not visible, and I cannot see Him?". She later found in her garden a painted image of Christ floating on water.  When placed inside her head-dress for safekeeping it then created a second image onto the cloth, and then a third was painted.  Hypatia duly converted and founded a church for the version of the image that remained in Camuliana.  In the reign of [[Justinian I]] (527-565) the image is said to have been processed around cities in the region to protect them from barbarian attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Start of Book 12 of "Chronicle", pp. 425-427; Mango, 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;  This account differs from others but would be the earliest if it has not suffered from [[iconodule]] additions, as may be the case.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle, 425-427, various notes&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the images (if there was more than one) probably arrived in [[Constantinople]] in 574,&lt;ref&gt;The date is von Dobschütz's conclusion, and the subject of long discussion at Chronicle, 425, note, as some have disagreed.&lt;/ref&gt; and is assumed to be  the image of Christ used as a [[palladium (protective image)|palladium]] in subsequent decades, being paraded before the troops before battles by [[Philippicus (general)|Philippikos]], [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]] and [[Heraclius]], and in the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Siege of Constantinople in 626]], and praised as the cause of victory in poetry by [[George Pisida]], again very early mentions of this use of icons.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 111-112; Emerick, 356-357&lt;/ref&gt;  It was probably destroyed during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]],&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 88&lt;/ref&gt; after which mentions of an existing image cease (however  Heinrich Pfeiffer identifies it with the [[Veil of Veronica]] and [[Manoppello Image]] &lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Pfeiffer, ''The concept of “acheiropoietos”,the iconography of the face of Christ and the veil of Manoppello'',  Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Scientific approach to the Acheiropoietos Images,  ENEA Frascati, Italy, 4‐6 May 2010 [http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/PfeifferWeb.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;), and in later centuries its place was taken by the [[Image of Edessa]], which apparently arrived in Constantinople in 944, and icons of the [[Theotokos]] such as the [[Hodegetria]]. The Image of Edessa was very probably later, but had what apparently seemed to the Byzantines an even more impressive [[provenance]], as it was thought to have been an authentic non-miraculous portrait painted from the life during the lifetime of Jesus.

'''Victoria Carolina Coronado y Romero de Tejada''' (December 12, 1820 – January 15, 1911) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] author considered the equivalent of contemporary [[Romanticism|Romantic]] authors like [[Rosalía de Castro]]. She became so popular as to merit the title "the female [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer|Bécquer]]."

==Youth==
Victoria Carolina Coronado y Romero de Tejada was born on 12 December 1820 in [[Almendralejo]], [[Badajoz]] in the province of [[Extremadura]]. She was the daughter of Nicolás Coronado y Gallardo and María Antonia Romero de Tejada y Falcón. Her family was well-to-do, but they adhered to a progressive ideology that caused her father and grandfather to be persecuted. After moving to the [[province|provincial]] capital of Badajoz, Carolina received the formal education for girls of her time: fashion and housework. Despite this, she demonstrated at an early age an interest in [[literature]], and she began to read works from widely varying genres. Thanks to this activity she gained a natural ability to compose verses. Her earliest poems were written when she was 10 years old. Though she employed somewhat sloppy language and committed grammatical errors, her lines were spontaneous and charged with feeling. Many of her poems were based on impossible loves. Her most notable subject was Alberto - who may not even have existed.

Her romantic temperament could also have been influenced by the chronic [[catalepsy]] from which she suffered. She even appeared to "die" on several occasions, leading her to become obsessed with death. She would eventually [[embalming|embalm]] her deceased husband, refusing to bury him, and she even had several "premonitions" in which she predicted the deaths of her children.

==Life in Madrid==
After taking a vow of abstinence after the death of Alberto Tejada at sea (whether he was real or imaginary), she revoked the vow when she married sir Horacio Justo Perry in [[Madrid]] in 1852. Perry was the secretary of the [[United States|American]] [[embassy]].

Coronado had a revolutionary spirit, and she became famous while living in Madrid for the literary salons she held. Her gatherings served as a meeting-point for progressive writers and a refuge for the persecuted, including many of the most well-known authors of the time. Unfortunately for her, her clandestine refuge and affinity for revolution brought about the disapproval of her contemporaries.

Despite this, she succeeded in publishing several works in newspapers and magazines and thus gained a certain measure of fame. Her physical beauty undoubtedly contributed to her success, and it caused infamous admiration in other romantic writers. In fact, [[José de Espronceda]] dedicated the following verses to her:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|es|Dicen que tienes trece primaveras
y eres portento de hermosura ya,
y que en tus grandes ojos reverberas
la lumbre de los astros inmortal.}}
|
They say that you have thirteen springs
and you are a vision of beauty
and that in your great eyes reverberates
the glow of the immortal stars.}}

Coronado died in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on 15 January 1911.

[[File:Monument à Carolina Coronado (Almendralejo).JPG|thumb|Monument to Coronado in [[Almendralejo]]]]

==Work==

The main body of Coronado's work was [[lyric poetry]]. Her poems adopted diverse themes, including patriotic sentiment in ''¡Oh, mi España!''; religion in ''El amor de los amores'' and ''¿Cómo, Señor, no he de tenerte miedo?''; and especially [[Romanticism]] in poems such as ''A una gota de rocío'', '' A la rosa blanca'', ''Nada resta de tí'', ''¡Oh! cuál te adoro'', ''A una estrella'', and ''A las nubes''. Her prolific works were compiled in a single volume entitled ''Poesías'', published in 1843 and re-edited in 1852, that includes a prologue by [[Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch]].

In prose, she wrote a total of fifteen novels including ''Luz'', ''El bonete de San Ramón'', ''La Siega'', ''Jarrilla'', ''La rueda de la desgracia'' (1873), and ''Paquita'' (1850). Many critics consider the last to be the best. She also authored several plays like ''El cuadro de la esperanza'' (1846), ''Alfonso IV de León'', ''Un alcalde de monterilla'', and ''El divino Figueroa'', but these endeavors are considered minor in comparison to her non-theatrical works.

'''''Charing Cross Bridge''''' is a series of [[oil painting]]s by [[France|French]] artist [[Claude Monet]]. Painted in between 1899 and 1904, they depict a misty, [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] [[Charing Cross Bridge]] in London.

==Historical information==
During the years between 1899 and 1905, Monet travelled to London to capture its sights from the fifth-floor balcony of the [[Savoy Hotel]]. Monet was captivated by the [[pea soup fog|London fog]], a notable atmospheric effect made markedly worse by the heavy pollution of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He painted the [[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|Houses of Parliament]], [[Waterloo Bridge]], and Charing Cross Bridge over and over, as he had earlier done with [[Haystacks (Monet)|haystacks]] and [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]], dashing off paintings to capture fleeting atmospheric effects. He was extremely prolific, beginning nearly 100 paintings in London.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven of the canvases were of Charing Cross Bridge, only twelve of which he finished in London; the rest he took back to his [[Giverny]] studio for completion.&lt;ref name=thyssen/&gt;

==Locations==
The ''Charing Cross Bridge'' paintings are scattered in collections all around the world. The unfinished canvas held by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] was once derided by [[Terry Teachout]] in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as second-rate, proof that "even a master can have his off days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMA has "second-rate art"?|url=http://eyeonindianapolis.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html|publisher=Eye on Indianapolis|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions are at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charing Cross Bridge, London, 1901|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/16544|publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charing Cross Bridge|url=http://www.artbma.org/annualreport/2009/leadership/monet.html|publisher=[[Baltimore Museum of Art]]|accessdate=29 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107200220/http://www.artbma.org/annualreport/2009/leadership/monet.html|archivedate=7 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charing Cross Bridge (overcast day), 1900|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/charing-cross-bridge-overcast-day-1900-34284|publisher=[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Harvard Museum of Fine Art, the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Monet, Charing Cross Bridge, Fog|url=http://www.ago.net/claude-monet-charing-cross-bridge-fog|publisher=[[Art Gallery of Ontario]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]&lt;ref name=thyssen&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Monet Charing Cross Bridge 1899|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/677|publisher=[[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Madrid]].

'''Cyriac K. Pullapilly''' is a [[Royal Society of Arts|Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts]], a former priest of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and an emeritus professor of history at [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College, Indiana]].

==Biography==
Cyriac Pullapilly was born in [[South India]]. He was ordained in 1948, and completed his undergraduate studies at the St. Joseph Apostolic seminary, which at its time, was the second-largest seminary in the world. While attending the seminary, he wrote for a missionary publication called ''Home Field''. He also was part of the anti-communist movement in his college and wrote various publications critical of the communist government which controlled the legislature in his state.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Priest from India views East, West|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/54969033/|accessdate=2016-10-05|agency=Suburbanite Economist|date=August 3, 1960|page=15 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he founded the Semester Around the World Program, where [[University of Notre Dame]] and Saint Mary's College, Indiana, students travelled the world and studied in India.

He has a multi-disciplinary approach to his studies and has published works on a broad range of subjects. His research has been supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and in 2006 – the year in which he was admitted to the Royal Society of Arts – he held a visiting academic post at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has also established his own publishing company and produced an "inclusive-language" edition of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Queen to honor educator: Royal Society of Arts to induct SMC prof |first=Kim |last=Abeel |date=October 9, 2006 |publisher=The Observer |location=Notre Dame, IN |url=http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/2.2754/queen-to-honor-educator-1.264092#.UT5LZvnbBBl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=xxxv |title=Asia in the Making of Europe: East Asia |first1=Donald Frederick |last1=Lach |first2=Edwin J. |last2=Van Kley |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-22646-765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon his founding of the Semester Around the World program, Pullapilly received the Spes Unica Award from Saint Mary's College for his outstanding service to the College in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.saintmarys.edu/files/courier/issues/courier-07summer.pdf | title=Awards |  journal=Courier | publisher=St. Mary's College | volume=82 | number=2 | date=Summer 2007 | page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pullapilly studied at St Thomas College in India and then at the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his PhD. He and his wife are both Indian immigrants to the United States, raising their children in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. Pullapilly is the father of filmmaker [[Gita Pullapilly]].&lt;ref name="NYT2009"/&gt;

An only child, Pullapilly's parents were initially reluctant to let him become a priest. Around 1960, he expressed interest in missionary work but said that he did not have the time.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"/&gt;

The '''Doña María de Aragón Altarpiece''' was an altarpiece painted between 1596 and 1599 by [[El Greco]] for the chapel of the [[Palacio del Senado (Spain)|Colegio de la Encarnación de Madrid]] (also known as the Colegio de doña María de Aragón). There has been much speculation over which paintings belonged to the work - there is now consensus that it consisted of six large canvases and a seventh, now lost. Five of those six canvases are now in the [[Prado]] and the sixth is in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] in Bucharest.

==History==
&lt;!---
En [[1596]] el Greco, se comprometió a realizar el retablo de la iglesia del colegio, un seminario de la [[Orden de San Agustín|orden agustina]]. El nombre popular alude a [[María de Aragón]], la mecenas que pagó las obras. El Greco recibió el encargo del [[Consejo de Castilla]], que se había hecho cargo de las obras después de la muerte de doña María. Existen documentos que atestiguan que debía realizarse en tres años y se valoró el trabajo en algo más de sesenta y tres mil [[Real español|reales]], el precio más alto que consiguió en su vida. Sin embargo no hay referencias del número de cuadros que lo formaban, ni de la estructura del retablo, ni de la temática tratada. [[Ceán Bermúdez]], dos siglos después, dijo que las pinturas trataban el [[ciclo de la vida de Cristo]].&lt;ref name=ruiz1&gt; Ruiz Gómez, op. cit., p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

El colegio se cerró en [[1808]] o [[1809]], pues según dos decretos de [[José Bonaparte]] en esas fechas se redujeron los conventos existentes y posteriormente se eliminaron las órdenes religiosas. El edificio se transformó en [[salón de Cortes]] en 1814 y entre 1820 y 1823; periodo en el que el retablo permaneció desmontado. Aunque desde 1823 el local recuperó su función de iglesia, únicamente se debió montar el lienzo central de la Anunciación. En 1835 volvió a utilizarse como sede de una institución política: el [[Estamento de Próceres]], posteriormente denominado Senado. Con diferentes vicisitudes, esa función se ha mantenido hasta la actualidad.&lt;ref name=ruiz1 /&gt;

El conjunto de pinturas debió ser trasladado en [[1813]] al convento agustino de [[San Felipe el Real]] y a la Casa de la [[Inquisición española|Inquisición]]. Posteriormente a la [[Real Academia de San Fernando]], y de allí al [[Museo de la Trinidad]], creado con obras de arte requisadas en virtud de la Ley de [[Desamortización (España)|Desamortización]]. Dicho museo se fusionó con el Museo del Prado en [[1872]] y de esta forma cinco de los lienzos del retablo terminaron en esta institución. Durante estos traslados se perdería la [[mazonería]]&lt;ref&gt;''Obra de relieve'' {{cita DRAE|mazonería}}&lt;/ref&gt; del retablo; mientras que el sexto lienzo, ''la Adoración de los pastores'', fue vendido y, después de varios cambios de propiedad, terminó en la colección real rumana en [[1888]], de donde pasó en 1948 al [[Museo Nacional de Arte de Rumanía]] de [[Bucarest]].&lt;ref name=ruiz1 /&gt;
---&gt;

== Composition ==
&lt;!---
La ausencia de documentos sobre el encargo que describan los cuadros han originado distintas hipótesis sobre el número de cuadros y los temas en ellos tratados. En [[1908]] [[Manuel Bartolomé Cossío|Cossío]] señaló la relación entre ''el Bautismo'', ''la Crucifixión'', [[La resurrección de Cristo (El Greco)|''la Resurrección'']] y ''[[la Anunciación]]''. [[August L. Mayer]] propuso en 1931 la relación entre los lienzos anteriores con ''el Pentecostés'' del Museo del Prado y ''la Adoración de los pastores'' de Bucarest. En [[1943]], Manuel Gómez Moreno conjeturó un retablo reticular formado por estos seis cuadros sin argumentarlo. Esta hipótesis no se ha tenido en cuenta hasta cuarenta años después pues para algunos especialistas ''la Resurrección'' y ''el Pentecostés'' corresponden a formulaciones estilísticas diferentes. Hasta [[1985]] la crítica especializada ha realizado distintas formulaciones al respecto, en general rechazando los dos últimos cuadros como pertenecientes al retablo.&lt;ref name=ruiz2&gt; Ruiz Gómez, op. cit., p.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

En 1985 se conoció una relación anónima fechada en [[1814]] en la que se registraban las obras depositadas en la casa de la Inquisición. En este listado se aludía al retablo mayor del colegio de doña María depositado en la sala carbonera y se hablaba de ''siete quadros de pinturas originales de Domenico Greco que estaban en el Altar Mayor''. Esta información ha afianzado la hipótesis de Gómez Moreno de un retablo de tres calles en dos pisos. Como en la relación se habla de siete cuadros se ha supuesto que el séptimo se trataría de un cuadro pequeño dispuesto en un tercer piso a modo de ático.&lt;ref name=ruiz2 /&gt;

La estructura de este retablo estaría compuesta en el piso inferior por ''la Anunciación'' en el centro con ''el Bautismo'' y ''la Adoración de los pastores de Bucarest'' a cada lado. Mientrás que en el piso superior en el centro se dispondría ''la Crucifixión'' y a sus lados ''la Resurrección'' y ''el Pentecostés''. Según José Milicua esta organización tiene coherencia histórico-teológica subrayando el sentido redentorista del retablo, pues ''la Crucifixión'' (piso superior) sería el momento culminante de la redención iniciada en ''la encarnación de María'' (piso inferior). ''La Adoración'' y ''la Resurrección'' serían la aparición y despedida del Salvador entre los hombres, mientras que ''el Bautismo'' y ''Pentecostés'' ilustrarían el descenso del [[Espíritu Santo]] sobre Cristo y sobre la comunidad apostólica.&lt;ref name=ruiz2 /&gt;

&lt;!---
Los temas, salvo el de Pentecostés, habían sido desarrollados ya en otras ocasiones, algunos desde su etapa italiana. Según Ruiz Gómez estos temas son retomados con gran originalidad mostrando su espiritualidad más expresionista. A partir de este momento su obra toma un camino muy personal y desconcertante distanciándose del estilo naturalista que comenzaba a dominar en aquella época. Las escenas están planteadas en espacios claustrofóbicos potenciando la verticalidad de los formatos. Una luz espectral destaca la irrealidad de las figuras, algunas en escorzos muy marcados. El color frío, intenso y contrastado aplicado con soltura a sus poderosas construcciones anatómicas muestra su estilo tardío característico.&lt;ref name=ruiz3&gt; Ruiz Gómez, op. cit., p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragon beam''' is a horizontal, diagonal [[Beam (structure)|beam]] in the corner(s) of some traditional [[Timber framing|timber framed]] buildings. The term is commonly used in both [[hip roof]] framing and [[jettying]]. Older publications may use the synonyms dragging beam, dragging piece, dragging tie, dragon piece or dragon tie. Inconsistencies in modern usage are discussed below. In French it is called a coyer or enrayure.

==Etymology==
The etymology of dragon is unclear. The term may be descended from German [[:de:Träger|träger]] (a carrier), Danish [[:da:Gitterbro|dragere]] (bearing beam, joist, girder) or Dutch [[:nl:Bint (bouwkunde)|draagbalk]] (beam). The origin has also been proposed as a corruption of diagonal or diagon.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Lewis, "Puncheons and Dragons:Renaissance carpentry and semantics" http://www.mileslewis.net/lectures/04-history-of-building/puncheons-and-dragons.pdf accessed 3/22/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip roofs==
The dragon beam lies parallel to and below a hip rafter and carries the rafter. The dragon beam is carried by the wall on the outer end and by a horizontal piece between the two walls on the inside end. There are conflicting usages for this term in the U.K. and U.S.A. (see below). The most common usage seems to be combination dragon beam/cross tie.

'''Dóra Keresztes''' (born October 3, 1953, [[Budapest]]) 
[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[Painting|painter]], printmaker, [[illustrator]], [[graphic designer]] and [[animated film director]].

==Biography==

She graduated from the [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design|Hungarian University of Arts And Design]]) in Budapest as pupil of [[István Balogh (director)|István Balogh]], [[György Haiman]], [[János Kass]] and [[Ernő Rubik]].  She started her career with book designs and illustrations mainly for children and contemporary [[Hungarian literature]]. Later on the film and theater posters came to the center of her interest and she was art director and designer of the „Muses” Cultural Magazine in Budapest. Beside her design activity she is an independent fine artist, stage designer and director of animated films. Her works have been shown in exhibitions, biennials and film festivals both in Hungary and abroad. Vice president of the Society of Hungarian Illustrators, film director in [[PannóniaFilm]] Studio, co-founder of [[Hungarian Poster Society]]. She works as a freelance designer in her own design studio.

==Her art==

Determining the coordinates of the creation of Dora Keresztes is especially helped by the artistic and thematic and technical constants of her works.  There is a number of them and since the fundamental ones migrate between the individual fields of activity parallelly attended to by Keresztes, they mutually transform and the generic plasticity and imagination of these fields. 
The origin of her linocuts were probably the woodcuts of the middle age, the world of "[[Biblia Pauperum]]" ("Paupers' Bible") which became so popular by the designers and fine artists of expressionist movement in the beginning of the 20th century too. Also her works were deeply influenced by the simplicity of East European [[folk art]]. She made study in Hungarian and Rumenian ([[Transilvania]]n) villages observing the decoration of small old churches. She does preach that traditional forms and handmade constructions could exist further and they can be part of the contemporary art and modern design as well. She likes to travel between the past and the present and in her pictures the world keeps her totality as it was in the time of the ancient mythologies and as it is in the tales and fables. We can observe her attraction towards the grotesque and [[surrealism]] too. Especially in her colorful animated films we can feel the presence of the dreams, subconscious and imagination. In some of her design works – especially in the case of posters and logos appears the influence of the emblematic power of [[folk art]] what is mixed with the more rigorous geometrical approach. She likes using the different forms of [[symmetry]] too and she plays very often with the rhythm of positive and negative forms. 
The world of Dora Keresztes is rather unusual in the digital field of the contemporary design life, but she says that the fundament of the future is in the past. She knows the responsibility of the designer for the local cultures, and she does work to keep them, she works for a healthy coexistence.

The '''Flood Ladies''' were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic [[1966 flood of the Arno]] as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

==History==
Following the devastating flooding that damaged and destroyed cultural treasures of Florence, Italy in 1966, while those losses can never be replaced, the generosity of some of Italy’s most significant women artists of the 20th century as well as distinguished painters and sculptors from around the world brought donations of hundreds of notable creative works to the city.

In 2014 the City of Florence opened the "Museum of the 1900s" to showcase these works.

The story of the Flood Ladies was chronicled in the 2014 book "When the World Answered. Florence, Women Artists and the 1966 Flood" and the 2015 PBS documentary of the same name.

"'''Frau Holle'''" (also known as "'''Mother Holle'''" or "'''Mother Hulda'''" or "'''Old Mother Frost'''") is a [[German language|German]] [[fairy tale]] that comes from the book ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen'' (''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'')  collected by [[The Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]].&lt;ref name=surlalune&gt;{{cite web|title=Frau Holle (Mother Holle) (A German Tale)|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/stories/holle.html|website=SurLaLuneFairyTales.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Frau Holle" is the 24th story in the first volume of the book published in 1812 as part of ''Children's and Household Tales''.

==Background==
[[File:Vrouwholle.jpg|thumb|260px|Frau Holle in the [[Efteling]]]]
The legend itself, as it was eventually passed to the Grimm Brothers, originates from oral traditions in [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] in what is now known as [[Hesse]]. It was told to them by Henriette Dorothea Wild (whom Wilhelm Grimm married in 1825) with more details, which were added in the second edition (1819). It is still a common expression in Hesse and beyond to say "Hulda is making her bed" when it is snowing, that is, she shakes her bed and out comes snow from heaven.

In the second edition of the book in 1819 they added some details, most prominently the rooster's greetings, provided by a correspondent: Georg August Friedrich Goldmann from [[Hanover]].&lt;ref name=Bio.&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Grimm|url=http://www.biography.com/people/wilhelm-grimm-21085173#grimms-fairy-tales|website=Bio.|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other tales collected by the brothers Grimm the story of Frau Holle was told to teach a moral. In this case, it is that hard work is rewarded and laziness is punished.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Frau Holle - Mauro Breda.jpg|420px|thumb|upright|Frau Holle]]
A rich [[widow]] lives with her daughter and her stepdaughter. The widow favored her younger biological daughter allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and [[Weaving (mythology)|spin]] beside the well.

One day she pricked her finger on the point of the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. Leaning over the well to wash the blood away, the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight. The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle, and in a panic she leapt into the well after it.

The girl found herself in a meadow where she came upon an oven full of bread. The bread asked to be taken out before it burned. With a baker's [[Peel (tool)|peel]] she took all the loaves out and then walked on. Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested. So she did so and gathered them into a pile, before continuing on her way. Finally she came to a small house of an old woman, who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework.

The woman identified herself as Frau Holle, and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed, as that would make it snow in the girl's world. The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle, and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.

After a time, the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home. Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl's kindness and hard work so much that when she escorted the girl to the gate, a shower of [[gold]] fell upon the girl. She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well. With that the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back, not far from her mother's house. 

Her mother wished the same good fortune for her biological daughter. She also set her to sit by the well and spin, but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself. She too came to the oven, but would not assist the bread; nor would she help the apple tree. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she likewise took service there, but before long fell into her lazy, careless ways. Frau Holle soon dismissed her. As the lazy girl stood at the gate, a kettle of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] spilled over her. "That is what you have earned," said Frau Holle, and closed the gate.

Other versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips everytime she speaks.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; That is why, in [[Hessen]] whenever it snows they say that Frau Holle is making her bed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm024.html ''Frau Holle'', translated by D.L. Ashliman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Marija Gimbutas]] names Hulda (or [[Holda]], Holla, Holle) as having originally been an ancient Germanic supreme goddess who predates most of the Germanic pantheon, including deities such as [[Odin]], [[Thor]], [[Freya]], and [[Loki]], continuing traditions of [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European]] [[Neolithic Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gimbutas, Marija, ''The Living Goddesses'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Christianity slowly replaced Scandinavian paganism during the [[Early Middle Ages]], many of the old customs were gradually lost or assimilated into Christian tradition. By the end of the [[High Middle Ages]], Scandinavian paganism was almost completely marginalized and blended into rural [[folklore]], in which the character of Frau Hulda eventually survived.

In Germanic Pre-Christian folklore, Hulda, [[Holda]], Holle and Holla were all names to denote a single being. According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Timm, Erika. 2003. Frau Holle, Frau Percht und verwandte Gestalten: 160 Jahre nach Grimm aus germanistischer Sicht betrachtet.&lt;/ref&gt; Hulda is also related to the Germanic figure of [[Perchta]]. She dwells at the bottom of a well, rides a wagon, and  first taught the craft of making linen from flax. Holle is the goddess to whom children who died as infants go, and alternatively known as both the Dunkle Großmutter (Dark Grandmother) and the ''Weisse Frau'' (White Lady), elements which are more typically associated with the Grimms' fairy tale as well. Her connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and [[Weaving (mythology)|weaving]] has associated her with [[witchcraft]] in Catholic German folklore.

Frau Holle is one of Germany's most durable female legendary figures and represents a pre-Christian deity who survived in popular belief and in the memory of common people well into the nineteenth century.

==Perchta==
{{Main|Perchta}}

The Grimms say Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Jacob (1882). Deutsche Mythologie 4th ed. [1875]. Trans. James Stallybrass Grimm's Teutonic Mythology Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed female spirit. She was known as a goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like myths of Holda in Continental German regions. He believes she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and she was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]].

According to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Timm, Erika. 2003. Frau Holle, Frau Percht und verwandte Gestalten: 160 Jahre nach Grimm aus germanistischer Sicht betrachtet.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Like many of the other tales collected by the Grimm brothers, "Frau Holle" personifies good behavior and bad, and the appropriate reward meted out for each.  Even so, it also exhibits a number of contrasts with other stories.  Typically, the magical beings who appear in the tales must enter the real world and appear to the protagonists before any intercession can take place.  Moreover, these beings are almost always anonymous and therefore difficult to correlate with figures in pre-Christian mythology.  By contrast, Frau Holle resides somewhere above the earth, and the protagonists must go to her, paradoxically by diving into a spring.  When she makes her bed, loose feathers are 'stirred up' and fall to earth as snow, and so this fairy tale is an origin myth as well.  Comparison between Frau Holle and a weather or earth goddess is inevitable.  Jakob Grimm&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Ludwig Karl Grimm, transl J.S. Stallybrass.''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]''. George Bell, London 1882, pp 263f.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Thunar ([[Thor]]) makes rain in a similar fashion, implying for Frau Holle a very high rank in the pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm (1882) p268&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though not unique in this respect, the Frau Holle story is also notable for the absence of class-related motifs such as palaces,  balls to which one may or may not be invited, and the rise to the status of the [[nobility]] through marriage.

According to the [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne and Thompson classification system of fairy tales]], ''Mother Hulda'' is a story of type 480, ''The Kind and the Unkind Girls''.  Others of this type include ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'', ''[[Diamonds and Toads]]'', ''[[The Three Heads in the Well]]'', ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', ''[[The Three Little Men in the Wood]]'', ''[[The Enchanted Wreath]]'', ''[[The Old Witch]]'', and ''[[The Two Caskets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/other.html "Tales Similar to Diamonds and Toads"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary variants include ''[[The Three Fairies]]'' and ''[[Aurore and Aimée]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 543, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gradation''' in art is a visual technique of gradually transitioning from one colour hue to another, or from one shade to another, or one texture to another.  Space, distance, atmosphere, volume, and curved or rounded forms are some of the visual effects created with gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gradation.svg|thumb|A gradient illustration, showing a gradation spectrum from black to white.]]
Artists use a variety of methods to create gradation, depending upon the art medium, and the precise desired effect. [[Blending (art)|Blending]], [[shading (art)|shading]], [[hatching]] and [[crosshatching]] are common methods.  A fading effect can be created with [[pastels]] by using a [[torchon (art)|torchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gradation in photography==
Gradation can also be useful in composing photographs. The early decades of the development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: {{blockquote|The great defect of all the processes of photolithography described in the last section is that they can only be applied with advantage to the reproduction of drawings or subjects in which the gradation of shade is shown by lines or dots separated by white spaces of varying sizes and at varying intervals apart, as in line or stipple engravings and lithographs in line and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The British Journal of Photography|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1878|volume=XXV|pages=518|author=J. Waterhouse, Capt.|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[File:Halftone example CMYK.png|thumb|Example of a halftone reproduction of a photograph.]]
A major innovation was the development of [[halftone]] photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a [[Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT)]], with a [[halftone screen]] as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the halftone screen serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.

Analog photography is limited by the materials and equipment used by the photographer to capture gradation. These constraints are eliminated in digital photography, where software can be used to manipulate photograph images to create gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Lambrecht |author2=Ralph W. Lambrecht |author3=Chris Woodhouse |title=Way Beyond Monochrome 2e: Advanced Techniques for Traditional Black &amp; White ...|year=2010|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=978-0-240-81625-8|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grassmann's laws''' describe empirical results about how the perception of mixtures of colored lights (i.e., lights that co-stimulate the same area on the retina) composed of different [[spectral power distribution]]s can be algebraically related to one another in a color matching context. Discovered by [[Hermann Grassmann]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grassmann|first1=H.|title=Zur Theorie der Farbenmischung|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|date=1853|volume=165|issue=5|pages=69–84|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650505}}&lt;/ref&gt; these "laws" are actually principles used to predict color match responses to a good approximation under [[photopic vision|photopic]] and [[mesopic vision|mesopic]] vision.  A number of studies have examined how and why they provide poor predictions under specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pokorny|first1=Joel|last2=Smith|first2=Vivianne C.|last3=Xu|first3=Jun|title=Quantal and non-quantal color matches: failure of Grassmann’s laws at short wavelengths|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=1 February 2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=A324|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.29.00A324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brill|first1=Michael H.|last2=Robertson|first2=Alan R.|title=Open Problems on the Validity of Grassmann's Laws|journal=Colorimetry|date=2007|pages=245–259|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch10/summary|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470175637.ch10/summary|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four laws are described in modern texts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Scott|title=University of Houston Vision OPTO 5320 Vision Science 1 Lecture Notes|url=https://www.opt.uh.edu/onlinecoursematerials/stevenson-5320/vis_sci_02.pdf|website=University of Houston Vision OPTO 5320 Vision Science 1 Course Materials|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with varying degrees of algebraic notation and are summarized as follows (the precise numbering and corollary definitions can vary across sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judd|first1=Deane Brewster|last2=Technology|first2=Center for Building|title=Contributions to Color Science|date=1979|publisher=NBS|page=457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgz_iI8NAzYC&amp;pg=PA457&amp;dq=%22Grassmann%27s+laws%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi33N_uibXYAhVqr1QKHXwJCvYQ6AEIWDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Grassmann's%20laws%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
----
{|
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''First law''':}}
|Two colored lights appear different if they differ in either dominant wavelength, luminance or ''purity''. Corollary: For every colored light there exists a light with a complementary color such that a mixture of both lights either desaturates the more intense component or gives uncolored (grey/white) light.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Second law''':}}
|The appearance of a mixture light made from two components changes if either component changes. Corollary: A mixture of two colored lights that are non-complementary result in a mixture that varies in hue with relative intensities of each light and in saturation according to the distance between the hues of each light.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Third law''':}}
|There are lights with different spectral power distributions but appear identical. First corollary: such identical appearing lights must have identical effects when added to a mixture of light. Second corollary: such identical appearing lights must have identical effects when subtracted (i.e., filtered) from a mixture of light.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Fourth law''':}}
|The intensity of a mixture of lights is the sum of the intensities of the components. This is also known as [[Abney's law]].
|}
----

These laws entail an algebraic representation of colored light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Erik|last2=Khan|first2=Erum Arif|last3=Akyuz|first3=Ahmet Oguz|last4=Johnson|first4=Garrett|title=Color Imaging: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439865200|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suLqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=grassman%27s+laws+additive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYz5iD8LPYAhWKxFQKHRrZCfgQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=grassman's%20laws%20additive&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming beam 1 and 2 each have a color, and the observer chooses &lt;math&gt;(R_1,G_1,B_1)&lt;/math&gt; as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 1 and &lt;math&gt;(R_2,G_2,B_2)&lt;/math&gt; as the strengths of the primaries that match beam 2, then if the two beams were combined, the matching values will be the sums of the components. Precisely, they will be &lt;math&gt;(R,G,B)&lt;/math&gt;, where:

:&lt;math&gt;R= R_1+R_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G= G_1+G_2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= B_1+B_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Grassmann's laws can be expressed in general form by stating that for a given color with a [[Spectral density|spectral power distribution]] &lt;math&gt;I(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; the RGB coordinates are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar r(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar g(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B= \int_0^\infty I(\lambda)\,\bar b(\lambda)\,d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that these are linear in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;; the functions &lt;math&gt;\bar r(\lambda), \bar g(\lambda), \bar b(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[color matching function]]s with respect to the chosen primaries.

==History==
Formed in early 1935 by artists including [[Augusta Savage]], [[Charles Alston]] and [[Elba Lightfoot]], the Harlem Artists Guild (HAG) had headquarters on 136th Street, New York. HWG strategies included pressurizing the [[Federal Arts Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] to accept more African-American participants.&lt;ref name=EHR /&gt; The constitution on the Guild stated in part: "We, the artists of Harlem, being aware of the need to act collectively in the solution of the cultural, economic, social and professional problems that confront us, do hereby constitute ourselves an organization that shall be known as the Harlem Artists Guild."&lt;ref name=HAC /&gt; Members included [[Romare Bearden]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaa.si.edu/2011/02/artists-of-the-harlem-renaissance.html "Artists of the Harlem Renaissance"], Archives of American Art, Thursday, February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gwendolyn Bennett]], [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Norman Lewis (artist)|Norman Lewis]], and some others; by 1937 the membership had grown to about 90 and the Guild was putting on exhibitions that included [[Jacob Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=HAC /&gt;

From discussions among HAG artists about the necessity for, and ways to bring about, the establishment of a permanent art center for Harlem came the idea for the [[Harlem Community Art Center]], which opened at the end of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendolyn Bennett, [http://newdeal.feri.org/art/art08.htm "The Harlem Community Art Center"], Federal Art Project Documents.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stacy I.

==History==
Jersey's previous main theatre, the Theatre Royal in Royal Crescent, Saint Helier, burnt down on 31 July 1863. It took two years for a new theatre to be built: Henry Cornwall opened the Royal Amphitheatre in Gloucester Street on 17 April 1865. This theatre was sold to Wybert Rousby in 1869, and became known as the Theatre Royal, and later as the Theatre Royal and Opera House.

The Theatre Royal and Opera House was described in the Royal Almanac for 1890: "Its outside appearance has nothing specially attractive, but the interior is effectively decorated and decidedly comfortable (...) Open at frequent intervals throughout the year for the production of London and Parisian successes in comedy, drama, farce; also grand and comic opera rendered by specially organized companies." In the 1880s and 1890s prices were as follows: stalls seating for 2 shillings; dress circle seating for 3 shillings; pit seating for 1 shilling; gallery seating for 6 pence. 
[[File:Theatre Royal Jersey Patience 1882.jpg|thumb|left|In 1882 the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] performed ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' at the Theatre Royal]]
The theatre hosted a number of notable events. On 29 October 1885 the unveiling of the Don Monument in The Parade was the occasion for a gala performance. In April 1891 Lillie Langtry made her first appearance in a Jersey theatre at the Theatre Royal, followed by her attendance in September 1898 of a performance of R. C. Carton's "Lord and Lady Algy". A stage play of "The [[Battle of Jersey]]" was presented on 8 March 1899, with Wybert Rousby himself as [[Francis Peirson|Major Peirson]], concluding with a tableau reenactment of Copley's "[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781|The Death of Major Peirson]]" on stage. The Theatre Royal hosted circus performances for which the seats were moved from the auditorium onto the stage to permit the circus acts to perform in the body of the theatre.

Wybert Rousby sold the theatre to Sidney Cooper in 1898. Fire broke out in the night of 29 March 1899; flames were spotted at 2.30am. Police, firemen, a detachment of troops, and the actors then performing "Red Riding Hood", turned out to battle the fire, but at 3.10 am the roof crashed down, destroying the building. Neighbouring properties were also damaged.

The Channel Islands Entertainment Co. Ltd. built a new theatre on the ruins of the Theatre Royal and Opera House. The Opera House was opened by [[Lillie Langtry]] on 9 July 1900, who performed in the first play produced in the new premises, "The Degenerates". The new building was modern and spacious compared to its predecessor. The stage was 40 feet deep and 60 feet broad with overhead room of 54 feet, capable of receiving scenery from [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane, London]]. There were two boxes, one on each side of the stage, level with the dress circle: on the right "The Governor's Box" and on the left "The Bailiff's Box".&lt;ref name="Lemprière"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lemprière|first=Raoul|title=The Theatre in Jersey|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=10 December 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fire on 12 May 1921 partly destroyed the building.

In the 1920s the management started showing films, and this developed into a programme alternating cinema and live entertainment. When the Picture House, a cinema in Saint Helier, closed in April 1931, the Opera House became a cinema. It ran a regular cinema programme until the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation]]. 
[[File:Demonstrations at Cinemas August 1941 Jersey.jpg|thumb|In 1941, the Opera House and other cinemas were threatened with closure by the Occupying authorities following public acts of resistance]]
When the Germans arrived, there were three cinemas in operation in Jersey: the Forum (opened 1935), the Opera House, and Wests (opened 1909). The Forum, as the largest cinema, was commandeered by the Germans for entertaining the troops. The two remaining cinemas had a mere 32 feature films in stock to last during the Occupation. The Opera House and Wests arranged an alternating programme between themselves, so that a week of cinema was followed by a week of stage performance and that when the Opera House was staging a play, Wests was showing a film, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Fifty Years of Films in Jersey'', ''[[Jersey Evening Post|Evening Post]]'', 30 January 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of providing entertainment and maintaining morale under the German Occupation was tackled by Jersey's amateur dramatic societies. By February 1941 a number of productions were nearing readiness but there was uncertainty as to which company would take the initiative. On 17 February the Opera House was reopened as a theatre with a production by the Green Room Club of "The Light of Heart" by [[Emlyn Williams]]. After that a new production was mounted monthly on average, interrupted by German requisitioning of the Opera House and other venues for their own purposes, such as a visit by German actress [[Lil Dagover]]. Times of curtain up varied according to the curfew imposed; on occasion when the population were collectively punished for acts of resistance by earlier curfews, the curtain had to rise as early as 6pm. The electricity supply became increasingly erratic. The Opera House was forced to resort to improvised lighting consisting of 3 car headlights in the orchestra pit and lights powered by car batteries in the wings.

In October 1943 a light opera "The Paladins", with libretto by Horace Wyatt and music by PG Larbalestier, was mounted. The German censor passed the text despite the inclusion of a chorus "Faithful and Free" that became an expression of patriotic longing that produced an emotional response in the audience.

In July 1943 the Opera House and other cinemas were ordered to be closed for a month, and again following [[D-Day]] on 6 June 1944 until 9 August 1944. When the electricity supply ended on 25 January 1945, performances at the Opera House ended. Immediately following Liberation on 9 May 1945, the Opera House reopened for a grand variety show on 10 May 1945 for released prisoners.&lt;ref name=Occupation&gt;{{cite news|title=The Story of "Occupation Theatre"|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=18 November 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera House resumed its operation as a cinema after the Liberation, but closed as a cinema in 1959, reverting to a stage theatre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1953 the theatre was purchased by Odeon (Jersey) Ltd. who ran it as a cinema with the exception of the staging of a musical show "Starlight Rendezvous" in 1955 and 1956. Odeon (Jersey) Ltd. put the Opera House on the market with a condition of sale that no films were to be shown under the new ownership. Theatrical impresario Tommy Swanson negotiated with the ultimate owners [[Rank Organisation]] for eighteen months before concluding the purchase at the end of the 1959 summer season. He undertook major renovations, adding 15 extra boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evening Post 1890-1965|year=1965|publisher=The Evening Post|location=Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building came into the ownership of Dick Ray from 1976 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/6746|title=Jersey Opera House rejects Ray’s rescue |last=Smith|first=  Alistair |work=The Stage| date=3 March 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the public of the Island of Jersey became the new owner of the Jersey Opera House at a cost of £1.3 million. In January 1997 the theatre closed for a major restoration project. A proposition was presented to the States of Jersey for a loan of £5.5 million to add to the £1.5 million that had been raised by the good will of the people and businesses of Jersey. This was successful and this major programme of work started in August 1998. After an extensive programme of rebuilding and renovation the new theatre opened its door on 9 July 2000 exactly 100 years to the day when the first Opera House had opened its doors to the public of Jersey.

The Jersey Opera House has had some financial difficulties in the past as well as periods when it did not operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/5684|title= Jersey Opera House directors all resign|last= Smith|first=Alistair |date= 17 December 2004|work=The Stage|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/6514|title=Jersey Opera House dark again|date=15 February 2005 |last=Smith|first=  Alistair |work=The Stage|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts''' (or '''The Shedd Institute''', and locally known simply as '''The Shedd'''), ), is a [[performing arts]] company, cultural arts center, and community [[music school]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. Located in downtown Eugene, The Shedd Institute has 3 performance venues, various community meeting rooms, and extensive music education facilities. It presents annually an array of culturally diverse festivals, concert series and educational programs that focus on, but are not limited to, American music in all of its forms and variations.

==History==
The Shedd Institute was founded in 1991 under the name [[Oregon Festival of American Music]] as a thematically based summer orchestral pops festival dedicated to the championship of American classical music. In 1993 the Festival was designated as a Resident Company of the [[Hult Center for the Performing Arts]]. It established a community music institute in 1995.

In 1997 the company shifted radically from its summer-only festival model and began year-round programming with the foundation of two additional performance initiatives, The American Symphonia and The Emerald City Jazz Kings. The American Symphonia, which was under the artistic direction of conductor [[James Paul]] from 1997–2006, was a classical music initiative dedicated specifically to the championship of post-1900 European art music written in the Western Hemisphere. The Emerald City Jazz Kings, founded and directed by trombonist and music scholar Stephen Stone, is a 16 to 22 member ensemble dedicated to the presentation of American popular music from the 1920s through '50s, with an emphasis on big band jazz, swing, musical theater, and the American standard. In 1998 the company's eclectic August festival named jazz pianist and composer [[Dick Hyman]] as its jazz advisor, who joined James Paul at its artistic helm.

By 1999 the Festival had added 2 more performance initiatives to its programming (its Now Hear This Presenting Series and the Twin Rivers Folklife Festival) and, with the continued expansion of its community music school, had begun a search for a building of its own. In July 2002 it moved into the former First Baptist Church in downtown Eugene (a {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} complex of performance, meeting and classroom spaces), which it named "The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts" in honor of early 20th century Chicago businessman and philanthropist [[John G. Shedd]], the great-grandfather of Festival co-founder and long-time patron and Director of Education, Ginevra Reed Ralph.

In 2004 the Festival official changed its name to the name of its building. It is commonly referred to as "The Shedd Institute" while the building is known simply as "The Shedd". It added 2 additional concert initiatives to its cultural service mix (The Magical Moombah, a musical vaudeville for kids directed by Judith "Sparky" Roberts, and its Shedd Presents series) and began rental of the facility to other regional, cultural and educational programs.

==Performance programs==
The Shedd Institute's performance division currently manages 5 concert series: [[Oregon Festival of American Music]] (an August Festival, founded in 1992, dedicated to the classic American Songbook),  The Emerald City Jazz Kings (founded in 1997, the Institute's resident jazz and historic popular music ensemble), Shedd Theatricals (founded in 2002 to produce classical musicals and musical comedies from the 1920s to early 1960s), The Magical Moombah (founded in 2001), the Now Hear This cultural presenting series (founded in 2000), and Shedd Presents (founded in 2004).

==Facilities==
The Shedd Institute's facility is located on the corner of Broadway &amp; High Street in downtown Eugene. Formerly, the building housed the First Baptist Church of Eugene.  A {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building has 2 formal concert halls (the 825-seat Jaqua Concert Hall and the 175-seat Recital Hall), a multi-purpose 250-seat Great Hall, 2 dance studios, a library, and over 30 other community meeting rooms, classrooms and rehearsal spaces.

'''Lee Grant''' (born '''Lyova Haskell Rosenthal'''; October 31, during the mid-1920s){{efn|name="birth year note"}} is an American actress and film director.

In her 1951 film debut, she played the role of a young shoplifter in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'', co-starring [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Eleanor Parker]]. It earned her an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], along with the Best Actress Award at the [[1952 Cannes Film Festival]].

In 1952, as she had refused to testify against her husband at the [[HUAC]] hearings, she was [[Hollywood ten|blacklisted]] from most acting jobs for the next ten years. She was then only able to find occasional work on the stage or as a teacher during that period. It also contributed to her divorce. After she was removed from the blacklist in 1962, she rebuilt her acting career in films, after which she starred in 71 TV episodes of ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' (1965–1966), followed by lead roles in films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (1967), and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), for which she won her first Oscar. In 1964, she won the [[Obie Award for Distinguished Performance by an Actress]] for her performance in ''[[The Maids]]''. During her career, she was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] seven times between 1966 and 1993, winning twice.

==Early life==
Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jerry.

Rosenthal, a realtor and educator. Her father was born in New York City, to [[Polish-Jewish]] immigrants, and her mother was a [[Russian-Jewish]] immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/202192/lee-grant-said-yes-to-everything-except-mccarth Profile], forward.com; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The family resided at 706 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]], in the [[Hamilton Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/38/Lee-Grant.html Lee Grant profile], FilmReference.com; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her date of birth is October 31, but the year is disputed, with all years ranging from 1925 to 1931 having been given as her year of birth at some point; however, census data, travel manifests, and testimony suggest that she was born in 1925 or 1926, while Grant's stated ages at the time of her professional debut and Oscar nomination indicate she was born in 1927.{{efn|name="birth year note"}}

She debuted in ''[[Franco Leoni|L'Oracolo]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1931&lt;ref&gt;Olin Downes.

Grant graduated from high school, and won a scholarship to the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]], and studied under [[Sanford Meisner]]. She subsequently enrolled in [[Actors Studio]] in New York.

==Career==
===1940s{{ndash}}1950s===
Grant had her first stage ballet performance in 1933 at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]].&lt;ref name=tcm&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/75242%7C96586/Lee-Grant/milestones.html Turner Classic Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, in her early teens, she was made a member of the [[American Ballet]], under [[George Balanchine]].&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt; As an actress, Grant had her professional stage debut as understudy in ''Oklahoma'' in 1944. In 1948, she had her Broadway acting debut in ''Joy to the World''. Grant established herself as a dramatic [[method acting|method]] actress on and off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], earning praise for her role as a shoplifter in ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{IBDB name|42830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her film debut two years later in the film version (''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]''), starring [[Kirk Douglas]], receiving her first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] nomination, and winning the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] Award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)]]&lt;/ref&gt; She said she enjoyed working under director [[William Wyler]], who helped guide her.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL3iv9gUAPA;t=1m43s Lee Grant, "Inside the Actors Studio" 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box||align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=But as quickly as that dream unfolded, her life soon turned into a nightmare... So right when her career should have been blooming, she was banned from working in Hollywood. And that ban lasted for twelve years, a lifetime for an actor.|source=[[Robert Osborne]], ''Turner Classic Movies'' interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/1033419/Conversation-With-Lee-Grant-A-TCM-Original-2014.html "Conversation With Lee Grant", 2014], tcm.com; accessed May 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1951, she gave an impassioned eulogy at the memorial service for actor [[J. Edward Bromberg]], whose early death, she implied, was caused by the stress of being called before [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). After her eulogy was published, she was summoned by the same committee to testify against her husband, playwright [[Arnold Manoff]], but refused. As a result, for the next ten years, her "prime years", as she put it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lee-grant-on-life-beyond-the-hollywood-blacklist "Lee Grant on life beyond the Hollywood blacklist"], CBSnews.com, August 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; she was [[Hollywood ten|blacklisted]] and her work in television and movies was limited.&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLf3Ga4ZBM Turner Classic Movies "Evening With Lee Grant" (1of4), ''Detective Story''], interview with [[Robert Osborne]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirk Douglas]], who acted with her in ''Detective Story'', recalled that director [[Edward Dmytryk]], a blacklistee, had first named her husband at the HUAC:{{quote|Lee was only a kid, a beautiful young girl with extraordinary talent and a big future. You could see it. She was so good that she earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her very first film role. But because Eddie Dmytryk named her husband, Lee Grant was blacklisted before her film career even had a chance to begin. Of course, she refused to testify about the man to whom she was married, and it took years before anyone would hire her for another picture.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Kirk. ''I Am Spartacus: Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist'', Open Road Media (2012) p. 26; {{ISBN|978-1453254806}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant appeared in a limited number of stage and television shows during these years. In 1953, she played Rose Peabody on the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. In the Broadway production of ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' in 1959, she succeeded [[Anne Bancroft]] in the lead female role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/lee-grant/11/ "Two for the Seesaw"], CBS News, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[File:Lee Grant - 1961.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Grant in 1961]]
By the time her name was finally removed from the blacklist in the early 1960s, she had since been divorced, remarried, and had a young daughter, [[Dinah Manoff|Dinah]]. She began re-establishing her television and movie career. In her autobiography, she writes:{{quote|Dinah was my grail, my constant; nothing and no one could get between us. Dinah and my need to support her financially, morally, viscerally, and my rage at those who had taken twelve working, acting years from my life, were what motivated me.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Lee. ''I Said Yes to Everything: A Memoir'', Penguin (2014) {{ISBN|978-0-399-16930-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}}} Her experience with the blacklist scarred her to such an extent that as late as 2002, she would freeze and go into a "near trance" when anyone asked her about her experiences during the McCarthy period.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven J. ''Hollywood Left and Right'', Oxford Univ. Press (2011) p. 128; {{ISBN|978-0195181722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant's first major achievement, after HUAC officially cleared her, was in the 1960s television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', as [[Stella Chernak]], for which she won an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] in 1966. In 1967, Grant appeared in an episode of ''[[Mission Impossible]]'', portraying the wife of a U.S. diplomat who goes undercover to discredit a rogue diplomat. That same year, she played the distraught widow of a murder victim in the Oscar-winning ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]''. In 1963, she won acclaim for her stage performance in the off-Broadway production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Maids]]''.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb name|15613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
She received subsequent Academy Award nominations for the dramas ''[[The Landlord]]'' (1970) and ''[[Voyage of the Damned]]'' (1976). Her acting range extended into comedy equally well, notably in several roles as an overbearing mother. In ''[[Plaza Suite (film)|Plaza Suite]]'' (1971), a comedy directed by [[Arthur Hiller]] and written by [[Neil Simon]], she played the harassed mother of a bride, with [[Walter Matthau]] as the father. The film was followed by another comedy role as the mother in ''[[Portnoy's Complaint (film)|Portnoy's Complaint]]'' (1972).

Also in 1971, she played cold-blooded killer Leslie Williams on the second episode ("Ransom for a Dead Man") of the [[Peter Falk]] series ''[[List of Columbo episodes|Columbo]]''. She would appear with Falk again on Broadway ''[[Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'', whose playwright Neil Simon said that his "first and only choice" for the part was Grant, who he said was equally at home with dramatists such as [[Chekhov]] or [[Sidney Kingsley]], yet could also be "hilariously funny" when the script called for it, as she was able to portray essential honesty in her acting.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Neil. ''Rewrites'', Simon &amp; Schuster (1996) p. 336)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among her most notable roles was as [[Warren Beatty]]'s older lover in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975), for which she won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Supporting Actress. The film received mixed reviews, but was Columbia's biggest hit in the studio's 50-year history.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Elizabeth. ''The Makeover in Movies: Before and After in Hollywood Films, 1941-2002'', McFarland (2004) p. 198&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' was the second film in which Grant acted under director [[Hal Ashby]]. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], comparing her in both films, noted Grant "is such a cool-style comedienne that she's in danger of having people say that she's good, as usual."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pauline Kael|Kael, Pauline]]. ''The Age of Movies: Selected Writings of Pauline Kael'', Penguin e-books (2011)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming, however, she did have some serious disagreements with Beatty, who was also the producer, and nearly quit. During one scene, she wanted to play it in a way she felt was more realistic from a woman's perspective, but Beatty disagreed. After thinking about the scene for a few days, she told director Ashby that she could not do it Beatty's way and was quitting. As she was walking out, Beatty stopped her, and asked what was wrong. "I sat down and told him", she said. "He threw up his hands and said, 'Play it your way. What do I know? I'm a man.'"&lt;ref&gt;Biskind, Peter.

[[file:Lee Grant 1975-1.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Grant in 1975]]
Despite the success of the film, Grant was feeling less secure in Hollywood, as she was then around fifty years old. She writes:
{{quote|I was becoming my own worst enemy as an actor, traumatized onstage and fixated on staying young so I could keep working in film. A woman of a certain age does not play in movies or TV; we're kicked to the side or out. And I was a woman of a certain age, terrified I'd be found out and unemployed again.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;{{rp|213}}}}

In March 1971, Grant appeared in the ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' episode "Ransom for a Dead Man"', and was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress&amp;nbsp;– Miniseries or a Movie. Having been nominated for two performances in the same acting category, she received the award for her other Emmy-nominated performance in the television film, ''The Neon Ceiling''. The only other nominee was [[Colleen Dewhurst]]; in Grant's acceptance speech, she wryly noted, "I must thank Colleen Dewhurst since it takes two of me to equal one of her." {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

During the 1975-76 television season, she starred in the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Fay (TV series)|Fay]]'', which, to her chagrin, was canceled after eight episodes. She made a guest appearance on ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'', in which her daughter [[Dinah Manoff]] co-starred. In 1978 she was the lead actress in the sequel, ''[[Damien: Omen II]]''.

Grant successfully moved into directing when she directed the stage play, ''[[The Stronger]]'', in 1976, written by [[August Strindberg]].

===1980s{{ndash}}1990s===
In 1980, Grant directed her first film, ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'', a story about an aging Jewish couple. That debut narrative film was followed by a widely distributed documentary film, "The Willmar 8", which profiled 8 female employees of a bank in Willmar, Minnesota who went on strike to protest pay inequities between male and female bank tellers. She starred a [[HBO]] remake of ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' in 1982, costarring [[Jerry Orbach]], both playing three different characters in three acts. It was filmed before a live audience.&lt;ref name=Shelley&gt;Shelley, Peter.

[[File:Lee Grant at F.I.S.T premier 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=.76|left|Grant at the premiere of ''F.I.S.T.'' (April 1978)]]
Actor [[Bruce Dern]], who played alongside her in [[The Big Town (1987 film)|''The Big Town'']] (1987), recalls working with her: "Lee Grant is a fabulous actress. Anytime she works it's a blessing you have her in your movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Dern|Dern, Bruce]]. ''Things I've Said, But Probably Shouldn't Have: An Unrepentant Memoir'', Wiley (2007) p. 231&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She directed several documentary films, including ''[[Down and Out in America]]'' (1986) which won the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]]. That same year, she directed ''Nobody's Child'', a television movie starring [[Marlo Thomas]] about a woman confined to a mental institution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0335519}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her direction, Grant became the first female director to win the [[Directors Guild of America Award]].&lt;ref name=TCM/&gt;

In 1988, she was awarded the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Women in Film Crystal Award]] for outstanding women who through their endurance and the excellence of their work have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wif.org/past-recipients Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120329/http://www.wif.org/past-recipients |date=2011-07-24 }} Women in Film website; accessed September 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiring her directing and acting skill, actress [[Sissy Spacek]] agreed to act in ''[[Hard Promises (1991 film)|Hard Promises]]'' (1991) "only to work with Grant", although Grant was later replaced as its director.&lt;ref&gt;Jarboe, Jan. "Sissy Spacek's Long Walk Home", ''Texas Monthly'', February 1991, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Grant played Dora Cohn, the mother of [[Roy Cohn]] in the biographical made-for-TV film ''[[Citizen Cohn]]'', which garnered her yet another Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

===2000s–present===
In 2001, Lee Grant portrayed Louise Bonner in [[David Lynch]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Mullholland Drive (film)|Mullholland Drive]]''. From 2004 to 2007, [[Carlin Glynn]], [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]], and Grant served as co-artistic directors for the [[Actors Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, James. ''Inside Inside'', Penguin Group (USA), October 18, 2007; {{ISBN|9781101211991}}, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, Grant directed a series of ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait]]'' episodes for Lifetime Television, that celebrated a diverse range of accomplished women.

In 2013 she returned to the stage, after a nearly forty-year absence, to star in ''[[The Gin Game]]'', part of a benefit for improvement programs at the Island Music Guild. Grant played Fonsia Dorsey opposite [[Frank Buxton]] as Weller Martin; her daughter [[Dinah Manoff]] directed the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2013/aug/12/theater-high-powered-cast-deals-this-gin-game/?partner=RSS#axzz2xZu7fd3s|title=Theater: High-powered cast deals this 'Gin Game'|author=Michael C.

==Notes==
{{Notelist|notes=

{{efn|name="birth year note"|Grant was born on October 31, but disagreement exists between sources over the year. While secondary and tertiary sources put Grant's year of birth between 1925 and 1931 she was almost certainly born in the mid-1920s. Public records indicate she was born in 1925 but a ship manifest and congressional testimony favor 1926. Recent interviews with Grant and her autobiography suggest 1927, although Grant herself is inconsistent on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;

''Secondary sources''
* ''Mid-1920s'': The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' notes that Grant is "famously inexact" about her age, as a result of being blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Carrie|last=Rickey|title='I Said Yes to Everything', by Lee Grant|date=July 17, 2014|work=[[SFGate.com]]|quote=Lyova Rosenthal was born in the mid-1920s. The granddaughter of Polish and Russian immigrants is famously inexact about her age. From her mid-20s to her mid-30s, the blacklist left her unemployable in TV and film, so she lied about her years, whatever they were, to remain viable as an actress.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/I-Said-Yes-to-Everything-by-Lee-Grant-5629159.php|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''1926–1930, 1931'': ''[[Who’s Who in America]]'' lists 1931 as Grant's birth year, but ''Great Jews in the Performing Arts'' notes that "Other sources give every year from 1926 through 1930."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Darryl|last=Lyman|title=Great Jews in the Performing Arts|year=1999|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bnQHAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rosenthal+1930 124] |quote=Lee Grant was born in New York City, New York, on October 31, 1931. (The date is so listed in Who's Who in America. Other sources give every year from 1926 through 1930.) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''1927'': While interviewing Grant, [[Gilbert Gottfried]] put her age at 24 at the time of her Oscar nomination and Cannes win.

'''Lynn Bayonas''' (11 April 1943 – 25 January 2010)&lt;ref name="Davern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/obituaries/allrounder-gave-tv-audiences-much-pleasure-20100201-n8y9.html|title=All-rounder gave TV audiences much pleasure|last=Davern|first=James|date=2 February 2010|publisher=The Age|accessdate=1 February 2010|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian television producer and [[television writer|writer]]. Her sister was ''[[Neighbours]]'' executive producer [[Susan Bower]].

==Personal life==
Lynette Margaret Bower was 18 years old and living in London when she got her breakthrough into television. She was an assistant to the general manager of [[The Australian Ballet]] who were then travelling through Europe and were due to travel on to the United States, somewhere that Bayonas didn't want to go.&lt;ref name="Courtis"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Courtis|title=Taking the Reins|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/20/1023864469810.html|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=20 June 2002|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst working in London, Bayonas heard of a job coming up with ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' creator [[Orson Welles]]. She agreed to meet Welles when he was making ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' with [[Peter Sellers]], Bayonas told him how she wasn't enjoying her job at the Australian Ballet and Welles invited her to Spain immediately.&lt;ref name="Courtis"/&gt; While working in Spain she met her future husband, Luis Bayonas, a writer, [[art director]] and [[assistant director]].&lt;ref name="Courtis"/&gt;

==Career==
Bayonas' first job was taking notes for the film that Welles was working on at the time. Bayonas admitted that working with Welles taught her about flexibility in storytelling and turned her against many writing courses that she felt were structured. {{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

After meeting her husband in Spain, Bayonas wanted to return to Australia, and [[Crawford Productions]] allowed her to do that by appointing her as script editor and writer on shows ''[[Homicide (Australian series)|Homicide]]'',&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Margaret|last=Rogers|title=Refractory: The Bill|date=25 June 2009|journal=Refractory: The Bill|issn=1447-4905}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Division 4]]'',&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; ''[[The Box (TV series)|The Box]]'' and ''[[The Sullivans]]''.&lt;ref name="Crawford TV Productions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crawford Productions Names A–F|url=http://www.crawfordproductions.net/names1.php|publisher=Crawford TV Productions|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121102249/http://www.crawfordproductions.net/names1.php|archivedate=21 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s she started work on ''[[A Country Practice]]'', the programme that later allowed her sister [[Susan Bower]] to break into television writing.

Beginning in 1994, Bayonas lived in [[Los Angeles, California]] for six years, writing for [[Paramount Pictures]]. During her time in Los Angeles, she worked on programmes such as ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]'' and ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Prime Time]]''. In 2000, Bayonas decided to return to Australia and began work on television programmes such as ''[[The Saddle Club]]'',&lt;ref name="Weekly Times"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Hudson |title=Join The Saddle Club |url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2009/04/01/66141_country-living.html |newspaper=[[The Weekly Times]] |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419234346/http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2009/04/01/66141_country-living.html |archivedate=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Secret Life of Us]]''&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bridget|last=McManus|title=Dark City|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/dark-city/2008/04/09/1207420400339.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=10 April 2008|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Lawrence of Arabia''. In 2008, just as the third series of ''The Saddle Club'' finished production, cancer took hold of Bayonas&lt;ref name="Davern"/&gt; meaning that this was Bayonas' last work before her death from cancer in January 2010.

She was also head of her own production company, '''Lynn Bayonas Productions''', based in [[Preston, Victoria]]&lt;ref name="Encore Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encoremagazine.com.au/writerproducer-lynn-bayonas-passes-away-399|title=Writer/producer Lynn Bayonas passes away|date=27 January 2010|publisher=Encore Magazine|accessdate=27 January 2010|location=Australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130220425/http://www.encoremagazine.com.au/writerproducer-lynn-bayonas-passes-away-399|archivedate=30 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lyric Theatre''', also known as the '''Lyric Hammersmith''', is a theatre in King Street, in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]], which takes pride in its original, "groundbreaking" productions.&lt;ref name=AboutLyric&gt;[http://www.lyric.co.uk/about/ "About the Lyric"], ''Lyric'' official website. Retrieved 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Lyric Theatre was originally a music hall established in 1888 on Bradmore Grove, Hammersmith. Success as an entertainment venue led it to be rebuilt and enlarged on the same site twice, firstly in 1890 and then in 1895 by the English theatrical architect [[Frank Matcham]]. The 1895 re-opening, as The New Lyric Opera House, was accompanied by an opening address by the famous actress [[Lillie Langtry]].&lt;ref&gt;The Era classified ads 13 July 1895 online. Retrieved 27 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the theatre was due to be closed and demolished. However, a successful campaign to save it led to the auditorium being dismantled and re-installed piece by piece within a modern shell on its current site on King Street a short distance from the former Bradmore Grove location. The relocated theatre opened in 1979.&lt;ref name=Earl&gt;John Earl, [http://www.frankmatchamsociety.org.uk/magazine.html "Presidential Address: The Crest of a Wave"], ''[[Frank Matcham]] Society Magazine'', n.d.. Retrieved 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two main performance areas: the ''Main House'', a 550-seat 19th-century auditorium maintaining the original design which hosts its main productions; and the 120-seat ''Studio'', which houses smaller productions by up-and-coming companies. The Lyric also presents frequent ''Lyric Children'' and ''Lyric Music'' performances as well as ''Sunday Night Comedy''.&lt;ref name=AboutLyric/&gt;

Its current artistic director is [[Sean Holmes]], and its executive director is Sian Alexander.&lt;ref name=AboutLyricCompany&gt;[http://www.lyric.co.uk/about/our-staff/ "About the Lyric: Our Staff"], ''Lyric'' official website. Retrieved 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyric has recently gone through a major re-development project, with new facilities for young people and the local community completed in 2015, designed by [[Rick Mather]] Architects&lt;ref name=CapitalDevelopment&gt;[http://www.lyric.co.uk/support-us/capital-development/ "Capital Development"], ''Lyric'' official website. Retrieved 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated in the 'community benefit' and 'tourism and leisure' categories at the RICS Awards 2016, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rics.org/uk/training-events/awards/rics-awards-london/|title = RICS Awards, London|last = Surveyors|first = Royal Institution of Chartered|publisher = rics.org|language = en|access-date = 15 March 2016|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160315212850/http://www.rics.org/uk/training-events/awards/rics-awards-london/|archivedate = 15 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Lyric won the [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre for [[Sean Holmes]]' production of [[Sarah Kane]]'s ''[[Blasted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item114061/Outstanding-Achievement-in-an-Affiliate-Theatre/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110714235731/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item114061/Outstanding-Achievement-in-an-Affiliate-Theatre/ |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, it was announced that Sean Holmes would be succeeded as artistic director in February 2019 by [[Rachel O'Riordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/rachel-oriordan-announced-as-new-lyric-hammersmith-artistic-director-a3930086.html|title=Rachel O'Riordan will take over from Sean Holmes at Lyric Hammersmith|author=|date=|website=standard.co.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Magischer Zirkel der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''''' (Magic Circle of the German Democratic Republic) was a national [[magic (illusion)|magicians']] association that was active in [[East Germany]] from 1956 to 1969, and again briefly in 1990.

== History ==

The organization was founded on 20 October 1956 following a meeting between Theo Bozenhard, Hans Marian, Hans Hander (Tosari), Hans-Gerhard Stumpf, and GDR Culture Minister [[Johannes R. Becher]].  Erich Kluge served as the organization's first chairman until January 1959, when he stepped down for reasons of ill health.  Hans Hander took over as interim leader, becoming first chairman on 12 January 1962 upon Kluge's death.  Siegfried Nitsche then served as first chairman from Hander's death in January 1968 until the organization was dissolved in December 1969.&lt;ref name="happel" /&gt;

Following the group's dissolution, magicians' associations in East Germany were confined to the local level.  In 1974 there were forty such associations, with a total membership of around 600.  By 1990 the number of associations had risen to 52.&lt;ref name="happel" /&gt;

On 11 November 1989, ten magicians convened in [[Leipzig]] and made an application to the Ministry of Culture to revive the ''Magischer Zirkel der DDR''.  Among the refounders were Hans-Georg Bucsi, Klaus Fürst, Hans-Gerhard Stumpf, and Annette Kirberg-Stumpf.  The association was officially re-established on 6 January 1990.  At its first conference on 10 March of that year, Hans-Gerhard Stumpf was elected president.  Within a few months, Stumpf and the managing directors of the association met with their [[West Germany|West German]] counterparts in the ''[[Magischer Zirkel von Deutschland]]'' to discuss unification of the two groups.  The merger was effected on 29 September 1990.&lt;ref name="happel" /&gt;

[[Image:Imarriedadventure.jpg|thumb|200px|I Married Adventure by Osa Johnson]]

'''Martin Elmer Johnson''' (October 9, 1884 – January 13, 1937) and his wife '''Osa Helen Johnson''' ([[née]] Leighty, March 14, 1894 – January 7, 1953) were [[United States|American]] [[adventurers]] and [[documentary]] filmmakers.
In the first half of the 20th century an American couple, Martin and Osa Johnson, captured the public's imagination through their films and books of adventure in exotic, faraway lands. Photographers, explorers, marketers, naturalists and authors, Martin and Osa studied the wildlife and peoples of East and Central Africa, the South [[Pacific Islands]] and British [[North Borneo]]. They explored then-unknown lands and brought back film footage and photographs, offering many Americans their first understanding of these distant lands.

==Biography==
Martin Elmer Johnson was born on October 9, 1884. Osa Leighty was born March 14, 1894 and raised in [[Chanute, Kansas]]. Although born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], Martin Johnson grew up in Lincoln, Kansas, and Independence, Kansas.

Martin Johnson took part as a crew member and cook in [[Jack London]]'s 1907–1909 voyage across the Pacific aboard the [[The Cruise of the Snark|''Snark'']].  After he had continued a voyage around the world, he started a traveling road show that toured the United States displaying photographs and artifacts collected on the voyage. He met Osa Leighty while he was showing his travelogues at the theatre in Osa's hometown of Chanute, Kansas, where she was singing.  Martin and Osa were married in May 1910 in Independence.&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.safarimuseum.com/about/martin-and-osa-johnson/ |title=About the Johnsons |website=THE MARTIN AND OSA JOHNSON SAFARI MUSEUM |access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johnsons spent the next 7 years touring with Martin's travelogue in the US and Europe. Martin also published his book “Through the South Seas With Jack London” in 1913.

==Safaris==
[[File:Osa Johnson and airplane.jpg|thumb|Osa with a gibbon in an airplane]]
In 1917, Martin and Osa departed on a nine-month trip through the [[New Hebrides]] ([[Vanuatu]]) and [[Solomon Islands]].  The highlight of the trip was a brief, but harrowing, encounter with a tribe called the [[Big Nambas]] of northern [[Malekula]]. Once there, the chief was not going to let them leave.  The intervention of a British gunboat helped them escape.  The footage they got there inspired the feature film ''[[Among the Cannibal Isles of the South Seas]]'' (1918).

The Johnsons returned to Malekula in 1919 to film the Big Nambas once again, this time with an armed escort.  The escort proved unnecessary as the Big Nambas were disarmed by  watching themselves in ''Among the Cannibal Isles of the South Seas''.  Martin and Osa  finished their trip in 1920 with visits to [[British North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]) and a sailing expedition up the coast of East Africa. After returning home, they released the features ''[[Jungle Adventures]]'' (1921) and ''[[Headhunters of the South Seas]]'' (1922).

The Johnsons' first African expedition, from 1921 to 1922, resulted in their feature film ''[[Trailing Wild African Animals]]'' (1923).

During the second and longest trip, from 1924 to 1927, the Johnsons spent much of their time in northern [[Kenya]] by a lake they dubbed Paradise, at [[Mount Marsabit]].  The movies ''[[Martin's Safari]]'' (1928), ''[[Osa's Four Years in Paradise]]'' (1941), and the film ''[[Simba: King of the Beasts]]'' (1928) were made with footage of these trips.

In 1925, Osa and Martin met the Duke and Duchess of York, later [[King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]], while on safari in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Osa. ''I Married Adventure''. (1940). J.B. Lippincott Company. U.S.A. 6th Edition chap. 23 page. 289-293&lt;/ref&gt;

The third African safari from 1927 to 1928 was a tour of the [[Nile]] with friend and supporter [[George Eastman]], founder of [[Eastman Kodak]].  This trip, along with previous footage was one of the first talkies for the Johnsons, ''[[Across the World with Mr. and Mrs. Johnson]]'' (1930), which included Martin's narrative.

In 1928 three Eagle Scouts were selected in national competition to go on safari with the Johnsons in East Africa: Robert Dick Douglas, Jr., of North Carolina, David R. Martin, Jr., of Minnesota, and Douglas L. Oliver of Georgia. The three scouts co-authored the 1928 book ''Three Boy Scouts in Africa''. Douglas (1912-2015) was an attorney, Martin (1913-2004) became an executive in the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and Oliver (1913-2009) was an Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at both Harvard University and the University of Hawaii.

From 1929 to 1931, the Johnsons spent a fourth tour in Africa in the [[Belgian Congo]].  There they filmed the [[Mbuti]] people of the [[Ituri Forest]] and the [[gorilla]]s in the Alumbongo Hills. The 1932 feature movie ''[[Congorilla (film)|Congorilla]]'' was in part a product of this trip, and was the first movie with sound authentically recorded in Africa.

[[Image:OSAS ARK.jpg|right|thumb|Osa's Ark S-38]]
In 1932 the Johnsons learned to fly at the Chanute Municipal Airport (now named the [[Chanute Martin Johnson Airport]]) in Osa's hometown of [[Chanute, Kansas|Chanute]]. Once they had their pilot's licenses, they purchased two [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] amphibious planes, a [[Sikorsky S-39|S-39-CS]] "Spirit of Africa" and [[Sikorsky S-38|S-38-BS]] "Osa's Ark".  On their fifth African trip, from 1933 to 1934, the Johnsons flew the length of Africa getting now classic aerial scenes of large herds of elephants, giraffes, and other animals moving across the plains of Africa.  They were the first pilots to fly over [[Mt. Kilimanjaro]] and [[Mt. Kenya]] in Africa and film them from the air. The 1935 feature film ''[[Baboona]]'' was made from this footage.

On January 3, 1935 ''Baboona'' was shown on an Eastern Air Lines plane becoming the first sound movie shown during flight.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Phil M.. "Along the Rialto". ''The Film Daily''. January 4, 1935. page. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The movie premiered January 22, 1935 at the Rialto Theatre in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Imperato, Pascal James; Imperato, Eleanor M. ''They Married Adventure''. (1992). Rutgers University Press. U.S.A. page. 185&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, the Johnsons were featured on [[Wheaties]] cereal boxes as "Champions of Sports."  Osa Johnson was the second female to appear on the box and she and Martin were the first married couple selected for this honor.

The Johnsons' final trip together took them to [[British North Borneo]] again, from 1935 to 1936. They used their smaller amphibious plane, now renamed "The Spirit of Africa and Borneo", and produced footage for the feature ''[[Borneo (film)|Borneo]]'' (1937).

Martin Johnson was a member of the [[Adventurers' Club of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Johnson" (obituary). ''The Adventurer'', January 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the Borneo expedition before the club on November 19, 1936, the event being called "Martin Johnson Night."&lt;ref&gt;"The November Dinner." ''The Adventurer'', December 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; He previewed his "Borneo Pictures" before the group on December 17, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;"The December Meeting." ''The Adventurer'', January 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Johnson died in the [[Western Air Express Flight 7|crash of a Western Air Express]] flight near [[Newhall, California]], on January 12, 1937. Osa was severely injured but recovered. By October 1937, the ''[[New York Times]]'' was publishing dispatches of Osa's latest trip to Africa, in which she described lifestyles and practices of the Maasai and other tribes.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/10/24/archives/natives-endanger-the-johnson-party-tanganyika-warriors-become.html |title=NATIVES ENDANGER THE JOHNSON PARTY |last=JOHNSON |first=OSA |date=1937-11-24 |website=New York Times |access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in New York City of a heart attack in 1953.

==I Married Adventure==

Osa Johnson’s autobiography ''I Married Adventure'' (IMA) was the best-selling non-fiction book of 1940. The continued popularity of IMA, with its zebra-striped cover, has generated interest in collecting first editions. Covers with “I MARRIED ''Adventure''” were first editions and those with “I MARRIED ADVENTURE” (all block letters) were later editions. The edition variations are now known due to years of collecting and studying all IMA editions by J.E. Paul Lewison of New York. A title with “''Adventure''” in italics can be a first edition or a Book of the Month Club (BMC) edition or a seventh edition. The difference is determined by examining the copyright page. First editions will include “MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BY THE HADDON CRAFTSMEN, INC., CAMDEN, N.J.” BMC editions state “PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” plus the BMC logo is on the dust jacket (if it has survived). Seventh editions specifically state “SEVENTH IMPRESSION”. Confusingly the seventh edition had both “''Adventure''” and “ADVENTURE” versions.

==Osa Johnson's The Big Game Hunt==

Television's first wildlife series, ''Osa Johnson's The Big Game Hunt'' a.k.a. ''The Big Game Hunt'', premiered in 1952. The 26 half-hour episodes were released by Explorers Pictures and primarily used Johnson film. Episodes introduced by Osa Johnson were African Army, Boy Scouts in Africa, Climbing Fish, The Floating Terror, Giant Elephants, Goring Brutes, Headhunters of Borneo, Jungle Panic, Jungle Power, Jungle Warriors, Rhinoceros, Simba's Trail, Slinking Fury and Weird Tribes. Episodes introduced by [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] were Armed Menace, Cameras in the Wilderness, Herds of Destruction, Jaws of Death, Kill to Live, Man-Eaters of the Masai, Monkey Safari, Orang-utan, Pygmy Hunters, Return to Adventure, Terror of the Plains and Trek through the Wild Lands.

==Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum==
The Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum] is located in Osa's hometown of [[Chanute, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safarimuseum.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 1961 to preserve the Johnsons' achievements and to encourage further research into their fields of study, the Safari Museum (as it was originally named) has grown and flourished. The museum started with a core collection of the Johnsons' films, photographs, manuscripts, articles, books, and personal belongings donated by Osa's mother. The museum shares the beautiful old railroad depot with the Chanute Public Library.

In 1998 the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum was named by the History Channel Traveler website as one of the "Top-Ten Historic Sites for Valentine's Day" that "capture romance, American-style." In 2001 [[The Pitch (newspaper)]] named Chanute, Kansas, and the museum as "Best Romantic Day Trip."

The museum is governed by a twelve-member volunteer Board of Trustees. Additionally, there are honorary trustees who help support and represent the museum. Honorary trustees include: Jack Badal, [[Robert Ballard]], [[Kevin Brownlow]], Gary K. Clarke (director emeritus of the [[Topeka Zoo]] and president of Cowabunga Safaris), [[Clive Cussler]], M. Miller Davis &amp; Ayden Mayeri, Nancy Durbin, [[Jack Hanna]], Ed Elbert (producer of, among others, ''[[The Mighty Quinn (film)|The Mighty Quinn]]''), Kelly Enright, Joyce Harrell, Dick Houston (president of Elefence International), Yvonne Houston (Osa's niece), Eleanor &amp; Pascal Imperato, Schuyler Jones, [[Nancy Landon Kassebaum Baker]], Lamont Lindstrom, Kenneth Love, Kate &amp; [[T.J. Miller]], Margaret Moore, [[Mike Resnick]], Kay &amp; [[George Schaller]], Igor Sikorsky, Jr. (son of [[Igor Sikorsky]]), Jan &amp; Romi Svatoš, [[Roy Thomas]], Mahlon Wallace III, Stan Walsh (Travel Adventure Cinema Society), Keith Wauchope ([[United States Ambassador to Gabon]], retired), Holly Wofford (Lake Paradise Entertainment producer), and Ray Woods.

Honorary trustees in memoriam include: Marianna Beach, Vern Carstens (Johnsons’ pilot), Dick Douglas, Clarke Getts (Osa’s second husband), Byron Harrell, Belle Leighty (Osa’s mother), David Martin, Douglas Oliver, C. Jackson Selsor, Kenhelm Stott, Jr. (general curator emeritus of the [[San Diego Zoo]] and trustee of the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]]), [[Lowell Thomas]], Joseph Tilton (Johnsons’ cameraman) and Helen (Joyce) &amp; George Wauchope (Helen was the Johnsons’ secretary who previously worked for Lowell Thomas).

==Sister museums – Musée de Manega and Sabah Museum==
The Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum has two international sister museums: [[Musée de Manega]] in Burkina Faso and [[Sabah Museum]] in [[Sabah]], Malaysia. These partnerships resulted from curatorial exchanges in 2000 and 2004 through the International Partnerships Among Museums program.

On February 22, 2011 the Sabah Museum opened its "Safari in Sandakan" exhibit at the Sandakan Heritage Museum in [[Sabah]], Malaysia. This exhibit covers the Johnsons' 1920 and 1935-1936 Borneo expeditions and was designed by Sabah Museum Curator Stella Moo.

The SUARA Community Filmmaking, in partnership with the Sabah Museum and the Sabah Society, has agreed on premiering the last film of Osa and Martin Johnson's last adventure in North Borneo. It was premiered on 30 September 2012 at the Borneo Eco Film Festival as it was the first time shown in Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beff.org.my/films-borneo.php#on&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge==
[[The Walt Disney Company]] was the first organization to license Johnson film from the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum for the 1976 program "Filming Nature's Mysteries." Disney again licensed Johnson film as part of the "Rafiki's Planet Watch" at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] when it opened April 22, 1998.

The architects and Disney team developing a new "[[safari lodge]]" borrowed Johnson films from the museum in 1997 and 1998 for research and inspiration. [[Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge]] opened April 16, 2001. Included is an ongoing exhibit of 36 Johnson photographs along with an original copy of Osa Johnson's 1940 autobiography ''I Married Adventure'' in the lodge's Sunset Lounge.

==Martin + Osa==
Martin and Osa Johnson were the namesake, inspiration and background story for the 2006-2010 [[Martin + Osa]] clothing line and national chain of 28 Martin + Osa stores launched by [[American Eagle Outfitters]]. Martin + Osa used references to the Johnsons on their clothing and accessories. Examples included "1910" (the year Martin and Osa married), "S-38" (refers to the Sikorsky S-38 amphibian airplane flown by the Johnsons) and "NC-52V" (the aircraft registration number of their Sikorsky S-39). In 2016 the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum acquired the Martin + Osa trademarks.

Muntz’s airship, named “Spirit of  Adventure”, sounds like a cross between the Johnsons’ “Spirit of Africa” plane and Osa’s popular ''I Married Adventure'' autobiography. A fictional poster promotes the launch of the “Spirit of Adventure” on April 25, 1934, from New York City. Coincidentally this was the starting point and the time frame of the Johnsons’ 1933-1934 “Flying Safari”. Also, the Fredricksens’ dream of a home overlooking “Paradise Falls” is reminiscent of the home the Johnsons built overlooking “Lake Paradise” or “Paradise Lake”.
*In 2005 the [http://cairocluborchestra.com/ Cairo Club Orchestra] of [[Melbourne]], Australia, revived the 1932 Congorilla Fox-Trot (inspired by the Johnsons' 1932 movie ''Congorilla'').
*Martin and Osa Johnson photographs appear in the movies ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004) and ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006) as well as the short film ''The Lost Explorer'' (2010) by [[Tim Walker]]. Johnson film segments were used in [[Su Friedrich]]'s film ''Hide and Seek'' (1996).
*In 2010 Martin and Osa Johnson were voted one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas! People ([[Kansas Sampler]] Foundation).
*Poet Elizabeth Bishop's poem "In the Waiting Room" references a picture of Martin and Osa Johnson in a February, 1918 National Geographic she read as a child.
* Martin Johnson is sarcastically referenced in "The Baby in the Icebox," a short story by James M. Cain that was first published in the American Mercury magazine in 1932.

In [[classical antiquity]], the '''muscle cuirass (Latin: lorica musculata)'''&lt;ref&gt;Also found as "muscled cuirass" or "lorica musculata". The [[contemporary Latin]] phrase ''lorica musculata'' appears not to be used among scholars, but will be found at [[Classical reenactment|reenactment]] [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22lorica+musculata%22&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;lr=&amp;ft=i&amp;cr=&amp;safe=images websites.] The word ''musculatus'' (nor any verb from which it might derive) does not exist in [[Classical Latin]], according to the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'', nor in [[late antiquity]], according to the ''Latin Dictionary'' of Lewis and Short, which includes [[patristic]] writers of the [[early Christian]] era.&lt;/ref&gt;, '''anatomical cuirass''' or '''heroic cuirass''' is a type of [[cuirass]] made to fit the wearer's torso and designed to mimic an idealized human physique. It first appears in late [[Archaic Greece]] and became widespread throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;M. Treister, "The Theme of Amazonomachy in Late Classical Toreutics: On the Phalerae from Bolshaya Bliznitsa," in ''Pontus and the Outside World: Studies in Black Sea History, Historiography, and Archaeology'' (Brill, 2004), p. 205; Charlotte R. Long, ''The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome'' (Brill, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally made from hammered [[bronze]] plate, [[boiled leather]] also came to be used. It is commonly depicted in [[ancient Greek art|Greek]] and [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]], where it is worn by generals, emperors, and deities during periods when soldiers used other types. 

In [[Roman sculpture]], the muscle cuirass is often highly ornamented with [[Greek mythology|mythological scenes]]. Archaeological finds of relatively unadorned cuirasses, as well as their depiction by artists in military scenes, indicate that simpler versions were worn in combat situations. The anatomy of muscle cuirasses intended for use might be either [[Realism (art)|realistic]] or reduced to an abstract design; the fantastically illustrated cuirasses worn by gods and emperors in Roman statues usually incorporate realistic [[nipple]]s and the [[navel]] within the scene depicted.

== Use ==
[[File:Naiskos soldiers Baltimore Painter MAN.jpg|thumb|Muscle cuirasses on a [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase]] from [[Apulia]] (c. 325 BC)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Treister, "The Theme of Amazonomachy," p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The cuirasses were cast in two pieces, the front and the back, then hammered. They were a development from the early Archaic bell-shaped cuirass, weighing about 25 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Y. Treister, ''Hammering Techniques in Greek and Roman Jewellery and Toreutics'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 115–118; Richard A. Gabriel and Karen S. Metz, ''From Sumer to Rome: The Military Capabilities of Ancient Armies'' (Greenwood, 1991), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from the 5th century BC have been found in the tombs of [[Thracians]], whose [[Thracian cavalry|cavalrymen]] wore them.&lt;ref&gt;Treister, ''Hammering Techniques'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest surviving depiction in Greek sculpture seems to be an example on a sculptural warrior's torso found on the [[acropolis of Athens]] and dating around 470 – 460 BC. The muscle cuirass is also depicted on [[Attic red-figure pottery]], which dates from around 530 BC and into the late 3rd century BC.

From around 475 to 450 BC, the muscle cuirass is shorter, covering less of the abdomen, and more nipped at the waist than in later examples. It was worn over a ''[[Chiton (costume)#Chitoniskos|chitoniskos]]''. In [[Neo-Attic|neo-Attic art]], the muscle cuirass was worn over a longer [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vergina#Archaeological finds|Tomb II at Vergina]] contained an iron muscle cuirass that was decorated with embossed gold.&lt;ref&gt;Treister, ''Hammering Techniques'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italian]] muscle cuirass lacked the shoulder-guards found on Greek examples.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sekunda, ''Republican Roman Army 200–104 BC'' (Osprey Publishing, 1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples among the [[Samnites]] and [[Oscans]] sketch a blockier torso more roughly than the anatomically realistic Greek pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Nic Fields, ''Roman Battle Tactics 390–110 BC'' (Osprey Publishing, 2010), p. 7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YJAd-soQyF8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=roman+%22muscle+cuirass%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m6LeTKzyG4nJnAefnfmaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=roman%20%22muscle%20cuirass%22&amp;f=false with images.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples come from graves in [[Campania]],&lt;ref&gt;Sekunda, ''Republican Roman Army 200–104 BC'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etruria]], and elsewhere in southern Italy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Polybius]] omits the muscle cuirass in his description of the types of armor worn by the Roman army, but archaeological finds and artistic depictions suggest that it was worn in combat. The monument of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] at [[Delphi]] shows two Roman infantrymen wearing [[Lorica hamata|mail shirts]] alongside three who wear muscle cuirasses.&lt;ref&gt;Sekunda, ''Republican Roman Army 200–104 BC'', pp. 8 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; They were worn mostly by officers, and may have been molded leather as well as metal, with fringed leather ''([[Pteruges|Pteryges]])'' at the armholes and lower edge.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The muscle cuirass is one of the elements that distinguished a senior officer's "uniform".&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Elton, "Military Forces," in ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic qualities ==
[[File:Doriphorus02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|125px|The ''Doryphoros'' of Polykleitos]]

=== ''Cuirasse esthétique'' ===
The sculptural replicating of the human body in the muscle cuirass may be inspired by the concept of [[heroic nudity]], and the development of the muscle cuirass has been linked to the idealized portraiture of the male body in Greek art.&lt;ref&gt;Jason König, ''Athletics and Literature in the Roman Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 103, providing further references in note 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kenneth Clark]] attributes the development of an idealized standard musculature, varied from the facts of nature, to [[Polykleitos]]:
{{quote|Polykleitos set himself to perfect the internal structure of the torso.  He recognized that it allowed for the creation of a sculptural unit in which the position of humps and hollows evokes some memory and yet can be made harmonious by variation and emphasis.  There is the beginning of such a system in [[:File:Torso Miletus Louvre Ma2792.jpg|the torso from Miletos]] and that of the [[Kritios Boy|Kritios youth]]; but Polykleitos' control of muscle architecture was evidently far more rigorous, and from him derives that standard schematization of the torso known in French as the ''cuirasse esthétique'', a disposition of muscles so formalized that it was in fact used in the design of armor and became for the heroic body like the masks of the antique stage.  The ''cuirasse esthétique'', which so greatly delighted the artists of the Renaissance, is one of the features of antique art that have done most to alienate modern taste.... But... we can see from certain replicas that this was originally a construction of great power.  Such is the copy of the ''[[Doryphoros]]'' in the Uffizi.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, ''The Nude'', Ch. 2, "Apollo."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Decoration ===
[[File:Athena Parthenos Louvre Ma91 n2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Gorgoneion on an Athena Parthenos]]
[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic rulers]] added divine emblems, such as thunderbolts, to the [[pteruges]].

Another conventional decoration is the [[gorgoneion]], or Medusa's head, on the upper chest, and often vegetative motifs on the pectorals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elfriede Knauer|Elfriede R. Knauer]], "''Knemides'' in the East? Some Observations on the Impact of Greek Body Armor on 'Barbarian' Tribes," in ''Nomodeiktes: Greek Studies in Honor of Martin Ostwald'' (University of Michigan Press, 1993), pp. 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the elements of iconography that identify the Greek [[Athena]] and the Roman [[Minerva]], goddesses who embodied the strategic side of warfare, was a [[breastplate]] bearing a gorgoneion (see [[Aegis]]). Other deities, particularly the [[war gods]] [[Ares]] and [[Mars (god)|Mars]], could be portrayed with muscle cuirasses.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Roman emperors ===
[[File:Augusto_di_Prima_Porta,_inv._2290,_03.jpg|thumb|150px|Muscle cuirass from the [[Augustus of Prima Porta]]]]

Among freestanding sculptures portraying [[Roman emperor]]s, a common type shows the emperor wearing a highly ornamented muscle cuirass, often with a scene from [[Roman mythology|mythology]]. Figures such as [[Nike (mythology)|winged victories]], enemies in defeat, and [[Roman virtues|virtues personified]] represent the emperor as master of the world. Symbolic arrangements this elaborate never appear on Greek cuirasses.&lt;ref&gt;Knauer in ''Nomodeiktes'' p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cuirass on the famous ''[[Augustus of Prima Porta]]'' is particularly ornate. In the center, a Roman officer is about to receive a Roman military standard ''([[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]])'' from a bearded "barbarian" who appears to be a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]. The Roman, who has a [[hound]] at his side, is most often identified as a young [[Tiberius]], and the scene is usually read as the return in 20 BC of the standards lost at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC. The anatomically realistic navel (Greek ''[[omphalos]]'', Latin ''[[wikt:umbilicus|umbilicus]]'') is placed between the two central figures, slightly below ground level in relation to the feet and centered above the [[personification]] of Earth, positioned over the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Keppie, ''The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1984), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reclining position, [[cornucopia]], and the presence of suckling babies is common to other goddesses in Augustan art who represent peace and prosperity. Other figures include a lyre-playing [[Apollo]] riding a [[griffin]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] on the back of a [[red deer|hind]], and the [[quadriga]] of the Sun at the top.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus'' (University of Michigan Press, 1988, 1990), pp. 175, 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Gugak Center''', located in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], is the primary institution of learning for Korean traditional music.

With a history dating back to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Eumseongseo|ko|3=음성서}} music institute of the [[Silla]] kingdom in the 7th century, The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts was founded under its present name in 1950.

It is dedicated to "preserving and promoting traditional Korean music."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170302033024/http://www.gugak.go.kr/eng/min/introduction.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;  Through academic courses, private study, ensembles, research, and performances, it preserves Korea's ancient musical traditions, including the ancient court ritual music called ''[[aak]]'' as well as the ritual music performed for the [[Jongmyo]] (royal ancestral shrine) and the [[Munmyo]] ([[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] shrine).

The recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry form a registry of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s selected yearly by the [[National Recording Preservation Board]] for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-home.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= Current Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislative intent of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 was to develop a national program to guard America's [[sound recording]] heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-about.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= Overview |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&lt;ref name="NRPB"/&gt; Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.

The first four yearly lists each included 50 selections. However, since 2006, 25 recordings have been selected annually. Thus, a total of 500 recordings have been preserved in the Registry {{as of|2017|lc=on}}. Each calendar year, public nominations are accepted for inclusion in that year's list of selections to be announced the following spring. Nominations are made in the following categories:

{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Blues
* Broadway/Musical Theatre/Soundtrack
* Cajun/Zydeco/"Swamp"
* Children's recordings
* Choral
* Classical
* Comedy/Novelty
* Country/Bluegrass
* Documentary/Broadcast/Spoken Word
* Environmental
* Field
* Folk/Ethnic
* Gospel/Spiritual
* Heavy metal
* Jazz
* Latin
* Pop (pre-1955)
* Pop (post-1955)
* R&amp;B
* Radio
* Rap/Hip-hop
* Rock
* Technology
{{div col end}}

Each yearly list has often included a few recordings that have also been selected for inclusion in the holdings of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]' audiovisual collection. Those recordings on the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry that are of a political nature will tend to overlap with the audiovisual collection of the National Archives. The list shows overlapping items and whether the National Archives has an original or a copy of the recording.

==Selection criteria==
The criteria for selection are as follows:&lt;ref name="NRRC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-nrr.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= National Recording Registry Criteria |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recordings selected for the National Recording Registry are those that are culturally, historically or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.
* For the purposes of recording selection, "sound recordings" are defined as works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sound component of a moving image work, unless it is available as an autonomous sound recording or is the only extant component of the work.
* Recordings may be a single item or group of related items; published or unpublished; and may contain music, non-music, spoken word, or broadcast sound.
* Recordings will not be considered for inclusion into the National Recording Registry if no copy of the recording exists.
* No recording should be denied inclusion into the National Recording Registry because that recording has already been preserved.
* No recording is eligible for inclusion into the National Recording Registry until ten years after the recording's creation.

==2002==
On January 27, 2003, the following 50 selections were announced by the National Recording Preservation Board.&lt;ref name="NRR2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2002reg.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= The National Recording Registry 2002 |date=December 6, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
{{As of|2014}}, the oldest recording on the list is [[Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville]]'s [[Phonautograms]] which date back to 1853. The most recent is ''[[Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman]]'' by [[Joan Tower]], performed by the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Marin Alsop]], which was released in 1999.&lt;ref name="NRPB2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-masterlist.html |publisher=[[The Library of Congress]] |title= Full Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selections vary widely in duration. Both the early Edison recordings and the instrumental "[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]" by [[Link Wray]], as well as "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley and His Comets]] clock in at under three minutes; the Edison Talking Doll cylinder is only 17 seconds long and some of Scott de Martinville's Photoautograms are just as brief. Meanwhile, [[Georg Solti]]'s recording of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s complete ''[[Ring Cycle]]'' is approximately 15 hours in duration and [[Alexander Scourby]]'s recitation of the [[King James Bible]] is over 80 hours in length.&lt;ref name="NRPB2"/&gt;

==History==
The Nationality Room Program was founded by [[Ruth Crawford Mitchell]] at the request of Pitt [[John Gabbert Bowman|Chancellor John Bowman]] in 1926 in order to involve the community as much as he could in constructing the [[Cathedral of Learning]] and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that what would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to the nationality communities that made up the Pittsburgh area to provide a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group had to form a Room Committee, which would be responsible for all fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The University provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, "...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/pages/about_nr.html |title=The Nationality Rooms: about nationality rooms |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028112138/http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/pages/about_nr.html |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each room's detail is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates, door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials.  Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the Cathedral.  A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965, when current Director E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion (so far) of eight additional rooms on the third floor.

A typical room on the 1st floor (those built between 1938 and 1957) took between three and ten years to complete, and would have cost the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|2006|r=0}}}} USD today, which was no small undertaking, especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]].  More recent rooms have cost in the range of $750,000 USD and up and taken up to ten years to complete.&lt;ref name=plannedrooms&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2015/06/17/Other-Nationality-Rooms-in-the-works/stories/201506170002|title=Other Nationality Rooms in the works|first=Caelin|last=Miltko|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 21, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620025447/http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2015/06/17/Other-Nationality-Rooms-in-the-works/stories/201506170002|archivedate=June 20, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon completion of their rooms, the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad.  The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events, lectures, concerts, exhibits, social events, and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms.  The committee may use its room for non-political meetings, lectures, or other functions if no classes are scheduled. Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees, and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for the [[Hillman Library|University libraries]], publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes, and the fostering of courses in the mother languages.  National, traditional, and religious holidays are celebrated on campus, and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions.

Original plans also proposed, in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor, the creation of "[[Pennsylvania]]" classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor "Pittsburgh" classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of the [[Western Pennsylvania]] or different eras of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=Classrooms;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a429842m;didno=00a429842m;view=image;seq=0032;node=00a429842m%3A14 |title=Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning |pages=30, 1933 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819190641/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=Classrooms;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a429842m;didno=00a429842m;view=image;seq=0032;node=00a429842m:14 |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A5;view=image;seq=0047 |title=Classrooms in the Cathedral of Learning |pages=19, 1944? |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up, only one room was installed, the [[Nationality Rooms#Early American|Early American]] Classroom, which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms. The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed, and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor.

[[File:English Room - Pitt - IMG 0501.jpg|thumb|right|The English Classroom, the largest of the 30 Nationality Rooms, contains several artifacts from the original second [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]]]
Upon completion of a room, a dedication ceremony is held in which a formal presentation of a ceremonial key is presented to the University's Chancellor in order to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift with a commitment on behalf of the University to maintain the room in perpetuity. The particular nationality room committee's officers then become active members of the Nationality Council which focuses on providing summer study abroad scholarships for Pitt students along with other non-political cultural or educational events within the Nationality Program's scope. Today the Cathedral is home to 30 Nationality Rooms (28 working classrooms and two display rooms: the [[Nationality Rooms#Early American|Early American]] Room and the [[Syria-Lebanon Room|Syrian-Lebanon]] Room), on the first and third floors. Each nationality room is designed to celebrate a different culture that had an influence on Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to 1787, the University's founding and the signing of the [[United States Constitution]]. Only one room does not follow this convention, with the [[Nationality Rooms#French|French]] Classroom depicting the French Empire period of the early 19th century. There are currently seven additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded.

Set in the Cathedral of Learning's cornerstone in 1937 is a gift from the Nationality Room Committee chairpersons to the University: a copper plate engraved with these thoughts:

:''Faith and peace are in their hearts. Good will has brought them together. Like the [[Magi]] of ancestral traditions and the shepherds of candid simplicity, they offer their gifts of what is precious, genuine and their own, to truth that shines forever and enlightens all people.''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Since 1944, tours of the nationality rooms have been given to visitors by a Pitt student organization, [[Quo Vadis]] (meaning ''Where do you go?''); they guide over 40,000 tourists a year. With reservations, specially themed tours based on creature symbolism, images of royalty, and folktales are also given. An estimated 100,000 visitors, including self-guided and walk-in tourists, visit the Nationality Rooms each year.

==Principles==
[[File:Indianroom2.jpg|thumb|The Indian Classroom, opened in 2000, is one of the newer Nationality Rooms that continue to be installed on the third floor]]
The following principles, in order to assure commonality of purpose, authenticity, and non-political cultural emphasis, governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957.
*A Nationality Room must illustrate one of the outstanding architectural or design traditions of a nation that is recognized as such by the [[United States Department of State]].
*The design of a given historical period must be cultural and aesthetic, not political.  The period depicted should be prior to 1787, the year the University was founded.
*To avoid political implications in the room, no political symbol is permitted in the decorations, nor a portrait or likeness of any living person.
*The only place a political symbol may be used is in the corridor stone above the room's entrance.
*No donor recognition may appear in the rooms. Donor recognition to the rooms is recorded in a Donor Book.
*Most architects and designers of the rooms have been born and educated abroad.  This has been instrumental in ensuring authenticity of design.

In the 1970s, policy revisions  were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles, utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life.  This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room.

The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tablet-armed seats, professor's lectern or table, adequate sight lines and lighting, modern audiovisual technology, and other necessities of a classroom.  New rooms also have narrated tour equipment. Materials are to remain authentic and durable  that are executed through architectural form and not mere surface embellishment and are to provide eternal qualities that have the potential to "teach" about the cultures  with appropriate non-political symbols and artifacts.

The [[Africa]]n Heritage Classroom was designed to reflect an 18th-century [[Ashanti people|Asante]] temple courtyard in [[Ghana]] which would provide the setting for ceremonial events, learning, and worship.  The classroom represents the entire continent of Africa with [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-style door carvings by Nigerian sculptor Lamidi O. Fakeye depicting ancient kingdoms of Africa including [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Benin]], [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]]/[[Angola]], [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]], [[Mali]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Plaster forms in the [[frieze]] represent the arts, music, science, languages, and literature of Africa. A [[display case]] housing artifacts from various African nations and the chalkboard area reflect [[patos]] around the courtyard. Below the chalkboard doors depicting the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lozenge and star motif are [[Sankofa]] birds which symbolize the need to learn from the past in order to prepare for the future.  The oxblood steps, two levels of student benches, and [[wainscot]] with relief decorations suggest the polished clay of an Asante temple.  Openwork screens are present on the windows as they are used in Asante structures to filter the sun's rays while allowing air flow.  Six chieftain stools provide informal seating near a hand-carved professor's lectern.

The design consists of intersecting arches and a domed ceiling built to lessen damage from frequent earthquakes in that country. The room's arches, built of Indiana limestone, make this the heaviest of the Nationality Rooms, weighing 22 tons, and required the second floor beneath the room to be reinforced in order to support its weight. The cornerstone is a [[basalt]] stone from the grounds of Sanahin. In the mortar behind it are the thumbprints of five of the oldest Armenian [[diaspora]] living in the Pittsburgh area, as well as the handprint of an infant of Armenian descent, symbolizing the continuity of the Armenian presence in western Pennsylvania.

The [[Austria]]n Nationality Room represents the 18th-century era of the Austrian Empire during its age of enlightenment under Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and incorporates [[Baroque]] elements of the [[Schloss Esterházy#The Haydnsaal|Haydnsaal]] in [[Schloss Esterházy]] at [[Eisenstadt]] where [[Joseph Haydn]] served as [[Kapellmeister]] from 1766 to 1778.  Ceiling paintings depict scenes from Roman mythology similar to those in the Haydnsaal.  The room features Lobmeyer crystal chandeliers, gilded white lacquer seminar furniture patterned after that in the formal dining hall of [[Vienna|Vienna's]] [[Hofburg]], royal red-tapestried walls, gold-leafed [[pilasters]], and a parquet floor inlaid in a starburst design.

The [[China|Chinese]] Classroom is inspired by the design of a palace hall in [[Beijing|Beijing's]] [[Forbidden City]] and is dedicated to the memory of [[Confucius]] and his democratic ideal of classless education. The teacher and students sit at the same level around a moon-shaped teakwood table.  The professor's chair is carved with the admonition to "Teach by inspiring gradually and steadily". A slate portrait of Confucius is present that is patterned after one in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|Confucian temple]] at his birthplace of [[Qufu]] in [[Shandong]] [[Province (China)|Province]].  Above the red lacquered door, Chinese characters are carved into the stone lintel that proclaim that "Humility of mind goes with loftiness of character." Stone lions flank the entrance before carvings of the plum blossom, the national flower of China. The ceiling contains a coiling golden five-clawed imperial dragon surrounded by clouds denoting nature's energy and freedom.  Painted squares portray dragons guarding the pearl of wisdom and the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] with the motan flower, a symbol of cultural wealth.  The opened blackboard doors reveal painted renditions of the babao, or [[Eight Treasures]], popular in [[Chinese art]].  On the base below is a carved version of the [[Bagua (concept)|Bagua]] which consists of eight trigrams surrounding the circular [[Yin and Yang]].

The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Classroom combines elements of a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] farmhouse, country church, and the [[Charles University in Prague]] while detailing men who contributed to Czechoslovak culture. The motto of the classroom, and of the former [[Czechoslovak government in exile]], is proclaimed by the inscription of "Pravda Vítězí" which translates to "Truth Will Prevail" and surrounds a bronze relief portrait of the first President and founder of Czechoslovakia [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]].  In a wrought-iron case near the window bay, a letter penned by the hand of Masaryk to students at the University of Pittsburgh recalls [[John Amos Comenius|John Amos Comenius']] belief that "education is the workshop of humanity".  All woodwork, except the furniture, is made of [[larch]] wood which grows to great heights in the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The ceiling, with flat boards overlapping each other between heavy beams, is painted by [[Prague]] artists Karel and Marie Svolinsky and depicts botanically accurate flowers and plants of Czechoslovakia and reflects a typical Slovak farmer's home and the style of country churches.

The plaster reveals of the bay window area is decorated by murals of miraculous trees bearing flowers and fruits and harboring animals, birds, and insects reflecting "peasant writings" and executed by the artists in freehand.  Ceiling panels portray eight famous persons in [[Czechs|Czech]] and Slovak history from the 9th through 19th centuries including [[Cyril and Methodius]] who created the [[Cyrillic script]], [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Waclaw]] who was the "[[Good King Wenceslaus]]" of the [[Christmas Carol]], [[Jan Hus]] who was a champion of [[Czech people|Czech]] religious freedom, [[John Amos Comenius]] who is considered the father of modern education, [[Jan Kollar]] a Slovak poet who called for [[Slavic people|Slavic]] unity, [[Ľudovít Štúr]] who developed the Slovak literary language, and Bishop Stefan Moyzes who pioneered popular education in [[Slovakia]]. [[Intarsia]] done by V. Kopka of [[Moravia]] are found on the entrance door panels and the professor's desk and lectern which depicts university academic disciplines.

The [[Colonial history of the United States|Early American]] Room is one of two display rooms not used as a functional classroom, although it is opened for guided tours.  The room was commissioned by longtime University Pittsburgh trustee [[George Hubbard Clapp]], a descendant nine generations removed from Roger Clapp, an English captain who sailed into the [[New England]] port of [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]] on May 30, 1630. The kitchen-living room of the early colonists was chosen to portray the sturdy simplicity of life in America during the 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks;cc=pittyearbooks;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=engineering%20building;rgn=full%20text;idno=1955e49702;didno=1955e49702;node=1955e49702%3A9;view=image;seq=54;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |title=The Owl, 1955, pg. 39, Documenting Pitt, University of Pittsburgh Digital Archive |publisher=Digital.library.pitt.edu:80 |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819190739/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks;cc=pittyearbooks;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=engineering%20building;rgn=full%20text;idno=1955e49702;didno=1955e49702;node=1955e49702:9;view=image;seq=54;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The room's focus is a nine-foot fireplace constructed from 200-year-old handmade bricks with "fixings" of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, longhandled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles, and forks.

The [[England|English]] Classroom is designed in the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]]-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style after the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that was rebuilt by [[Sir Charles Barry]] following the fire of 1834.  The English Classroom is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and incorporates several original items given as gifts from the [[British Government]] from the damaged House of Commons, whose Chamber was completely destroyed, following its bombing by the Luftwaffe in 1941, including the stone fireplace, [[hearth]] tiles, [[linenfold]] [[oak]] paneling, entrance doorframe, [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]], and [[corbels]].  The fireplace is from the Commons' "Aye Lobby", so named because members walk through it to vote "yes" to a bill, and is marked with the initials V.R. for [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria Regina]]. The [[cast-iron]] [[Fireplace fireback|fireback]] and andirons commemorate the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 and an inscription above the fireplace is from [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Richard II (play)|King Richard II]]'' and uses lettering adapted from the letter tiles originally designed for medieval paving by the Monks of [[Chertsey Abbey]] in [[Surrey]]. The inscription reads: "Set in the silver sea.....this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England." Above the doorway hangs a royal [[coat of arms]] made in 1688 during the reign of [[James II of England|King James II]]. The linenfold paneling itself arrived at the University still having a blackened coat from the bombing.&lt;ref name="Mike Wereschagin"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_457452.html |author = Mike Wereschagin| title = Celebration of Nations | work = [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] | date = 2006-06-10 | accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the ceiling trusses are four carved [[limestone]] corbels from the House of Commons that are carved with a [[Tudor rose]].  Two corbels remain uncarved to emphasize the original carved corbels. The window frames, set in limestone, are characteristic of the Tudor period, and contain old imported glass, seeded and tinted, and encased in small, diamond-shaped leaded frames.  [[Stained-glass]] window medallions depict the coats of arms of English towns and cities, literary and political figures, scholars of the Universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and the Houses of [[House of Lords|Lords]] and Commons.  Portraits of University of Pittsburgh alumnus and former Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]]&lt;!-- "St. James's" is spelled correctly; check the spelling note in the link.

A brick from [[10 Downing Street]] serves as the room's [[cornerstone]].  The [[white oak]] floor is fitted together with wooden peg [[dowels]]. Tudor-Gothic oak benches resemble the old House of Commons benches and are similarly arranged. Two English oak tables with melon-shaped legs stand before the bay.  Two House of Commons Library chairs upholstered in green leather and bearing the official gold crest featuring the [[portcullis]] and crown were a gift of [[Alfred Bossom, Baron Bossom|Lord Alfred Bossom]] and were rebuilt using wood from actual chairs in the bombed House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/england/engl.html | title = English Nationality Room | work = University of Pittsburgh Website | date = | accessdate = 2007-07-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118101925/http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/england/engl.html | archivedate = 2008-01-18 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849970166/ | title = flickr: Cathedral of Learning 300 | date = July 2005 | accessdate = 2008-08-10 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160723000454/https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849970166/ | archivedate = 2016-07-23 | df   =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The [[France|French]] Classroom was designed by [[Jacques Carlu]], Director of [[Fontainebleau Schools|School of Architecture]] in [[Fontainebleau]], in the [[First French Empire|French Empire Period]] that reflects a French style inspired by the glories of the ancient and classical past that were rediscovered during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] campaigns in [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Egypt]]. This places the timeframe of inspiration for the classroom in the late 18th century and early 19th century, just after the founding of the University of Pittsburgh in 1787, therefore making it the only classroom which represents an era postdating the founding of the University, although many room elements are influenced by the [[Palace of Versailles]] which clearly predates it.  The color scheme of the room is blue-gray, royal blue, and gold, which were suggested by French-American architect [[Paul Philippe Cret]] and are typical colors used at the height of the French Empire. The walls of the room are lined with wood paneling in classical proportions, and slender wall [[pilasters]] are capped with delicately carved ad gilded crowns. Carved ornaments of the Egyptian [[griffin]] and classical rosettes accentuate panel divisions.  A wall cabinet containing art objects, books, and medallions balances the entrance door and maintains the room's symmetry.  Crystal and metal chandeliers, which are simplified versions of those found in Palace of Versailles' [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]], hang from a grey plaster ceiling. A parquet floor pattern also reflects many rooms in the Palace of Versailles. A [[mahogany]] professor's chair and table are of the [[Directoire|Directoire period]] design include bronze ornaments imported from France that are replicas of originals of Empire furniture in the [[Louvre]].  The mahogany student tablet armchairs are upholstered in royal blue. On the rear wall, a 16th-century Choufleur [[tapestry]] depicts an allegorical woodland scene including, among other animals, a [[unicorn]] which often served as a central figure in tapestries and legends from the [[Middle Ages]].  Gold [[damask]] draperies with a wreath and [[lyre]] motif add to the sense of French opulence and frame the windows which look out on the University's [[Heinz Memorial Chapel]], itself an example of French [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic architecture]] inspired by the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=English%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;view=image;seq=0063;node=00a872842m%3A6 |author=Ruth Crawford Mitchell |title=The French Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1944 |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germany|German]] Classroom was designed by German-born architect Frank A. Linder to reflect the 16th century [[German Renaissance]] as exemplified in the Alte Aula (Great Hall) of the [[University of Heidelberg]]. The woodwork of the room was done by German-born [[Philadelphia]] decorator Gustav Ketterer and includes [[walnut]] paneling framing the blackboards, columns carved with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s flanking the two entrance doorways, and support broken-arch [[pediments]] surmounted by carved polychromed crests of the two oldest German universities: Heidelberg (1386) and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (1409). The doors are mounted with ornate [[wrought-iron]] hinges and locks, and their upper panels are decorated with [[intarsia]] depicting the central square of [[Nürnberg]] on the front door and the fountain of [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber|Rothenburg]] on the rear door. Carved in the [[architrave]] above the paneling are the names of famous speaking philosophers, poets, musicians, artists, and scientists. The intarsia doors of the four corner cabinets feature tales from German folklore including [[Percival|Parsifal]] who searched for the [[Holy Grail]], [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] who was the hero of the [[Nibelungenlied]], the maiden wooed in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] poem ''[[Heidenröslein]]'', and [[Lorelei]] who was the golden-haired [[Rhine]] maiden whose song lured sailors to destruction. Painted on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] above the front blackboard are words from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''Das Ideal und das Leben'', "Stern endeavor, which no arduous task can shake, to the hidden fount of true attains." The rear wall has a quotation from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''Was wir bringen'' which reads: "Great mastery results from wise restraint, and law alone points the way to liberty." Furniture includes the professor's leather upholstered chair stands on a small platform behind a burled walnut table and student tablet armchairs are walnut with  scroll backs. Wrought-iron chandeliers are the work of German craftsman.  The display case contains gifts of artworks and books from Germany's Ministry of Education. The [[stained-glass]] windows were designed by master stained glass artist [[Charles Connick]], however they were not completed until 1953 by Connick protege Frances Van Arsdale Skinner.&lt;ref name="Connickwindows" /&gt; The windows depict characters in the [[Grimm Brothers|Grimm Brothers']] fairy tales such as [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], and [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=English%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A7;view=image;seq=0079 |title=The German Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning |year=1941 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The room's columns and pilasters, as well as the coffered ceiling, bear painted decorations identical to those used on ancient Greek structures. The artwork was done by Athenian artist Demetrios Kokotsis who used the traditional [[encaustic painting]] method, employing earth colors and beeswax applied freehand which was then overlaid with 24-carat gold leaf rubbed on by polishing bones which required two men more than seven months to complete. White oak furniture, patterned after designs on Greek vases, is decorated with gold-leaf carvings and sunburst inlays of ebony. Student chair backs carry the names of Greek islands and towns. The professor's and guests' chairs bear the names of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Socrates]]. A line from [[Homer|Homer's]] [[Iliad]] exhorts students to strive for nobility and excellence. The deep red wall color is repeated in the drapery valance with its Greek key design. Archives in the alcove cabinet record visits by the Queen of Greece, and by ecclesiastic and diplomatic officials.  In 1940, one of two marble [[pilasters]] for the room that was being constructed in Greece from the [[Penteli|Mt Pentele]] stone quarry used to build the [[Parthenon]], cracked shortly before shipping to the United States. With an invading [[World War II]] army massing on its borders, the column could not be replaced. Greek architect John Travlos ordered a matching crack etched into the undamaged column in order to preserve the symmetry. The marble was transported on the last ship to sail to America prior to the invasion and occupation of Greece. In November 1941, Travlos crouched under a blanket in his apartment closet listening to banned [[BBC]] radio broadcasts. Suddenly, Greek ecclesiastical music spouted from the radio, and Travlos heard the people of Pittsburgh dedicate his memorial to Greece.&lt;ref name="Mike Wereschagin"/&gt;

[[Dénes Györgyi]], a professor at the Industrial Art School in [[Budapest]], won the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Classroom design competition sponsored by Hungary's Ministry of Education in 1930 which features [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] folk art combined with deep wood carvings and historic stained glass windows.  The walls of the room are [[oak]] veneer stained a soft tobacco brown.  The wood in the panels was carefully selected and matched, so that the natural grains form interesting decorative patterns.  The ceiling is 70 wooden cazettas suspended in a wooden frame and has a predominant hue of "[[paprika]] red", a color inspired by the peppers which are hung to dry over white fences in Hungary.  The cazettas are decorated with folk motifs (birds, hearts, and [[tulips]]) in turquoise, green, and white were painted by Antal Diossy in Budapest.  Joining the ceiling and walls is an inscription frieze with the first two stanzas of ''[[Himnusz]]'', the Hungarian National Anthem by [[Ferenc Kölcsey]]. Above the blackboard is the coat of arms of the University of Buda which was founded in 1388.  At the top is the crown of [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]], the patron saint of Hungary and its first Christian king.  The student seats are made of oak and are unadorned except for stylized carved tulip ornaments on the back.  A bench along the rear wall and guest chairs are upholstered in blue.  Along the corridor wall, panels carved with floral, plant, and bird designs invoke a "tulip chest" which are the traditional hope chests of Hungarian village brides that are decorated with tulips.  In the display case lined with soft blue velvet is an exhibit of Hungarian porcelain, lace, embroidery, and costumed dolls.  Stained and painted glass windows depict the legend of Hungary's founding as well as important events in the nation's history and culture. The rear window depicts [[King Nimrod]] and his sons, [[Hunor and Magor]], who pursued a white stag from the east to the fertile [[Danube]] plain. Descendants of Hunor became the [[Huns]] and those of Magor became the Magyars. The bay windows commemorate historic figures and events of the [[Middle Ages]], [[Renaissance]], and 17th and 19th centuries. The oak entrance doors bears deep carvings of tulips, [[pomegranate]] leaves, daisies, and wheat.  The door's center panel states the date of the room's completion in 1938. The carvings were made by American wood carvers of Hungarian birth from [[plaster]] models that were made in Budapest to ensure Magyar authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[India]]n Classroom is modeled on a typical 4th-9th century AD courtyard from  [[Nalanda University]], a [[Buddhist]] monastic university in [[Nalanda]].  At its peak, the university's five temples and 11 monasteries covered {{convert|32|acre|m2}} and attracted thousands of students from all over [[Asia]]. The room depicts a classroom courtyard at Nalanda. The pale rose bricks, specially fabricated to reflect the hue and texture of the original, form the walls, floor, pilasters, and niches. Six stone columns decorated with rosettes, swags, and fruit echo those found at Nalanda. The rear sculpture wall, a scaled down version of one at Nalanda's [[Stupa]] #3, bears images of six [[Bodhisattvas]]. Flanking display cases hold replicas of ancient bronze sculptures found at the site. A watercolor [[triptych]] depicts male and female students at Nalanda as scholar-monk Silabhadra says farewell to 7th-century Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]].

Adapted from [[Killeshin]] Chapel in [[County Carlow]], the triangular doorway gable is carved with human and animal masks against a background of zig-zag and beaded designs. The blackboard frame's pendental arches are carved with foliage, images of wolfhounds, and stylized cat masks. On the opposite wall a sculptured stone chest, under a monumental recessed arch, is patterned after a bishop's tomb in [[Rock of Cashel|Cormac's chapel]]. Its ornate sculpture depicts the "Great Beast," a greyhound-like animal wreathed in [[interlace (visual arts)|interlaced ornaments]]. On the chest rests a replica of the Gospels from the [[Book of Kells]]. The wrought-iron case bears bird and beast designs drawn from the Book of Kells.  Stained-glass windows, created in 1956/7 by the Harry Clarke Studios in Dublin, portray famous teachers at three of Ireland's oldest centers of learning; [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finnian]] at [[Clonard, County Meath|Clonard]], [[Columba|St. Columkille]] at [[Derry]], and [[Mo Chutu of Lismore|St. Carthach]] at [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hayden |editor1-first=James J. |date=1957 |title=The Irish Room in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;type=simple;q1=nationality%20rooms;sort=datea;rgn=subject;view=image;seq=12;idno=31735051653701;didno=31735051653701;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |location=Pittsburgh |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |page=10 |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illuminations in the Book of Kells inspired the chair design, except for the wolfhound heads.

The [[Israel]] Heritage Classroom reflects the simplicity of a 1st-century [[Galilee|Galilean]] stone dwelling or house of assembly, this room's benches are patterned after those in the 2nd-3rd-century [[synagogue]] of [[Capernaum]]. The [[Ten Commandments]], carved in [[Hebrew]], grace the [[oak]] entrance door.  Grapes, [[pomegranates]], and [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] on the stone [[frieze]], copied from Capernaum, represent crops grown in the Galilee. On the window wall, an inscription discovered in the 6th-century [[Rehob]] synagogue cites the [[Talmudic law]]s governing the growing of crops each seventh year. A scroll fragment in the rear case replicates the [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll]] segment which contains the prophecy "They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks..." Ancient wine jars flank the scroll. The professor's table, based on one found in Jerusalem's 1st-century burnt house, stands before a copy of the only existing stone [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] which served as a functional [[candelabrum]]. The quotation on the chair reads: "I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils." Three segments from the 6th-century [[Dura Europos]] murals grace the chalkboard doors, [[Ezra|Ezra the Scribe]], reads the law; [[Moses]] brings forth water for the 12 tribes; and the sons of [[Aaron]] consecrate the Temple.  Oak benches bear the names of the 12 tribes of Israel. The floor mosaic replicates one in the 6th century Galilean synagogue of [[Beit Alfa|Beth Alpha]].

The [[Italy|Italian]] Classroom reflects the serenity of a 15th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] monastery, with its traditional devotion to religion, art, music, and education. The rear choir stall bench and shuttered windows introduce the monastic theme. The blackboard doors recall an ''armadio'', a cabinet behind an altar used to hold priestly vestments. The turquoise ''soffitto a cassettoni'' ([[coffered ceiling]]), embellished with carved, gold-leafed rosettes, was inspired by one originally in the San Domenico Convent at [[Pesaro]]. In the [[architrave]], names of famous Italians are inlaid in olive wood. The lettering resembles that used in the inscription on the [[Arch of Titus]] in [[Rome]]. Bay benches are cushioned in red velvet. The red tile floor is set in a herring-bone pattern similar to that of [[Florence|Florence's]] [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. An original Florentine fireplace, made of sandstone from the quarries of [[Fiesole]], bears the carved [[Latin]] inscription, "O Lord, do not forsake me." On either side stand [[X-chair|Savonarola chairs]]. Monastery bench designs, adapted for student use, are carved with names and founding dates of Italian universities. The oldest is the [[University of Bologna]], established in 1088. From the front of the room, a bronze bust of [[Dante Alighieri]] faces Giovanni Romagnoli's mural of [[Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia]], the first woman in the world to achieve a university degree when she was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1678  by the [[University of Padua]].

The [[Japan]]ese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, evoking the mid-18th century [[minka]] which were houses of the non-ruling classes of Japan. This room is representative of minka that might be the residence of an important village leader in a farm village on the outskirts of [[Kyoto]] and the design represents the core rooms of the house: a plank-floored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma, an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entry-way, for cooking and as a work space. The doma was also a space for household life, where farm, business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof. In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather. A central feature of the room is the massive, rough-hewn beam, the ushibari of Japanese [[pine]], supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room.  The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature. To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post, the daikokubashira, the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the building's existing superstructure. The major posts are made of [[zelkova]], ([[keyaki]]), a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern. The other beams are made of American pine. The posts and beams are connected without nails, using traditional joinery techniques. The ceiling is of [[bamboo]] with joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below.  The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls  through the use of textured wallpaper and  wooden [[wainscoting]] for greater durability. The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji, sliding doors of lattice frames, covered with translucent paper. The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room.  The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the ima's wooden floor. Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor, this feature has been eliminated in the classroom for practicality.  Located on the rear wall, is the [[tokonoma]], a raised alcove for the display of treasured objects, flower arrangements, and seasonal decorations. The tokonoma has been built in shoin-style, with shôji along its exterior side. The corner post, tokobashira, is made of [[ebony]] and the floor of the tokonoma is [[tatami]]. The display cases at the rear of the room and along the interior wall contain artifacts in keeping with the period and include a [[chagama]] and [[furo]], an iron kettle with metal charcoal hearth/brazier combination, used in the "tea ceremony." While typical minka would have no chairs at all, in keeping with its function as a classroom, the classroom has wooden chairs designed and crafted specifically for students and are consistent in design with the rest of the room. Sliding wooden panels cover the blackboard at the front of the room. The interior surface of the entry door has been modified with a wooden treatment that suggests the sliding door that was the typical entrance to a house of this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/countries/japan.html |title=Marie Mazzocco, The Japanese Nationality Room, 1999-05-26 |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209004337/http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/countries/japan.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lithuania]]n Classroom is dominated by a fresco depicting [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis|Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis']] famous painting ''The Two Kings'' portrays the reverence Lithuanians have for their villages. This mural sets the tone for a room that pays tribute to the symbolism and love of nature and home reflected in Lithuanian folk art. The door's wooden planks are laid in a diamond pattern similar to those of many farm structures. At the center of the door is a carved rosette, symbol of fire. Above the entrance, a stylized sun between two horses' heads represents light and sound believed to ward off evil spirits. The [[white oak]] molding of intersecting [[scallops]] resembles decorations found on farm granaries or kleitis. Names of famous Lithuanians are carved on the frieze above the blackboard. The wall fabric is linen woven in a design called "The Path of the Birds." Its frame is of white oak and rare [[bog oak]] that acquires its deep hue while submerged in a marshy bog for decades. Lithuanian farmers would thus preserve prime trees in order to make furniture pieces that were treasured as heirlooms. The professor's desk is modeled after a household table and the lectern incorporates details of a spinning wheel spindle. Student chairs are carved with a design found on household utensils. The radiator enclosure is perforated with a design of wild [[rue]] leaves, the [[Lithuanian national emblem]]. Traditionally, a bride is crowned with a wreath of rue, symbol of chastity. Windows of handpressed glass bear leaded medallions in the form of sun ornaments often found on roadside shrines.

The [[Norway|Norwegian]] Classroom was designed in [[Oslo]] in an 18th-century peasant style using Norwegian building techniques, painted decoration, and craftsmanship by architect Georg Eliassen just prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Plans for the room were sent on the last ship to leave [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] for the [[United States]] where they were completed by University Architect Albert A. Klimcheck.  Walls of the main space are paneled with vertical overlapping [[spruce]] boards hand-rubbed with wax.  The walls in the front of the room are painted a soft blue and decorated with floral designs reminiscent of the 18th century [[rosemaling]] technique.

Because living and bedrooms were often merged into one room during this era, two of the panels swing open as if they would reveal traditional built-in-beds, but instead conceal the blackboard. The room features high-sloped ceilings reflective of those in [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] peasant homes that keep snow from accumulating during the severe winters. Spruce boards are laid in a herringbone pattern slanting upward to a plane of flat boards decorated by two hand-carved, painted rosettes with a symbol for the [[midnight sun]].  Wooden chandeliers bearing a painted design incorporating "1945", the year the room was opened, hang from the flat surfaces.  The professor's section of the room has a low raftered ceiling.

The transition between the two parts of the room is indicated by a corner kleberstone fireplace in which [[birch]] logs were burned standing on end to assure that smoke would rise up the chimney.  Windows are of handmade opalescent glass tinted pale yellow.  Since a bay window is not a [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian]] tradition, the area is plastered, paved with [[slate]], and treated as a traditional alcove. The student tablet armchairs are low-backed and the professor's chair is of a typical [[Viking]] design with carved heads of beasts and an intertwining dragon motif that traditionally serves as a symbol that protects against evil.

The room features a century-old [[grandfather clock]] with an engraved dial and a case that is painted to match the wall decorations of the smaller room.  Above the rear wall bench and flanked by corner [[display cabinet]]s decorated with rosemaling, hangs a framed copy of a 1695 Norwegian woolen [[tapestry]] depicting the [[Biblical]] parable of the five wise and five foolish virgins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849173165/sizes/l/ |title=Norwegian Room: Cathedral of Learning 345, 2005-07 |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904054553/https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849173165/sizes/l/ |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poland|Polish]] Classroom was inspired by rooms in [[Cracow|Cracow's]] [[Wawel Castle]], for centuries the residence of kings. The Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and the science that his theories revolutionized, are also a major theme of the room. A replica of the famous [[Jan Matejko]] portrait of Copernicus shows him as a young man pursuing his study of the universe from a workshop on the roof of his uncle's house in Allenstein ([[Olsztyn]]). In the bay stands an enlarged replica of the 16th-century [[Jagiellonian globe]], one of the oldest existing globes to depict [[North America]] as a separate continent. The original globe was only eight inches high and was designed to operate as a clock and calendar and it took a [[metalsmith]] in Cracow five years to complete the large globe in this room.

Artists from Cracow also came to Pittsburgh to paint the ceiling of {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} beams with informal geometric [[Renaissance]] decorations. The room is illuminated by a bronze chandelier bearing a stylized [[Polish eagle]]. The [[walnut]] seminar table was copied from one in a state dining room at Wawel Castle. The windows combine hexagonal handmade [[roundels]], similar to those in Wawel Castle, with stained-glass coats of arms representing Polish institutions of higher education. The cornerstone is a fragment of Gothic cornice preserved from the [[Collegium Maius]] (1369), the ancient [[Jagiellonian Library]]. Poland's music is represented by the original manuscript of [[Ignace Paderewski]]'s only opera, ''[[Manru]]'', which is displayed in the archive cabinet.

The [[Romania]]n Classroom was designed in [[Bucharest]] by Nicolae Ghica-Budeşti. The carved doorframe is characteristic of stone thresholds of Romanian monasteries and is made is of American [[limestone]] selected due to its similarity to Romanian limestone used in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|royal palace]] at Bucharest. The entrance door of the Romanian Classroom is ornately carved [[oak]] reminiscent of [[Byzantine churches (buildings)|Byzantine churches]] in Romania. The words of [[Vasile Alecsandri]], one of the greatest Romanian poets of the 19th century, are carved overhead in the stone door frame from his ''Ode to the Year 1855'': "The Romanian is like the mighty rock which amidst the waves of the stormy and majestic sea forever remains unmoved." The floor is laid in square blocks of pink [[marble]] imported from quarries at Ruşchiţa. The black boards are set in arched oak panels, carved in a manner of icon screens in [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Greek Catholic]] Romanian churches. These are separated by carved-twisted rope which suggests the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] origin of many of Romania's artistic traditions. Ancient original icons from Romania depicting the [[Virgin and Child]], [[Christ]], the [[Dormition of the Virgin]], and [[Saint Mark]] are embedded in the upper section of each panel.

White arca paint mixed with color gives the smooth plastered walls a bluish pink tint. A Byzantine-style [[mosaic]] embedded in the rear wall, a gift of the Romanian government, was executed by Bucharest ceramicist Nora Steriade in gold, turquoise, bronze, ruby red, and black pieces of glass, and was originally part of the Romanian Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://documenting.library.pitt.edu/islandora/object/pitt%3A31735062128982/viewer#page/50/mode/1up|title=photo caption (mosaic)|journal=Pitt|date=Summer 1942|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|number=12|page=48|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lettering for the inscription and for the entrance text is the work of Alexander Seceni. The mosaic depicts [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]], Prince of [[Wallachia]], who refused to recant the [[Christian faith]] even at the cost of his own life and the lives of the male members of his family. The six windows have rounded [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] heads reflecting tradition brought from Rome when they conquered the original [[Dacia]]n settlers in 106 AD.

Two small window casements are deeply recessed and have marble window ledges. The four large center windows, form an alcove shut off from the main part of the room by an iron grilled gates wrought in Romania and hung in an arch. These gates swing back in folded sections against the plastered wall. A slab of polished marble tops the wrought-iron [[radiator]] grille. Yellow silk draperies frame the windows and ancient icons befitting the season and holidays are exhibited in the alcove which is reminiscent of an icon shrine in an Orthodox Church.   The student chairs are of dark oak hand-carved by Romanian peasant artisans using simple [[Pocket knife|pocketknives]] and each [[Splat (furniture)|splat]] bears a different design.  The professor's reading desk was adapted from an Eastern Orthodox Church [[lectern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A13;view=image;seq=0177 |title=The Romainian Classrooms in the Cathedral of Learning |year=1944 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Classroom contains folk ornamentation with traditional motifs from [[Byzantium]], the spiritual center of Russia.  The seminar table is made of oak slabs matched in contrasting grain and held together by ornamental keys. The cut-out apron is characteristic of massive tables in the [[Vologda]] district. The back of each student's chair has a cruciform circle pattern surmounted by triangles carved with symbols of regional or stylistic significance including the [[reindeer]] which symbolizes the [[tundra]] and the [[sturgeon]] that represents the [[Volga River]].  The professor's chair has a back of spirals surmounted by two [[Peafowl|peacocks]] worshipping the tree of life.  The podium is ecclesiastic in character and suggests the analoi used in Orthodox churches to support heavy Bibles. The blackboard is patterned after a [[triptych]], or three-leafed frame which holds icons.

The doors of the blackboard are a grille of wooden spirals backed by red velvet.  Above them is a carved panel with Sirin and Alcanost, the twin birds of Russian folklore that depict joy and sorrow as indistinguishable. A [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] or low [[wainscot]] of simple horizontal oaken boards surrounds the room and incorporates the blackboard, the corner cupboard, and kiot which is a [[Slavic (language)|Slavic]] term for a wall frame treated as a piece of furniture. Within the kiot hangs an vishivka ([[appliqué]] and [[embroidery]]) banner of [[Saint George]], patron saint of [[Moscow]] since the 15th century. The banner was made with pieces of 16th and 17th century fabric from [[Venice]] and [[Paris]] and is an example of needlework once popular with the Russian aristocracy.  The words "Valorous youth victorious over forces of evil and darkness" are carved in both [[Russian (language)|Russian]] and English below the banner. A copy of the Avinoff family icon in the room depicts the miraculous saving of the city of Kitej from a [[Tatars|Tartar]] invasion in the 14th century.  The ceiling is cornered with designs resembling those used to form traditional Easter cakes and which symbolize the four seasons, with a [[bud]] for Spring, a [[sunflower]] for summer, [[grapes]] for Autumn, and a [[pine cone]] for Winter. A [[wrought iron]] chandelier was created by Russian-born Hyman Blum.

Following a visit from [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in 2009, a display cabinet with carved ornamentation matching the rooms original carvings was installed to house three gifts presented by the then [[Russian President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilsonandmccracken.com/cabinetry/u-pittsburgh-russian-nationality-room/|title=U.

The [[Scotland|Scottish]] Classroom was designed by [[Reginald Fairlie]] of [[Edinburgh]] in the period style of the early 17th century.  The woodwork is carefully selected and treated English [[Pollarding|pollard]] oak.  The names of distinguished Scots are carved in the ribbon bands of the panels and include [[David Livingstone]] who was an African missionary and explorer, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] who authored ''[[Treasure Island]]'', and [[Alexander Fleming]] who discovered [[penicillin]].  The inscriptions above the doors and the rear cabinet are from "[[The Brus]]" by the 14th-century Scottish poet [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]].  The room's oak doors were copied from the entrance of [[Rowallan Castle]] in [[Ayrshire]].  A 16th-century Scottish proverb above the blackboard was taken from the [[Cowgate]] in Edinburgh and is known as "the Scottish Golden Rule" which reads: "Gif Ye did as Ye sould Ye might haif as Ye would." The [[plaster]] frieze was adapted from the plaster frieze at [[Elcho Castle]] in [[Perthshire]] and incorporates symbols of 14 [[Scottish clans]] which had members on the room committee, such as the buckle of the [[Clan Leslie|Leslie Clan]].  The [[thistle]], Scotland's national flower, is rendered on the cornerstone as a tree-of-life.  The [[overmantel]] of the Scottish [[sandstone]] fireplace that is flanked by carved kists, or log storage chests, is dominated by a portrait of poet [[Robert Burns]] that is copied from an original by [[Alexander Nasmyth]] which hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery of Scotland]].  Above the portrait is the cross of [[St. Andrew]], Scotland's patron saint. The bronze statuettes on the mantel near an arrangement of dried [[Calluna|heather]] are miniature replicas of heroic statues at the gateway to [[Edinburgh Castle]] and represent the 13th-century patriot [[Sir William Wallace]] and the 14th century freedom fighter, [[Robert the Bruce]], both of whom were popularized in the movie ''[[Braveheart]]''.

Medallions in the bay windows represent the coats of arms of the four ancient Scottish universities: [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of St. Andrew's|St. Andrew's]], [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]].  The medallions in the front and rear windows are of [[Elgin Cathedral|Elgin]] and [[Melrose Abbey]]s which were 13th and 16th century seats of learning.  The draperies are of [[Crewel embroidery|crewel-embroidered]] linen.  The rooms lighting fixtures were inspired by an iron [[coronet]] in Edinburgh's John Knox Museum that was retrieved from the battlefield of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] at which Scotland won its independence from England in 1314.  Student's seats resemble a chair that belonged to [[John Knox]].  An old Scottish church furnished the pattern for the reading stand.  The rear cabinet, based on an [[aumbry]] or weapon closet, contain artifacts such as [[pewter]] and [[Porcelain|china]] used at Soutar's Inn in Ayrshire that was frequented by Robert Burns. The panels in the doors, mantel, and in-the-wall cabinets were carved in Edinburgh by Thomas Good and then shipped to Pittsburgh.  The cabinetwork was done in the shops of Gustav Ketterer of [[Philadelphia]].  [[Wrought iron]]work was done by [[Samuel Yellin]].  Cut into stone  above the doorways are the thistle and the [[Royal Arms of Scotland|Lion Rampant]], the Scottish emblem incorporated into [[British coat of arms|Britain's royal arms]]. The chairman of the original Scottish Classroom Committee was [[Jock Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;view=image;seq=209;node=00a872842m%3A15;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |title=The Scottish Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning |year=1940 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A3;view=image;seq=9;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |title=Classrooms in the Cathedral of Learning | pages= 5 |year=c. 1944 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] Classroom reflects a peasant cottage and contains murals painted by [[Olle Nordmark]]. The special glory of the room is the rear wall paintings. The inspiration for the four framed paintings came from painted panels done by the 18th-century painter from [[Hälsingland]], [[Gustav Reuter]]. Linton Wilson found the panels at the [[Nordic Museum]].&lt;ref name="pres_swedishroom"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;view=toc;idno=31735051654220 |title=University of Pittsburgh presentation ceremonies for the Scottish, German, Swedish and Russian Rooms |location=Pittsburgh, Pa. |year=1938 |pages=13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813045331/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;view=toc;idno=31735051654220 |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hooded brick fireplace derives from an original in the [[Bollnäs]] Cottage in [[Skansen]], the famous outdoor museum in [[Stockholm]]. The brilliant white walls and fireplace are constructed of 200-year-old handmade bricks. The fire tools were handwrought by Ola Nilsson, a Swedish blacksmith. He reconstructed tools used in his childhood home in Sweden.&lt;ref name="swedishroom"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=31735051654212;view=toc;frm=frameset |title=The Swedish Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh |location=Pittsburgh, Pa |year=1940 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610200631/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=31735051654212;view=toc;frm=frameset |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subtle sense of humor associated with the [[Swedish people]] is revealed in the room's paintings. A wall fresco secco depicts the [[Three Wise Men]] dressed as [[cavaliers]] riding to [[Bethlehem]], in two directions. In their midst is Sweden's patron saint, [[Catherine of Vadstena|St. Catherine]]. The sloped ceiling bears decorations in which the central figure is the [[Archangel Gabriel]], seen as a droll trumpeter with two left feet. Nearby are renditions of Justice and Knowledge surrounded by groupings of flowers. Justice uses her blindfold to hold scales that appear balanced but have an off-center fulcrum. Knowledge seems puzzled as she contemplates writing on her slate with a quill pen.

Furniture and woodwork are the work of Erik Jansson of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="pres_swedishroom"/&gt; The classroom's oak furniture is stained a muted gray-blue tone, similar to that found in old Swedish homes. Floral designs, in colors that complement the amber tone of fir wall benches, brighten the door and archive cabinet. The red brick floor is set in a [[herringbone pattern|herringbone]] pattern.

Originally a library built in 1782 in a wealthy Damascan merchant's home, the [[Syria]]-[[Lebanon]] Room was moved intact to its location in the Cathedral of Learning following a six-year effort to fund and install the room by the Syrian and Lebanese communities in Pittsburgh.  Because of the fragility and pricelessness of the furnishing, it has been closed for class use and is one of two display rooms. The [[Tilia|linden]]-paneled walls and ceilings are decorated with “[[gesso]] painting,” a mixture of chalk and glue applied by brush in intricate relief, then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf.

The [[Turkey|Turkish]] Nationality Room was based on a baş odası, or main room, of a typical Turkish house or hayat with an outer gallery and a side [[iwan]]. The iwan is intended to be used as an entrance area similar to the royal pavilion, annexed to the [[Yeni Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]] in the [[Eminönü]] district of [[Istanbul]], which was built in 1663 for the use of [[Mehmed IV|Sultan Mehmet IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oa04/TNR/design.html | title=Design | publisher=Turkish Nationality Room | accessdate=2012-01-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208050744/http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oa04/TNR/design.html | archivedate=2012-02-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the iwan of the Turkish Nationality Room, four ceramic panels, painted on clay tiles in [[Ankara]], represent various cultures and points in Turkish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=17517 | title=Construction begins on 2 nationality rooms | first=Peter | last=Hart | newspaper=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2011-09-01 | accessdate=2012-01-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225060041/http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=17517 | archivedate=2014-02-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest ceramic is a portrait of [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]], the founder and first president of the [[Republic of Turkey]], who is depicted instructing the nation on the [[Turkish alphabet]] adopted in 1928. Other panels depict [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] princesses, who represent the importance of women in circa 9th-century Turkish culture, a reproduction of "Two merchants in conversation" by [[:tr:Mehmed Siyah Kalem|Mehmed Siyah Kalem]] which signifies the appearance of realism in Turkish drawing around the 14th century; and a depiction of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] at the circumcision ceremony of [[Şehzade Beyazıt]] and Şehzade Cihangir which represents the apex of [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] power and culture in the 16th century.  The main room attempts to convey the theme of democracy with its seating distributed around the perimeter of the room which suggests that all occupants are equals. Hardwood seats mimic [[divan]]-style seating found in a typical baş odası with back panels that function as writing tablets which when retracted form a "parted curtain" motif, a common shape used for household wall niches. The room's ceiling, modeled after the Emirhocazade Ahmet Bey summer house in [[Safranbolu]], is a combination of traditional çitakâri and kündekâri carpentry art that creates intricate geometric patterns using small pieces of wood attached without metal fasteners or glue. Clear glass windows along one wall frame a painted mural depicting a panoramic view of Istanbul which is feature similar to that seen in the mirrored room of the [[Topkapi Palace]]. The stained glass windows depict a tulip shape which served as a symbol of the Ottomans in the 18th century.  Display cases contain historic examples of Turkish calligraphy, ceramics, jewelry, miniatures and textiles as well as an [[evil eye]]. The entrance symbol above the exterior door depicts the current [[flag of Turkey]], adopted in 1936.

On the right wall, a copper bas-relief depicts the development of Ukrainian culture over the millennia. It portrays cultural centers, historical figures, rituals, monuments, and the evolution of Ukrainian ornament. The massive crossbeam's elaborate carvings include a protective solar symbol and a quotation from Ukraine's bard [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861): "Learn, my brothers! Think and read ... Learn foreign thoughts, but do not shun your own country!"  Beyond the wood posts, reminiscent of a gallery, the display case houses traditional Ukrainian art and crafts.

In order to worship and hold church services in their native [[Welsh language]], and spurred on by the non-conformist movement started by the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Welsh people met in secret locations such as barns or homes, as suggested by the simple white walled capel modeled in this Nationality Room.  The minister would live at one end as depicted by the display case with dishes and pottery that would be found in a Welsh kitchen and the long oak case clock seated on a Welsh slate foundation opposite the main blue door.

The bay window serves as the focus of the Welsh chapel worship, including a blue raised pulpit with a view of the entire congregation and two Deacon's benches from which to monitor the actions of the minister and congregation.

At the other end of the room is a table bearing a lectern, as such worship places would often become a school room for both children and adults during week days.  Above the chalk board is the [[Lord's Prayer]], written in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stdavidssociety.homestead.com/files/newsletter_Oct_2009.pdf | title=St. David's Newsletter | date=September 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712215215/http://stdavidssociety.homestead.com/files/newsletter_Oct_2009.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pew benches of [[pine]] face the lectern.  Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn cattle stalls, would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made of [[Populus|poplar]] and flooring suggests a typical capel dirt floor.  The carved stone dragon over the doorway, the long-time Welsh national symbol, represents the legendary victory of the Red Dragon over the White Dragon of numerous tales of medieval Wales and represents the triumph of Good over Evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Classroom was designed by Professor [[:hr:Vojta Braniš|Vojta Braniš]], a sculptor and director of the Industrial Art School in [[Zagreb]].  The walls are paneled in [[Slavonia]]n oak and hand-carved with geometric figures and the old Slavonic heart design which is combined with a running geometric border, a favorite with [[South Slavs]].  This type of work, known as "notch-carving", was traditionally done with a penknife as pastime of peasants.  On the corridor wall is a specially designed coat of arms featuring a double-headed eagle symbolizing the religious influences of Eastern [[Byzantine Empire|Empire of Byzantium]] and Western [[Roman Empire|Empire of Rome]] along with the founding dates of the universities in [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]], and [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]].  The ceiling is carved with intricate [[Croats|Croatian]], [[Slovenes|Slovenian]], and [[Serbs|Serbian]] folk motifs and the wooden chandeliers are similar to those in the [[Beli dvor|White Palace]] in Belgrade. The professor's chair and guests chairs were carved by students at the International Art School in Zagreb, and each spindle of the chairs bears a different notched design.  At the window, a bronze sculpture by Vojta Braniš, "Post-War Motherhood", depicts a barefoot mother nursing her child whom she has protected during the long months of war.  In the display cabinet is a lace portrayal of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] of Brežje by Slovenes Leopoldina Pelhan and her student Mila Božičkova which took six months to complete and was inspired by the story of a lace Madonna created by the villagers of [[Sveta Gora]] in order to replace a priceless painting during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19841129&amp;id=YOsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-mEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4908,9389725&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press]] |date=November 29, 1984 |title=Heirlooms decorate Pitt Nationality Rooms for December tours |page=C6 |accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling squares contain one of the three alternating ceiling ornaments suggesting flowers, stars, the sun, and other radiating geometric patterns, which are organized into a matrix of 9 by 7 squares.

Above the paneled walls, six portraits depict prominent Yugoslavs. On the front wall are portraits of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864) who compiled the Serbian dictionary and collected, edited, and published Serbian national ballads and folk songs; and Croatian statesman [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] (1815–1905) who was known for his efforts to achieve understanding between the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Greek Orthodox]] churches, founder of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]). On the corridor wall are likenesses of [[Jurij Vega|Baron George von Vega]] (1754–1802), a Slovenian officer in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army and mathematician recognized for various works including a book of logarithm tables; and [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Petar Petrović Njegoš]] (1813–1851), the last prince-bishop of [[Montenegro]], who was celebrated for his poetry.  Represented on the rear wall are [[Roger Joseph Boscovich|Rugjer Bošković]] (1711–1787), a Croatian scientist distinguished for his achievements in the fields of mathematics, optics, and astronomy; and [[France Prešeren|France Ksaver Prešeren]] (1800–1849) who is considered one of the greatest native-language Slovenian poets.

The Yugoslav Classroom's Executive Committee was first organized in 1926 under the chairmanship of Anton Gazdić, the president of the [[Croatian Fraternal Union]]. After his death in September 1933 the new chairman was Steve Babić, the previous vice-chairman, and the new vice-chairwoman became Catherine Rušković McAleer. Famous Croatian sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] was a great supporter of the Classroom and gave two of his works to the University, one a bust of [[Mihajlo Pupin]] and the other a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch Starrett, Agnes (ed.)

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to film:

'''[[Film]]''' &amp;ndash; refers to motion pictures as individual projects and to the field in general.  The name came from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock|filmstock]]) has historically been the primary [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is film? ==
Film can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, film is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Film is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. 
*** One of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
*** One of the [[performing arts]] &amp;ndash; art forms in which artists use their body, voice, or objects to convey artistic expression. Performing arts include a variety of disciplines but all take the form of a [[performance]] in front of an audience.
*** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
* [[Show business]] &amp;ndash; a means of providing employment for [[actor]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[technician]]s, regardless of whether the finished film was produced as a [[for-profit]] enterprise or as a [[not-for-profit]] public service.

=== Other names for film ===
* Movies
* Motion pictures
* Pictures
* Celluloid
* Flicks (or flickers)
* Photoplays
* Picture shows
* The cinema
* The silver screen (talkie era); the silver sheet (silent era)
* Videos

==Essence of film==

* [[Filmmaking]] &amp;ndash; process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through scriptwriting, casting, shooting, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition.  Filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish.

'''''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up''''' is a 2009 book by the American philosopher [[Irving Singer]], in which the author summarizes and expands upon the themes of his earlier three-volume works ''The Nature of Love'' (1984–1987) and ''Meaning in Life'' (1992–1996). The book, which has been described as an "intellectual biography" by its author, received positive reviews.

==Publication history==
''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' was published by [[MIT Press]].{{sfn|Singer|2009|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' received positive reviews from the philosopher [[Leslie Armour]] in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Armour|2009|page=78}} and in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|2009|page=43}} The book was also reviewed by R. White in ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]''.{{sfn|White|2009|pages=319–320}}

Armour described the book as "an account of a life devoted to the idea of love and the love of ideas", and wrote that it summarizes Singer's previous work, including his philosophical trilogies ''The Nature of Love'' and ''Meaning in Life'', "with relaxed charm."{{sfn|Armour|2009|page=78}} The ''Publishers Weekly'' review described the book as "fairly interesting" and a summation of Singer's work, suggesting that it could serve as an introduction to it. It also wrote that it can serve as "a stand-alone survey of", or a model for understanding, the [[philosophy of love]].{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|2009|page=43}}

===Academic journals===
''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' received positive reviews from Erica Lucast Stonestreet in ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'',{{sfn|Stonestreet|2009}} and Michael Strawser in ''[[Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review]]''.{{sfn|Strawser|2010|pages=502–505}}

Stonestreet observed that the book deals with the same themes as Singer's previous works, such as ''The Nature of Love''. She wrote that it resembled a conversation in structure, and that it "lacks an overarching thesis and may for this reason be disappointing to someone who is looking for a systematic introduction to the philosophy of love", but credited Singer with being able to talk "graciously and thoughtfully about things that matter." She compared Singer's views to those of the philosopher [[Harry Frankfurt]], in that "both believe that love involves bestowing value on the beloved".{{sfn|Stonestreet|2009}} Strawser described the book as "the kind of book one wants to read by an eminent philosopher who has devoted his philosophical career to the study of love" and "an ideal opening text for a course on the philosophy of love". He credited Singer with providing an "accessible historical overview of the subject".{{sfn|Strawser|2010|pages=502–505}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Alan Soble]] wrote in the foreword to ''Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up'' that it "is as much an intellectual biography as it is an exploration of love and sex", and observed that it "summarizes, explains, and elaborates" themes in Singer's ''The Nature of Love''. He recommended it to "potential students of the philosophy of love and sex".{{sfn|Soble|1999|pages=ix–xii}}

'''PROPAGANDA''' is a large collection of [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]-licensed&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060915092439/https://olympus.het.brown.edu/cgi-bin/dwww?type=file&amp;location=/usr/share/doc/propaganda-debian/copyright PROPAGANDA license file] from its Debian package retrieved 2007-12-30&lt;/ref&gt; seamless [[Desktop environment|desktop]] backgrounds included in various [[Linux distribution]]s, and available via free download over the web. While no longer being produced or even officially hosted online, the collection consisted of approximately 15 volumes of largely abstract and surreal art, numbering over 1,000 images in total. Created in [[GIMP]] by Bowie J. Poag, the images were meant to attract users to the platform by virtue of the art having been 100% Linux-generated.

The style of the images produced by Poag were unusual in terms of their geometric qualities. Appearing to repeat seamlessly along all four edges, PROPAGANDA images became attractive for use in [[3D modeling]], and particularly for use as [[desktop wallpaper]], in that limitations in graphics hardware at the time often prevented users from using full screen 24-bit images. Using smaller, tileable images for desktop backgrounds helped keep memory utilization to a minimum, while still allowing early Linux desktops to be visually appealing.

After ten months, Poag turned control of the project over to Naru Sundar who was then a student at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. Although Sundar would subsequently release two additional volumes, Poag terminated the project in April 2000 citing a lack of activity by Sundar, and a falling out with Chris DiBona, a manager of community projects at [[VA Linux Systems]], who provided hosting space for his project.

As a side source of amusement, PROPAGANDA's website featured a satirical storyline that [[John F. Kennedy]] had faked his own assassination in 1963, and had placed himself into cryogenic suspension until the time was right to lead the charge against Microsoft, and help the Linux movement gain footing. While not greatly influential, Poag's work with PROPAGANDA led many to develop an interest in Linux as a platform during its formative early years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=propaganda Everything2 node] by ''Toastie'', retrieved 2007-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Propaganda site was formerly officially hosted at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://propaganda.system12.com/ and then http://propaganda.themes.org&lt;/nowiki&gt; before going offline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">{{about|the literary term|the album by Deep Purple|Purple Passages}}

In [[literary criticism]], '''purple prose''' is [[prose]] text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word a Day – purple prose |url=http://www.wordsmith.org/words/purple_prose.html |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and [[metaphor]]s. When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed '''purple patches''' or '''purple passages''', standing out from the rest of the work.

Purple prose is criticized for desaturating the meaning in an author's text by overusing melodramatic and fanciful descriptions. As there is no precise rule or absolute definition of what constitutes purple prose, deciding if a text, passage, or complete work has fallen victim is a somewhat subjective decision. According to [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], "It takes a certain amount of sass to speak up for prose that's rich, succulent and full of novelty. Purple is immoral, undemocratic and insincere; at best artsy, at worst the exterminating angel of depravity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Paul|title=IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE|journal=New York Times|date=15 December 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term ''purple prose'' is derived from a reference by the Roman poet [[Horace]]&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nixon |first=Cheryl |title=Novel Definitions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTY6q_hIa90C&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=19 May 2013 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=9781770482074 |pages=194– |date=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrone1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macrone|first=Michael|title=It's Greek to Me |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ohlxXHpEK8C&amp;pg=PA147 |accessdate=19 May 2013 |date=1994-05-18 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780062720443 |pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Quintus Horatius Flaccus, 65–8 BC) who wrote in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 14–21):&lt;ref name="horace"&gt;Horace (18 BC).

'''Rainie Branning''' (also '''Cross''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC One]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Tanya Franks]]. Introduced as the drug-addicted sister of [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]), Franks has had three separate guest stints in 2007 (two episodes), 2008 (four episodes) and 2010 (seven episodes) and between 12 April and 8 December 2011. Rainie returned on 16 June 2014, when she was revealed as [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) mystery phone contact, having been with Ian on [[Good Friday]], the night of [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?|Lucy Beale's murder]] but departed again not long after. In January 2015, it was confirmed that Rainie would return for the conclusion of the [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]] storyline.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a619170/eastenders-plans-who-killed-lucy-beale-flashback-episode.html#~p0s36dwC2QiV2K|title=EastEnders plans 'Who Killed Lucy Beale?' flashback episode - EastEnders News - Soaps - Digital Spy|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=4 January 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainie made another guest appearance on 19 January 2018 and returned full-time to the show on 24 April 2018, now married to her former brother-in-law, [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]).

Described as "the slightly broken sister who's one step away from a vodka bottle", Rainie's storylines have often centred on her addictions to [[drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. During her seven episode guest stint in 2010, Rainie was involved in a highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). It was branded "inappropriate" and "horrid" by the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''. ''EastEnders'' star [[Natalie Cassidy]] (who plays [[Sonia Fowler]]) also criticised the storyline, saying she was "shocked", but Franks defended the storyline, though she herself was not surprised that viewers had complained.

==Storylines==
===2007–2008===
Rainie first appears at Tanya's house claiming that she is no longer using drugs but Tanya catches her attempting to inject heroin and gives her a choice to take the £500 and never to see Tanya or her children again, or stay the night and get help with her problems. Rainie leaves with the money without Tanya noticing but ignores the ultimatum, returning the following year. Tanya is in an emotional state, having recently split from her husband [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]). Rainie returns the money to Tanya and says she is not using drugs, so Tanya allows her to stay but she tests positive for [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] so Tanya asks her to leave.

===2010–2011===
Rainie returns to Walford in 2010 and tells Max she is clean and sober, and asks Max for Tanya's phone number. Tanya's daughter, [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]), wants Rainie to stay and Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister [[Carol Jackson]]'s ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out. She starts looking for her drugs where a drunken [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) approaches, finds Rainie's crack cocaine and is tempted to try some after she says it helps her block out her memories. Phil and Rainie get high at Phil's home. Rainie goes to get more drugs when Phil steals money from [[The Queen Victoria]] public house, but is mugged by a drug dealer. Phil's girlfriend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) offers to help him get clean but throws Rainie out of the house, calling her pathetic.

In 2011, Rainie returns to Tanya's house as their mother, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]), is visiting. Rainie says she is now completely clean and is staying with Cora because her counsellor wants her to reconnect with her family. When Tanya and [[Greg Jessop]] ([[Stefan Booth]]) go on their honeymoon, Rainie looks after their house and meets Phil at [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)|R&amp;R]]. They talk about their past but he tells her that he does not want to associate with her and leaves. She and [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) then get drunk together and later go to his flat and have sex. Jack rejects Rainie the following morning. Tanya and Greg return and see how much trouble Rainie has caused. She also causes trouble with Shirley so Tanya asks her to leave but Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay, much to Greg's disappointment. Rainie visits Jack's wife [[Ronnie Branning]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) to find the knickers she supposedly left behind and taunts Ronnie, asking her to tell Jack to phone her, leading to her being kicked out again. She joins a support group to help her stay off drugs and alcohol which Phil also attends. Rainie struggles and calls her drug dealer but Phil catches Rainie with drugs and takes them from her, destroying them. She gets drunk and goes to Tanya's salon, where Tanya takes her home. Greg throws her out after Tanya lies that Rainie tried to stab her. A few days later, Phil finds Rainie in the pub and Shirley catches them talking and wrongly assumes they are romantically involved but finds out that Phil has been sponsoring Rainie. Shirley almost gives Rainie a job in the café but changes her mind.

Rainie leaves Walford again but insists on her return that she is still not taking drugs. However, she faces several temptations by people offering her drugs, eventually buying some from [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]). When Phil finds out, he asks Ryan to not sell to Rainie again. [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) takes pity on Rainie and helps her to clean herself up, telling her about drug addict [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]) and giving her a Bible, which makes Rainie decide to change as she finds religion. Rainie apologises to Tanya for being rude to her earlier in the week, and Tanya agrees to let her stay with her and Greg. Rainie and Cora confide in one another when Rainie says Tanya treats her like a child. When it is revealed that Tanya had an affair with Max, Rainie nearly turns to drink, but stops herself. She gets a job at the [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)|R&amp;R]] club, unaware that she only got it because her boss, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) wanted to irritate Phil. The next week, Phil demands Janine sack Rainie and she agrees but Rainie later applies for a job as an office worker with Janine's new property management business but Janine makes her a cleaner. When Phil is sent photos relating to an incident from his past, Rainie stops him turning to drink. Phil tells her about the incident and they start to kiss, but are interrupted by [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]). Rainie mentions the photos to Shirley, making Shirley think  Rainie is sending them so she threatens Rainie, telling her to stop.

Rainie later discovers that Tanya has [[cervical cancer]]. Max returns with his brother, [[Derek Branning|Derek]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]), and Derek recognises Rainie from Max and Tanya's wedding and is attracted to her, later mentioning that they had sex. Rainie demands to know why Tanya stopped her treatment and she explains that it did not work for their father and admits she helped him die, shattering Rainie and Cora. Though Tanya and Cora reconcile, Rainie is still angry, telling Tanya she hopes the cancer kills her. She sleeps rough, but then meets Derek and starts a sexual relationship him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 29/11/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017tb3d |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Nigel Douglas; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Jeff Povey|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rainie asks Tanya to apologise over their father but she refuses, as she does not regret it. Cora backs Tanya up and tells Rainie she is ashamed to be her mother so Rainie decides to leave for Tanya's sake, though she apologises for her comments. She breaks up with Derek and leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 08/12/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0183nyn |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Daniel Wilson; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Wendy Granditer |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Tanya and Max decide to remarry. Tanya wants Rainie to attend the wedding but doesn't know where she is and asks Cora to track her down. With help from Jack, Cora manages to get in touch with Rainie and arranges to meet her at a pub, but upon arriving, Rainie has sent her sponsor [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Olivia|Olivia]] (Samantha Best), to the pub with a letter. Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is pleased to have been invited to the wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora is the reason for her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she will leave her alone from now on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 25/10/2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nkn2p |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Rupert Such; Executive Producer: [[Lorraine Newman]]; Writer: Jesse O'Mahoney |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–2015===

For several weeks following the death of his daughter [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) receives texts and calls from "R", all of which he ignores. After texting her to leave him alone, "R" comes to Walford and is revealed to be Rainie. She blackmails Ian, threatening to tell his fiancée [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and son [[Peter Beale]] ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) that he was seeing her as a [[prostitute]] on [[Good Friday]], the night of Lucy's death.&lt;ref name="Rainie Returns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rainie Blackmail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/06/17/rainie-cross-returns-to-eastenders-to-blackmail-ian-beale-about-night-of-lucy-beales-murder-4765429/|title=EastEnders: Rainie blackmailing Ian over the night Lucy died|date=17 June 2014|work=[[Daily Metro]]|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) sees Rainie, she reveals what Ian has done,&lt;ref name="Rainie tells Patrick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/387646/EastEnders-spoiler-Patrick-Ian-secret|title=Patrick to discover Rainie secret|last=Percival|first=Ash|date=7 July 2014|work=[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he is unable to tell Denise when he suffers a stroke. Ian meets Rainie to tell her that he will not pay her anymore, but [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) catches Ian and pulls up behind him. Ian drives away so Rainie approaches Mick, thinking he is a customer. He rejects her but the police arrest him for soliciting a prostitute. To protect Ian, Mick pleads guilty.&lt;ref name="Mick Carter stitched up by Rainie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/393121/EastEnders-spoiler-Mick-Carter-stitched-up-by-hooker-Rainie|title=Mick Carter stitched up by Rainie|last=Percival|first=Ash|date=7 August 2014|work=[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainie and Cora meet at the court, as Cora has come to support [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]). Cora confronts Rainie, and realises that she is the prostitute involved, and sees how low she has fallen and gives her money to fund her addiction so she can stop her prostitution. Ian tells Phil what has happened, so Phil pays Rainie, telling her to stop blackmailing Ian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a590552/eastenders-phil-mitchell-in-showdown-with-rainie-spoiler-pictures.html#|title=EastEnders: Phil Mitchell in showdown with Rainie - spoiler pictures|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=15 August 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil finds a flat for Rainie in Walford but she is thrown out by her landlord because of her prostitution.

She then tells Denise about her night with Ian. Cora promises to help her get clean, but when she goes out, she returns to find Rainie gone and that she has stolen all her money. A flashback later reveals what happened between Rainie and Ian on the day Lucy died.

===2018–===

Rainie returns to Walford in January 2018, visiting her niece Abi, whose life support is to be turned off. Rainie brings a diamond healer as a gift to Abi. The family are devastated when Abi's life support is switched off and she dies. When Max returns to Walford following a break away after Abi's funeral, he marries Rainie and later introduces her as his wife to the residents. Rainie, who claims to now believe in God, stays with Max in his newly acquired car lot and he promises to get them a home and when they visit Abi's daughter, [[Abi Branning (2017 character)|Abi Branning]], Max vows that they will get custody of her. Rainie and Max meet with Abi's social worker and use Jack's house to convince him they are suitable to raise Abi and after the meeting, Rainie and Max row about Rainie potentially ruining Max's plan to raise Abi. When Cora offers Rainie the chance to leave Max, relocate to [[Exeter]], run a tearoom and be part of Abi's upbringing with her and Tanya, Rainie takes a cheque from Cora for £50,000, but contacts social worker Calvin and Jamahl visits in Calvin's place. He is not expecting Cora to be there and Cora says Rainie is leaving Max to help her raise Abi, to which Jamahl says the courts still have to decide, however, Rainie says she will not leave Max and they reveal Cora's bribe. Despite initially only having married Max as a business arrangement, Rainie begins to develop genuine feelings for him and is devastated when he nonchalantly reveals he believes Rainie will find somewhere else to live after the custody case. She is also upset when Max signs up for a dating service for one-night stands. Rainie suggests that they have one night of casual sex together, claiming that they are professionals and only need to do it once. Max is almost convinced but Rainie is thrown off course when a woman using the dating service texts Max. Rainie continues to fight her feelings for Max and becomes furious when Max does not show it back. She attempts to leave but Max stops her and begs her to stay. After an emotional talk with Jack, they sleep together again. They agree that it is nothing more than a one-off, but Rainie feels guilty and decides to leave Walford. Max manages to catch her at the station and persuades her to stay. Unknown to Rainie and Jack, his daughter [[Amy Mitchell]] (Abbie Knowles) has videoed them kissing.

===Notable relationships===

====Phil Mitchell====
Rainie's relationship with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden|McFadden]]) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil were to be involved in a storyline involving the taking of [[crack cocaine]]. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time."&lt;ref name="Rainie teases"/&gt; Franks was given advice from the charity [[DrugScope]] on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic.&lt;ref name="Rainie teases" /&gt; She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, "If there are people who have a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as ''EastEnders'' does something like this."&lt;ref name="Rainie teases"/&gt; She also stated that if ''EastEnders'' "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life.

===Reintroduction (2014)===

Tanya Franks returned to the role of Rainie Cross for a stint on 16 June 2014. Her return was kept a secret by the cast and crew of ''EastEnders'', and followed the surprise returns of [[Laurie Brett]], [[Nicholas Bailey]] and [[Emma Barton]] as [[Jane Beale]], [[Anthony Trueman]] and [[Honey Mitchell]] respectively. All of these returns were under new executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]].&lt;ref name="Rainie Returns"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a578214/eastenders-airs-surprise-rainie-cross-return.html|title=EastEnders airs surprise Rainie Cross return|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=16 June 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainie was reintroduced as part of the "[[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]' storyline, a story that began in April 2014 when [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) was murdered, and climaxed as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations of ''EastEnders'' in February 2015.&lt;ref name="Rainie Returns"/&gt;

===Reintroduction (2018)===
On 18 January 2018, it was announced that Franks had agreed to reprise her role of Rainie. On her return, Franks stated: "It's like never having been away. I love working with everyone at ''EastEnders''. With John Yorke at the helm at the moment, the show is in good hands and I'm excited to explore the next chapter in Rainie's journey."&lt;ref name="2018 return"/&gt; It was also revealed that Rainie would return for one episode later in January and would return for a full-time return later in the year. Rainie returned for one episode on 19 January 2018.&lt;ref name="2018 return"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Megan|title=EastEnders return for Rainie Cross as Tanya Franks reprises the role|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a847838/eastenders-return-tanya-franks-reprises-rainie-cross-role/|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainie returned in the episode broadcast on 24 April 2018.{{Fact|date=April 2018}}

==Reception==
[[File:Rainie and Phil.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The storyline in which viewers saw [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and Rainie on a drug binge prompted over 200 complaints.]]Franks said that after her stint in 2008, many people recognised her in the street and asked if she would return.&lt;ref name="Rainie teases"/&gt; Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying "''EastEnders'' in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively."&lt;ref name="drug complaints"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a259613/bbc-defends-eastenders-drug-scenes.html|title=BBC defends 'EastEnders' drug scenes|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=11 August 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=11 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/content/response/100810_res_eastenders_drugs|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419171024/http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/content/response/100810_res_eastenders_drugs|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 April 2013|title=EastEnders, scenes featuring Phil and Raine under the influence of drugs inappropriate, BBC One|date=9 August 2010|work=[[BBC]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 May 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline.

They're in danger of making it look appealing."&lt;ref name="dr"/&gt; Finally, "It was a bit much. I've found ''EastEnders'' distressing over the last month."&lt;ref name="dr"/&gt; The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' described the scenes as 'disturbing'.&lt;ref name="dr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ENDERS+FANS+PROTEST+AT+SOAP+CRACK+SCENES%3b+Beeb+in+firing+line+over...-a0234270149|title=ENDERS FANS PROTEST AT SOAP CRACK SCENES; Beeb in firing line over Mitchell drug binge|date=13 August 2010|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=27 July 2011|location=[[Scotland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''EastEnders'' star, [[Natalie Cassidy]] also criticised the scenes, saying, "You can't swear or show two people making love before the watershed, yet you can show people smoking class A drugs?

'''Skoob''' is a collaborative [[Social networking service|social network]] for [[Brazil]]ian readers, launched in January 2009 by developer Lindenberg Moreira.&lt;ref name="skoob"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazetaonline.globo.com/_conteudo/2010/10/687046-leitura+em+rede.html|title=Leitura em rede| publisher=[[Globo.com]]|language=portuguese|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without advertising, the site became a meeting point for readers and writers who exchange tips about books and organize meetings in bookstores. The network allows interaction with other social networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as popular e-commerce stores in Brazil, such as: Americanas.com, Saraiva, and Submarino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI96567-15220,00-REDES+SOCIAIS+TRAZEM+A+LITERATURA+PARA+A+INTERNET.html|title=Redes sociais trazem a literatura para a internet|work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]|language=portuguese|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skoob's name comes from the English word "[[book]]s" spelled backwards. Through free registration, the user creates a profile showing what books they are reading or rereading, have read, want to read, or are no longer reading, thus forming a  "virtual bookshelf". Users can also add missing titles and share their views on the books via assessments and reviews. On January 27, 2012, a survey was released that indicates that Skoob had more than 1.200.000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2012/01/skoob-a-rede-social-de-leitores-brasileiros-chegou-aos-420-mil-usuarios-cadastrados.html|title=Skoob, a rede social de leitores brasileiros, chegou aos 420 mil usuários cadastrados|website=TechTudo|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify". Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."&lt;ref&gt;

A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in [[elegance]] and [[fashion]], covering the art of "[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne."&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last       = DeJean
| first      = Joan
| title         = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour
| year      = 2003
| publisher = Free Press
| location  = New York
| isbn      = 978-0-7432-6413-6
| page      = 3
| quote         = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&amp;sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sophistication ==

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

* cultural sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:
{{cite book
| last       = Holt
| first      =  Douglas
|author2=Douglas Cameron
 | title         = Cultural Strategy: Using Innovative Ideologies to Build Breakthrough Brands
| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=PNEQ7gGDGVwC
| accessdate    = 2011-02-24
| year      = 2010
| publisher = Oxford University Press
| isbn      = 0-19-958740-X
| pages      = 91–92
| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;(or culturedness)
* intellectual sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:{{cite book
| last       = Hodgson
| first      = Marshall G. S
| authorlink = Marshall Hodgson
| title         = The venture of Islam: conscience and history in a world civilization
| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=LKO5GRC8j1MC
| accessdate    = 2011-02-24
| volume    = 3
| year      = 1974
| publisher = University of Chicago Press
| isbn      = 978-0-226-34684-7
| page      = 323
| quote         = But the mutakallim's universe of discourse now included the whole range of Falsafah with its intellectual sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of [[humor]], [[Victor Raskin]] distinguishes "two types of sophistication: limited access, or allusive knowledge, and complex processing".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last       = Attardo
| first      = Salvatore
| authorlink = Salvatore Attardo
| title         = Linguistic theories of humor

| publisher = Walter de Gruyter
| isbn      = 978-3-11-014255-6
| page      = 216
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquiring sophistication ==

Methods of acquiring the appearance of personal sophistication include:

* educational travel – note the function of the traditional [[Grand Tour]] for European aesthetes&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last       = Warneke
| first      = Sara
| authorlink = Sara Warneke
| title         = Images of the educational traveller in early modern England
| url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=ldbOFtWaqFAC
| accessdate    = 2011-02-24
| series    = Brill's studies in intellectual history
| volume    = 58
| year      = 1995
| publisher = Brill
| isbn      = 978-90-04-10126-5
| page      = 242
| quote         = By the second half of the seventeenth century the experience of the Grand Tour marked the socially successful gentleman. In 1678 Gailhard noted that many travelled Englishmen regarded their home-bred compatriots as their social inferiors and affected foreign accents, fashions and mannerisms in order to demonstrate their sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Finishing school]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1        = Mackintosh
| first1       = Prudence
|date=January 1986
| title        = Little Women
| journal      = [[Texas Monthly]]
| volume       = 14
| issue        = 1
| pages        = 154

| accessdate   = 2011-02-24

| quote        = 1913 [–] Miss Ela Hockaday opens a finishing school in Dallas and single-handedly creates the Texas ideal of what a lady should be. [...] [D]aughters from remote West Texas ranches gained a measure of sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On a societal level commentators can associate various forms of sophistication with [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Textiles of [[Mexico]]''' have a long history. The making of [[fiber]]s, cloth and other [[textile]] goods has existed in the country since at least 1400 BCE. Fibers used during the pre-Hispanic period included those from the [[yucca]], [[Arecaceae|palm]] and [[Furcraea|maguey]] plants as well as the use of [[cotton]] in the hot lowlands of the south. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the Spanish introduced new fibers such as [[silk]] and [[wool]] as well as the European foot treadle [[loom]]. Clothing styles also changed radically. Fabric was produced exclusively in workshops or in the home until the era of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1880s to 1910), when the mechanization of [[weaving]] was introduced, mostly by the French. 
Today, fabric, clothes and other textiles are both made by craftsmen and in factories. Handcrafted goods include pre-Hispanic clothing such as [[huipil]]s and [[sarape]]s, which are often [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Clothing, [[carpet|rug]]s and more are made with natural and [[natural dye|naturally dyed]] fibers. Most handcrafts are produced by [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous people]], whose communities are concentrated in the center and south of the country in states such as [[Mexico State]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Chiapas]]. The textile industry remains important to the economy of Mexico although it has suffered setback due to competition by cheaper goods produced in countries such as [[China]], [[India]] and [[Vietnam]].

==History==
[[File:Murales Rivera - Färberei.jpg|thumb|Diego Rivera mural depicting the making of textiles in the pre-Hispanic period]]

===Pre-Hispanic period===
The oldest known fabric fragments in Mexico have been found in the arid north of the country in states such as [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Durango]] and date to approximately between 1800 and 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=424 |title=El Textil Artesanal en México, Introducción – Antecedentes Históricos |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Textile Crafts in Mexico, Introduction - Historical Precedents |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083752/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=424 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Hispanic times, the most common woven fibers in dry areas were from the yucca and palm trees, with cotton grown in the hot humid areas near the coast. It was unknown to the [[Aztec]]s until they conquered cotton growing areas and began demanding it as tribute. Then, only the upper classes were permitted to wear it. Given the important status cotton cloth had, it is often used as money. For some ceremonial garments, [[amate]] or bark paper was used.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=2722 |title=Evolucion del Textil en México despues de la Colonia |work=Artes e Historia |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Evolution of textiles in Mexico after the colonial period |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094504/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=2722# |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Each of the sedentary Mesoamerican cultures had a god of weaving. Women were often buried with woven items they had made. Cortés mentions the Aztecs’ skill in weaving in one of this letters to the king of Spain, in very favorable terms.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

===Colonial era===
[[File:WeaverTexcoco1.JPG|thumb|Weaver using foot treadle loom of the type introduced by the Spanish]]
After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the production of cloth and the wearing of clothes in Mesoamerica changed drastically. Most pre-Hispanic forms of dress and body adornment were banned by the Spanish as “uncivilized.” Indigenous, European and Asian fabrics influenced Mexican cloth production by the mid colonial period.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt; The Spanish did not favor the native cotton, nor did they find the material produced on traditional [[Loom#Back strap loom|backstrap looms]] wide enough. New techniques and materials were introduced. Spanish modes of dress, itself a mixture of European, [[Asia Minor]] and [[Egypt]]ian influences, were introduced as well. At first wool and silk fabric was imported, then sheep and [[silkworm]]s as well as European foot pedal looms all by the late 1530s. By 1580, Mexico had become one of the most productive areas for wool and silk cloth. Most of the production was concentrated in the present day states of Oaxaca, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Puebla]]. At first Spanish weavers dominated production, but they were soon replaced by native weavers who were making material cheaper. Instead of prohibiting Indian made fabric, European weavers decided instead to hire them, creating workshops. While the indigenous weavers were not paid much, the Spanish owners did make money. These workshops eventually produced enough fabric for both internal consumption and for export to [[Spain]], the [[Philippines]], [[Central America]] and [[Peru]]. Silk cloth production was particularly dominant from 1540 to 1580; However, the end of this period, the yearly [[Manila Galleon]] was regularly bringing cheaper silk from Asia.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt;

While cotton cloth was not favored by the Europeans, it was still made and offered as tribute to Spanish overlords. Commercializing the fiber was difficult as the plant grows in the lowlands near the oceans and not near the manufacturing areas in the highlands, and transportation costs were high. Large cotton weaving workshops were not founded until the second half of the 17th century. Eventually, the production of this fabric as well as wool fabric filled the gap left by the disappearance of Mexican silk fabric production.  Wool fabric remained important because it was favored by the upper tiers of colonial society, and because sheep could be raised near major weaving areas, such as [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]],  [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Morelia|Valladolid]], [[Acámbaro]], and [[San Miguel de Allende]].&lt;ref name="despues"/&gt;

===19th century to present===

In times past, fabric and clothing were made to last for decades, but today fabric is much cheaper and much of what clothing is bought is soon thrown away. This is mostly due to the mechanization of weaving, which has made fabric inexpensive.&lt;ref name="ecological"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los nuevos textiles ecológicos |author= Gabriela Casavantes |url=http://www2.esmas.com/mujer/ecomujer/099481/los-nuevos-textiles-ecolgicos |newspaper=es mas |location=Mexico |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The new ecological textiles |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, as in other parts of the world, the introduction of modern transportation and communications brought about major changes in the production and distribution of goods and in firms' management and structure.&lt;ref name="porfirian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gómez-Galvarriato |first1=Aurora  |date=Autumn 2008 |title= Networks and Entrepreneurship: The Modernization of the Textile Business in Porfirian Mexico |journal=Business History Review |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=475–505 |doi=10.1017/s0007680500082611}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century, industrialization affected textile production with the introduction of steam-powered machines and the efforts of French immigrants from [[Barcelonnette]], who began to arrive in Mexico in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;  The mass production of textiles, especially cotton textiles, developed earlier than in other countries outside of Western Europe and the United States, nearing the same level as in England in the mid-18th century despite social unrest at that time. Mechanization of cloth production began in the 1830s; however, high internal taxes among states kept production facilities small and unconsolidated. While Mexican production lagged behind that of Europe, certain regions of the country such as La Laguna, in the modern states of [[Durango]] and Coahuila, became important producers of cotton fabric. The most widely produced fabric was called “manta,” a natural cotton favored by many indigenous groups.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

The development of steamship lines and railroad networks allowed Mexico-produced fabrics to be exported. The consolidation of power by Porfirio Díaz in the 1880s opened up business opportunities and made foreign investment possible. By the end of the 19th century, textile production and distribution was the country’s largest manufacturing sector, mostly controlled by French immigrants. The immigrants worked together, forming the “Barcelonnette network.” They started off with small textile mills and dry goods stores, which eventually grew into large factories and [[department store]]s, including [[Palacio de Hierro]], which still exists.  These French immigrants consolidated textile operations by the end of the 19th century, and by the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]] changed their power source from steam to electricity. They also changed textile mills from mostly family-owned organizations to more modern enterprises with professional managers and stock sold on exchanges.&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;

The [[sewing machine]] appeared in the early 20th century and became widely used to join fabric and for embroidery . This led to another level of textile production: finished clothing.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

==Craft and indigenous textiles today==

===Indigenous tradition===
[[File:WeaverZaachila2.JPG|thumb|Woman in Zaachila, Oaxaca weaving with a backstrap loom]]

Textiles is one of Mexico’s more important crafts as it represents the continuation of tradition as well as its fusion with modern designs and techniques. Both pre-Hispanic and colonial era style textiles are still made in Mexico. In addition, many of the textile factories use machines based on old foot pedal looms from the colonial period. There are basically four types of fibers used for fabric production:&lt;ref name="turedomex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.edomexico.gob.mx/iifaem/htm/html/textil.htm |title= TEXTIL Artesania Mexiquense |publisher= Secretaria de Turismo Estado de Mexico |location=Mexico State |language=Spanish |trans-title=Craft textiles in Mexico State |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Vegetable products such as cotton
* Animal products such as wool and silk
* Minerals such as [[Goldwork (embroidery)|gold and silver thread]]
* Synthetics.
Raw materials for textiles fall into two groups: smooth fibers such as silk, cotton, and wool, introduced to the American continent by the [[conquistador]]s; and hard fibers native to Mexico such as [[ixtle]], [[lechuguilla]], reeds, palm, twigs,  and [[willow]]. In indigenous regions of Mexico, women are responsible for clothing the community, a process which often begins with harvesting natural fibers and then [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[dyeing]], and weaving textiles. In various parts of Mexico, both native backstrap looms and pedal-driven looms of European origin are used to weave principally cotton and wool.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/208-the-artesanias-of-michoacan-an-introduction |title= The artesanias of Michoacan - an introduction  |date= October 9, 2008 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most handcrafted textiles are produced by the sixty or so indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico, who mostly live in rural areas in the center and south of the country. In these textiles, traditional indigenous designs, and in some cases techniques still survive.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  One common technique in craft fabric is [[brocade]], which allows for raised designs to be woven into the cloth.&lt;ref name="maestros"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=6235&amp;id_seccion=5334&amp;id_subseccion=3050&amp;id_documento=821 |title= Para convertir la hebra en telas Salon de Maestros de Arte Popular |work= Artes e Historia |location= Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title= Converting fiber into cloth – Masters’ Room at the (Museum of ) Popular Art |accessdate= June 1, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094522/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=6235&amp;id_seccion=5334&amp;id_subseccion=3050&amp;id_documento=821 |archivedate= July 19, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous textiles are made at home by women and used for clothing, home use, decorative use and ceremonial use. Items include those that are hand woven, hand embroidered, [[knitting|knitted]] and more.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  Clothing is one of the ways that these groups distinguish themselves from each other and the world at large. Some of these garments include the huipil, the [[quechquemitl]], [[Tilmàtli|tilmas]], sandals and [[rebozo]]s.&lt;ref name="artshistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583 |title=Introduccion al Textil de la Epoca Contemporanea |author=CONACULTa |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Introduction to textiles of the modern era |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094529/http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=7041&amp;id_seccion=845583# |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ethnic groups, such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] in central Mexico commercialize their original and traditional creations as well as produce them for domestic consumption. People in coastal areas continue to plant cotton, spin it, dye it with natural elements such as [[indigo]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Indigenous clothing===
[[File:MixDressRMH.JPG|thumb|100px|Huipil on display at the Regional Museum of [[Huajuapan]].]]
Most of the pre-Hispanic clothing that survives is for women.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  These include “enredos”, or wrap dresses, fajas, or cloth belts, huipils, a type of tunic, quechquemitl, which is a kind of rectangular or square short poncho. The last was originally worn directly on the upper body of a woman but today it is worn over a blouse.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=655 |title=El Textil Artesanal en México Los Diseños |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Craft textiles in Mexico Introduction- Designs |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083815/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=655 |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose-fitting sack dresses, called huipils in Oaxaca and guanengos in [[Michoacán]], are often heavily embroidered with [[running stitch|straight stitching]], [[cross stitches|cross stitching]] and [[tuck (sewing)|tucks]] with floral and geometric motifs.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:RebozosBeltsZaachila.JPG|thumb|left|Rebozos and "fajas" or sash/belts for sale in Zaachila, Oaxaca]]
A widely used garment in both indigenous and mixed race communities is the rebozo. This is a long rectangular shawl used both as a wrap and as a means to carry children or heavy objects tied onto the body. The rebozo came about during the colonial period, not in the pre-Hispanic era.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;  The rebozo is a synthesis of three historical influences, the pre-Hispanic “mámatl,” the Spanish mantilla and the “repacejo,” an Oriental garment.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;  This is a long rectangular piece of cloth with long [[fringe (textiles)|fringes]] at both ends. Most rebozos are made with multicolored designs woven into the pieces using threads of different colors. Those of a single color are usually made of yarn or thread that has been [[tie-dye]]d to produce color variations in the final piece. This latter style is called “jaspe” or jasper and are usually woven on backstrap looms.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

The rebozo has been produced mostly in central Mexico since the colonial period, with some of the best known producers in Mexico State and Michoacan. [[Tenancingo, Mexico State|Tenancingo]] is one of the best known producers of craft rebozos, usually made of cotton but wool is also used. Traditional rebozos in the [[Lake Pátzcuaro]] area are often of white and blue over a black background and may be embroidered in tiny cross stitch.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:Sarape patrn.jpg|left|thumb|Portion of a sarape]]
Few pre-Hispanic male clothing pieces survive since many [[Mesoamerica]]n males went about nude or semi nude, causing Spanish authorities to force them to adopt European shirts and pants early. This early colonial style shirts and pants have changed little in indigenous communities and are now identified with indigenous groups, especially the [[Tarahumara]] in Chihuahua, the [[Tacuate people|Tacuates]] in Oaxaca and the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]]s in Chiapas.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  Many male garments are heavily embroidered in multiple colors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;  Since indigenous pants lack pockets, many men carry decorated bags called [[moral]]s. The only pre-Hispanic male garment to survive is the sarape, which is used only in certain areas of Mexico.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

In addition to clothing, other items are woven such as bedspreads, blankets, hats, cinches and knapsacks. The designs for these are most often woven into the fabric itself, but embroidered stars, border designs, deer, and other can be seen as well. These items may be made with various fibers include those derived from the maguey plant.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

===Embroidery===
[[File:Embroidery by Virginia Sa¦ünchez de Cornelio.jpg|thumb|left|Embroidered panel by Virginia Sanchez de Cornelio of Oaxaca]]
[[File:BlousesSkirtsHuastecaMAP.JPG|thumb|Embroidered blouses from the [[La Huasteca]] region of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].]]
One of the most distinctive aspects of indigenous handcrafted textiles is the use of embroidery. Indigenous motifs found on garments range from geometric patterns, [[zig-zag]], spirals, moons, crosses and [[fretwork|stepped frets]]. Thin cloth belts that wrap around the waist (fajillas) are common in a number of indigenous groups and are richly embroidered. The borders are often adorned with zig-zag edging, such as those of the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]s. The [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s use a moon pattern on these belts along with their morrals or carrying bags, and the Tarahumara tend to decorate theirs with triangular designs. Many of the embroidery patterns of the huipils in Oaxaca, also show pre-Hispanic influence. Flower designs are popular for embroidering women’s clothing among the Otomis, Nahuas, [[Huastecs]], Huichols and others. Spirals and curved designs appear with frequency especially in the center and south of the country.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

In addition to flowers, other themes from nature in woven and embroidered designs include plants, animals such as squirrels, rabbits, deer, armadillos, doves, hummingbirds, pelicans, seagulls and fish. [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]] embroidered belts are known for their zoomorphic designs and those of [[Santo Tomás Jalieza]] tend to have images of large plumed birds. The cloth napkins of [[San Mateo del Mar]] have images of aquatic birds such as pelicans and seagulls, with those of the Tacuates of [[Santiago Zacatepec]] have borders with many diminutive animals such as centipedes, scorpions, birds, iguanas, cats, foxes and more.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

Human figures appear with relative frequency as well. They feature prominently on the embroidered napkins of [[San Juan Colorado]] and as Danza de la Pluma dancers on the cloth belts of Santo Tomás Jalieza. Patriotic symbols such as two-headed eagles, the three colors of the Mexican flag and the eagle with serpent crest. These are most prevalent in the central region of the country among the Otomis, Nahuas, Huastecos, Huicholes and others.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;
Christian symbols such as the cross, virgins, saints, angels and other elements were introduced by evangelists in the early colonial period. These appear on small and large pieces such as men’s shirts among the Tzotzil in Chiapas, in the fabrics of [[San Miguel Ameyalco]], which feature churches, and the appearance of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in many textiles in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla|Sierra Norte]] of Puebla.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

Popular sayings or phrases also appear especially in the textiles of the Purépecha around Lake Pátzcuaro and in the state of Puebla.&lt;ref name="2uvtextil"/&gt;

===Looms===
[[File:WeavingTeotitlan1.JPG|thumb|150px|Man working on treadle loom in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca]]
Two types of looms are employed in the making are handcrafted fabrics, the pre-Hispanic backstrap loom and the introduced European foot pedal loom. Traditionally, weaving, especially on the backstrap loom, was considered to be women’s work. Women still produce items such as kitchen cloths, tablecloths, carrying bags and ornamental items with traditional designs. Although considered primitive, the backstrap loom is versatile and allows for different techniques and combinations of techniques, some of which can be very complicated. It allows for the combining of different fibers such as cotton with wool or silk.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;  Designs are woven into the cloth on this loom by changing thread colors and/or by adding items such as shells or other matter into the finished product. The backstrap loom is most prevalent in the south of the country.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;

The foot pedal loom was brought to Mexico after the Conquest. Unlike pieces done on backstrap looms, pieces done on these machines have traditionally been done by men with wool being the favored fiber.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;   This type of loom is most extensively used in the center and north of the country.&lt;ref name="1uvtextil"/&gt;  The principal advantage of this loom is that it allows for pieces of greater width than backstrap looms and has been used to create sarapes, rugs, blankets and more.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

===Rugs and other items made in Oaxaca and Mexico State===
[[File:Family of Bulmaro Pe¦ürez Mendoza finishing off a tapete.jpg|left|thumb|Bulmaro Perez Mendoza family finishing off a rug]]
Two states that continue to have significant handcrafted textile production are Oaxaca and Mexico State. Oaxaca is known for its variety of handcrafted textiles including rugs, rebozos, tablecloths and traditional clothing such as huipils. These are made backstrap looms or foot pedal looms.&lt;ref name="elcolor"&gt;{{cite news |title= El color de tus textiles |author=Alicia Boy |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=September 17, 2000 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The color of your textiles }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico State craft pieces are mostly produced in [[Jiquipilco]], [[Tejupilco de Hidalgo]], [[Temascaltepec de González]], [[Temoaya]], [[Valle de Bravo]], [[Zacazonapan]], [[Toluca]] and Tenancingo producing napkins, tablecloths, sheets, kitchen items, clothing, bathroom items, rebozos and rugs.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;
[[File:DiamanteMEAPO.JPG|thumb|150px|"Diamante Ojo de Dios" by Antonio Ruiz Gonzalez of Teotitlan del Valle at Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca]]
Both states also are significant producers of rugs. The making of knotted rugs by the Otomi in Mexico State is relatively recent. It began in 1969 when Ernesto Fernández Hurtado of the Bank of Mexico decided to promote a pilot center in Temoaya for the study and manufacture of this type of rug using traditional Otomi designs. Today, these rugs are a distinctive feature in Mexico State crafts. The rugs are made with 100% virgin wool and have an average knot density of 140,000 m2. There are about 21 different designs offered with 250 variations in colors and size.&lt;ref name="turedomex"/&gt;  Most are sold in upper-class neighborhoods of Mexico City, but due to the problem of cheap imitations, some vendors only sell from their workshops.&lt;ref name="encuentros"&gt;{{cite news |title= Encuentros con Mexico / Nudos que asombran en el Estado de Mexico|author=Ricardo Diazmunoz |author2=Maryell Ortiz de Zarate |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=August 21, 2005 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encounters in Mexico/Knots that amaze in Mexico State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teotitlán del Valle]] in Oaxaca is known for its woven rugs. Most producers make their rugs on foot pedal looms using wool dyed with [[natural dye|natural materials]] such as [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and the [[cochineal]] bug.&lt;ref name="valles"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los valles centrales de Oaxaca  |author=Carlos Puga |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=October 31, 1999 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The central valleys of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs are also produced in [[San Pablo de Mitla|Mitla]], [[Santa Ana del Valle]] and [[Tlacolula de Matamoros]] along with blankets and a type of sarape.&lt;ref name="elcolor"/&gt;  One distinguishing feature of Oaxaca rug production is the use of the cochineal insect. This insect has been used since pre-Hispanic times to dye fiber, producing colors ranging from purple to yellow, varying depending on what the ingredients, such as certain flowers or lime juice, are added. For a time, the use of natural dyes was threatened by cheaper [[synthetic dye|synthetics]] but the use of natural dyes has made a comeback.&lt;ref name="elcolor"/&gt;

===Value and protection of handcrafted textiles===
[[File:RugsTexSaleTeotitlan1.JPG|thumb|left|Rugs and other textiles for sale in Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca]]
After the Mexican Revolution, references to native Mexican cultures became fashionable, including arts crafts food and regional clothing. This was expressed in the arts by those such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Dr. Atl]].&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt;
Since that time, there have been a number of efforts to maintain and expand the textile producing traditions, especially of the south of Mexico. The Textile Museum has a collection of 4,000 pieces and is located in the former monastery of San Pablo in the [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|city of Oaxaca]]. The museum was opened in 2008 and sponsored by the [[Alfredo Harp Helú]] Foundation. The pieces include modern, colonial and pre-Hispanic textiles. Clothing items include huipils, enredos, quechquemilts, skirts, rugs and wall hangings. The collection is in three divisions Textiles of Oaxaca, Textiles of Mexico and Textiles of the World.&lt;ref name="anuncian"&gt;{{cite news |title= Anuncian nueva sede para Museo Textil de Oaxaca |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/467152.html |agency=Notimex |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=New site announced for the Textile Museum of Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sna' Jolobil, or House of the Textiles in the [[Tzotzil language]], is a cooperative of more than 600 Tzotzil and Tzeltal women in 12 municipalities in Chiapas based in [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]]. It was founded to promote and elevate the textile crafts, especially those produced on backstrap looms, with the aim of preserving traditional techniques and designs as well as promoting the economic fortunes of women weavers. The organization has a collection of antique huipils available for study and reproduction as well as workshops in weaving and producing vegetable dyes. The organization has been successful in attracting more young people into the craft. In 1986, it received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (National Prize of Sciences and the Artes) and numerous members have earned individual awards for their work.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

[[File:ClothesSaleSolidaridadDF.JPG|thumb|Traditional clothing for sale on a sidewalk in Mexico City]]
Federal agencies such as [[FONART]] and various state agencies have their own promotional efforts including annual crafts contests and the recognition of masters in various fields, including textiles.  [[Florentina López de Jesús]] is an [[Amusga people|Amusgo]] from [[Xochistlahuaca]], [[Guerrero]]. She learned to weave from her mother at six years of age as well as to prepare raw cotton and spin it into yarn. She continued to weave as well as to do other jobs to help out her family. As an adult she began to make pieces specifically for sale such as tablecloths, placemats, rebozos and huipils, traveling to [[Ometepec]] to market. Her work caught the attention of FONART in between 1969 and 1971, which led to her becoming a member of the La Flor de Xochistlahuaca artisans’ cooperative. Since then, she has given workshops to people in her region as well as the Curso de Tintes Naturales sobre Algodon (Natural Dyes for Cotton Course) in 1994 and has promoted the use of brown cotton called “coyochi.” Her work has won a number of awards including 2nd place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1987, 1st place Gran Premio de Arte Popular, FONART in 1991 and Premio Nacional de Artesanias de SECOFI in 1993.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Juan Rayón Salinas, whose parents were craftsmen, is from Mexico State. He began working with textiles in 1970, and in 1971 the state government began work to open a Centro de Capacitación de Tapiz y de Bajo Liso to introduce European techniques for making rugs. Traditionally Rayón’s hometown of [[Xonacatlán]] made wool sarapes, but he entered the center specializing in throw rugs. He work was recognized and he began to participate in exhibitions in Mexico and abroad. After working for a time with the Centro, he established his own independent workshop. His work can be seen in various cities in Mexico as well as in New York. Also from Xonacatlán, Reyna Rayón Salinas is known for her cloth belts and embroidery, which she has been making since she was 12.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Cosme Flores is from the [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|city of Tlaxcala]], son and grandson of weavers who made wool rugs. He began weaving when he was 11 along with working in agriculture. His work has won various prizes such as first place in the Concurso Estatal de Artesanias Tlaxcaltecas in 1993 and 1994. His work is also featured in a permanent exhibition at the Museo de Artes y Tradiciones Populares de Tlaxcala.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Justina Oviedo Rangel is of the [[Huave people|Huave ethnic group]] in Oaxaca. She began weaving when she was eight on her own while playing. When her mother saw her ability, she began to give her formal lessons. She specializes in napkins, placeholders and tablecloths, but also makes huipils. She also makes figures of clay. Her work has won awards such as the Concurso de Tejido de San Mateo del Mar in 1978 and various times since then until 1989.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;

Evaristo Borboa was born in Tenancingo, Mexico State, where the making of rebozos is a tradition. He began weaving when he was 12, making rebozos using a backstrap loom, rather than the European loom. This means that each of his rebozos are made individually rather 26-30 at a time, which is possible with larger looms. He is also known for his knotted or “ikat” technique as well as the jasper style. Interested in older styles of rebozos, he began in experiment in 1947 with these older designs. In the 1960s, upon visiting the Virgin of [[Zapopan]], he noticed that the image was wrapped only in a simple shawl. He offered to make the image new rebozo, something he has done every year since. Recognition has come late in Borboa's life winning awards from FONART and state agencies starting in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="maestros"/&gt;
[[File:Zinacantán - Tissage traditionnel.JPG|thumb|Woman weaving on backstrap loom in Chiapas]]
Handcrafted textiles have also been promoted as a tourist attraction in its own right. This is especially true in the state of Chiapas.&lt;ref name="piratechina"&gt;{{cite news |title= Peligra artesanía por piratería china |url= http://www.terra.com.mx/Turismo/articulo/175211/ |agency=Notimex |newspaper=Terra |location=Mexico |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Chinese pirated items putting crafts in danger }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican handcrafted textiles have experienced a resurgence of interest due to the reassessment of them as a luxury item and the rising interest in some consumer sectors in locally crafted wares. Many of these textiles are being incorporated into items sold by globally recognized brands.&lt;ref name="cnnexpan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Industria del lujo revalora la artesanía |author=Marco A. Hernández |url= http://www.cnnexpansion.com/estilo/2010/04/16/artesania-glocal |newspaper=CNN Expansión |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Luxury industry revalues crafts }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Vuitton]], who has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, sponsored an exhibition called “Historias de Tradición artesanal” (Stories of Artisan Tradition) at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="cnnexpan"/&gt;

However, handcrafted textiles not only compete with other types of imported textiles, but also countries like China and [[Guatemala]] are producing imitations of traditional Mexican indigenous designs. These can be found both inside and outside of Mexico. The Asociacion de Mujeres Empresarias in Chiapas considers the imitations to be a form of trademark infringement and puts native weavers livelihoods at risk. Organizations such as this work to have indigenous designs marked as intangible world heritage to protect it with markers for authenticity—much as is done for [[tequila]] or [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]].&lt;ref name="piratechina"/&gt;

==Current textile industry==

===Current importance of the sector===
Modern textile production in Mexico dates back to the era of Porfirio Díaz from the 1880s to 1910.&lt;ref name="porfirian"/&gt;  Today, textile production plays an important role in the [[gross domestic product]] of Mexico, since it is exported and generates employment. Textile production includes the making of thread, cloth and decoration, in both natural and synthetic fibers. It accounts for about 1.2% of the total GDP and 7.1% of the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economia.gob.mx/?P=1326 |title= Programa para la competitividad de la cadena de fribra textile-vestido |author= Oscar Escalera Antezana  |publisher= Ministry of the Economy of Mexico |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Program for the competitiveness of the fiber textile clothing chain |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth largest manufacturing activity in the country.&lt;ref name="dragon"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wharton.universia.net/index.cfm?fa=viewfeature&amp;id=911&amp;language=english |title= The Chinese Dragon Threatens Mexico’s Textile Industry |date= Feb 9, 2005  |publisher=Wharton School de la Universidad de Pennsylvania y Universia.  |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the Mexican Revolution to the mid-2000s, the sector saw steady growth. Much of the growth in the last four decades was spearheaded by “maquiladoras” or manufacturing plants along the northern border, which can import raw materials duty-free to make exportable products.&lt;ref name="meltdown"&gt;{{cite news |title= Maquila meltdown |author=BILL MONGELLUZZO |newspaper=Journal of Commerce |location=New York |date=April 14, 2003 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important textile area is the state of [[Guanajuato]], which is Mexico’s third largest producer. Some of these products include clothing, thread and sewing fabric, sheets, tablecloths, decorative pillows, rugs, carpets and tarps. Clothing items include jeans, other pants, blouses, [[tshirts]], sweaters, vests, jackets, skirts and others, for national and international brands such as [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]], Chipieco, Carhartt, Echojeans, Polo Ralph Lauren, JCPenney, Old Navy, Timberland and more.&lt;ref name="irapuato"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irapuato.gob.mx/Negocios/negociostextil.php |title=Industria Textil |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Irapuato |location=Irapuato, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Textile Industry |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the mid-2000s, the sector began to decline, mostly due to foreign competition. A significant number of jobs have been lost since 2003 as well as a number of factories. Many of these operations and jobs are shifting to Asia.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt;

===Exports to the United States===
The U.S. is the largest textile importer and almost all textile producing countries compete for a share of this market. Mexico ranks fourth in textile exports to the U.S. according to OTEXA.&lt;ref name="irapuato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="costosos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Resultan costosos textiles mexicanos |author=Myriam Garcia |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=August 9, 2005 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican textiles turn out to be costly }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico’s advantages in this market is it proximity and favorable tariffs, especially since the passage of NAFTA. In 2004, all restrictions and quotas on Mexican textiles were lifted in the United States.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

However, textile exports to the U.S. fell from more than 11 billion dollars in 2004 to just over 10 billion in 2005,&lt;ref name="demandachina"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico demandara a China por practicas ilegales; [Source: El Universal]|author=Guadalupe Hernandez Espinosa |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location=Miami |date=June 17, 2005 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexico sues China for illegal practices }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the U.S. imports more from other countries, who produce more cheaply.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;

From January through September 2004, U.S. imports of Mexican-made apparel reached $5.069 billion, 4.3% below the total registered for the same period in 2003, according to the CNIV, Mexico’s textile industry association. Meanwhile, U.S. imports of Chinese garments grew 21.7% during that period to reach $6.69 billion Yet Mexican-made products began to lose their competitiveness in the U.S. because taxes and tariffs on imports from other countries were also dropping.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

===Non-U.S. markets===
While the U.S. is by far the major market for Mexican textiles, Mexico has free-trade pacts with 43 countries, one of the largest such networks in the world. Until very recently, this did not include China, which has been seen as an “enemy” rather than as a potential trading partner. There has been changes in this as Mexico seeks to expand business ties with China, especially in attracting capital.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt; In the Americas, Mexico is part of the Central America Tree Trade Agreement,&lt;ref name="schwab"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Schwab Signs Textile Customs Cooperation Agreement with Mexico Office of the United States Trade Representative |publisher=U.S. Trade Representative |year=2007 |url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/archives/2007/january/schwab-signs-textile-customs-cooperation- |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014442/http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/archives/2007/january/schwab-signs-textile-customs-cooperation-# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently Mexico and Peru struck a deal for the import and export of clothing and other textiles.&lt;ref name="aztec21"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://azteca21.com/n/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11582:considerable-potencial-de-comercio-entre-sectores-textil-y-vestido-de-mexico-y-peru-intermoda&amp;catid=5&amp;Itemid=356|title= Considerable potencial de comercio entre sectores textil y vestido de México y Perú: INTERMODA |date=December 2009 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Considerable business potential between the textile and clothing sectors of Mexico and Peru:Intermoda |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico’s textile exports to Canada increased fivefold by the mid-2000s, raising its market share in that country to five percent. Export growth to Canada has slowed since then but remains fairly strong.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2005022-eng.htm |title= Stretching or Shrinking? The Textile and Clothing Industries in Canada |author= Diana Wyman |publisher= International Trade Division Statistics Canada |location=Canada |accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic clothing market===
Nine major chain stores control 40% of the brick-and-mortar sales, but approximately 58% of the domestic clothing market obtains its goods through illegal channels, either through smuggling, robbery or the evasion of taxes.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt; Much of the illegal Chinese textiles sold in Mexico enter through the United States, where labels are changed to avoid Mexico's 533% tariff on Chinese goods.&lt;ref name="demandachina"/&gt;

===Mexico’s international competitors===

In addition to those from China, Mexican textile exports face competition from India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt; Vietnam, Hong Kong and Central America.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="costosos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vietrival"&gt;{{cite news |title= Vietnam se convierte en rival textil para México |author= Manuel Lombera Martínez |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/finanzas/54833.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Vietnam becomes a textile rival for Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Mexican textiles held around 12% of the U.S. market while Indian textiles 3.84%. Other Asian countries with presence include Hong Kong (5.7%), Indonesia (5.3), Vietnam and Bangladesh (5% each) .&lt;ref name="indiaolvera"&gt;{{cite news |title= Supera India en textiles a Mexico |author=Silvia Olvera |author2=Alberto Barrientos |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=March 17, 2006 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=India surpasses Mexico in textiles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the reason for this is that labor costs are significantly higher in Mexico than in Asia. Mexico also has regulations that inhibit investment, as well as stricter environmental laws.&lt;ref name="mineconomy"/&gt;  Mexican fabrics cost 3.45 dollars per square meter while Chinese textiles cost 2.69 dollars. While the cost of Mexican fabric has increased 2%, those from a number of other countries in Asia and Central America have gone down. One major factor behind this is Mexico’s relatively expensive labor costs.&lt;ref name="costosos"/&gt; Another reason Asian products are cheaper is that utilities such electricity, gas and transport is cheaper.&lt;ref name="vietrival"/&gt;

China is Mexico’s most important competitor. Not only are products from this country cheaper, the supply chain in China is more organized than in Mexico. For example, most threads used to sew clothing are produced in China; Mexico produces little, creating the need to import such. This can cause production delays. Mexico is also mostly limited to the making of basic items with little added value instead of more fashionable products that sell for more. In addition, Mexico also has protectionist policies designed to inhibit foreign investment and ownership of textile production facilities in the country.&lt;ref name="dragon"/&gt;

One example of this is the [[maquiladora]] industries. Prior to the 2000s, maquiladoras owned by Asian concerns who imported materials from Asia to make products for the U.S. enjoyed the same tax advantages as those who used Mexican suppliers. However, this was changed during the beginning of the 21st century. This caused many Asian maquiladoras to close and move to Asia as the tax advantages no longer compensated for higher labor costs.&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt;

Mexico has also complained to the [[World Trade Organization]] that China has been engaging in “illegal practices” such as “dumping” (selling abroad at a price lower than local markets) to the detriment of the Mexican industry. Mexico claims that the Chinese government subsidizes textiles sales abroad to gain market share.&lt;ref name="demandachina"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11200">[[File:TheaterAufDerWiedenFloorplans.png|350px|right|thumb|Floorplan of the ground level and first balcony level, from 1789.  "Klafter" denotes a unit of measure, about 1.9 meters. From the State Archives of Upper Austria in [[Linz]]]]
The '''Theater auf der Wieden''', also called the '''Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden''' or the '''Wiednertheater''', was a theater located in the then-suburban [[Wieden]] district of [[Vienna]] in the late 18th century.  It existed for only 14 years (1787–1801), but during this time it was the venue for the premiere of no fewer than 350 theatrical works,&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 69)&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most celebrated was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.  During most of this period the director of the theater was [[Emanuel Schikaneder]], remembered today as librettist and impresario of ''The Magic Flute''.

==Origin==

The "Freihaus" was a large complex of businesses and residences belonging to the Starhemberg family.  It was located at the northern edge of the Wiedner suburb, separated from the inner city by the "Glacis", the ring of open land that surrounded inner Vienna for purposes of military defense.

The Freihaus attracted intensive development because by an earlier Imperial decree (1647) it was free from taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 43).  The exemption held good for the Starhembergs, not their tenants; presumably the heavy development of the complex occurred because the untaxed Starhembergs could offer lower rents.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex was called the "Starhembergische Freihaus" ("free-house of the Starhembergs"), from which was derived the name "Freihaus-Theater".&lt;ref&gt;Buch (2007, ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Rossbach, a theater director who had already been successfully mounting productions in Vienna for several years,&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; made an application to build a new theater in the Freihaus.  This was approved 16 March 1787,&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began, following a design by the architect Andreas Zach.  The building was completed within six months and was opened for its first performance on 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The theater was a three-story structure having a divided parterre (ground level) and two galleries (balconies).  The external walls and roof were of brick and the interior was of wood.  According to Krzeszowiak the theater had "very good acoustics".&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 81).  Krzeszowiak does not give his source for this description.&lt;/ref&gt; No description of the theater's capacity survives. The dimensions of the theater were 30 by 15 meters;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008:4).  All page references to Lorenz are from the web-posted version.&lt;/ref&gt; Buch judges that the theater must have held over 500 spectators;&lt;ref&gt;Buch (2007, ix)&lt;/ref&gt; Honolka estimates 800, then 1000 following an expansion carried out by Emanuel Schikaneder.&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 76)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage area was substantial, forming 12 meters of the 30 meter length of the building. Honolka judges that it was "planned from the beginning for opulent scenic design."&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 76), also Lorenz (2008:4)&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the plays and librettos of Emanuel Schikaneder, Buch infers "a mechanical stage with three trap doors, movable flats and backdrops, and devices to accommodate flying machines, storms, sea battles, and similar effects."&lt;ref&gt;Buch (2007, ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==

The founding director was Christian Rossbach, who served from October 1787 to March 1788.  Rossbach's venture lasted only a few months and ended in financial failure, despite a dispensation from the Emperor to perform during Lent.  He first tried playing in cheaper venues in Vienna, then left Vienna with half of his troupe to play the provinces in Moravia.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 83)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossbach was succeeded by Johann Friedel, who ran the productions from March 1788 to his death in March 1789.  Friedel worked in collaboration with his lover Eleonore Schikaneder, the estranged wife of Friedel's  former theatrical colleague Emanuel Schikaneder.  Like Rossbach Friedel was unable to make the theater a success, despite making improvements to the property and mounting as many as nine productions within a period of two weeks; Honolka comments that "they can scarcely have been properly rehearsed."&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 76)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Following Friedel's death, Eleonore reconciled with her husband and invited him to take on the directorship,&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990, 59)&lt;/ref&gt; which he held from July 1789 until the theater's closure in June 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Krzeszowiak (2009, 7-8).&lt;/ref&gt;  Schikaneder created a new troupe partly from the participants in Friedel's ensemble, and partly from personnel he brought with him from his former troupe, playing in [[Regensburg]].  The company offered "mostly German operas and plays with songs and incidental music (tragedies, comedies, and spectacles with elaborate stage machinery)".&lt;ref&gt;Buch 1997, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  The company staged [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Abduction from the Seraglio]]'' in April and May 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Buch 1997, 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1789, Schikaneder's company staged a series of fairy tale operas. These included ''[[Der Stein der Weisen]]'' (''The Philosopher's Stone''), a collaboratively written work to which Mozart contributed a small portion of the music (see [[Benedikt Schack]]). The fairy tale series culminated with the premiere in September 1791 of Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.  The latter was a success, and played for over 100 performances in its first year alone, 223 over the life of the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Yates (1995, 19)&lt;/ref&gt; It gave rise to a sequel by Schikaneder and [[Peter von Winter]] (1798) entitled ''[[The Magic Flute Second Part]]''.

The theater continued to be used for opera until 1801,&lt;ref&gt;Grove opera dictionary, "Wieden"&lt;/ref&gt; when Schikaneder moved the troupe to his newly built ''[[Theater an der Wien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove opera dictionary, "Vienna"&lt;/ref&gt;  Prince Starhemberg, an efficient businessman, promptly tore down the old theater and replaced it with apartment housing.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008:9)&lt;/ref&gt; The roof tiles were reinstalled on the parish church of [[Perchtoldsdorf]], where they can be seen to this day ([http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:At_perchtoldsdorf02.jpg]).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz (2008:11)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinion==
Published opinion concerning the theater has evolved, raising the estimation of the quality of the building and the performances therein. This rise in its estimate has paralleled shifts in Mozart biography, as the field shifts away from the traditional assessment of Mozart's later life as wretched and despairing.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, it was presented as part of Mozart's decline that he was reduced to writing for a grossly inferior theater not affiliated with the court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the building, testimony from the early Romantic era is preserved in the writings of [[Ignaz von Seyfried]] (1776–1841), who was the musical director of the theater from 1798 to 1801; he continued in this role at the Theater an der Wien until 1826.  In 1840, he wrote a contribution to the ''Neue Zeitschrift für Musik'' (12/46, 5 June 1840) in which he described the ''Theater an der Wieden'' in rather derogatory terms: "... for that limited venue, not much better than a wooden shack [German ''Holzbude''], Mozart composed his immortal Magic Flute".&lt;ref&gt;Buch 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As modern research has shown, this description is entirely false; see in particular Lorenz (2008). Of the legend, Kurt Honolka writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The loss of prestige which Schikaneder suffered at the end of the 19th century also extended to "his" theater. Of course, its simple structure could not measure up to the palatial court or civic "New Renaissance" buildings then being built. But it was of solid stone, with a tiled roof. The interior was made of wood, as was usual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Honolka (1990:75)&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern notes written for concert programs and recordings often still perpetuate the "shack" legend.&lt;ref&gt;Examples can be viewed on line: [http://www.richmondsymphony.com/events_details.asp?id=205], [http://www.columbiasymphony.org/pdf/Mozart.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional views also asserted that the standard of musical execution in the theater was poor; this for instance is the view taken in [[Hermann Abert]]'s influential Mozart biography. The modern scholar [[David Buch]], who had access to more historical materials than Abert, offers a different assessment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another  myth  about  this  theater  has  also  persisted  in  modern  literature,  namely,  that  the  music  was  of  an  inferior  quality  and  that  the  performances  were  rather  crude. While there is one derisive review of a performance at the Theater auf der Wieden by a north German commentator in 1793, most contemporary reviews were positive, noting a high standard of musical performance. &lt;ref&gt;David J. Buch, "The House Composers of the Theater auf der Wieden in the. Time of Mozart (1789-91)", available on line at [http://www.biu.ac.il/HU/mu/min-ad/06-2/2_House_Comp14-18.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SarDrama Урод репетиции 01.JPG|thumb|right|A director providing instruction]]

A '''theatre director''' or '''stage director''' is an instructor in the [[theatre]] field who oversees and orchestrates the mounting of a theatre production (a play, an [[opera]], a [[Musical theatre|musical]], or a devised piece of work) by unifying various endeavours and aspects of production. The director's function is to ensure the quality and completeness of theatre production and to lead the members of the creative team into realizing their artistic vision for it. The director therefore collaborates with a team of creative individuals and other staff, coordinating research, [[stagecraft]], [[costume design]], [[Theatrical property|props]], [[lighting designer|lighting design]], acting, [[set design]], [[stage combat]], and [[sound design]] for the production. If the production he or she is mounting is a new piece of writing or a (new) translation of a play, the director may also work with the playwright or translator. In contemporary theatre, after the [[playwright]], the director is generally the primary visionary, making decisions on the artistic concept and interpretation of the play and its staging. Different directors occupy different places of authority and responsibility, depending on the structure and philosophy of individual theatre companies. Directors use a wide variety of techniques, philosophies, and levels of collaboration.

== The director in theatre history ==
In [[ancient Greece]], the birthplace of European drama, the writer bore principal responsibility for the staging of his plays. Actors were generally semi-professionals, and the director oversaw the mounting of plays from the writing process all the way through to their performance, often acting in them too, as [[Aeschylus]] for example did. The author-director would also train the [[choir|chorus]], sometimes compose the music, and supervise every aspect of production. The fact that the director was called ''didaskalos'', the Greek word for "teacher," indicates that the work of these early directors combined instructing their performers with staging their work.&lt;ref&gt;Brocket, Oscar G.: ''History of the Theatre''. 8th ed. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jean Fouquet - The Martyrdom of St Apollonia - WGA08031.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Fouquet]]:'' The Martyrdom of St. Appollonia'' (1460), depicting the staging of a mystery play, led by a theatre director]]
In [[medieval]] times, the complexity of vernacular religious drama, with its large scale [[mystery plays]] that often included crowd scenes, processions and elaborate effects, gave the role of director (or ''stage manager'' or ''pageant master'') considerable importance. A miniature by [[Jean Fouquet]] from 1460 (pictured) bears one of the earliest depictions of a director at work. Holding a prompt book, the central figure directs, with the aid of a long stick, the proceedings of the staging of a dramatization of the ''Martyrdom of [[Saint Apollonia]]''. According to Fouquet, the director's tasks included overseeing the erecting of a stage and scenery (there were no permanent, purpose-built theatre structures at this time, and performances of vernacular drama mostly took place in the open air), casting and directing the actors (which included fining them for those that infringed rules), and addressing the audience at the beginning of each performance and after each intermission.&lt;ref&gt;Brocket, ''op.cit.'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Renaissance]] times up until the 19th century, the role of director was often carried by the ''[[actor-manager]]''. This would usually be a senior actor in a troupe who took the responsibility for choosing the repertoire of work, staging it and managing the company. This was the case for instance with [[Commedia dell'Arte]] companies and English actor-managers like [[Colley Cibber]] and [[David Garrick]].

[[Image:Stanislavsky.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of [[Constantin Stanislavski]] by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
The modern theatre director can be said to have originated in the staging of elaborate spectacles of the Meininger Company under George II, Duke of [[Saxe-Meiningen]]. The management of large numbers of extras and complex stagecraft matters necessitated an individual to take on the role of overall coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Brown, John (ed.): ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the role of the director in modern theatre, and [[Germany]] would provide a platform for a generation of emerging visionary theatre directors, such as [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Max Reinhardt]]. Simultaneously, [[Constantin Stanislavski]], principally an actor-manager, would set up the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in [[Russia]] and similarly emancipate the role of the director as artistic visionary.

The French ''regisseur'' is also sometimes used to mean a stage director, most commonly in [[ballet]]. A more common term for theatre director in French is ''metteur en scène''.

Post [[World War II]], the [[actor-manager]] slowly started to disappear, and directing become a fully fledged artistic activity within the theatre profession. The director originating artistic vision and concept, and realizing the staging of a production, became the norm rather than the exception. Great forces in the emancipation of theatre directing as a profession were notable 20th-century theatre directors like [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]],
[[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]], [[Michael Chekhov]], [[Yuri Lyubimov]] (Russia), [[Orson Welles]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] (Britain), [[Bertolt Brecht]] (Germany), [[Giorgio Strehler]] and [[Franco Zeffirelli]] (Italy).

A cautionary note was introduced by the famed director Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]] who said "the only way to learn how to direct a play, is ... to get a group of actors simple enough to allow you to let you direct them, and direct".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A number of seminal works on directing and directors include Toby Cole and Helen Krich's 1972 ''Directors on Directing: A Sourcebook of the Modern Theatre'', Edward Braun's 1982 book ''The Director and the Stage: From Naturalism to Growtowski'' and Will's ''The Director in a Changing Theatre'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1998. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director.'' University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Directing education ==
Because of the relatively late emergence of theatre directing as a performing arts profession when compared with for instance acting or musicianship, a rise of professional vocational training programmes in directing can be seen mostly in the second half of the 20th century. Most European countries nowadays know some form of professional directing training, usually at [[drama school]]s or [[College or university school of music|conservatoires]], or at universities. In Britain, the tradition that theatre directors emerge from degree courses (usually in English literature) at the [[Oxbridge]] universities has meant that for a long time, professional vocational training did not take place at drama schools or performing arts colleges, although an increase in training programmes for theatre directors can be witnessed since the 1970s and 1980s.  In American universities, the seminal directing program at the [[Yale School of Drama]] produced a number of pioneering directors with D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts) and M.F.A. degrees in Drama (rather than English) who contributed to the expansion of professional resident theaters in the 1960s and 1970s.  In the early days such programmes typically led to the staging of one major thesis production in the third (final) year.  At the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[Keith Fowler]] (a Yale D.F.A. and ex-producer of two LORT companies) led for many years a graduate programme based on the premise that directors are autodidacts who need as many opportunities to direct as possible.  Under Fowler, graduate student directors would stage between five and ten productions during their three-year residencies, with each production receiving detailed critiques.

As with many other professions in the performing arts, theatre directors would often learn their skills "on the job"; to this purpose, theatres often employ trainee assistant directors or have in-house education schemes to train young theatre directors. Examples are the [[Royal National Theatre]] in [[London]], which frequently organizes short directing courses, or the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] and the [[Donmar Warehouse]] on London's [[West End theatre|West End]], which both employ resident assistant directors on a one-year basis for training purposes.

== Styles of directing ==
Directing is an artform that has grown with the development of theatre theory and theatre practice. With the emergence of new 
trends in theatre, so too have directors adopted new methodologies and engaged in new practices.Interpretation of the drama, by the late twentieth century, had become central to the director’s work. Relativism and psychoanalytic theory influenced the work of innovative directors such as [[Peter Brook]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Peter Stein]], and [[George Strehler]]. &lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Michael: ‘’Thinking Like a Director’’ page 13. Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a show has opened (premiered before a regular audience), theatre directors are generally considered to have fulfilled their function. From that point forward the [[Stage management|stage manager]] is left in charge of all essential concerns.

The '''Victoria Theatre, Salford''', is a theatre in the [[Broughton, Salford|Lower Broughton]] area of [[Salford, Greater Manchester]], England. It is situated on Great Clowes Street, on the corner of the Elton Street. The theatre officially opened 10 December 1900 and was last in use as a bingo hall in 2008. The original capacity was 2,000 seated, this was increased to 3,000 in 1910. Palatial Leisure Limited sold the building in September 2018.

== Background ==
The Victoria Theatre, designed by [[Bertie Crewe]], was built by The Broughton Theatres Syndicate Ltd,&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Victoria Theatre (Salford) | url =http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/1829-victoria-theatre-salford | website = theatrestrust.org.uk | publisher = [[Theatres Trust]] | date = 2015 |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the same syndicate which controlled the [[Frank Matcham#Career|Regent Theatre]], Cross Lane, Salford (destroyed by fire in 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Regent Theatre of Varieties, and Assembly Rooms, Cross Lane, Salford | url = http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SalfordTheatres.htm#regent | website = arthurlloyd.co.uk | publisher = Arthur Lloyd |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's foundation stone was laid on 4 October 1899 by the actor [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]]. Accompanying Irving was [[Bram Stoker]], also in attendance were Bertie Crewe, the Civic Mayor of Salford [[Civic mayor of Salford#Mayors of Salford|Samuel Rudman]], [[Frederick Platt-Higgins]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Salford North (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford North]]), C. V. Haworth (chairman of the syndicate), a large number of the members from the Salford Corporation, and former Civic Mayors of Salford [[Civic mayor of Salford#Mayors of Salford|Sir W. H. Bailey]] and [[Civic mayor of Salford#Mayors of Salford|Sir Richard Mottram]]. Crewe presented Irving with a mallet and a silver trowel. In a short speech Irving remarked, "I have always contended that a well-conducted playhouse is a centre of rational recreation, and without rational recreation no community can pretend to have its facultics in proper order."&lt;ref name="MG_1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = New theatre for Broughton: speech by Sir Henry Irving | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 5 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/473575385 | date = 5 October 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the application for the theatre's licence was heard by the town council, Mr. J. Broxap put forward an amendment, "That the resolution of the Watch Committee be approved subject to no application being made to the Excise for the licence to sell intoxicating drink." The amendment was seconded by Mr. Haworth who added, "Persons who went in and out to get drink interrupted the performance, to the annoyance of those who desired to see the piece." The council voted 25 for the amendment to alter the theatre's licence so that alcohol could not be sold, 32 against and 1 abstention. The Mayor declared the amendment lost.&lt;ref name="Amend"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford Town Council: The licence of the Broughton Theatre - confirmation by the council | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 3 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/473680545 | date = 31 October 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2,000 seater theatre opened on 10 December 1900 with the play "''[[The Sign of the Cross (play)|Sign of the Cross]]''," performed by [[William Greet]]'s company, with Edward Vincent as the Prefect and Virginia Buckle as the Christian girl Mercia. The front of the theatre was described as "red terra-cotta, divided by [[Pilaster|Ionic pilasters]] into five bays" and the foyer was described as "a hall 34 feet long and 18 feet wide, with marble mosaic floor, walls panelled in fibrous plaster, and hand-painted ceiling". The dimensions of the stage were also recorded as "Its width is 74 feet, the distance from the curtain line to the back wall is 40 feet, the distance from stage to grid is 50 feet, and the proscenium opening is 30 feet in width.&lt;ref name="MG_2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Opening of the Victoria Theatre, Broughton | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] |page = 4 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/473713520 | date = 11 December 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use as a cinema ==
In November 1901, less than a year after opening, the theatre began showing films and in 1913 it was granted a cinema licence.&lt;ref name=Cinema_Treasures&gt;{{cite web | title = Victoria Theatre | url = http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2056 | website = cinematreasures.org | publisher = Cinema Treasures | access-date = 6 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner/managers, Messrs J. P. Moore &amp; Montague Beadyn, also increased the capacity in 1910 from 2,000 to 3,000. However, from 1917 to 1919 the venue became a theatre once more.&lt;ref name="TT" /&gt;

In 1919 the theatre consultant Mr. Watson redesigned the auditorium with interior paintings and a Tudor Café and the theatre became predominantly a cinema again under H. D. Moorhouse,&lt;ref name=TM_2&gt;{{cite news | last = Parkinson | first = J.

== 1958–1971 ==
Following the cinema's closure in July 1958 the theatre was used as a clothing / furniture store with some performances by repertory groups, including Venture Productions, and pantomimes being staged during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="TT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TM_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt;

From the mid 1960s until the summer of 1971, the theatre was owned by a Salford businessman, Councillor Sam Goldberg.&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt; Goldberg allowed repertory groups such as Venture Productions to put on productions rent free.&lt;ref name="Guardian_rep"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Warehouse may be theatre again: company accepts offer | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 10 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/184767720 | date = 19 August 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used the theatre as winter headquarters for his own Southport Repertory Company.&lt;ref name="Guardian_Southport"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford loses last theatre | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 6 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/185463291 | date = 30 December 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg tried unsuccessfully to sell the freehold to Salford City Council, in the hope that they might operate the building as a civic theatre and arts centre. Talks stalled after it was estimated that the cost of modernising the building could be about £80,000, the theatre was running at a loss at the time of Goldberg's death.&lt;ref name="Guardian_Southport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughing"&gt;{{cite web | title = Victoria Theatre Salford (blog) | url = http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/victoria-theatre-salford.html | website = laughingaudience.co.uk | publisher = Laughing Audience |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Councillor Cecil Franks, the chairman, said it was hopeless to try to maintain a "Victorian relic" of this size in its present form.&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford may lose theatre | work = [[The Observer]] | publisher = [[ProQuest]] | page = 5 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/185581918 | date = 27 October 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg died prior to the North Manchester Amateur Operatic Society's production of "''[[The Quaker Girl]]''", May–June 1971, (music by [[Lionel Monckton]], lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]] and [[Percy Greenbank]]), the theatre then lay dark.&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt;

== Use as a bingo hall ==
After a brief unsuccessful attempt to run the venue as a bingo hall in 1973 the theatre closed again. It then remained dark until the 1980s when a second attempt was successful and the bingo hall remained open until 2008.&lt;ref name="TT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AL" /&gt; The theatre became a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II Listed Building]] on 18 January 1980.&lt;ref name="Historic"&gt;{{cite web | title = Former Victoria Theatre | url = https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1386137 | website = historicengland.org.uk | publisher = [[Historic England]] |accessdate= 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its time as a bingo hall in the 1980s the building was severely damaged when its third floor was removed and replaced with a less ornate brick wall.&lt;ref name=ATV&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Salford residents rally to save historic local theatre | work = [[ATV Today]] | publisher = [[Associated Television|ATV]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160514034751/http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/1900-salford-residents-rally-to-save-historic-local-theatre-68/ | archive-date = 14 May 2016 | url = http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/1900-salford-residents-rally-to-save-historic-local-theatre-68/ | date = 25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual arts in Israel''' refers to [[Plastic arts|plastic art]] created in the [[Land of Israel]]/[[Palestine region]], from the later part of the 19th century until today, or art created by [[List of Israeli artists|Israeli artists]]. Visual art in [[Israel]] encompasses a wide spectrum of techniques, styles and themes reflecting a dialogue with [[Jewish art]] throughout the ages and attempts to formulate a national identity.&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/3689/a-century-of-israeli-art-on-view-in-berlin/|title=A Century of Israeli Art, on View in Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bonfils, Félix (1831-1885) - 613 - Joueurs de violon bedouins.jpg|thumb|[[Félix Bonfils]]&lt;br /&gt;''Beduin violin players'', 1880s]]
[[File:19th century embroidery.jpg|thumb|Temple mount map and buildings, late 19th century&lt;br /&gt;embroidery&lt;br /&gt;private collection.]]

Early art in the Land of Israel was mainly [[decorative art]] of a religious nature (primarily [[Jewish]] or [[Christian]]), produced for religious [[pilgrims]], but also for export and local consumption. These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, rubber stamps, etc., most of which were decorated with [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] from [[graphic arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, ''Art and Artisan in the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1979, Israel Museum) (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jewish settlements artists worked at [[gold smithing]], silver smithing, and embroidery, producing their works in small crafts workshops. A portion of these works were intended to be amulets. One of the best known of these artists, [[Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi]] of Jerusalem made Shiviti (or Shivisi, in the Ashkenazic pronunciation, meditative plaques used in some Jewish communities for contemplation over God's name) on glass and amulets on parchments, with motifs such as the Sacrifice of Isaac, the [[Book of Esther]], and views of the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Western Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Haviva Peled, "Seven Artists", in Fischer (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Objects of applied art were produced also at the "[[Torah ve-Melakhah]]" ("Torah and Work") school founded in 1882 by the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, "First Starts: Torah and Work", in [http://www.openu.ac.il/zmanim/zmanim103/download/zmanim103-ofrat.pdf ''Zmanim''], 103, Summer 2008 (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This school opened departments for the production of art objects in [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] and [[Baroque]] styles, produced by combining manual labor with modern machines.

A large body of artistic work was produced by European artists, primarily Christian painters, who came to document the sites and landscapes of the "[[Holy Land]]". The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation – first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] – of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Parry, ''Jerusalem 1861: Impressions'' (1978, Ariel)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore an ethnographic approach is in evidence in the photographs, which present a static and stereotypical image of the figures they depict. In the photographs of the [[France|French]] photographer [[Felix Bonfils]] such as, for example in his prominent photographs of the Holy Land in the last decades of the 19th century, we even see an artificial desert background, in front of which his figures are posed At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, local photographers began to appear, the most important of whom is [[Khalil Raad]], who focused on an ethnographic description of the reality of the Holy Land, in large part colonialistic. In addition there were other photographers, many of them Armenian, who worked as commercial photographers in the Land of Israel and neighboring countries.

In the 1920s, many Jewish painters fleeing pogroms in Europe settled in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;

==Art of "The Land of Israel", 1906–1932==

===Bezalel===
[[File:Ehad haam school3.jpg|thumb|"Hebron", homemade glazed tiles made at the ceramics workshop at Bezalel.]]

Until the beginning of the 20th century no tradition of fine arts existed in the Land of Israel although European artists came as visitors and painted the "Holy Land". Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the “Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts,” known as "[[Bezalel]]", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.

At the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British "[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine "''Yalkut Bezalel''", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption "Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction".&lt;ref&gt;Yael Granot, "Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. "There is a practical side to the study of art", Schatz wrote, "The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

In the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the "Eastern" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as "Jewish" motifs and designs they perceived as "Eastern". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865–1908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as "[[Jugendstil]]" ["Youth Style" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were "Orientalist" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lachovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.

Due to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.

===Land of Israel modernism movement===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture פסל הארי השואג בתל חי.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]&lt;br /&gt;The Roaring Lion, 1928–1934&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Hai]]]]

At the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more "subjective" art. this Period often called The "[[Tower of David Period]]". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.

The monument "The Roaring Lion" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the "Assyrian-Mesopotamian" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. "For many generations", Melnikov asserted, "the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it".&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Other young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the "Hebrew Artists Association" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an "Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the "Bezalel Art" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.

Another organization of Israel artists was called "Egged" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Haim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called "The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930".

To a significant extent the modern painters began to create a "Hebrew" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward naïve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the "Land of Israel School".

Among the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting "Resting at Noon" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this naïve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.

This approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the "Railway Crossing at Herzl Street" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.

Reuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in "Sophie, Bukharin Jewess" (1924) and "Dancers from Miron" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In "First Fruits" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in "First Fruits" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.

In spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.

===Armenian ceramic art===

In 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.

The central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884–1953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[St. John's Ophthalmic Hospital]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52&lt;/ref&gt; As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts—frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.

The artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Khirbat al Mafjar]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.

[[File:Larski Human hand's 001.jpg|thumb|[[Helmar Lerski]], Human hands, 1933–1940]]

The return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time it should be noted that these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the "Parisian" influence was expressed in a "dynamic softness that melts heavy structures", German art and the "[[New Objectivity]]" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Efrat, "Anorexia Artistica" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the "[[Bauhaus]]". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.

One sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the "New Bezalel". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, "Bezalel", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, "The Fleece" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.

Even more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as {{ill|Zoltan Kluger|he|זולטן קלוגר}}, [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.

[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called "metamorphosis by means of light"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.
Another artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.&lt;ref&gt;Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canaanite movement===
{{Main|Canaanism}}
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Itzhak Danziger]]&lt;br /&gt;Nimrod, 1939&lt;br /&gt;The [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem Collection]]
[[File:Amos kenan.JPG||thumb|[[Amos kenan]]&lt;br /&gt;Messiah, 1966&lt;br /&gt;Tefen Open Museum]]

In 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908–1981) published "Epistle to Hebrew Youth", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of "[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew–speaking nation with an independent identity.

The visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.

One of the most significant artists of the "Canaanite" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was "to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us".&lt;ref&gt;Amos Kenan, "Greater Israel", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.

Danziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures "[[Nimrod]]" (1939) and "[[Shabazia]]" (1939). When "Nimrod" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against "Nimrod" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of "Jewishness". To a significant extent "Nimrod" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the "New Jewish Man".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that "Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation…Nimrod will be young forever".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Agrippas vs. Nimrod", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about "Nimrod" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the "Canaanite" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in "primitive" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the "New Horizons" group.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, "The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avant Garde: the 1950s and 1960s==
In the 1950s and 1960s Israeli artists began exploring the idiom of the Avant-garde current in Europe and the United States. Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Horizons===
[[File:Zaritsky, Yossef, Painting, 1950-1~B74 0036.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Zaritsky]]&lt;br /&gt;Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949&lt;br /&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]

[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]&lt;br /&gt;Growth, 1959&lt;br /&gt;Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]

The germination of the "New Horizons" ("Ofakim Hadashim") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name "the Group of Eight", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called "The Group of Seven" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group stated that "The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the "New Horizons". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.

The group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group – Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called "lyrical abstract", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the "Land of Israel" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.

For example, in his series "Yehiam" (1949–1952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.

Others in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.

In the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.

Indeed, during the 1950s, the "New Horizons" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism and Social art===
While the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as "regionalism".&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, "Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period – World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.

The quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

New Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim – his series "Yehiam", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950–1952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced "Wheat Sheaves" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted "Soldiers", "Air raid Alarms" and "Maabarot" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the "Center for Advanced Culture" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement "[[Hashomer Hatzair]]".&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.

Mordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting "Gate of Light" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.

Ever since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].

===Abstract art after New Horizons===
During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[New Horizons group]] influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.

New Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called "Tazpit" ("Outlook"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&amp;nbsp;cm 1971]]
One of the artists on the fringe of the "New Horizons" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, "Red House (How Are Things at Home?)" (1960),&lt;ref&gt;For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, "The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; "Sarajevo Manuscript" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works "The High Commissioner" (1966) and "Agripas Street" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, "The High Commissioner", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the "Caananite" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.&lt;ref&gt;See: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Agrippas vs. Nimrod", Kav, 9, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the "New Horizons" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.
Abstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions to this are the works "With beers, beers, and more beers" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works "Fraction and Time", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues "life experience as the layers accumulate".&lt;ref&gt;See: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963–1984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local Art Between Wars, 1967–1982==
[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]&lt;br /&gt;''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]

Until the 1970s, mainstream Israeii art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the "ars poetica" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.

===Art of Protest===
Among the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, "Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin", in Studio, 76, October–November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; His early works, such as "Panic Over Trousers" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture "Take Me Under Your Wings"(1964–65) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See Ellen Ginton, "The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture "He Walked in the Fields" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the "mythological Sabra"; Tumarkin strips off his "skin" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by "[[Earth Art]]", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.

After the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.

==="Want of Matter"===
[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]&lt;br /&gt;Untitled, 1969&lt;br /&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]
[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]&lt;br /&gt;Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]

In the mid-1960s a group called "[[10+]]" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the "lyric abstraction" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschit]]z, and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although "10+" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school "The College" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called "The Want of Matter".

The theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit "The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the "non-aesthetic" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.

According to Breitberg-Semel, "The Want of Matter" began with the painting of the "[[New Horizons]]" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the "lyrical abstract", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called "The Want of Matter", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.

Visually, "[[Want of Matter]]" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.

In an article accompanying "The Want of Matter" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work "typifies the Tel Aviv spirit", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally "native" and "Sabra" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: "The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'"; See: Doron Rabina, "The Drawing Itself". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's paintings, which include "childish" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words "head" or "geranium" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,&lt;ref&gt;This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; came to epitomize "The Want of Matter" style.

In addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its "artistic language" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the "halo" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.&lt;ref&gt;See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and "content".&lt;ref&gt;Michal Neeman, "Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here", 2, 1999, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in "The College". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as "The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly" (1979) and "The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation " If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a "toy forest".&lt;ref&gt;See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Breitling-Semel, "Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Against the background of the visual dimension of "The Want of Matter" Style, texts written in commercial style&lt;ref&gt;Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.&lt;/ref&gt; or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in "The Loyal Fish and the Bird" (1977) or "The Message According to the Bird" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series "The Blue Retouching" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.

In spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as "Bicycle" (1977) or "The Princess in the Palace" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work "bursts out " of its frame and spreads out into space.

===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===
[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]&lt;br /&gt;''Energy'', 1969&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]

Conceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yochevet Weinfeld]], [[Adina Baron]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinhas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading ‘taste’ while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)

The axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva’s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.

Ullman’s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration –five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.

[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]
Joshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.

Efrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.

Efrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art "epistemic abstraction". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal—the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric—that is, obedient and “blind”—reproductive mechanism.

These dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 "Art and Language", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum "Eyes of the Nation" by Ellen Ginton 2008.

[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]&lt;br /&gt;Levitation, 1976]]
The perception of "The Want of Matter" as the "center" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the "Tel Aviv School", "The New Jerusalem School", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the "Tel Aviv School", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the "Jerusalem" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.&lt;ref&gt;Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed "conceptuality" to "picturesqueness", universal abstraction to specific locality.&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, "Memories of the Seventies", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like "activity" and "concept", instead of terms like "installation" and "display", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.&lt;ref&gt;See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or "concrete, " that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.&lt;ref&gt;See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.

Ellen Ginton, in her article "The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries " (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, "Memories of the Seventies", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ginton, "The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Place", "Concept" and "Action"===
[[File:NeusteinJerusalemRiverProject.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Neustein]], [[Gerard Marx]], [[Georgette Batlle]], "Jerusalem River Project", 1970]]

One of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create "The Jerusalem River Project". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26–32. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

This work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward "[[Land Art]]". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the "Land of Israel" and the "Orient", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the "New Horizons" school can be clearly seen.

In the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of "Land Art" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The "repair" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project "The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. "Nature should not be returned to its natural state", Danziger contended. "A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept".&lt;ref&gt;In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.

Another example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, "bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches […] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish"&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Barzel, "Landscape As a Work of Art" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as "Metzer-Messer" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88–89. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, "Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using "impoverished" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as "Earth Crucifixion" (1981) and "Bedouin Crucifixion" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created "crucifixion pillars"&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82–83. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; for these lands.

Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the "Leviathians", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and "land art" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words "America", "Africa", and "Green card" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238–240. Also: Gideon Efrat, ''Beit Avraham Ofek'' (Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 1986), p. 35. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity and the Body===
[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]&lt;br /&gt;Exposure (Installation view), 1975]]

The landscape as a space for [[performance]] and expressions of [[gender]], which occupied center stage in American art of this period, never caught on in Israel as it did in the [[United States]]. [[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image – The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work "Letter to Beuys" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.

In his work "Via Dolorosa" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, ''"The Heart of Things", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971–1986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition "Exposure" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.

===Political art===
After the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.

One of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work "Touching the Border" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In "Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about "Israel 25 Years Hence", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, "A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland".&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] ("Gabi and Sharon") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, "Who needs a parade?" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.

[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was "Head Sculpture", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter "T", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision".&lt;ref&gt;See: Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image – The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work "A Gentle Hand" (1975–1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: "All Her Heart She Gave Him" and the first words of which are "A gentle hand", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904–1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, "Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;Irit Segoli, "My Red is Your Precious Blood", Studio, 76, October–November 1996, pp. 38-39. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NeusteinStillLifeOnTheBorder.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, "Still Life On The Border", Tel-Hai, Israel, 1983]]

===The 1980s in Israeli Art===
[[File:Nahum Tevet, Jemmáin, 1986, Coll. Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]&lt;br /&gt;Jemmáin, 1986&lt;br /&gt;Kunsthalle, Manheim]]

Most of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American "[[Neo-Geo]]" style, the "Pop Art" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as "[[Bad Painting]]", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.

These international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of "the high" and "the low" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.&lt;ref&gt;See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.

In parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.

If in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with "protest". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as "Green Line With Green Eyes" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-naïve style, combined with captions like "Here is Arara" or "Umm Al-Fahm".

[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled "Tsoba". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Jossef Zaritsky]], in which he "erased", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.

Artistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.

In the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.

[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named "Shelter 209", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the "[[Zik Group]]", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.

===The 1990s and After===

The 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the "[[Art Focus]]" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).

As part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.

In the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.

In works such as "Temple Mount" (1995) or "Country" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined "primitive" images with modernist values. In his work "The Clinic" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work "The Boy From South Tel Aviv" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition "Real Time"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition "Yotam" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.

In the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as "Keffiyah" and "Biladi", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.

The tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the "Sabra" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series "Jericho First" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.

The photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death. In the untitled photograph (1999) that has come to be known as "The Last Supper", soldiers sit around a table in a tableau reminiscent of "The Last Supper" of Leonardo da Vinci.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">The '''World Crafts Council AISBL (WCC-AISBL)''' is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that was founded in 1964 to promote fellowship, foster economic development through income generating craft related activities, organize exchange programs, workshops, conferences, seminars, and exhibitions—and in general, to offer encouragement, help, and advice to the craftspersons of the world. The organization is now formally registered in Belgium as an international organization and ''AISBL'' is there the french shortcut for an ''international [[association without lucrative purpose]]''. The WCC is organised into five regions: Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The organization is affiliated to [[UNESCO]].

The WCC was founded in 1964 by [[Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay|Kamaladevi Chattopadhay]] and [[Aileen Osborn Webb]] (who had founded the [[American Craft Council]] in 1943.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftvic.org.au/resources/craft-culture/2002/global-peace-through-craft-the-formation-of-the-world-crafts-council ''Global Peace Through Craft: The Formation of the World Crafts Council'', By Sandra Alfoldy], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The WCC (Europe) meets once a year and the 2011 meeting was held in [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture360.org/event/dublin-world-crafts-council-europe-conference/ ''Dublin: World Crafts Council Europe conference'', by Judith Staines], 17 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Crafts Council meets every four years. In 2012, the General Assembly occurred in [[Chennai]] when [http://www.kaivalam.com/ Usha Krishna] was the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaivalam.com ''Kaivalam''] Kaivalam Craft Summit&lt;/ref&gt; After this General Assembly the Presidency will move from India to China. Mr. Wang Shan was the president, Ms. Jing Chen was the Secretary General. In 2014, WCC Golden Jubliee Celebration Summit was held in Dongyang, China, more than 2000 craftpeople from 63 countries participated. In 2016, the General Assembly occurred in [[Isfahan, Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://isfwcc.ir/wcc18th/Introduction.aspx , ''The 18th General Assembly of the World Crafts Council Isfahan''], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; from September 22 to 29.
