The '''1886 Belfast riots''' were a series of intense riots that occurred in [[Belfast]], Ireland during the summer and autumn of 1886.

==Background==
[[File:United Kingdom general election 1885 in Ireland.svg|thumb|left|Irish Nationalists had seized the vast majority of Irish seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885 (Ireland)|1885 election]], and would maintain this dominance in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886 (Ireland)|1886 election]] onwards.]]
In the late 19th century [[Catholics]] began to migrate in large numbers to the prosperous [[Ulster Protestant]] city of [[Belfast]] in search of work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marianne Elliott]], (2000), ''The Catholics of Ulster: A History'', London: Penguin, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the riots Catholics made up over one-third of the population of the city.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott (2000), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; This migration brought with it sectarian tensions as Catholics and Protestants competed for jobs.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; As the minority, Catholics found themselves discriminated against in this area and were kept at the lower end of the labour market.&lt;ref name="Elliott2"&gt;Elliott (2000), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time there was a real possibility that the British government would establish a [[devolution|devolved]] Irish parliament (see: [[Irish Home Rule Movement]]). Belfast Catholics believed that a devolved Irish government would be sympathetic to their situation and end the discrimination. Belfast Protestants believed this too and feared the end of their privileged position.&lt;ref name="Elliott2"/&gt;

In April 1886 Prime Minister [[William Gladstone]] introduced a [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|home rule bill]]. On 8 June the bill was defeated in the House of Commons.

==Riots==
The introduction of the bill led to renewed sectarian tensions in Belfast. On 3 June a Catholic [[navvy]] sneered to a Protestant co-worker that under an Irish government Protestants would never get hired, even in Belfast. This represented the very worst fears of Protestants towards Home Rule and the story quickly spread throughout Belfast. This led to clashes between Protestant and Catholic labourers on the shipyards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Home_RuleThe_Elections_of_1885__1886#14The1886HomeRuleriots UUC History Faculty: The 1886 Home Rule Riots] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204232813/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Home_RuleThe_Elections_of_1885__1886 |date=4 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Reverend Hugh Hanna (1824–1890).jpg|thumb|Preachers such as [[Hugh Hanna]] played a prominent role in encouraging rioters.]]
The riots intensified on 8 June, the day that the home rule bill was defeated in parliament. Celebrations were held throughout the city to celebrate the defeat. Some of those celebrating attacked Catholic homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="Bardon"&gt;Jonathon Bardon (2001), ''A History of Ulster'', Belfast: The Blackstaff Press, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The police found themselves unable to cope with the situation. Reinforcements were sent in from other parts of Ireland. Most of the reinforcements were Catholic. A rumour that the reinforcements were sent by Gladstone to punish Belfast Protestants for opposing Home Rule spread throughout the city.&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt; It was encouraged by popular preachers such as [[Hugh Hanna]].&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt; The rioters thus began to attack the police, and later soldiers.&lt;ref name="Bardon2"&gt;Bardon (2001), p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; Running battles between security forces and rioters lasted until 14 June.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd (1987), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June the reinforcements were sent home by the city government, although some were kept as trouble was expected on [[The Twelfth|12 July]], the date of annual Protestant celebrations.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Boyd (1987), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Trouble did indeed erupt on the 12th and, contrary to the expectations of the government, the police found themselves overwhelmed by the Protestant attackers.&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; Reinforcements had to be sent into Belfast again and the threat of over 2,000 police officers and soldiers descending on the city caused the rioters to quit by the 14th.&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;

On the last Saturday of July Hanna held his annual outing for the Protestant children of Belfast. This outing usually involved a trip out to the country with marching and drum along the way. Hanna agreed to comply with the city's request that he forgo the drumming and marching due to the tense situation.&lt;ref name="Boyd2"&gt;Boyd (1987), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As the outing made its way through Belfast disappointed local Protestants joined in to march with their own drums and anti-Catholic banners. Marchers deliberately provoked the Catholics by marching into Catholic areas.&lt;ref name="Boyd2"/&gt; Taunting quickly gave way to heavy street fighting between Catholics, Protestants and police.&lt;ref name="Boyd2"/&gt; Bloody clashes on a par with the riots in June lasted for a few days, but low-intensity rioting continued until September.&lt;ref name="Bardon2"/&gt;

Officially thirty-one people were killed in the riots, although George Foy, who made surgical reports on the riots, reckoned that the real death toll might have been as high as fifty.&lt;ref name="Bardon2"/&gt; Hundreds were injured. Over four hundred arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd (1987), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated £90,000 worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity was significantly compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Budge and Cornelius O'Leary, (1973), ''Belfast: Approach to Crisis. A Study of Belfast Politics, 1613–1970'', London: MacMillan Press., p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*[[Reginald Edward Harry Dyer]], who gained notoriety for his role in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]], was deployed to Belfast with the British Army to perform riot control duties.

The '''2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar''' began on 25 August of that year when the Myanmar military forces and local [[Buddhism and violence|Buddhist extremists]] started attacking the [[Rohingya people]] and committing atrocities against them in the country's north-west Rakhine state. The atrocities included attacks on Rohingya people and locations, looting and burning down Rohingya villages, mass killing of Rohingya civilians, gang rapes, and other sexual violence.

Using statistical extrapolations (based on six pooled surveys conducted with a total of 2,434 Rohingya refugee households in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh,) Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) estimated in December 2017 that during the persecution, the military and the local Buddhists killed at least 10,000 Rohingya people.&lt;ref name=ABC-10000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/sites/usa/files/summary_of_findings_-_msf_mortality_surveys_-_coxs_bazar.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111164514/https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/sites/usa/files/summary_of_findings_-_msf_mortality_surveys_-_coxs_bazar.pdf# |archive-date=2018-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 392 Rohingya villages in Rakhine state were reported as burned down and destroyed,&lt;ref name="OHCHR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23575&amp;LangID=E|title=Myanmar: UN Fact-Finding Mission releases its full account of massive violations by military in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States|last=|first=|date=|website=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001070325/https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23575&amp;LangID=E#|archive-date=2018-10-01|dead-url=no|access-date=30 September 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the looting of many Rohingya houses,&lt;ref name=Reuters-Investigates-Massacre/&gt; and widespread gang rapes and other forms of sexual violence against the Rohingya Muslim women and girls.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent-Rape/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyStar-Rape/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-Rape/&gt; The military drive also displaced a large number of Rohingya people and made them refugees. According to the United Nations reports, {{as of|2018|September|lc=y}}, over 700,000 Rohingya people had fled or had been driven out of Rakhine state who then took shelter in the neighboring [[Bangladesh]] as refugees. In December 2017, two Reuters journalists who had been covering the [[Inn Din massacre]] event were arrested and imprisoned. Foreign Secretary Myint Thu told reporters Myanmar is prepared to accept 2,000 Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/regional/myanmar-prepares-for-the-repatriation-of-2000-rohingya|title=Myanmar prepares for the repatriation of 2,000 Rohingya|website=The Thaiger|access-date=1 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101055259/https://thethaiger.com/news/regional/myanmar-prepares-for-the-repatriation-of-2000-rohingya#|archive-date=2018-11-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, news agency [[Reuters]] uncovered a [[massacre]] event that took place in the Rakhine state's Inn Din village on 2 September 2017. It is known as [[Inn Din massacre]]. Ten Rohingya men, who were captured from the Rohingya villagers of Inn Din, were massacred by the members of Myanmar army and the Buddhist villagers who formed an "informal militia" to attack the Rohingya villages.&lt;ref name=Reuters-Investigates-Massacre&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-rakhine-events/ |title=Massacre in Myanmar: One grave for 10 Rohingya men |author=Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo |date=8 February 2018 |work=[[Reuters]] |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211050619/https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-rakhine-events/# |archive-date=2018-02-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were taken from the hundreds of Rohingya villagers who gathered near a beach to seek safety.&lt;ref name=Al-Jazeera-Action/&gt; Reuters was able to identify all the ten victims: five of the men were fishermen, two were shopkeepers, one was an Islamic teacher, and the last two were high school students.

===Village burning and looting===
[[File:Aerial view of a burned Rohingya village in Rakhine state, Myanmar - September 2017.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of a burned Rohingya village in Rakhine state, Myanmar, September 2017]]
In September 2018, the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar released a report stating that at least 392 Rohingya villages in Rakhine state had been razed to the ground since 25 August 2017.&lt;ref name="OHCHR" /&gt; Earlier, [[Human Rights Watch]] in December 2017 said it had found that 354 Rohingya villages in Rakhine state were burnt down and destroyed by the Myanmar military.&lt;ref name=VOA-354-villages&gt;{{cite news|title=New Rohingya Villages Destroyed in Myanmar|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-new-rohingya-villages-destroyed-in-myanmar/4168511.html|newspaper=VOA News|date=18 December 2017|author=|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124175944/https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-new-rohingya-villages-destroyed-in-myanmar/4168511.html#|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These destructions included thousands of structures, mainly homes used by the Rohingya Muslims. Chris Lewa, director of The Arakan Project, has blamed the security forces of burning village after village in a systematic way while also blaming Rohingya arsonists of burning the Buddhist village of Pyu Ma.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Sep01/&gt; A video provided to [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] by a human rights monitor purportedly shows the village burning and in another clip of freshly dug earth mound, allegedly graves of those killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Villagers slaughtered in Myanmar 'massacre', reports of women and children among more than 100 dead|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-01/reports-of-women-and-children-among-dead-in-myanmar-massacre/8862164|accessdate=1 September 2017|work=ABC News|date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831234421/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-01/reports-of-women-and-children-among-dead-in-myanmar-massacre/8862164#|archive-date=2017-08-31|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Inn Din massacre]] in early September 2017, members of Myanmar military and the Buddhist villagers of Inn Din looted the Rohingya hamlets in the Inn Din village and then burned down the Rohingya houses.&lt;ref name=Reuters-Investigates-Massacre/&gt; Several Buddhist villagers later confessed to [[Reuters]] that they set fire to the Rohingya houses with [[kerosene]], and also took part in the massacre on 2 September. The 33rd Light Infantry Division of Myanmar Army, the 8th Security Police Battalion, and the Buddhist villagers took part in the looting which included Rohingya property, goats, cows, cattle, and motorcycles. Thant Zin Oo, the commander of the 8th Battalion, later sold the cows and the cattle in exchange for money.&lt;ref name=Reuters-Investigates-Massacre/&gt;

===Gang rapes and sexual violence===
In November 2017, both the UN officials and the [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that the Armed Forces of Myanmar were committing widespread [[gang rape]]s and other forms of [[sexual violence]] against the Rohingya Muslim women and girls for the last three months.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent-Rape&gt;{{cite news |title=Rohingya crisis: Burmese military guilty of widespread rape of fleeing women and girls, Human Rights Watch says |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/rohingya-crisis-latest-today-burmese-military-rape-accusation-human-rights-watch-muslim-refugees-a8057846.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=16 November 2017 |author=Michelle Nichols |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212142155/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/rohingya-crisis-latest-today-burmese-military-rape-accusation-human-rights-watch-muslim-refugees-a8057846.html# |archive-date=2018-02-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyStar-Rape&gt;{{cite news |title=Rohingya women gang-raped by Myanmar army |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/rohingya-girls-gang-raped-myanmar-army-1490278 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=13 November 2017 |author= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203123834/http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/rohingya-girls-gang-raped-myanmar-army-1490278# |archive-date=2018-02-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-Rape&gt;{{cite news |title=Rohingya Were Raped Systematically by Myanmar’s Military |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-rapes.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 November 2017 |author=Rick Gladstone |access-date=2018-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203125955/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-rapes.html?_r=0# |archive-date=2018-02-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Armed Forces, the Myanmar [[Border Guard Police]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist militias]] of Rakhine were also involved in these atrocities. HRW stated that these gang rapes and sexual violence were committed as part of the military's ethnic cleansing campaign while the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten stated that the Rohingya women and girls were made the "systematic" target of rapes and sexual violence because of their ethnic identity and religion. Other forms of sexual violence included [[sexual slavery]] in military captivity, forced public nudity, and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-myanmar/u-n-official-says-will-raise-sexual-violence-against-rohingya-with-icc-idUSKBN1DC0N7 |title=U.N. official says will raise sexual violence against Rohingya with ICC |author=Serajul Quadir |date=12 November 2017 |work=Reuters |publisher= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203041614/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-myanmar/u-n-official-says-will-raise-sexual-violence-against-rohingya-with-icc-idUSKBN1DC0N7# |archive-date=2018-02-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyStar-Rape/&gt; Some women and girls were raped to death while others were found carrying raw wounds and being traumatized after they had arrived in refugee camps in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=DailyStar-Rape/&gt; Human Rights Watch reported of a 15-year-old girl who was ruthlessly dragged on the ground for over 50 feet and then was raped by 10 Myanmar soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=5 reasons the U.N.

According to the ''Mission report of OHCHR'' (released on 11 October 2017 by the [[United Nations]] Office of the [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]]), the Myanmar military in early August 2017 began a "systematic" process of driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from Myanmar.

== Criticism ==
The 2017 persecution against the Rohingya people garnered strong criticism from all across the world, and created grave concern about the human rights issues. International communities and human rights officials have described the violence as [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]]. Soon after the security forces and Buddhist militia started "clearance operations", the world leaders warned the Myanmar authority to avoid civilian casualties.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Sep01/&gt; In late September, a seven-member panel of the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] accused Myanmar of conducting [[genocide]] against the Rohingya and the Kachin minority groups.&lt;ref name=PPT-Straits-Times&gt;{{cite news |title=Permanent Peoples Tribunal finds Myanmar guilty of genocide |url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/09/282864/permanent-peoples-tribunal-finds-myanmar-guilty-genocide |newspaper=New Straits Times |date=22 September 2017 |author=Bernama |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201192958/https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/09/282864/permanent-peoples-tribunal-finds-myanmar-guilty-genocide# |archive-date=2018-02-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PPT-Daily-Star&gt;{{cite news |title=Myanmar found guilty of genocide |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/mayanmar-rohingya-refugee-crisis-myanmar-found-guilty-genocide-1466263 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=23 September 2017 |author= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000356/http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/mayanmar-rohingya-refugee-crisis-myanmar-found-guilty-genocide-1466263# |archive-date=2017-09-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict came after a five-day trial, held at the law faculty of the University of Malaya, which examined various documentaries, expert views, and the testimony of the victims of atrocities.

After a two-year investigation into the plight of the Rohingya ethnic minority, the human rights group [[Amnesty International]] in their report described the restricted situation of the Rohingya people as "an open-air prison" as they are under a "vicious system of institutionalised [[discrimination]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]]" which is limiting their [[human rights]], their [[freedom of movement]], and their access to [[food]], [[healthcare]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name=Amnesty-Apartheid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/myanmar-apartheid-in-rakhine-state/|title='Caged Without A Roof': Apartheid In Myanmar's Rakhine State|author=|date=|work=Amnesty International|publisher=|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115064231/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/myanmar-apartheid-in-rakhine-state/#|archive-date=2018-01-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffpost-Apartheid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rohingya-muslims-prison-amnesty_us_5a05f62ce4b01d21c83e6b84 |title=Apartheid In Myanmar: Rohingya Muslims Trapped In ‘Open-Air Prison,’ Amnesty Says |author=Jesselyn Cook |date=11 November 2017 |work=Huffington Post |publisher= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201112841/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rohingya-muslims-prison-amnesty_us_5a05f62ce4b01d21c83e6b84# |archive-date=2018-02-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, Amnesty International mentions that the Rohingya minority are confined to their villages, to townships, and to shabby camps which are cut off from the rest of Myanmar, and travel between their own villages is seriously restricted. Travel between townships is subject to a complicated process of obtaining permission, and even then those permitted to travel are routinely harassed, physically tortured or arrested. All these "systematic" discrimination and persecution amount to [[apartheid]], the rights group said.&lt;ref name=Amnesty-Apartheid/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huffpost-Apartheid/&gt;

====China====
[[China]]'s commercial and strategic involvement with the Myanmar government have complicated its role in the 2017 events. As part of its "[[One Belt, One Road]]" program of regional expansion, China has made heavy investments in Rakhine state—including development of China's strategically and economically critical first-ever seaport on the [[Indian Ocean]], in the predominantly-Rohingya coastal Rakhine township of [[Maungdaw township (Myanmar)|Maungdaw]]—providing a much-shorter route to the sea for land-locked Central and Western China. China also has indicated intentions to "develop" Rakhine state commercially in other ways. With China's engagement in Rakhine state requiring cooperation with the Myanmar military and government, China has used its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to protect them from any forceful U.N. action over the Rohingya issue—and has argued that the "solution" to the Rohingya crisis is, instead,  more "development" in Rakhine state.&lt;ref name="business_interests_2017_01_04_theguardian_com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/04/is-rohingya-persecution-caused-by-business-interests-rather-than-religion "Is Rohingya persecution caused by business interests rather than religion?,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175759/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/04/is-rohingya-persecution-caused-by-business-interests-rather-than-religion# |date=2018-09-05 }} ''[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]],'' retrieved October 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="why_do_china_2017_10_18_scmp_com"&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2115839/why-do-china-india-back-myanmar-over-rohingya-crisis "Why do China, India back Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis?,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175732/https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2115839/why-do-china-india-back-myanmar-over-rohingya-crisis# |date=2018-09-05 }} ''[[South China Morning Post]],'' retrieved October 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinese_spadework_2017_11_28_the_hindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-ministers-spadework-lays-the-foundation-for-suu-kyis-visit/article21040847.ece "Chinese Minister's spadework lays the foundation for Suu Kyi's visit,"] November 28, 2017 ''[[The Hindu (newspaper)|The Hindu]],'' (India), retrieved November 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="china_self_interest_2018_01_16_scmp_com"&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2128432/inside-rohingya-refugee-camps-traumatised-exiles "China accused of self-interest by blocking moves to stop violent persecution of minority ethnic group in neighbouring Myanmar,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905214834/https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2128432/inside-rohingya-refugee-camps-traumatised-exiles# |date=2018-09-05 }} January 16, 2018, ''Post Magazine'', ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', retrieved January 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="india_acts_fast_2017_11_28_the_hindu"&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-acts-fast-to-counter-chinese-moves-in-myanmar/articleshow/61826389.cms "Rohingya: India acts fast to counter Chinese moves in Myanmar,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905141137/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-acts-fast-to-counter-chinese-moves-in-myanmar/articleshow/61826389.cms# |date=2018-09-05 }} July 13, 2018, ''[[The Economic Times]],'' (India), retrieved Jul 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="china_urges_mynmar_2018_07_08_daiiy_star"&gt;[https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-crisis/china-urges-myanmar-to-start-rohingya-refugee-repatriation-soon-1601959 "China urges Myanmar to start Rohingya refugee repatriation soon,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905203738/https://www.thedailystar.net/rohingya-crisis/china-urges-myanmar-to-start-rohingya-refugee-repatriation-soon-1601959# |date=2018-09-05 }} July 8, 2018, ''[[Daily Star (newspaper)]],'' (Bangladesh), retrieved July 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myanmar_rejects_accusation_2018_08_29_bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45338986 "Rohingya: Myanmar rejects UN accusation of 'genocide' against Rohingya,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830090437/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45338986# |date=2018-08-30 }} August 29, 2018, ''[[BBC News]],'' retrieved August 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2017, the Myanmar authorities were asked by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) and the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) “to immediately stop violence in northern Rakhine State, and to promptly and effectively investigate and vigorously prosecute cases of violence against women and children.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22196&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR - Myanmar Rohingya abuses may be crimes against humanity, UN rights experts warn|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2018-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008221301/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22196&amp;LangID=E#|archive-date=2017-10-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) initiated an investigation into the August 2017 (and subsequent) events, but Myanmar's government expelled the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Myanmar, [[Yanghee Lee]], and refused to allow U.N. investigators unfettered access to the conflict region to investigate. The OHCHR investigating team turned, instead, to other sources—particularly including over 800 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, satellite imagery, and online (internet-posted) information from within Myanmar.&lt;ref name="un_report_A_HRC_39_64_ohchcr_2018_08_27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="un_calls_2018_08_27_reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="military_leaders_must_face_2018_08_27_bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="investigators_call_2018_08_27_cbs_news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myanmar_generals_2018_08_27_reuters_us_news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="year_after_rohingya_massacres_2018_08_27_ny_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="how_genocide_investigated_2018_09_03_bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45341112 "Myanmar Rohingya: How a 'genocide' was investigated,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905145940/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45341112# |date=2018-09-05 }} September 3, 2018, ''[[BBC News]]'', retrieved September 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-August 2018—a year from the start of the August 2017 events—the OHCHR published the report of their investigation into the events.  They documented extensive killing, gang-rape and injury of Rohingya, particularly by the Myanmar military—the [[Tatmadaw]]—and stated that the Tatmadaw and several of its commanders (including Commander-in-chief Senior General [[Min Aung Hlaing]]) should face charges in the [[International Criminal Court]] for "[[crimes against humanity]]", including acts of "ethnic cleansing" and "genocide" particularly for its August–September 2017 actions against the Rohingya of Myanmar.&lt;ref name="un_report_A_HRC_39_64_ohchcr_2018_08_27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="un_calls_2018_08_27_reuters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="military_leaders_must_face_2018_08_27_bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="investigators_call_2018_08_27_cbs_news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myanmar_generals_2018_08_27_reuters_us_news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="year_after_rohingya_massacres_2018_08_27_ny_times" /&gt;

====ASEAN====

The [[ASEAN]] member states have upheld a principle of non-interference in intra-ASEAN relations. A day before the 30th [[ASEAN Summit]] was held on April 26, 2017, Reuters reported on the Myanmar military's operations on the Rohingya in November 2016. Nonetheless, the Rohingya crisis was not on the official agenda in the Summit.&lt;ref name="thediplomat.com"&gt;"Why ASEAN Can't Ignore the Rohingya Crisis" (https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/why-asean-cant-ignore-the-rohingya-crisis/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612111150/http://thediplomat.com/2017/05/why-asean-cant-ignore-the-rohingya-crisis/# |date=2017-06-12 }}). The Diplomat. 17 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, leaders of ASEAN countries have begun concerns on the issue. In a meeting with other ASEAN foreign ministers on December 19, 2016, Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman called for a collective effort to resolve the crisis. In addition, in the 30th ASEAN Summit, Indonesian President Joko Widodo discussed the issue of the Rohingya crisis with Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanma de facto leader. He was said to stress the importance of stability in Myanmar for the wider regional security.&lt;ref name="thediplomat.com"/&gt;

The ASEAN states' hesitance to comment on the issue may be explained by a concern that the rise of China and its influence in Myanmar could risk ASEAN's interest in the country. Azeem Ibrahim, the author of ''The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide'', noted, “Myanmar’s interactions with ASEAN are perhaps indicative of its wider approach to international relations.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, Azeem. "The Return to Democracy (2008-2015)." ''The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide.'' London, England: Hurst, 2016. 75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While ASEAN member states welcome economic opportunities with China's rise, they fear its growing influence. It has been suggested that ASEAN criticism of Myanmar's domestic crisis will lead to closer ties between [[China–Myanmar relations|China and Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;Chachavalpongpun, P. 2012. 'The Vexing Strategic Tug-of-War over Naypyidaw: ASEAN's View of the Sino-Burmese Ties.' ''Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs,'' 31:1 97-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGOs===
According to Matthew Smith of the NGO Fortify Rights, “We can now say with a high level of confidence that state-led security forces and local armed residents have committed mass killings.” Smith accused the Burmese military of trying to expel all Rohingyas from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21728643-burmese-army-burning-villages-and-raping-and-killing-their-inhabitants-state-led-massacre|title=A state-led massacre triggers an exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar|date=9 September 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=10 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909202744/https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21728643-burmese-army-burning-villages-and-raping-and-killing-their-inhabitants-state-led-massacre#|archive-date=2017-09-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Accord==
Aburi accord is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;
*"Members agree that the legislative and executive authority of the Federal Military Government should remain in the Supreme Military Council, to which any decision affecting the whole country shall be referred for determination provided that where it is possible for a meeting to be held the matter requiring determination must be referred to military governors for their comment and concurrence.
*Specifically, the council agreed that appointments to senior ranks in the police, diplomatic, and consular services as well as appointment to superscale posts in the federal civil service and the equivalent posts in the statutory corporation must be approved by the Supreme Military Council.
*The regional members felt that all the decrees passed since January 15, 1966, and which detracted from previous powers and positions of regional governments, should be repealed if mutual confidence is to be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Biafra: Selected Speeches and Random Thoughts by C. Odumegwu Ojukwu published by Harper &amp; Row 1969."&lt;!-- the accord is as written here word for word--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Breakdown==
In response to the accord,  the federal government promulgated Decree No. 8, which was mainly an embodiment of the accord.
The accord finally broke down because of differences of interpretation on both sides. This led to the outbreak of [[Nigerian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Reflections on the [[Nigerian Civil War]] by Raph Uwechue, [[Trafford Publishing]], 2004.{{ISBN|1-4120-2806-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AAA Foundation.jpg|thumb|right|US Embassy document detailing the formation of the AAA under the BINCI of the Colombian National Army]] 
The '''''Alianza Americana Anticomunista''''' ('''AAA''', pronounced '''triple-A'''; "American Anticommunist Alliance") was believed to be a [[paramilitary]] [[far-right]] group mainly operating in [[Colombia]] between 1978 and 1979.

Contemporary accusations and declassified U.S. Embassy documents have linked the creation and operation of this group to members of a [[Colombian National Army]] battalion employing the Triple A name as a label.&lt;ref name="Embassy1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Document number: 1979Bogota01410 |author=U.S. Ambassador Diego Asencio |publisher=United States Embassy in Bogotá, Colombia |date=February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSA1"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Truth about Triple-A |publisher=National Security Archive |date=2007-07-01 |author=Michael Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
A 1979 report from the [[United States]] Embassy in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] details that then-General [[Jorge Robledo Pulido]] and members of the [[BINCI|"Charry Solano" Battalion of Intelligence and Counterintelligence]] (BINCI) were directly involved in the creation of AAA. The report describes a plan intended "to create the impression that the American Anti-communist Alliance has established itself in Colombia and is preparing to take violent action against local [[communist]]s."&lt;ref name="Embassy1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSA1" /&gt;

==Accusations and activities==
In December 1978 the Anticommunist American Alliance bombed the [[Colombian Communist Party]] Headquarters, and later the Communist Party's newspaper ''Voz Proletaria''. The bombing of the Communist Party HQ left no casualties according to the 1979 U.S. Embassy's report, which describes Triple A's contemporary activities as "more appropriately characterized as dirty tricks" than human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Embassy1" /&gt; 

BINCI has been accused of participating in a number of other [[Bombing#Delivery|bombings]], [[kidnapping]]s and [[assassination]]s against [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] and abuses of guerrilla detainees between the years of 1978 and 1979. In an open letter published on November 29, 1980 by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] newspaper ''El Día'', five individuals identified as former Colombian military detail a number of activities carried out by BINCI personnel operating as Triple A. Among those implicated in the operations of Triple A are then-Lieutenant [[Mario Montoya Uribe]], who would have participated in the bombing of ''Voz Proletaria'', and then-Lieutenant Colonel [[Harold Bedoya]], the commander of BINCI who would have given orders to several of the personnel involved.&lt;ref name="ElDia1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Militares colombianos presos denuncian crimenes de colegas |date=1980-11-29 |author=Teresa Gurza |publisher=El Dia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 1992 publication, ''El Terrorismo de Estado en Colombia'' (State Terrorism in Colombia), prepared by a coalition of [[human rights]] groups that included [[Catholic]] [[peace movement]] [[Pax Christi|Pax Christi International]], repeated the accusations found in the ''El Día'' article.&lt;ref name="Pax1"&gt;{{cite news|title=El Terrorismo de Estado en Colombia |publisher=Various Human Rights Groups |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. evaluation===
In 1999 the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|Defence Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) concluded that there was no evidence to support the accusations regarding General [[Mario Montoya Uribe]]'s involvement in Triple A, citing the information as "a [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[smear campaign]] dating back 20 years."&lt;ref name="DIA1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three leading candidates to become next military intelligence chief |publisher=National Security Archive |author=Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) |date=September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial took place before the National Security Archive's request and subsequent declassification of the 1979 Embassy document.&lt;ref name="NSA1" /&gt;

The '''Arab Socialist Movement''' ({{lang-ar|حركة الاشتراكيين العرب |rtl=yes}}- {{lang|ar-Latn|Harakat Al-Ishtirakiyeen Al-'Arab}}) also known as '''Arab Socialist Party''', was a [[political party]] in [[Syria]] that has split into several factions since the 1960s which continue to use the same name.

== History ==
The original party traced its roots back to the 1930s radical anti-[[capitalist]], [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] group led by [[Akram al-Hawrani]],{{sfnp|Akram al-Bunni|2013|p=8}} but was formally established on 5 January 1950.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}} It merged with the [[Ba'ath Party]] in 1953,{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=65}} only to withdraw again in 1963.&lt;ref name="auxiliary" /&gt; It then split into several factions: 
* One, led by Abdul-Ghani Qannout joined the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]]-led [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] government in 1972{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=175, 176}}{{sfnp|Akram al-Bunni|2013|pp=5, 8}} and has continued to support the [[al-Assad family]]'s rule ever since. After Abdul-Ghani Qannout died in 2001, Ahmad al-Ahmad (died 2016) became the new secretary general; under him, the party continued its pro-government course, even during the [[Syrian Civil War]]. In course of this conflict, a member of the Arab Socialist Movement's political office, Turki Albu Hamad, formed the "[[Forces of the Fighters of the Tribes]]" militia.&lt;ref name="auxiliary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aymennjawad.org/19789/quwat-muqatili-al-ashair-tribal-auxiliary-forces |title=Quwat Muqatili al-Asha'ir: Tribal Auxiliary Forces of the Military Intelligence |author=Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi |work= |date=2 April 2017|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another splinter group was led by the former officer Abdul-Ghani Ayyash (died 2010), and joined the opposition in form of the [[National Democratic Rally (Syria)|National Democratic Rally]].{{sfnp|Akram al-Bunni|2013|p=8}}
* One faction of [[Marxism|Marxists]], led by Akram al-Bunni, split off and formed the "National Council of Damascus Declaration for National Democratic Change", which was suppressed by the Assad government.{{sfnp|Akram al-Bunni|2013|p=6}}
*Another branch has also gained legal recognition and parliamentary representation, but under the name "[[National Vow Movement]]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Ascribed characteristics''', as used in the [[social sciences]], refers to properties of an individual attained at birth, by inheritance, or through the aging process. The individual has very little, if any, control over these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Perspective|last=Ferrante|first=Joan|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples include race, ethnicity, gender, caste, height, and appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John Robert|publisher=Cenage|year=|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is apt for describing characteristics chiefly caused by "nature" (e.g. genetics) and for those chiefly caused by "nurture" (e.g. parenting during early childhood), See: [[Nature versus nurture|Nature versus Nurture]].

== Use Within Demography ==

Demography being the statistical study of populations requires the ability to differentiate between populations. Most populations self-ascribe themselves as being different than another by the creation of a country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel|title=Milestones: 1945–1952 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This allows Demographers to draw lines between countries and compare them. However useful, countries have significant complex populations that require more exacting definitions. Commonly seen are uses of [[Race (human categorization)|Race]], [[Gender]] and [[Ethnicity]]. In the scope of academic demography, all of these are [[Social construction of gender|Social Constructs]], '''ASCRIBED''' to groups or individuals for Stratification &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs|title=Race and Racial Identity Are Social Constructs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender roles : a sociological perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda|isbn=9780205899685|edition=Sixth|location=Boston|oclc=892213147|date = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With these [[Theory|theories]] in place, many new theories can be formed and data collected to either prove or disprove them. Ascribed characteristics can have large by-products weather perceived or not. Discussed below are Race, Gender, [[Social status|Social Status]] / [[Caste]] and Hiring / Promotion.

=== Race ===
Ascribed characteristics are not always used for academic purposes. People with certain ascribed characteristics can be systematically treated with prejudice. Thus, the study of [[racism]] can be seen, at least superficially, as the study of the ways that people with a certain skin color and cultural background are systematically treated differently by society at large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourse and Discrimination: Rhetorics Of Racism and Antisemitism|last=Resigl|first=Martin|last2=Wodak|first2=Ruth|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Race does not entirely have a 

=== Gender ===
[https://www.uu.nl/staff/fvantubergen/0 Frank van Tubergen] studied the how ascribed characteristics and achieved characteristics effect their [[Social capital|Social Capital]] in the article ''Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Tubergen|first=Frank|last2=Al-Modaf|first2=Obaid Ali|last3=Almosaed|first3=Nora F.|last4=Al-Ghamdi|first4=Mohammed Ben Said|title=Personal networks in Saudi Arabia: The role of ascribed and achieved characteristics|journal=Social Networks|volume=45|pages=45–54|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2015.10.007|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The article highlighted that women have less social capital than men in [[Saudi Arabia]] citing specifically that it was "due to fewer non-family connections". There are many arguments that stem from disagreements over the definition of what is a fact when it comes to gender, showing the fluidity of ascribed characteristics. For example, people who find [[homosexuality]] morally objectionable may attempt to justify this by insisting that homosexuals make a conscious decision about the nature of the sexual desire they experience however, it would difficult to condemn homosexuality if homosexuality was predetermined, either genetically or from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Q|last2=Wilson|first2=G.D|year=2003|title=Sexual orientation and the 2nd to 4th finger length ratio: evidence for organising effects of sex hormones or developmental instability?|url=|journal=International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=28|pages=288–303|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Sexual orientation]].). Both Groups do however use the term all the same, simply '''ascribing''' different definitions to those individuals.

=== Social Status / Caste ===
Many different societies have had varying types of social stratification both historically and in the modern era. One of the most obvious examples is [[India]], and its [[Caste system in India|Caste System]]. In its essence, it was a system that ascribed sweepers the lowest status, making this one group literally untouchable. Although India officially states that discrimination against lower castes is illegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf][http://www.ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/CII2011/cii-2011/Chapter%207.pdf CRIME AGAINST PERSONS BELONGING TO SCs / STs]'''Government of India, National Crime Records Bureau''' (2011), page 108&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== Hiring / Promotion ===

[[Ronald P. Dore]] was a British sociologist that was a specialist in the Japanese Economy. His view will be expressed here. In his largest work, ''British Factory, Japanese Factory''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British factory, Japanese factory : the origins of national diversity in industrial relations|last=Dore|first=Ronald|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520024953|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=20130326}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Dore investigates whether decisions on hiring and promotion, in the Japanese firm Hitachi, over a particular time were based chiefly on "achievement" or chiefly on "ascribed characteristics". The context of the discussion implied that achievement-based decisions are good, while those based on ascribed characteristics are bad. His discussion admits explicitly and, implicitly, that there are several complications to moral judgement that include:

* Some achievement characteristics are positively correlated with some ascribed characteristics such as intelligence and socioeconomic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strenze|first=Tarmo|date=2007-09-01|title=Intelligence and socioeconomic success: A meta-analytic review of longitudinal research|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606001127|journal=Intelligence|volume=35|issue=5|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "the power to command...may be much more likely to be bred in upper class families" to the extent that "the power to command" is viewed as a measure of merit. Promotion decisions favoring high merit would not be entirely distinguishable from making promotion decisions favoring high class thus, it can be difficult, to tell whether a particular promotion decision has been made for just or unjust reasons.
* It is possible to, "irrelevantly acquire discriminatory characteristics", or even do so intentionally. For example, by converting to a new religion or getting married. 
* It is reasonable to view even some ascribed characteristics as factors that should affect employee compensation. In Hitachi, for example, pay is positively correlated both with performance and with age. The latter is an ascribed characteristic, but Dore suggests that it is a perfectly reasonable consideration, especially since expenses such as childcare, tend to increase over the duration of employment at Hitachi.

Dore also points out that what counts as an ascribed characteristic can vary depending on context. In evaluating the fairness of hiring standards, he viewed an applicant's success in the educational system as a good approximation of achievement. Thus, he noted that hiring decisions at Hitachi, during the time of his study, were "regulated by very strict qualification standards" and not very significantly influenced by ascribed characteristics. When he turned to evaluate opportunities for advancement within the firm, however, Dore noted that "educational qualifications...limit the range of posts which one can achieve". Meaning even if one's level of achievement increases, one may still be kept down by a relative lack of achievement in the educational system. Therefore, in investigating opportunities for promotions, educational achievement " the two become another form of ascribed characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hearn|first=James C.|title=Attendance at higher-cost colleges: Ascribed, socioeconomic, and academic influences on student enrollment patterns|journal=Economics of Education Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–76|doi=10.1016/0272-7757(88)90072-6|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additional forms of ascribed characteristics expand on the definition of an ascribed characteristic allowing for it to have more applications.

In [[information technology]], a '''backup''', or '''data backup''', or the process of backing up, refers to the copying into an [[archive file]] of computer [[data]] so it may be used to restore the original after a [[data loss]] event. The verb form is [[wikt:back up|"back up"]] (a [[phrasal verb]]), whereas the noun and adjective form is [[wikt:backup|"backup"]].&lt;ref name="AHDictionaryBackup"&gt;{{cite web |title=back•up |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=backup |website=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |accessdate=9 May 2018 |year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backups have two distinct purposes. The primary purpose is to recover data after its loss, be it by [[File deletion|data deletion]] or [[Data corruption|corruption]]. Data loss can be a common experience of computer users; a 2008 survey found that 66% of respondents had lost files on their home PC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabooza.com/globalsurvey.html Global Backup Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327235844/http://www.kabooza.com/globalsurvey.html |date=27 March 2010 }}. Retrieved 15 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary purpose of backups is to recover data from an earlier time, according to a user-defined [[data retention]] policy, typically configured within a [[Backup software|backup application]] for how long copies of data are required.&lt;ref name="NelsonPro11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4uEEsq3CJYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Pro Data Backup and Recovery |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction to Backup and Recovery |author=Nelson, S. |publisher=Apress |pages=1–16 |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4302-2663-5 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though backups represent a simple form of [[disaster recovery]] and should be part of any [[disaster recovery plan]], backups by themselves should not be considered a complete disaster recovery plan. One reason for this is that not all backup systems are able to reconstitute a computer system or other complex configuration such as a [[computer cluster]], [[active directory]] server, or [[database server]] by simply restoring data from a backup.&lt;ref name="CougiasTheBackup03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eLviiTag5A0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=The Backup Book: Disaster Recovery from Desktop to Data Center |chapter=Chapter 1: What's a Disaster Without a Recovery? |author=Cougias, D.J.; Heiberger, E.L.; Koop, K. |publisher=Network Frontiers |pages=1–14 |year=2003 |isbn=0-9729039-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a backup system contains at least one copy of all data considered worth saving, the [[computer data storage|data storage]] requirements can be significant. Organizing this storage space and managing the backup process can be a complicated undertaking. A data repository model may be used to provide structure to the storage. Nowadays, there are many different types of [[data storage device]]s that are useful for making backups. There are also many different ways in which these devices can be arranged to provide geographic redundancy, [[data security]], and portability.

Before data are sent to their storage locations, they are selected, extracted, and manipulated. Many different techniques have been developed to optimize the backup procedure. These include optimizations for dealing with open files and live data sources as well as compression, encryption, and [[Data deduplication|de-duplication]], among others. Every backup scheme should include [[Dry run (testing)|dry runs]] that validate the reliability of the data being backed up. It is important to recognize the limitations and human factors involved in any backup scheme.

== Storage, the base of a backup system ==

=== Data repository models ===
Any backup strategy starts with a concept of a data repository. The backup data needs to be stored, and probably should be organized to a degree. The organisation could be as simple as a sheet of paper with a list of all backup media (CDs, etc.) and the dates they were produced. A more sophisticated setup could include a computerized index, catalog, or relational database. Different approaches have different advantages. Part of the model is the [[backup rotation scheme]].&lt;ref name="DeanComp09"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QEMAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA602 |title=CompTIA Network+ 2009 in Depth |chapter=Chapter 14: Ensuring Integrity and Availability |author=Dean, T. |publisher=Cengage Learning |pages=571–614 |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-59863-878-3 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Unstructured : An unstructured repository may simply be a stack of tapes or CD-Rs or DVD-Rs with minimal information about what was backed up and when. This is the easiest to implement, but probably the least likely to achieve a high level of recoverability as it lacks automation.
; Full only / [[system image|System imaging]] : A repository of this type contains complete system images taken at one or more specific points in time.&lt;ref name="DeanComp09" /&gt; This technology is frequently used by computer technicians to record known good configurations. Imaging&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Five key questions to ask about your backup solution |url=http://sysgen.ca/five-key-backup-questions/ |website=sysgen.ca |accessdate=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042343/http://sysgen.ca/five-key-backup-questions/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is generally more useful for deploying a standard configuration to many systems rather than as a tool for making ongoing backups of diverse systems.
; [[Incremental backup|Incremental]] : An incremental style repository aims to make it more feasible to store backups from more points in time by organizing the data into increments of change between points in time. This eliminates the need to store duplicate copies of unchanged data: with full backups a lot of the data will be unchanged from what has been backed up previously.&lt;ref name="DeanComp09" /&gt; Typically, a full backup (of all files) is made on one occasion (or at infrequent intervals) and serves as the reference point for an incremental backup set. After that, a number of incremental backups are made after successive time periods. Restoring the whole system to the date of the last incremental backup would require starting from the last full backup taken before the data loss, and then applying in turn each of the incremental backups since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tech-faq.com/incremental-backup.shtml Incremental Backup] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621090117/http://www.tech-faq.com/incremental-backup.shtml |date=21 June 2016 }}. Retrieved 10 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some backup systems can reorganize the repository to synthesize full backups from a series of incrementals.
; [[Differential backup|Differential]] : Each differential backup saves the data that has changed since the last full backup.&lt;ref name="DeanComp09" /&gt; It has the advantage that only a maximum of two data sets are needed to restore the data. One disadvantage, compared to the incremental backup method, is that as time from the last full backup (and thus the accumulated changes in data) increases, so does the time to perform the differential backup. Restoring an entire system would require starting from the most recent full backup and then applying just the last differential backup since the last full backup.
:: By standard definition, a differential backup copies files that have been created or changed since the last full backup, regardless of whether any other differential backups have been made since then, whereas an incremental backup copies files that have been created or changed since the most recent backup of any type (full or incremental). Other variations of incremental backup include multi-level incrementals and incremental backups that compare parts of files instead of just the whole file.
; Reverse delta : A reverse delta type repository stores a recent "mirror" of the source data and a series of differences between the mirror in its current state and its previous states. A reverse delta backup will start with a normal full backup. After the full backup is performed, the system will periodically synchronize the full backup with the live copy, while storing the data necessary to reconstruct older versions.&lt;ref name="LeonSoftware15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYcTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Software Configuration Management Handbook |author=Leon, A. |publisher=Artech House |page=65 |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-60807-844-8 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be done using [[hard links]], or using binary [[data comparion|diffs]]. This system works particularly well for large, slowly changing, data sets.
; [[Continuous data protection]] : Instead of scheduling periodic backups, the system immediately logs every change on the host system. This is generally done by saving byte or block-level differences rather than file-level differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sertdatarecovery.com/business-data-backup-disaster-recovery-planning-resource.html Continuous Protection white paper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072358/http://www.sertdatarecovery.com/business-data-backup-disaster-recovery-planning-resource.html |date=4 March 2016 }}. (1 October 2005). Retrieved 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from simple [[disk mirroring]] in that it enables a roll-back of the log and thus restoration of old images of data.

=== Storage media ===
[[File:DVD, USB flash drive and external hard drive.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right, a [[DVD]] disc in plastic cover, a [[USB flash drive]] and an [[external hard drive]]]]
Regardless of the repository model that is used, the data has to be stored on some data storage medium.

; [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]] : Magnetic tape has long been the most commonly used medium for bulk data storage, backup, archiving, and interchange. Tape has typically had an order of magnitude better capacity-to-price ratio when compared to hard disk, but the ratios for tape and hard disk have become closer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storagesearch.com/engenio-art2.html Disk to Disk Backup versus Tape – War or Truce?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712235906/http://www.storagesearch.com/engenio-art2.html |date=12 July 2016 }} (9 December 2004).

; [[Optical storage]] : Recordable [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s are commonly used with personal computers and generally have low media unit costs. However, the capacities and speeds of these and other optical discs have traditionally been lower than that of hard disks or tapes (though advances in optical media are slowly shrinking that gap&lt;ref name="WanOptical14"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Optical storage: An emerging option in long-term digital preservation |journal=Frontiers of Optoelectronics |author=Wan, S.; Cao, Q.; Xie, C. |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=486–492 |year=2014 |doi=10.1007/s12200-014-0442-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhangHigh18"&gt;{{cite journal |title=High-capacity optical long data memory based on enhanced Young's modulus in nanoplasmonic hybrid glass composites |journal=Nature Communications |author=Zhang, Q.; Xia, Z.; Cheng, Y.-B.; Gu, M. |volume=9 |pages=1183 |year=2018 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03589-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Many optical disk formats are [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] type, which makes them useful for archival purposes since the data cannot be changed. The use of an auto-changer or jukebox can make optical discs a feasible option for larger-scale backup systems. Some optical storage systems allow for cataloged data backups without human contact with the discs, allowing for longer data integrity.
; [[SSD]]/[[Solid-state drive]]: Also known as [[flash memory]], [[thumb drive]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, [[CompactFlash]], [[SmartMedia]], [[Memory Stick]], [[Secure Digital card]]s, etc., these devices are relatively expensive for their low capacity in comparison to hard disk drives, but are very convenient for backing up relatively low data volumes. A [[solid-state drive]] does not contain any movable parts unlike its magnetic drive counterpart, making it less susceptible to physical damage, and can have huge throughput in the order of 500Mbit/s to 6Gbit/s. The capacity offered from SSDs continues to grow and prices are gradually decreasing as they become more common.&lt;ref name="MicheloniSolid17"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013049 |title=Solid-State Drives (SSDs) |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |author=Micheloni, R.; Olivo, P. |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=1586–88 |year=2017 |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2017.2727228 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCMagBestRuggedHDDs&amp;SSDs" /&gt; Over a period of years the stability of flash memory backups is shorter than that of hard disk backups.&lt;ref name="ForbesKeepingDataLongTime" /&gt;
; [[Remote backup service|Remote backup service AKA cloud backup]] : As [[broadband Internet access]] becomes more widespread, remote backup services are gaining in popularity. Backing up via the Internet to a remote location can protect against events such as fires, floods, or earthquakes which could destroy locally-stored backups.&lt;ref name="DellEMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.emc.com/corporate/glossary/remote-backup.htm |title=Remote Backup |work=EMC Glossary |publisher=Dell, Inc |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a number of drawbacks to remote backup services. First, Internet connections are usually slower than local data storage devices. Residential broadband is especially problematic as routine backups must use an upstream link that's usually much slower than the downstream link used only occasionally to retrieve a file from backup. This tends to limit the use of such services to relatively small amounts of high value data, even if a particular service provides initial [[seed loading]].   Secondly, users must trust a third party service provider to maintain the privacy and integrity of their data, although confidentiality can be assured by encrypting the data before transmission to the backup service with an [[key (cryptography)|encryption key]] known only to the user. Ultimately the backup service must itself use one of the above methods so this could be seen as a more complex way of doing traditional backups.
; [[Floppy disk]] and its derivatives : During the 1980s and early 1990s, many personal/home computer users associated backing up mostly with copying to floppy disks. However, the data capacity of floppy disks did not keep pace with growing demands, rendering them effectively obsolete.  Later "[[superfloppy]]" devices and [[Iomega REV|related "non-floppy"]] devices provide greater storage capacity and remain supported as backup media by some developers.&lt;ref name="RetrospectWindows12UG" /&gt;

=== Managing the data repository ===
Regardless of the data repository model, or data storage media used for backups, a balance needs to be struck between accessibility, security and cost. These media management methods are not mutually exclusive and are frequently combined to meet the user's needs. Using on-line disks for staging data before it is sent to a near-line [[tape library]] is a common example.

Data repository implementations include&lt;ref name="StackpoleSoftware07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjAhVzuV7k0C&amp;pg=PA164 |title=Software Deployment, Updating, and Patching |author=Stackpole, B.; Hanrion, P. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=164–165 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4200-1329-0 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GnanasundaramInfo12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PU7gkW9ArxIC&amp;pg=PA255 |title=Information Storage and Management: Storing, Managing, and Protecting Digital Information in Classic, Virtualized, and Cloud Environments |editor=Gnanasundaram, S.; Shrivastava, A. |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |page=255 |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-118-23696-3 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

; [[Online|On-line]] : On-line backup storage is typically the most accessible type of data storage, which can begin a restore in milliseconds.  An internal hard disk or a [[disk array]] (maybe connected to [[Storage area network|SAN]]) is one example of an on-line backup. This type of storage is convenient and speedy, but is relatively expensive and is vulnerable to being deleted or overwritten, either by accident, by malevolent action, or in the wake of a data-deleting [[Computer virus|virus]] payload.
; [[Nearline storage|Near-line]] : Near-line storage is typically less accessible and less expensive than on-line storage, but still useful for backup data storage.  A good example would be a [[tape library]] with restore times ranging from seconds to a few minutes. A mechanical device is usually used to move media units from storage into a drive where the data can be read or written. Generally it has safety properties similar to on-line storage.
; [[Off-line storage|Off-line]] : Off-line storage requires some direct action to provide access to the storage media: for example inserting a tape into a tape drive or plugging in a cable. Because the data are not accessible via any computer except during limited periods in which they are written or read back, they are largely immune to a whole class of on-line backup failure modes. Access time will vary depending on whether the media are on-site or off-site.
; [[Off-site data protection]]:  Backup media may be sent to an off-site vault to protect against a disaster or other site-specific problem. The vault can be as simple as a system administrator's home office or as sophisticated as a disaster-hardened, temperature-controlled, high-security bunker with facilities for backup media storage. Importantly a data replica can be off-site but also on-line (e.g., an off-site [[RAID]] mirror). Such a replica has fairly limited value as a backup, and should not be confused with an off-line backup.
; [[Backup site]] or disaster recovery center (DR center): In the event of a disaster, the data on backup media will not be sufficient to recover. Computer systems onto which the data can be restored and properly configured networks are necessary too. Some organizations have their own data recovery centers that are equipped for this scenario. Other organizations contract this out to a third-party recovery center. Because a DR site is itself a huge investment, backing up is very rarely considered the preferred method of moving data to a DR site. A more typical way would be remote [[disk mirroring]], which keeps the DR data as up to date as possible.

== Selection and extraction of data ==
A successful backup job starts with selecting and extracting coherent units of data. Most data on modern computer systems is stored in discrete units, known as [[Computer file|files]]. These files are organized into [[filesystem]]s. Files that are actively being updated can be thought of as "live" and present a challenge to back up. It is also useful to save metadata that describes the computer or the filesystem being backed up.

Deciding what to back up at any given time involves tradeoffs. By backing up too much redundant data, the data repository will fill up too quickly. Backing up an insufficient amount of data can eventually lead to the loss of critical information.&lt;ref name="LeesWhatTo17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://irontree.co.za/what-to-backup-a-critical-look-at-your-data-1935.html |title=What to backup – a critical look at your data |author=Lees, D. |work=Irontree Blog |publisher=Irontree Internet Services CC |date=25 January 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Files ===
; [[File copying|Copying files]] : With '''file-level''' approach, making copies of files is the simplest and most common way to perform a backup. A means to perform this basic function is included in all backup software and all operating systems.

; Partial file copying: Instead of copying whole files, a backup may include only the blocks or bytes within a file that have changed in a given period of time. This technique can substantially reduce needed storage space, but requires a high level of sophistication to reconstruct files in a restore situation. Some implementations require integration with the source file system.

; Deleted files : To prevent the unintentional restoration of files that have been intentionally deleted, a record of the deletion must be kept.

=== Filesystems ===
; Filesystem dump: Instead of copying files within a file system, a copy of the whole filesystem itself in '''block-level''' can be made. This is also known as a ''raw partition backup'' and is related to [[disk image|disk imaging]]. The process usually involves unmounting the filesystem and running a program like [[dd (Unix)]].&lt;ref name="PrestonBackup07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-w4fXbBInoC&amp;pg=PA111 |title=Backup &amp; Recovery: Inexpensive Backup Solutions for Open Systems |author=Preston, W.C. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=111–114 |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-596-55504-7 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the disk is read sequentially and with large buffers, this type of backup can be much faster than reading every file normally, especially when the filesystem contains many small files, is highly fragmented, or is nearly full. But because this method also reads the free disk blocks that contain no useful data, this method can also be slower than conventional reading, especially when the filesystem is nearly empty. Some filesystems, such as [[XFS]], provide a "dump" utility that reads the disk sequentially for high performance while skipping unused sections. The corresponding restore utility can selectively restore individual files or the entire volume at the operator's choice.&lt;ref name="PrestonUnix99"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_i1sO47qNnMC&amp;pg=PA73 |title=Unix Backup &amp; Recovery |author=Preston, W.C. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=73–91 |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-56592-642-4 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Identification of changes: Some filesystems have an [[archive bit]] for each file that says it was recently changed. Some backup software looks at the date of the file and compares it with the last backup to determine whether the file was changed.

; [[Versioning file system]] : A versioning filesystem keeps track of all changes to a file and makes those changes accessible to the user. Generally this gives access to any previous version, all the way back to the file's creation time. An example of this is the Wayback versioning filesystem for Linux.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/publications/Cornell04VFS.html Wayback: A User-level V File System for Linux] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406204849/http://www.aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/publications/Cornell04VFS.html |date=6 April 2007 }} (2004). Retrieved 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live data ===
A [[Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot]] is an instantaneous function of some [[file system|filesystems]] that presents a copy of the filesystem as if it were frozen at a specific point in time, often by a [[copy-on-write]] mechanism. An effective way to back up live data is to temporarily [[quiesce]] them (e.g., close all files), take a snapshot, and then resume live operations. At this point the snapshot can be backed up through normal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edseek.com/~jasonb/articles/dirvish_backup/snapshot.html What is a Snapshot backup?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403041940/http://edseek.com/~jasonb/articles/dirvish_backup/snapshot.html |date=3 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}Retrieved 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Snapshotting a file while it is being changed results in a corrupted file that is unusable, as most large files contain internal references between their various parts that must remain consistent throughout the file.  This is also the case across interrelated files, as may be found in a conventional [[database]] or in applications such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server]].  The term [[fuzzy backup]] can be used to describe a backup of live data that looks like it ran correctly, but does not represent the state of the data at a single point in time.&lt;ref name="LiotineMission03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LecC2BhPPxMC&amp;pg=PA244 |title=Mission-critical Network Planning |author=Liotine, M. |publisher=Artech House |page=244 |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58053-559-5 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Open file backup: Many backup software applications undertake to back up open files in an internally consistent state.&lt;ref name="HandyBackupOpenFileWindows"&gt;{{cite web |title=Open File Backup Software for Windows |url=https://www.handybackup.net/open-file-backup.shtml |website=Handy Backup |publisher=Novosoft LLC |accessdate=29 November 2018 |date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File locking]] would be useful for regulating access to open files, but this may be inconvenient for the user.  Some applications simply check whether open files are in use and try again later.&lt;ref name="RetrospectWindows12UG" /&gt;  Other applications exclude open files that are updated very frequently.&lt;ref name="ArqTroubleshootingBackingUpOpen/lockedFiles"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reitshamer |first1=Stefan |title=Troubleshooting backing up open/locked files on Windows |url=https://www.arqbackup.com/blog/troubleshooting-backing-up-openlocked-files-on-windows/ |website=Arq Blog |publisher=Haystack Software |accessdate=29 November 2018 |date=5 July 2017 |at=Stefan Reitshamer is the principal developer of Arq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Interrelated database files backup: Some interrelated database file systems offer a means to generate a "hot backup"&lt;ref name="UWiscOracleBackups"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boss |first1=Nina |title=Oracle Tips Session #3: Oracle Backups |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302110933/http://www.wisc.edu/drmt/oratips/sess003.html#Hotbackup |website=www.wisc.edu |publisher=University of Wisconsin |accessdate=1 December 2018 |archivedate=2 March 2007 |date=10 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the database while it is online and usable. This may include a snapshot of the data files plus a snapshotted log of changes made while the backup is running. Upon a restore, the changes in the log files are applied to bring the copy of the database up to the point in time at which the initial backup ended.&lt;ref name="ArcserveOracleWhatIsARCHIVE-LOG"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is ARCHIVE-LOG and NO-ARCHIVE-LOG mode in Oracle and the advantages &amp; disadvantages of these modes? |url=https://support.arcserve.com/s/article/202080249?language=en_US |website=Arcserve Backup |publisher=Arcserve |accessdate=29 November 2018 |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metadata ===
Not all information stored on the computer is stored in files. Accurately recovering a complete system from scratch requires keeping track of this non-file data too.&lt;ref name="Gresovnik1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.arnes.si/~ljc3m2/igor/blogs/technical/bootable_media_creation.html |title=Preparation of Bootable Media and Images |last=Grešovnik |first=Igor |date=April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425113119/http://www2.arnes.si/~ljc3m2/igor/blogs/technical/bootable_media_creation.html |archivedate=25 April 2016 |access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; System description: System specifications are needed to procure an exact replacement after a disaster.
; [[Boot sector]] : The boot sector can sometimes be recreated more easily than saving it. Still, it usually isn't a normal file and the system won't boot without it.
; [[Disk partitioning|Partition]] layout: The layout of the original disk, as well as partition tables and filesystem settings, is needed to properly recreate the original system.
; File [[metadata]] : Each file's permissions, owner, group, ACLs, and any other metadata need to be backed up for a restore to properly recreate the original environment.
; System metadata: Different operating systems have different ways of storing configuration information. [[Microsoft Windows]] keeps a [[Windows Registry|registry]] of system information that is more difficult to restore than a typical file.

== Manipulation of data and dataset optimization ==
It is frequently useful or required to manipulate the data being backed up to optimize the backup process. These manipulations can provide many benefits including improved backup speed, restore speed, data security, media usage and/or reduced bandwidth requirements.
; [[Data compression|Compression]] : Various schemes can be employed to shrink the size of the source data to be stored so that it uses less storage space. Compression is frequently a built-in feature of tape drive hardware.&lt;ref name="CherrySecuring15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SD_LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306 |title=Securing SQL Server: Protecting Your Database from Attackers |author=Cherry, D. |publisher=Syngress |pages=306–308 |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-12-801375-5 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Data deduplication|Deduplication]] : When multiple similar systems are backed up to the same destination storage device, there exists the potential for much redundancy within the backed up data. For example, if 20 Windows workstations were backed up to the same data repository, they might share a common set of system files. The data repository only needs to store one copy of those files to be able to restore any one of those workstations. This technique can be applied at the file level or even on raw blocks of data, potentially resulting in a massive reduction in required storage space.&lt;ref name="CherrySecuring15" /&gt; Deduplication can occur on a server before any data moves to backup media, sometimes referred to as source/client side deduplication. This approach also reduces bandwidth required to send backup data to its target media. The process can also occur at the target storage device, sometimes referred to as inline or back-end deduplication.
;[[Replication (computer science)|Duplication]] : Sometimes backup jobs are duplicated to a second set of storage media. This can be done to rearrange the backup images to optimize restore speed or to have a second copy at a different location or on a different storage medium.
; [[Encryption]] : High-capacity removable storage media such as backup tapes present a data security risk if they are lost or stolen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11048 Backups tapes a backdoor for identity thieves] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405033517/http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11048 |date=5 April 2016 }} (28 April 2004). Retrieved 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Encrypting the data on these media can mitigate this problem, but presents new problems. Encryption is a CPU intensive process that can slow down backup speeds, and the security of the encrypted backups is only as effective as the security of the key management policy.&lt;ref name="CherrySecuring15" /&gt;
; [[Multiplexing]] : When there are many more computers to be backed up than there are destination storage devices, the ability to use a single storage device with several simultaneous backups can be useful.&lt;ref name="PrestonBackup07-02"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-w4fXbBInoC&amp;pg=PA219 |title=Backup &amp; Recovery: Inexpensive Backup Solutions for Open Systems |author=Preston, W.C. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=219–220 |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-596-55504-7 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Refactoring: The process of rearranging the backup sets in a data repository is known as refactoring. For example, if a backup system uses a single tape each day to store the incremental backups for all the protected computers, restoring one of the computers could potentially require many tapes. Refactoring could be used to consolidate all the backups for a single computer onto a single tape. This is especially useful for backup systems that do ''incrementals forever'' style backups.
; [[Disk staging|Staging]] : Sometimes backup jobs are copied to a staging disk before being copied to tape.&lt;ref name="PrestonBackup07-02" /&gt; This process is sometimes referred to as D2D2T, an acronym for Disk to Disk to Tape. This can be useful if there is a problem matching the speed of the final destination device with the source device as is frequently faced in network-based backup systems. It can also serve as a centralized location for applying other data manipulation techniques.

== Managing the backup process ==
As long as new data are being created and changes are being made, backups will need to be performed at frequent intervals. Individuals and organizations with anything from one computer to thousands of computer systems all require protection of data. The scales may be very different, but the objectives and limitations are essentially the same. Those who perform backups need to know how successful the backups are, regardless of scale.

=== Objectives ===
; [[Recovery point objective]] (RPO) : The point in time that the restarted infrastructure will reflect. Essentially, this is the roll-back that will be experienced as a result of the recovery. The most desirable RPO would be the point just prior to the data loss event. Making a more recent recovery point achievable requires increasing the frequency of [[file synchronization|synchronization]] between the source data and the backup repository.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/recovery_point_objective.php Definition of ''recovery point objective''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513180844/http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/recovery_point_objective.php |date=13 May 2007 }}.

; [[Recovery time objective]] (RTO) : The amount of time elapsed between disaster and restoration of business functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/recovery_time_objective.php Definition of ''recovery time objective''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516081425/http://www.riskythinking.com/glossary/recovery_time_objective.php |date=16 May 2007 }}. Retrieved 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Data security]] : In addition to preserving access to data for its owners, data must be restricted from unauthorized access. Backups must be performed in a manner that does not compromise the original owner's undertaking. This can be achieved with data encryption and proper media handling policies.&lt;ref name="LittleImplement03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DqO6kizEDUC&amp;pg=PA17 |title=Implementing Backup and Recovery: The Readiness Guide for the Enterprise |chapter=Chapter 2: Business Requirements of Backup Systems |author=Little, D.B. |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |pages=17–30 |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-48081-5 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Data retention]] period : Regulations and policy can lead to situations where backups are expected to be retained for a particular period, but not any further. Retaining backups after this period can lead to unwanted liability and sub-optimal use of storage media.&lt;ref name="LittleImplement03" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
An effective backup scheme will take into consideration the following situational limitations&lt;ref name="NelsonPro11-2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4uEEsq3CJYC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Pro Data Backup and Recovery |chapter=Chapter 9: Putting It All Together: Sample Backup Environments |author=Nelson, S. |publisher=Apress |pages=203–246 |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4302-2663-5 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

; Backup window: The period of time when backups are permitted to run on a system is called the backup window. This is typically the time when the system sees the least usage and the backup process will have the least amount of interference with normal operations. The backup window is usually planned with users' convenience in mind. If a backup extends past the defined backup window, a decision is made whether it is more beneficial to abort the backup or to lengthen the backup window.
; Performance impact: All backup schemes have some performance impact on the system being backed up. For example, for the period of time that a computer system is being backed up, the hard drive is busy reading files for the purpose of backing up, and its full bandwidth is no longer available for other tasks. Such impacts should be analyzed.
; Costs of hardware, software, labor: All types of storage media have a finite capacity with a real cost. Matching the correct amount of storage capacity (over time) with the backup needs is an important part of the design of a backup scheme. Any backup scheme has some labor requirement, but complicated schemes have considerably higher labor requirements. The cost of commercial backup software can also be considerable.
; Network bandwidth: Distributed backup systems can be affected by limited network bandwidth.

=== Implementation ===
Meeting the defined objectives in the face of the above limitations can be a difficult task. The tools and concepts below can make that task more achievable.
; Scheduling: Using a [[job scheduler]] can greatly improve the reliability and consistency of backups by removing part of the human element. Many backup software packages include this functionality.
; Authentication: Over the course of regular operations, the user accounts and/or system agents that perform the backups need to be authenticated at some level. The power to copy all data off of or onto a system requires unrestricted access. Using an authentication mechanism is a good way to prevent the backup scheme from being used for unauthorized activity.
; Chain of trust : Removable [[storage media]] are physical items and must only be handled by trusted individuals. Establishing a chain of trusted individuals (and vendors) is critical to defining the security of the data.

=== Measuring the process ===
To ensure that the backup scheme is working as expected, the following best practices should be enacted&lt;ref name="AkhtarDatabase12"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Database Backup and Recovery Best Practices |journal=ISACA Journal |author=Akhtar, A.N.; Buchholtz, J.; Ryan, M.; Setty, K. |volume=1 |pages=1–6 |year=2012 |url=https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2012/Volume-1/Pages/Database-Backup-and-Recovery-Best-Practices.aspx |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DorionBackupReportingTool&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dorion |first1=Pierre |title=Why you need a data backup reporting tool |url=http://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/tip/Why-you-need-a-data-backup-reporting-tool |website=TechTarget |publisher=Tech Target Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2017 |date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PritchardCloud17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-to-cloud-backup-What-it-is-and-why-you-need-it |title=Cloud-to-cloud backup: What it is and why you need it |author=Pritchard, S. |work=Computer Weekly |publisher=TechTarget |date=December 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

; [[Backup validation]] : (also known as "backup success validation") Provides information about the backup, and proves compliance to regulatory bodies outside the organization: for example, an insurance company in the USA might be required under [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] to demonstrate that its client data meet records retention requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hipaadvisory.com/regs/recordretention.htm HIPAA Advisory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411135655/http://www.hipaadvisory.com/regs/recordretention.htm |date=11 April 2007 }}. Retrieved 10 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Disaster, data complexity, data value and increasing dependence upon ever-growing volumes of data all contribute to the anxiety around and dependence upon successful backups to ensure [[business continuity]]. Thus many organizations rely on third-party or "independent" solutions to test, validate, and optimize their backup operations (backup reporting).
; Reporting: In larger configurations, reports are useful for monitoring media usage, device status, errors, vault coordination and other information about the backup process.
; Logging: In addition to the history of computer generated reports, activity and change logs are useful for monitoring backup system events.
; Validation: Many backup programs use [[checksum]]s or [[hash function|hashes]] to validate that the data was accurately copied. These offer several advantages. First, they allow data integrity to be verified without reference to the original file: if the file as stored on the backup medium has the same checksum as the saved value, then it is very probably correct. Second, some backup programs can use checksums to avoid making redundant copies of files, and thus improve backup speed. This is particularly useful for the de-duplication process.
; Monitored backup: Backup processes can be monitored locally via a software dashboard or by a third party monitoring center. Both alert users to any errors that occur during automated backups. Some third-party monitoring services also allow collection of historical metadata, that can be used for storage resource management purposes like projection of data growth and locating redundant primary storage capacity and reclaimable backup capacity.

== Enterprise client-server backup ==
[[File:Backup_diagram.svg|right|thumb|A computer sends its data to a backup server, during a scheduled backup window.]]

To accommodate the requirements of a backup administrator who may not be part of the IT staff with access to the secure server area, enterprise client-server software may include features such as:

A sidebar on the left or navigation bar shows the clickable categories of backup server information for it; each category shows a panel, which may have a specialized toolbar below or in place of the standard toolbar.  The built-in categories include activities—thus providing [[Backup#Measuring the process|monitored backup]], past backups of each individual source, scripts/policies/jobs (terminology depending on the application), sources (directly/indirectly), archive files, and storage devices.&lt;ref name="RetrospectMac14UG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NetBackupAdminGuideVol.1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Symantec NetBackup ™ Administrator's Guide, Volume I Windows |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~danno/symantec/NetBackup_AdminGuideI_WinServer.pdf |website=Symantec |publisher=Veritas Technologies LLC (US) |accessdate=18 November 2017 |pages=35–45(Administration Console), 833–843(Activity Monitor), 888–894(Reports utility), 912(Remote Administration Console), 915–938(Java Console) |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BackupExecAdminConsole"&gt;{{cite web |title=Symantec Backup Exec: About the Administration Console |url=http://backup-exec.helpmax.net/en/introducing-backup-exec/about-the-administration-console/ |website=''Helpmax.net'' |publisher=HelpMax Software Help &amp; Shop Inc. |accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cathal O'Byrne's book ''As I Roved Out'' there are a couple of chapters on Steel. She lived in a cottage in the townland of Poleglass, on the outskirts of [[Belfast]] and [[Lisburn]], along what is now the Stewartstown Road. Her place in history comes from her sympathy for the [[Roman Catholic]] faithful who, under [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Law]], were denied their church buildings for worship. Steel was the trusted custodian of the sacred vessels used in the [[Liturgy]], as well as a small horn used to summon the faithful to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Her name is commemorated in the name of one of the roads through Poleglass. She kept watch and provided warnings to the people attending mass when the soldiers were approaching. She is depicted in many of Belfast's [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] murals.

[[Image:Cellulose Sessel.svg|thumb|[[Cellulose]] is an example of a (1→4)-β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucan composed of [[glucose]] units]]
'''β-Glucans''' ('''beta-[[glucans]]''') comprise a group of β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose [[polysaccharide]]s naturally occurring in the cell walls of [[cereal]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[Fungus|fungi]], with significantly differing [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties dependent on source. Typically, β-glucans form a linear backbone with 1-3 β-[[glycosidic bonds]] but vary with respect to molecular mass, solubility, viscosity, branching structure, and gelation properties, causing diverse physiological effects in animals.

At dietary intake levels of at least 3 g per day, oat fiber β-glucan decreases blood levels of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and so may reduce the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]s.&lt;ref name="ho"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27724985 | year = 2016 | author1 = Ho | first1 = H.

== History ==
Cereal and fungal products have been used for centuries for medicinal and cosmetic purposes; however, the specific role of β-glucan was not explored until the 20th century.  β-glucans were first discovered in lichens, and shortly thereafter in barley. A particular interest in oat β-glucan arose after a cholesterol lowering effect from oat bran reported in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirby RW, Anderson JW, Sieling B, Rees ED, Chen WJ, Miller RE, Kay RM |title=Oat-bran intake selectively lowers serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations of hypercholesterolemic men |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=824–9 |year=1981 |pmid=6263072 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the FDA approved of a claim that intake of at least 3.0 g of β-glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. The approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of β-glucan: rolled oats (oatmeal), oat bran, whole oat flour, oatrim, whole grain barley and barley beta-fiber. An example of an allowed label claim: Soluble fiber from foods such as oatmeal, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of oatmeal supplies 0.75 grams of the 3.0 g of β-glucan soluble fiber necessary per day to have this effect.

==Structure==
Glucans are arranged in six-sided D-glucose rings connected linearly at varying carbon positions depending on the source, although most commonly β-glucans include a 1-3 glycosidic link in their backbone. Although technically β-glucans are chains of D-glucose [[polysaccharides]] linked by β-type [[glycosidic bonds]], by convention not all β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose polysaccharides are categorized as β-glucans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Natural and Modified (1→3)-β-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Glucans in Health Promotion and Disease Alleviation|last = Zeković|first = Djordje B.|date = 10 October 2008|journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|doi = 10.1080/07388550500376166|pmid = |access-date =|volume=25|issue = 4|pages=205–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose is not typically considered a β-glucan, as it is insoluble and does not exhibit the same physicochemical properties as other cereal or yeast β-glucans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Identification of high b-glucan oat lines and localization and chemical characterization of their seed kernel b-glucans|last = Sikora|first = Per|date = 14 June 2012|journal = Food Chemistry|doi = 10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.10.007|pmid = 23199994|volume=137|issue = 1–4|pages=83–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Beta-D-glucopyranose-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|Glucose molecule, showing carbon numbering notation and β orientation.]]

Some β-glucan molecules have branching glucose side-chains attached to other positions on the main D-glucose chain, which branch off the β-glucan backbone. In addition, these side-chains can be attached to other types of molecules, like proteins, as in [[polysaccharide-K]].

The most common forms of β-glucans are those comprising D-glucose units with β-1,3 links.  Yeast and fungal β-glucans contain 1-6 side branches, while cereal β-glucans contain both β-1,3 and β-1,4 backbone bonds. The frequency, location, and length of the side-chains may play a role in immunomodulation. Differences in molecular weight, shape, and structure of β-glucans dictate the differences in biological activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oats Nutrition and Technology|last = Chu|first = YiFang|publisher = Wiley Blackwell|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-118-35411-7|location = Barrington, Illinois|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dietary modulation of immune function by β-glucans|last = Volman|first = Julia J|date = 20 November 2007|journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior|doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.11.045|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==β-glucan types==

β-glucans form a natural component of the cell walls of bacteria, fungi, yeast, and cereals such as oat and barley. Each type of beta-glucan comprises a different molecular backbone, level of branching, and molecular weight which affects its solubility and physiological impact. One of the most common sources of β(1,3)D-glucan for supplement use is derived from the cell wall of baker’s yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''). β-glucans found in the cell walls of [[yeast]] contain a 1,3 carbon backbone with elongated 1,6 carbon branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Structure of a β-(1→3)-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Glucan from Yeast Cell Walls|last = Manners|first = David J.|date = 2 February 1973|journal = Biochemical Journal|doi =10.1042/bj1350019 |pmc=1165784|pmid=4359920|volume=135|issue = 1|pages=19–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources include [[seaweed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Teas | first = J | year = 1983 | title = The dietary intake of Laminarin, a brown seaweed, and breast cancer prevention | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 217–222 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | issn = 0163-5581 | pmid = 6302638 | doi = 10.1080/01635588209513760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various mushrooms, such as [[lingzhi mushroom|lingzhi]], [[shiitake]], [[Inonotus obliquus|chaga]], and [[Grifola frondosa|maitake]], which are under preliminary research for their potential [[immune system|immune]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23739801|pmc=3775562|year=2013|author1=Vannucci|first1=L|title=Immunostimulatory properties and antitumor activities of glucans (Review)|journal=International Journal of Oncology|volume=43|issue=2|pages=357–64|last2=Krizan|first2=J|last3=Sima|first3=P|last4=Stakheev|first4=D|last5=Caja|first5=F|last6=Rajsiglova|first6=L|last7=Horak|first7=V|last8=Saieh|first8=M|doi=10.3892/ijo.2013.1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fermentable fiber===
{{Main|Dietary fiber}}

In the diet, β-glucans are a source of soluble, [[fermentation|fermentable]] [[dietary fiber|fiber]] &amp;ndash; also called ''prebiotic fiber'' &amp;ndash; which provides a substrate for [[gut flora|microbiota]] within the [[large intestine]], increasing [[feces|fecal bulk]] and producing [[short-chain fatty acids]] as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities.&lt;ref name="mcrorie"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27863994|year=2017|author1=McRorie Jr|first1=J.

[[File:Oatmeal (1).jpg|thumb|Oatmeal is a common food source of β-glucans]]
===Cereal===
{{Main|Oat beta-glucan}}

Cereal β-glucans from oat, barley, wheat, and rye have been studied for their effects on [[cholesterol]] levels in people with normal cholesterol levels and in those with [[hypercholesterolemia]].&lt;ref name=ho/&gt; Intake of oat β-glucan at daily amounts of at least 3 grams lowers total and [[low-density lipoprotein]] cholesterol levels by 5 to 10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21631511|year=2011|author1=Othman|first1=R. A|title=Cholesterol-lowering effects of oat β-glucan|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=69|issue=6|pages=299–309|last2=Moghadasian|first2=M. H|last3=Jones|first3=P.

Oats and barley differ in the ratio of trimer and tetramer 1-4 linkages. Barley has more 1-4 linkages with a degree of polymerization higher than 4. However, the majority of barley blocks remain trimers and tetramers. In oats, β-glucan is found mainly in the endosperm of the oat kernel, especially in the outer layers of that endosperm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Gov.ntis.ava18921vnb1.ogv|thumb|"The Correct Procedure for a Visual Search" – A 1990 video produced by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]]]
A '''body cavity search''', also known simply as a '''cavity search''', is either a visual search or a manual internal inspection of [[Body cavity|body cavities]] for prohibited materials ([[contraband]]), such as illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons. Body cavities used for concealment include [[nostril]]s, [[human ear|ear]]s, [[human mouth|mouth]], [[navel]], [[human penis|penis]] ([[urethra]] and [[foreskin]]) or [[vagina]], and [[rectum]]. It is far more invasive than the standard [[strip search]] that is typically performed on individuals taken into custody, either upon police arrest or [[incarceration]] at a jail, [[prison]], or [[psychiatric hospital]]. Often the procedure is repeated when the person leaves the institution.

Body cavity searches may also be conducted at some international border crossings such as the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] when they suspect [[Border search exception|international travelers]] of hiding contraband—such as drugs—in their [[alimentary canal]] ([[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestional tract]]).&lt;ref&gt;''See [[United States v. Montoya de Hernandez]]'', 473 U.S. 531, 538 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
Many articles of contraband are concealable in the body's cavities, via means such as insertion into the [[rectum]]. Illegal drugs are often found in condoms and temporarily stowed in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], and cylinders such as cigar tubes are used to hide money, intravenous syringes, and knives. Duplicate [[handcuff]] keys could be concealed in many body [[orifices]], such as in the nasal passages or underneath the tongue.

In a thorough ''visual body cavity'' search, a [[flashlight]] is used to illuminate common bodily areas, including the [[nostril]]s, [[human ear|ear]]s, [[human mouth|mouth]], [[navel]], [[human penis|penis]] ([[urethra]] and [[foreskin]]) or [[vulva]], and [[buttocks]]. Generally, the [[detainee]] is required to cooperate with manipulating these body parts as they are examined.

[[Squatting position|Squatting]] is sometimes instructed during the visual search, and prolonged holding of a squat can be demanded; squats are sometimes demanded while standing over a mirror (so that the observer has an improved view).  The person may be asked to “squat and cough,” with the aim of dislodging an object stored in the rectum or vagina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/04/supreme_court_strip_search_decision_how_to_check_someone_for_contraband_.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During ''manual body cavity'' searches, an inmate is temporarily transferred to an offsite clinic to be examined by a licensed physician of the same gender; body orifices are probed using fingers or instruments. The circumstances in which these inspections may be done are often restricted, such as on individuals refusing to offer to consent to a visual body cavity search for reasons other than anxiety or in situations where there is a strong evidence to suspect the presence of contraband, and require a court order. 
  
As cavity searches have proven as an ineffective strategy in the total prevention of smuggling objects as it cannot detect objects in the intestines or stomach, as well as taking into consideration the intrusive nature and inherently humiliating or degrading procedure, it has become fairly normal for authorities to instead isolate individuals in a monitored environment until they pass excreta and/or x-ray the individual's pelvic area as it is less invasive and psychologically damaging.

==Legal standing ==
Some inmates and human rights activists argue that body cavity searches are done not so much to stop the flow of contraband but rather to harass and humiliate detainees. A visual inspection of the rectum will not reveal objects concealed deeply inside. Likewise, it is possible to circumvent detection during manual body cavity searches. In some instances, suspects swallow packages of drugs protected by condoms and allow them to pass through their [[digestive tract]]. Only [[diagnostic imaging]] will reveal the concealed contraband, invalidating the body cavity search.

[[File:Drug-Packer X-Ray.jpg|thumb|X-ray diagnostic images can reveal concealed contraband that could not otherwise be detected. The yellow marks show capsules of illegal drugs swallowed by the suspect. Such smugglers are often called drug packers or [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]]s.]]

Because these searches are highly invasive and greatly compromise an individual’s right of privacy, the legality of visual and manual body cavity searches is frequently contested.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], ''[[Bell v. Wolfish]]'' is the benchmark case on this issue. In its judgment of the case, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] established a standard of reasonable grounds for performing cavity searches. Among these are security concerns at prisons. Such searches are generally governed by the Fourth Amendmendment to the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits searches without probable cause. &lt;ref&gt;https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===
In the UK, cavity searches are not carried out upon entry to prisons, although new prisoners are required to perform squats as part of their strip-search. Though said prisoners may be visually searched, prison staff do not have the power to carry out cavity searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/prisoninformation/prisonservicemagazine/index.asp?id%3D4480%2C18%2C3%2C18%2C0%2C0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610195847/http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/prisoninformation/prisonservicemagazine/index.asp?id=4480%2C18%2C3%2C18%2C0%2C0 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Law enforcement officers are not allowed to conduct cavity searches or [[strip search]]es in [[Pakistan]].  Any officer who conducts a cavity search or strip search can be sentenced up to 4 years in prison and given a [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]7500 fine.

==In popular culture==
The body cavity search is frequently used as a [[joke]] in comedies such as the movie ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'' and ''[[Seinfeld]]'', due to its humiliating, uncomfortable, and invasive nature. Generally, it adds to the suffering of a [[comedic foil]]. It is generally not depicted explicitly, but implied by the donning of a lubricated glove by a searcher. It is similar to the use of the [[rectal examination]] in this regard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Caladrius2.jpg|right|thumb|343px|An illustration of the Caladrius' prophecies from the 1588 edition of [[The Physiologus]]. Copperplate by [[Pieter van der Borcht (I)]].]]
The '''Caladrius''', according to [[Roman mythology]], is a snow-white bird that lives in the king's house. It is said to be able to take the sickness into itself and then fly away, dispersing the sickness and healing both itself and the sick person. The caladrius legend formed part of medieval bestiary materials, which typically provided a Christian moralization for the animals they discussed.

==Origin==
It has been theorized that the caladrius is based on a real bird. Due to descriptions of it being completely white with no black on it, it is possible that it was based on the [[dove]], or possibly some sort of water bird such as the [[heron]]. Louis Reau believes it was most likely a white [[plover]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Réau, ''Iconographie de l'art chrétien'', 6 vols. (Paris, 1955-59).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medieval bestiaries==
Medieval interpretations focused on the diagnostic potential of the bird: if it looks into the face of a sick person, the person will live; if it looks away, the person will die.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough interpretation of the emphasis on diagnostic power, see Herbert L. Kessler, 'Christ the Magic Dragon' ''Gesta'' Vol. 48, No. 2, Making Thoughts, Making Pictures, Making Memories: A SPECIAL ISSUE IN HONOR OF MARY J. CARRUTHERS (2009), pp.119-134.&lt;/ref&gt; This is compatible with the idea that the caladrius' look draws the sickness into itself; the bird is then said to fly up to the sun, where the disease is burned up and destroyed. In the Christian moralization, the caladrius represents Christ, who is pure white without a trace of the blackness of sin.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Baxter, ''Bestiaries and Their Users in the Middle Ages'' (Thrupp, 1998), pp.66-68.&lt;/ref&gt; The bird shows how Christ turns away from unrepentant sinners and casts them off; but those to whom he turns his face, he makes whole again. Sometimes this moral is used specifically against the Jews to describe how, because the Jews did not believe, Christ turned his face from them and toward the Gentiles, taking away and carrying their sins to the cross.&lt;ref&gt;See Kessler, 'Christ the Magic Dragon', p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch, "[[Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber]]", the title character (played by [[Steve Martin]]), uses a caladrius (portrayed by a live bird, most likely some form of dove or pigeon) in an attempt to diagnose a patient.  The difficulties of using live animals on live television provided most of the humor for the few seconds of the bird's appearance.

In ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]'', a myth unit available to the Atlanteans was the "Caladria," which served as a flying scout and a healer, though it more closely resembled an angel than a bird.

A song dedicated to the Caladrius ("Pasărea Calandrinon") appears on the album "Cantafabule", released in 1975 by Romanian rock group ''[[Transsylvania Phoenix]]''.

A Japanese WebNovel titled "Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi ~ Sokushi Mahou to Skill Copy no Choetsu Heal" or "The Redo of a Healing Magician ~ Transcendental Healing of Instant Death Magic and Skill Copying" mentions it as a monster which is considered a God by a demon race tribe. It has the power to devour diseases and also spread them.

In ''[[Hollow Earth (novel)|Hollow Earth]]'' (2012), by [[John Barrowman|John]] and [[Carole Barrowman]], the first book of the Hollow Earth Trilogy, the caladrius is a mythical bird that can see the future.

[[File:NISSAN CARWINGS Navigation System for FUGA.jpg|right|thumb|Nissan CarWings]]

'''CarWings''', renamed '''NissanConnect''' in 2015, and also branded as '''Infiniti InTouch''' is a vehicle [[telematics]] service offered by the [[Nissan Motor Company]] to drivers in Japan, the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nissanusa.com/innovations/carwings.article.html|title=Call Your Car With CARWINGS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan.co.uk/GB/en/YouPlus/welcome_pack_leaf/how_does_it_work.html|title=You+Nissan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most other countries where the LEAF is sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/carwings/id407497029?mt=8|title=NissanConnect EV on the App Store|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides mobile connectivity for on-demand traffic information services and internet provided maps displayed inside select Nissan vehicles. The service began in December 1997, having been installed in the 1997 [[Nissan Cedric]], [[Nissan Gloria]], [[Nissan President]], [[Nissan Cima]] and the [[Nissan Elgrand]].

The subscription service replaces the need to periodically update in-car navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the vehicles TCU (telematics control unit), unlike other Nissan vehicles that use the driver's cell phone to connect to their data services.

==Services Offered==
The services offered vary on the version of the navigation system installed in the vehicle.

=== Fastest route (on-demand VICS) ===
This feature offers the most efficient route based on various conditions between the point of departure and the destination. The objective of this feature is to offer a predetermined route that will enable the driver to arrive with the least amount of interruptions, taking into account any factors that could contribute to a delay in arriving in the least amount of driving time. The [[Vehicle Information and Communication System|VICS]] (Vehicle Information and Communication System) feature is a service offered only in Japan that provides traffic information and is broadcast digitally on FM radio frequencies.

===Operator Services===
By selecting this feature, the system will connect you to a call center, where a destination can be sent to your vehicle by an operator, which can be done while the vehicle is moving. Other information available includes current weather information, a search for restaurants as well as other features. If the caller is unsure of some of the details needed, the live operator can make suggestions or offer assistance in numerous categories.

=== AutoDJ (information content) ===
Some of the services available include traffic and weather information, horoscopes, including sports scores and game status. The information is then displayed on the screen. The downloaded text, and navigation can be read audibly by the navigation system. Starting September 20, 2006, CARWINGS was made available to subscribers on their home computers, by registering the URL of a site that offers RSS, which is then relayed to a separate "information channel" that is also displayed.

===Probe traffic information delivery===
Installed in conjunction with HDD navigation, this service began in November 2006. The telemetry is uploaded via mobile phones, and the Nissan Vehicle Information Center collects and analyzes statistical system to deliver results as traffic information. The vehicles position is then complemented by the [[Vehicle Information and Communication System|VICS]] service to display the fastest route. The implementation is very similar to the "Floating car" system offered by Honda's [[Internavi]] service.
As of June 2007, the vehicles listed below were offered this particular service.
*Skyline, Serena, Tiida, Tiida Latio, Wingroad, Dualis

===This city guide===
Installed in HDD navigation, and Service began in November 2006. 
This service offers entertainment, shopping and leisure activities available relative to the current vehicles position and is downloaded automatically. It offers voice suggestions and directions to various locations.

===Random Play===
Installed in HDD navigation, and Service began in November 2006.
Provide location and time automatically according to the above services listed.

==Price==
When a new car is purchased at [[Nissan#Japan|Japanese Nissan dealers]], the navigation service is optional, registration for the service was free for three years from April 2008 operator services are free. After the free period ends, the service is available for ¥ 3,150 per year. The data connection subscription is an additional fee, provided by mobile phone communication services from telecom company [[WILLCOM]] subscription service "dedicated service for CARWINGS Navigation System". [[Softbank]] in 2010 since January, and flat-rate only communicate with the car navigation system at 210 yen per month to charge regular packets "Navigation Plan".

==Supported vehicles==
Most of the Nissan vehicles (excluding commercial vehicles, some trucks) manufacturers standard or available in the navigation support options that are set by dealers. However, the feature can be used by different types of cars and navigation. Also, [[Suzuki]] for certain models ([[Suzuki Grand Vitara|Grand Vitara]] etc.) have also been adopted.

Since September 2008, [[Sanyo]] navigation system also added support in some models of their "Gorilla" product line.

'''Ceasefires in Myanmar''' have been heavily utilized by the Burmese government as a policy to contain ethnic rebel groups and create tentative [[truce]]s. The first ceasefire was arranged by the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] in 1989, specifically spearheaded by [[Khin Nyunt]], then the Chief of Military Intelligence, with the [[Kokang people|Kokang]]-led [[National Democratic Alliance Army]], which had recently split from the [[Communist Party of Burma]] due to internal conflicts.&lt;ref name="tni"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Tom|date=July 2009|title=Neither War Nor Peace: The Future of Cease-fire Agreements in Burma|publisher=Transnational Institute|location=Amsterdam|url=http://www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/ceasefire.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Internal conflict in Myanmar}}
[[File:They go back.jpg|thumb|The November 1963 peace talks collapsed and members of the Communist Party of Burma are shown walking back to their rebel bases after the end of conference in Rangoon.]]
The internal conflict in Myanmar began after the country's [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–1962|independence in 1948]], as successive central governments of [[Myanmar]] (or Burma) fought myriad ethnic and political rebellions. Some of the earliest insurgencies were by [[Bamar|Burmese]]-dominated "multi-colored" leftists, and by the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU). The KNU fought to carve out an independent Karen state from large swaths of Lower Myanmar. Other ethnic rebellions broke out in the early 1960s after the central government refused to consider a federal style government. By the early 1980s, politically oriented armed insurgencies had largely withered away, but ethnic-based insurgencies remained active during the conflict.

In the 1980s, rebel groups controlled most of the country's periphery. The two major organisations fighting against the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]]-led government, were two umbrella groups, the pro-Chinese [[Communist Party of Burma]] (allied to local [[Kokang people|Kokang Chinese]], [[Wa people|Wa]] and [[Shan people|Shan]] groups), based along the Chinese-Burmese border; and the pro-West National Democratic Force (made up of ethnic [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Karenni]] and Shan opposition groups), based along the Thai-Burmese border.&lt;ref name="tni"/&gt;

By the late 1980s, the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) had weakened considerably, because of waning Chinese financial support and internal strife. During the [[1988 Uprising]], the CPB failed to seize the opportunity to invoke political change. A month later, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC), a council of military men, staged a [[coup d'etat]]. Consequently, ethnic Wa and Kokang armed forces led a mutiny against CPB, forming the [[United Wa State Party]] (UWSP) and the [[National Democratic Alliance Army]] (NDAA) respectively.&lt;ref name="tni"/&gt; SLORC used this opportunity to arrange ceasefires with the armed rebel groups that had just mutinied, under a policy designed by [[Khin Nyunt]], who was then the Chief of Military Intelligence.&lt;ref name="tni"/&gt; The deal fell short of its nationwide billing, with seven of the fifteen armed groups invited declining to sign because of disagreements over who the process should include, and ongoing distrust of Myanmar's semi-civilian government and its still-powerful military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-idUSKCN0S82MR20151015|title=Myanmar signs ceasefire with eight armed groups|date=2016-10-15|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Reconciliation after 1988==
Government troops heavily used four cuts [[counter-insurgency]] tactics in ethnic areas in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="mmpeacemonitor.org"&gt;http://www.mmpeacemonitor.org/conflict/conflict-overview&lt;/ref&gt; Most ethnic groups became armed after the first military coup in 1962 and successive military governments used four cuts counter insurgency policy in ethnic areas. This policy involved: the cut off communications among rebel armed groups as well as local people; the cut off of information among people; the cut off of trade route in designated territories; searches and the destruction of any possible supplies to cut off these areas. &lt;ref&gt;Shan Human Rights Foundation (SHRF). (1998). Dispossessed: forced relocation and extrajudicial killings in Shan State. Chiang Mai: SHRF Special Publication.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the military government forced ethnic groups to sign ceasefire agreements with ethnic rebels groups, while government troops were trying to root out their main bases in 1990s. In meanwhile, ethnic minorities’ political parties which won seats in 1990 elections, and formed the second largest pro-democracy block after NLD, were severely oppressed in cities. By the end of the century, there were twenty armed opposition groups had cease fire agreements with governments.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. (2006). Myanmar's long road to national reconciliation (1st ed., p. 39). Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government did not hold political discussions with these groups or winning political parties. Therefore, some ethnic groups continued their armed struggle against the government. The ethnic populations suffered the most the result of long-standing hostilities with the central government. They have been treated as enemies of the state and second class citizens &lt;ref name="mmpeacemonitor.org"/&gt;

==Agreements==
The signed ceasefire agreements have been nothing more than temporary military truces to suspend fighting and preserve the status quo, allowing the rebel groups to retain administrative control of their territories. Weaker or splinter rebel groups typically forfeit their territories to the government.&lt;ref name="tni"/&gt; Most agreements simply stipulated that the groups would be allowed to retain their arms and territories until the promulgation of a new constitution.

As part of the ceasefires, the government began the Border Area Development Programme in 1989, which became a ministry-level body in 1992, as the Ministry for the Progress of Border Areas and National Races and has built road infrastructure, schools, and hospitals in rebel-occupied territories.&lt;ref name="lall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lall|first=Marie|date=23 November 2009|title=Ethnic Conflict and the  2010 Elections in Burma|journal=Asia Program Papers|publisher=Chatnam House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2015, Burmese President Thein Sein signed a nationwide ceasefire draft along with many ethnic leaders and government officials.&lt;ref name="RFA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tun|first=Thiha|date=2 April 2015|title=Myanmar Government And Ethnic Leaders Sign Tentative Peace Deal|journal=Radio Free Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border Guard Forces===
{{main|Border Guard Forces}}
In April 2009, Lieutenant General [[Ye Myint]] led a government entourage to meet with [[Kokang people|Kokang]], [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Wa people|Wa]] insurgent groups, to discuss plans to create "collective security" formed by them and under the command of the [[Tatmadaw]], which would eventually lead to the creation of the Border Guard Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=16691 |title=Border Guard Force Plan Leads to End of Ceasefire |last=Wai Moe |date=31 August 2009 |work=The Irrawaddy |accessdate=21 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302212345/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=16691 |archivedate=2 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, four of the insurgent groups, the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]], the [[Kachin Defence Army]] (4th Brigade of the KIA), the [[New Democratic Army - Kachin]] (NDA-K), and the [[Pa-O National Organisation]]/[[Pa-O National Army|Army]] (PNO/A), accepted the transition plan's terms and transformed into BGF groups.&lt;ref name="BurmaPartners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmapartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/NDF-on-CFG-Eng-March-2010.pdf|title=NDF Report on Ceasefire Groups Resisting SPDC’s Pressure and Instability|date=7 March 2010|work=National Democratic Front (Burma)|accessdate=21 March 2012|location=Mae Sot, Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eastern Slavic name|Anatolyevich|Streltsov}}

'''Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov''' ({{lang-rus|Эдуа́рд Анато́льевич Стрельцо́в ||p=ɪdʊˈart ɐnɐˈtolʲɪvʲitɕ strʲɪlʲˈtsof |a=Ru-Eduard Streltsov-yzavyalo.ogg}}, 21 July 1937 – 22 July 1990) was a [[Association football|footballer]] from the Soviet Union who played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] for [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] and the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet national team]] during the 1950s and 1960s. A powerful and skilful attacking player, he scored the fourth-highest number of goals for the Soviet Union and has been called "the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; He is sometimes dubbed "the Russian [[Pelé]]".&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;

Born and raised in east Moscow, Streltsov joined Torpedo at the age of 16 in 1953 and made his international debut two years later. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal [[Association football at the 1956 Summer Olympics|at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics]], and came seventh in the [[1957 Ballon d'Or]]. Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]]; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, he confessed, despite inconclusive evidence against him. He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the [[Gulag]] system of [[forced labor|forced]] [[labor camp|labour camps]].

Streltsov was released after five years in the camps and in 1965 he resumed his career with Torpedo Moscow. In the first season of his comeback, the club won the [[Soviet Top League|Soviet championship]]; in 1968 Torpedo won the [[Soviet Cup]]. Streltsov was restored to the Soviet national team in 1966, and in 1967 and 1968 named [[Soviet Footballer of the Year]]. By the time of his retirement in 1970 he had pioneered innovations such as the back-heeled pass, which became known in Russia as "Streltsov's pass". He died in Moscow in 1990. Six years later, Torpedo renamed their home ground "[[Eduard Streltsov Stadium]]" in his honour. In the 21st century, statues of Streltsov stand outside the stadium bearing his name and the [[Luzhniki Olympic Complex]] in Moscow.

==Early life==

Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov was born in [[Perovo District|Perovo]], an eastern district of Moscow, on 21 July 1937, the son of Anatoly Streltsov, a front-line soldier and intelligence officer, and Sofia Frolovna. Anatoly did not return to the family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in [[Kiev]]; Sofia therefore raised her son on her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]].&lt;ref name=Rizhkov/&gt;

The factory recognised his talent from a young age: Streltsov became the Fraser Factory football team's youngest ever player when he was 13 years old. Three years later in 1953, a [[exhibition game|friendly match]] was organised between Fraser and a youth team from [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]]. Streltsov impressed the Torpedo coach, Vasily Provornov, and after befriending him, left Fraser to play for Torpedo.&lt;ref name="Rizhkov"&gt;{{Harvnb

==Career==

===Early career===
Aged 16, Streltsov made his debut for Torpedo during [[1954 Soviet Top League|the 1954 season]], appeared in every league game and scored four goals.&lt;ref name=clubstats/&gt; The team finished ninth in the league, a drop from third the previous year.&lt;ref name="topleaguetables"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he scored a [[hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] within the first 45 minutes as the Swedish team was defeated 6–0. On his second appearance, a friendly home game against [[India national football team|India]], he scored three goals again. A further game in Hungary and a goal against [[France national football team|France]] meant that by the start of 1956, Streltsov had scored seven goals for the Soviet Union in four matches. After scoring in a match against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in April 1956, he missed three international matches before returning in September with a goal after three minutes in a 2–1 away victory over [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. Streltsov continued to score regularly for Torpedo, managing 12 league goals during the [[1956 Soviet Top League|1956 season]], but appeared in two successive defeats for the Soviets before they travelled in November 1956 to the [[1956 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=clubstats/&gt; Streltsov scored three goals in a 16–2 victory over [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] in an unofficial match on 15 November before scoring a late winning goal in the first tournament match against the [[United Team of Germany]] nine days later. The Soviets required a [[replay (sports)|replay]] to overcome [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] in the quarter-finals and met [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the semi-final.&lt;ref name=ussr5259/&gt;

The match finished 0–0 after 90 minutes,&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=ussr5259/&gt; and with defender [[Nikolai Tishchenko]] and Streltsov's fellow Torpedo forward [[Valentin Kozmich Ivanov|Valentin Ivanov]] both injured, the Soviet team had only nine fit players when Bulgaria scored early in [[extra time]]. Streltsov's performance was later described by journalist [[Jonathan Wilson (journalist/author)|Jonathan Wilson]] as "magnificent"; he scored an equaliser after 112 minutes and then [[Assist (football)|set up]] [[Boris Tatushin]] of Spartak Moscow four minutes later to score the winning goal.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Streltsov missed the final against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] as the team manager, [[Gavriil Kachalin]], believed the two forward players should be club team-mates; as Ivanov was unfit, Streltsov was dropped as well. [[Nikita Simonyan]], who took his place, offered Streltsov his gold medal following a 1–0 victory over the Yugoslavs, an offer which the Torpedo player refused, saying "Nikita, I will win many other trophies".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Streltsov received two votes in the [[1956 Ballon d'Or]].&lt;ref name="ballondor1956"&gt;{{cite web

Streltsov scored the first goal in a 2–0 win in a [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]] [[play off|play-off]] match in Poland which meant the Soviet Union qualified for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=ussr5259/&gt; At club level, he scored 12 goals in 15 league matches during the [[1957 Soviet Top League|1957 season]]. Torpedo, never league champions and traditionally overshadowed by local rivals such as [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo]] and Spartak, finished as runners-up of the [[Soviet Top League]].&lt;ref name=topleaguetables/&gt; At the end of that season, Streltsov came seventh in the [[1957 Ballon d'Or]], gaining 12 votes;&lt;ref name="ballondor1957"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the start of the World Cup year, 1958, his international record stood at 18 goals in 20 games. Streltsov scored five goals in the first eight league matches of the [[1958 Soviet Top League|1958 Top League season]], and appeared in a 1–1 friendly draw with [[England national football team|England]] in Moscow on 18 May 1958.&lt;ref name=ussr5259/&gt;

===Rape conviction===

====Accusation====
Streltsov was known for womanising, drinking heavily and leading an extravagant life outside of football, as well as for wearing his hair in the British "[[Teddy Boy]]" style.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt; As a key player for his club and for the Soviet national side, these traits combined to create an impression in government circles that, in Wilson's words, "Streltsov was becoming rather too much of a celebrity".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The problem was brought to a head by an alleged relationship between the footballer and Svetlana Furtseva, the 16-year-old daughter of the first female [[Politburo]] member [[Ekaterina Furtseva]]. With the young Svetlana besotted by the 19-year-old Torpedo forward, her mother first met him at a [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] ball held early in 1957 to celebrate the Olympic victory of 1956. Furtseva suggested he might marry her daughter, to which Streltsov replied "I already have a fiancée and I will not marry her [Svetlana]." While drunk, he was later heard to remark either "I would never marry that monkey" or "I would rather be hanged than marry such a girl" (both quotes were reported), humiliating Furtseva, a minister close to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;

Streltsov became secretly engaged to Alla Demenko before leaving for the Olympics,&lt;ref name=Nilin7879/&gt; and the couple married on 25 February 1957,&lt;ref name="Nilin7879"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Нилин (Nilin)
|2002
|pp=78–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; halfway through preparations for the Soviet season. The Department of Soviet Football criticised both the player and his club over the timing of the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] also seemed to distrust him, considering him a possible [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|defector]] after he attracted the interest of French and Swedish clubs during tours overseas with Torpedo. His file in the party archives included the comment: "[a]ccording to a verified source, Streltsov said to his friends in 1957 that he was always sorry to return to the USSR after trips abroad."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; After he was sent off during a game in [[Odessa]] in April 1957, the official government sports newspaper ''[[Sovetsky Sport]]'' published an article about him titled "This is not a hero" as well as letters purportedly written by members of the proletariat, which described Streltsov as an "example of the evils of western imperialism".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

[[File:Nikita Khrusjtsjov.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1961. According to [[Gavriil Kachalin]], who managed the national football team, Khrushchev was personally involved in the Streltsov rape case.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;]]
A week after appearing against England in a warm-up match in Moscow for the 1958 World Cup, Streltsov was invited to a party by a Soviet military officer, Eduard Karakhanov, to be held on 25 May.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Streltsov and the rest of the Soviet squad were on a pre-World Cup training camp at Tarasovka, just outside Moscow, but the team had been given the day as holiday. At the end of such days, the players had to report to the authorities at [[Dynamo Stadium (Moscow)|Dynamo Stadium]] at 4:30&amp;nbsp;pm,&lt;ref name=Nilin91/&gt; but Streltsov and two team-mates, Spartak players [[Mikhail Ogonkov]] and [[Boris Tatushin]], ignored this rule and went to the party anyway.&lt;ref name="Nilin91"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Нилин (Nilin)
|2002
|p=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Held at Karakhanov's [[dacha]], it was also attended by a 20-year-old woman named Marina Lebedeva, whom Streltsov had never met. The following morning, Streltsov, Ogonkov and Tatushin were all arrested and charged with raping her.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="OFlynn"&gt;{{Harvnb
|O'Flynn
|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Kevin O'Flynn writes that since heavy drinking had taken place at the party, the evidence against Streltsov was "confused and contradictory", even from Lebedeva herself.&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt; But the Soviet team coach, [[Gavriil Kachalin]], claimed shortly before Streltsov's death that influence from high up in the Communist Party dictated that the player could not be helped; Kachalin said that police told him of Khrushchev's personal involvement, fuelled by a grudge held by Furtseva.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; According to Soviet Union team-mate Nikita Simonyan, speaking in 2006, Streltsov wrote home to his mother "saying he was taking the blame for someone else".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Streltsov and Lebedeva did sleep together, Simonyan said, and he did not believe their meeting had been set up, but he was unsure about whether or not Streltsov had raped her. Simonyan proposed that consensual sex could have been twisted into a rape accusation by "the system", which he said bore ill will towards the Torpedo forward.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; However, in the same interview Simonyan revealed incriminating photographs of both Lebedeva and Streltsov from the time of the trial, including one in which the Torpedo player's face "was streaked from nose to cheekbone with three parallel scratches".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; "[T]here is the possibility that the photographs were doctored or the injuries inflicted at a later date", Wilson comments, "but Soviet justice rarely required such damning evidence."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Streltsov's wife of just over a year, Alla, filed for divorce soon after the accusations were made.&lt;ref name="Nilin99"&gt;{{Harvnb
  |Нилин (Nilin)
  |2002
  |p=99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Streltsov himself, the only members of the team present at his trial were Ogonkov and Tatushin, who appeared as witnesses.&lt;ref name=Nilin99/&gt;

====Conviction; the Gulag====

Streltsov confessed to the crime after being told this would allow him to keep his place in the Soviet team for the 1958 World Cup.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; This did not happen, however; far from remaining in the national side, Streltsov was sentenced to twelve years in the [[forced labor|forced]] [[labor camps|labour camps]] of the [[Gulag]], and barred from ever returning to professional football of any kind.&lt;ref name=Nilinch50/&gt; Plans for a march by 100,000 workers at Moscow's [[ZiL]] car factory, the base of the Torpedo club, to show support during the trial, were abandoned when Streltsov was sentenced before the march could be arranged.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nilin251/&gt; Ogonkov and Tatushin, meanwhile, were banned from playing any kind of organised football for three years,&lt;ref name="ogonkov"&gt;{{cite journal

|p=93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the camp where he was incarcerated, Streltsov was initially victimised by a young criminal who inflicted so much physical harm on him that he spent four months in the prison hospital, suffering from injuries caused by blows from either an "iron bar or a shoe heel".&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt; Camp authorities later started to include Streltsov in football matches to calm down the inmates in times of trouble; one prisoner, Ivan Lukyanov, later said: "[w]e loved Streltsov, we believed he would return to football. And not only us."&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;

Meanwhile, the Soviet team travelled to Sweden for the World Cup without Streltsov, Ogonkov or Tatushin. The world's press claimed that two of the competing teams were severely weakened: England by the [[Munich air disaster]], and the Soviets by the loss of Streltsov.&lt;ref name="Kuper39"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Kuper
|1998
|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets reached the quarter-finals, losing 2–0 to hosts Sweden, a team defeated 6–0 by the Soviet Union during Streltsov's 1955 debut.&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;&lt;ref name=ussr5259/&gt; Without Streltsov, Torpedo dropped from their second-place finish in 1957 to seventh [[1958 Soviet Top League|in 1958]], though the team also reached the Soviet Cup final before losing to Spartak. Streltsov's place as the club's leading scorer was taken by the 21-year-old forward [[Gennadi Gusarov]], who had turned professional with Torpedo during 1957. The team rose to fifth in 1959 before winning [[Double (association football)|the Double]] of Top League and Cup [[1960 Soviet Top League|during the following year]], with Gusarov leading the league in goals with 20. Torpedo then finished as runners-up in both competitions [[1961 Soviet Top League|in 1961]], with Gusarov scoring 22. Two mid-table finishes followed as Gusarov was sold to city rivals Dynamo between the 1962 and 1963 seasons, but Torpedo once again came second [[1964 Soviet Top League|in 1964]], losing a championship play-off against [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] after the two clubs finished equal on points.&lt;ref name=topleaguetables/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rusteam.permian.ru/players/gusarov.html |title=	Геннадий Гусаров (Gennadiy Gusarov) |language=Russian |first=Александр (Kashintsev, Alexander) |last=Кашинцев |work=Сборная России по футболу |accessdate=6 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and return to football===

====Amateur play====

Streltsov was released on 4 February 1963,&lt;ref name="Nilin134"&gt;{{Harvnb

|Нилин (Nilin)
|2002
|loc=Основные даты жизни Эдуарда Стрельцова}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to patch up his differences with Alla, he married Raisa Mikhailovna in September 1963. He started to play for the amateur factory team, which caused it to attract large crowds, both at home and away. When the ZiL side travelled to [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] for an away match late in the 1964 season, the team's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov, something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started; during the first half, they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium, chanting Streltsov's name. Worried that the angry crowd might go through with this, the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half. On stepping onto the field, the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation.&lt;ref name="Nilinch42"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Нилин (Nilin)
|2002
|loc=«Втуз бы я обязательно закончил...», p. 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Streltsov in the team, ZiL topped the factory league after winning all 11 matches. Although he was not allowed to play for Torpedo, Streltsov attended matches at his old club throughout the season.&lt;ref name=Nilinch42/&gt; In October 1964, Khrushchev was replaced as the Communist Party's [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who shortly after taking office received a letter signed by tens of thousands of people, including [[Hero of Socialist Labour|heroes of Socialist Labour]] and national and regional [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] members, requesting the reversal of Streltsov's professional ban. Some party members were wary of a potential comeback, fearing that Streltsov's inclusion in a Torpedo squad that regularly travelled to Western Europe could lead to an international incident, but Brezhnev repealed the ban, arguing that as a free man Streltsov should be able to use his trained profession. He was cleared to return to Torpedo before the 1965 season.&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nilinch50"&gt;{{Harvnb

====Return to professionalism====
Streltsov was enthusiastically welcomed back by supporters.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Although he had lost some of his strength and agility, his footballing intelligence was still intact; his presence helped Torpedo to win the [[1965 Soviet Top League|1965 Soviet championship]], with Streltsov scoring 12 goals from 26 league matches.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt;&lt;ref name=clubstats/&gt;&lt;ref name=topleaguetables/&gt; At the end of the season, he came second in the voting for the [[Soviet Footballer of the Year]] behind Torpedo team-mate [[Valery Voronin]].&lt;ref name=poy/&gt; It was the second time that Torpedo had won the league; the club had won its first title [[1960 Soviet Top League|five years earlier]], during Streltsov's imprisonment.&lt;ref name=topleaguetables/&gt; Streltsov made his debut in continental club competition on 28 September 1966, playing in a 1–0 defeat away to [[F.C.

An appearance in a 1–0 away defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] followed two weeks later.&lt;ref name=ussr6069/&gt; Torpedo reached the final of the [[Soviet Cup]] in 1966, but lost 2–0 to Dynamo.&lt;ref name=topleaguetables/&gt; Streltsov matched his previous seasonal tally of 12 league goals during the 1966 Top League season.&lt;ref name=clubstats/&gt;

Streltsov successfully re-established himself in the Soviet team over the following year, as he appeared in eight consecutive USSR matches, starting with a 2–0 friendly victory over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in Glasgow in May 1967. He scored two goals during this run in the national side: one each in a 4–2 win against [[France national football team|France]] in Paris on 3 June 1967 and a 4–3 European Championship qualifying home victory over [[Austria national football team|Austria]] eight days later. After losing his place for the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying|qualifying]] match against Finland on 30 August 1967, Streltsov missed three Soviet Union matches. He regained his place for an away friendly match against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] on 8 October, scoring a goal as the Soviets fought back from 1–0 to record a 2–1 win. He retained his place for the rest of the calendar year, and scored a hat-trick away against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] on 17 December.&lt;ref name=ussr6069/&gt; He was voted Soviet Footballer of the Year at the end of the season,&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="poy"&gt;{{cite web

Streltsov was dropped from the Soviet team for the first three national team matches of 1968. After featuring in a home friendly win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in April, he made his final appearance for the USSR in the 2–0 1968 European Championship quarter-final first leg loss to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 4 May 1968. The Soviets beat Hungary 3–0 in Moscow a week later, without Streltsov, to qualify for the final tournament on aggregate. Streltsov was left out of the tournament squad, and never played for the USSR again; after his final appearance, his international tally stood at 25 goals in 38 matches.&lt;ref name=ussr6069/&gt; Torpedo won the Soviet Cup during the 1968 season, overcoming [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek]] side [[FC Pakhtakor Tashkent|Pakhtakor Tashkent]] 1–0 in the final.&lt;ref name=topleaguetables/&gt; Streltsov retained his title of Soviet Footballer of the Year after scoring the highest seasonal total of his career, 21 (in the league), but was moved back to [[midfielder|midfield]] before the 1969 season and did not score in 23 league matches during his final two years.

==Post-retirement career==
Following a footballing career [[List of one-club men in association football|spent exclusively with Torpedo]], Streltsov, a supporter of [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team.&lt;ref name=Rizhkov/&gt; After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund his study of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture.&lt;ref name="Nilin226"&gt;{{Harvnb

Olympic policy in 1956 was to award gold medals only to members of the winning football squad who had played in the final match. Since Streltsov did not play in the final, he did not receive a medal. He was posthumously given a gold medal in 2006, after this policy was changed retroactively to allow all members of winning Olympic squads to receive medals.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Style of play and legacy==
Many critics consider Streltsov to be one of the finest footballers ever from Russia or the Soviet Union: British journalist and author Jonathan Wilson describes him as "the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced&amp;nbsp;... a tall, powerful forward, possessed of a fine first touch and extraordinary footballing intelligence",&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; while Russian author Aleksandr Nilin writes that "the boy came to us from the land of wonder".&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt; Streltsov's skilful, innovative style of play helped him to stand out in Soviet football, and his pioneering of the back-heeled pass resulted in it becoming known in Russia as "Streltsov's pass".&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite news

In his later years, with his physical attributes reduced, he emphasised his skill and on-field intelligence to become more of a playmaker, playing further back and setting up attacking moves for team-mates rather than leading them himself. Indeed, for his final two seasons, Streltsov played in an attacking midfield role rather than up front. Despite the eight-year gap between his two spells as a member of the Soviet national team, Streltsov, nicknamed "The Russian [[Pelé]]",&lt;ref name=OFlynn/&gt; was the fourth highest international goalscorer in the country's history.&lt;ref name=ussrcaps/&gt;

The '''Historical revision of the Inquisition''' is a [[historiography|historiographical]] process that started to emerge in the 1970s, with the opening of formerly closed archives, the development of [[Cultural history|new historical methodologies]], and, in Spain, the death of the ruling dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in 1975. New works of [[historical revisionism]] changed our knowledge of the history of the [[Inquisition|Roman and Spanish Inquisition]]s.

Writers associated with this project share the view of Edward Peters, a prominent historian in the field, who states: "The Inquisition was an image assembled from a body of legends and myths which, between the sixteenth and the twentieth centuries, established the perceived character of inquisitorial tribunals and influenced all ensuing efforts to recover their historical reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Iarocci | first = Michael P. | title = Properties of Modernity | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | date = 1 March 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0826515223&amp;id=CuliwYNyvSUC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;sig=DOZYfMfF_RBMgzsbT8KfXVqO3y4 | isbn = 0-8265-1522-3 | page = 218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Inquisition]]s were ecclesiastical investigations conducted either directly by the [[Catholic Church]] or by secular authorities with the support of the Church. These investigations were undertaken at varying times in varying regions under the authority of the local bishop and his designates or under the sponsorship of papal-appointed legates. The purpose of each inquisition was specific to the outstanding circumstances of the region in which it was held. Investigations usually involved a legal process, the goal of which was to obtain a [[Confession (law)|confession]] and reconciliation with the Church from those who were accused of heresy or of participating in activities contrary to Church [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. The objectives of the inquisitions were to secure the repentance of the accused and to maintain the authority of the Church. Inquisitions were conducted with the collaboration of secular authorities. If an investigation resulted in a person being convicted of heresy and unwillingness to repent punishment was administered by the secular authorities.

"Until recently, Protestant-inspired literature on the Inquisition tended to be hostile to the Catholic Church per se, while Catholic literature tended to be narrowly apologetic and justificatory."&lt;ref name=Hove/&gt; For Protestant scholars of the nineteenth century such as [[William H. Prescott]] and [[John Lothrop Motley]] the [[Spanish Inquisition]] represented  "the archsymbol of religious intolerance and ecclesiastical power".&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/reviews/980419.19kagent.html Kagan, Richard L., "A Kinder, Gentler Inquisition", ''The New York Times'' (book review), 19 April 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Charles Lea]] wrote both ''A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages'' (1888) and ''A History of the Inquisition of Spain'' (1906). ''A History of the Inquisition of Spain'' was considered both groundbreaking and polemical. His studies were criticized for having both an [[anti-Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, R. S. [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic13philuoft#page/n413/mode/2up ''"The Last Historian of the Inquisition,"''] ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', Vol. XIII, N°. 51, July 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; and an anti-Spanish bias. Lea saw the Inquisition as ''theocratic absolutism'' that weakened Spain to an extent that undermined its overseas empire and ultimately contributed to its defeat during the Spanish–American War of 1898.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt; However both [[Juan Antonio Llorente]]'s in his ''Histoire critique de l'Inquisition espagnole'' (1817) and Lea had access to original documents.

For a long time, the Spanish Inquisition had been associated principally with persecution of Protestants. Nineteenth-century historian [[José Amador de los Ríos]] brought a focus to bear on the situation of Spain's large ''converso'' population.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

==More recent studies==
The two most significant and extensively-cited sources of this revised analysis of the [[historiography]] of the inquisitorial proceedings are ''Inquisition'' (1988) by Edward Peters and ''The Spanish Inquisition: An Historical Revision'' (1997) by [[Henry Kamen]]. These works focus on identifying and correcting what they argue are popular modern misconceptions about the inquisitions and historical misinterpretations of their activities. Kamen's 1997 book is updated and revised from an edition first published in 1965. Kamen takes the position that the Inquisition in Spain was motivated more by political considerations than religious, that the monarchs routinely protected those close to the crown, and that in Aragon large areas either defied or hindered its operation.&lt;ref name=Rust&gt;[http://jcs.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/381.extract Rust, Eric C., "Review of The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision", ''Journal of Church and State''] Vol. 41, Issue 2, p.  381&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Rust of Baylor University describes Kamen's work as "historical revision at its best".&lt;ref name=Rust/&gt;

Helen Rawlings credits Kamen with launching a movement to revisit the historical record.&lt;ref name=Hove&gt;[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/vanhove_inquisitions_apr08.asp Hove, Brian S.J., "The Inquisitions of History: The Mythology and the Reality", Ignatian Insight, January 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlings identifies four distinct phases, as over time the Inquisition in Spain adapted to changing conditions. From 1480 to 1525 there was an intense persecution of ''conversos'' suspected of continuing to practice Judaism. From 1525 to 1630 there was an increased concern of possible Protestant influence on "Old Christians". A less active period from 1630 to 1725 periodically looked to Portuguese "New Christians" operating in Spanish commercial sectors; and from 1725 to 1824 traditionalists and liberals argued the future of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hsp/summary/v007/7.1.rawlings.html  Helen Rawlings.

{{Further|Medieval Inquisition}}

=== The "Grand Program" ===
During the 11th century, a new wave of religiosity swept through Europe. It claimed that the prospect of [[salvation]] in the world would greatly increase if the world were reformed. In addition, the [[papacy]] itself underwent reform at the end of the 11th century and the Church began devising its "grand program of sanctifying the world".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=40}} This "grand program" was a combination of the Church's desire to reform its institutional life, free itself from secular control, and to build a Christian society. There was also a growing opinion that those who rebelled from the church's beliefs ([[heretics]]) or those who behaved in a manner that was "un-Christian" were not simply souls led astray in a "temptation-filled world, but [were] subverters of the world's new course".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=40}}

Until the late 12th century, the investigation of [[heresy]] was considered the responsibility of local churches and it was held that local secular authorities would prosecute heretics. However, in 1179, the Church's "grand program of sanctifying the world" saw the creation of The Third Lateran Council that included a canon condemning heretics.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=47}} In 1184, [[Pope Lucius III]] issued the ''[[Ad abolendam]]'', labeled "the founding charter of the inquisition," that called for those found as heretics by the local church to be turned over to secular courts.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=47}} Finally, in 1199, [[Pope Innocent III]] equated heresy with treason and in 1208 called for a "crusade" against the Albigensians{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=50}}

=== The Albigensian Crusade ===
{{Main|Albigensian Crusade}}
According to Peters the violence of the following "Albigensian Crusade" was not in line with the reforms and plans of Innocent, who stressed confession, reform of the clergy and [[laity]], and pastoral teachings to oppose heresy.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=50-51}} Peters asserts that the violence was due to the "crusade" being under the control of mobs, petty rulers, and local bishops who did not uphold Innocent's ideas, armies from northern France swept through the south and essentially eradicated the Albigensians. The uncontainable, prejudicial passion of local mobs and heresy hunters, the violence of secular courts, and the bloodshed of the Albigensian crusade sparked a desire within the papacy to implement greater control over the prosecution of heresy. This desire led to the development of organized legal procedures for dealing with heretics.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=52-58}}

[[Protestant]] reformers in the 16th century often pointed to the Cathar and Waldensian movements as part of an underground reformed Church that had been the victim of persecution for centuries even though the Cathars had an unquestionably non-Reformed, [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] perception of God.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=123}}

=== Codes and torture ===
Generally, inquisitorial courts functioned much like the secular courts of the time, though their sentences and penances were less cruel.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=65}} A number of procedures and protections restricted the [[torture]] of the accused, although much torture could be inflicted, and capital punishment was executed by secular authorities due to the clerical prohibition on shedding blood.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=45}} Torture was used to extract confession, rather than as a form of punishment as used by secular courts. Any confession made following or during torture had to be freely repeated the next day without torture or it was considered invalid.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=65}}  "Technically, therefore, torture was strictly a means of obtaining the only full proof available…[The inquisitors'] tasks were not only – or even primarily – to convict the contumacious heretic, but…to preserve the unity of the Church".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=65}}

After the suppression of the Albigensian heresy in southern France in the 13th century, inquisitorial trials diminished in the face of more pressing local needs, and any lingering trials were left to secular authorities. Inquisitorial courts conducted under local episcopacies worked closely with local secular authorities and dealt with local circumstances. Regional control of the inquisitorial process and regional concerns became dominant.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=74}}  By the mid-to-late 14th century papal-commissioned inquisitions had been dissolved in many parts of Europe.

== The Inquisitions in Spain ==
{{Further|Spanish Inquisition}}

=== Antisemitism and the "conversos" ===
Peters writes,&lt;blockquote&gt;"From the mid fifteenth century on, religious anti-Semitism changed into ethnic anti-Semitism, with little difference seen between Jews and conversos except for the fact that conversos were regarded as worse than Jews because, as ostensible Christians, they had acquired privileges and positions that were denied to Jews. The result of this new ethnic anti-Semitism was the invocation of an inquisition to ferret out the false conversos who had, by becoming formal Christians, placed themselves under its authority".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=84}}

It was a heated mixture of this racial and religious prejudice against the conversos that ignited what later became known as the "Spanish Inquisition."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main heresy prosecuted during the period of inquisitions in Spain was the secret practice of [[Judaism]] among some ''conversos''. (The number of ''conversos'' secretly practicing what of Judaism they could is unknown, but recent scholarship has tended to document the existence of more of them, and at later dates, than previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;William Childers, “'Según es cristiana la gente': The Quintanar of ''[[Persiles and Sigismunda|Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' and the Archival Record, ''Cervantes. Journal of the Cervantes Society of America'', vol. 24, no. 2, fall 2004, http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/segun-es-cristiana-la-gente-the-quintanar-of-persiles-y-sigismunda-and-the-archival-record/, consulted 6/10/2015.&lt;/ref&gt;) From the establishment of the inquisitions up to 1530, it is estimated that approximately 2,000 "heretics" were turned over to the secular authorities for execution in Spain.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}}

There were so few Protestants in Spain that widespread persecution of Protestantism was not physically possible. In the 1560s, a little over one hundred people in Spain were convicted of Protestantism and were turned over to the secular authorities for execution. From 1560 to 1599, two hundred more people were accused of being followers of [[Martin Luther]]. "Most of them were in no sense Protestants...Irreligious sentiments, drunken mockery, anticlerical expressions, were all captiously classified by the inquisitors (or by those who denounced the cases) as 'Lutheran{{'"}}.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=98}}

=== Procedure and torture ===
[[Evidence]] and [[witness]] [[testimony]] was gathered before an arrest was made. Once an arrest was made, the accused was given several opportunities to admit to any heretical behavior before the charges against him/her were identified. If the accused did not admit to any wrongdoing, the inquisitors dictated the charges and the accused was required to respond to them immediately.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=93}}  Torture was used, but only for extracting [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s during a trial and was not used as [[punishment]] after sentencing. If torture was used, the accused was required to repeat their repentance without torture.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=92-93}}  The Inquisition also had a rule that they were only allowed to use torture once, however, they were able to 'suspend' sessions and resume them the following day, though this never lead into a 3rd day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/257/000111921/ NNDB – Torquemada]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the French inquisitions, the purpose of Spanish inquisitorial torture was to gain either information or confession, not to punish. It was used in a relatively small percentage of trials, since of course the threat of torture if no confession was given was often enough to induce one, and was usually a last resort.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|pp=174–192}} The "scenes of sadism conjured up by popular writers on the inquisition have little basis in reality, though the whole procedure was unpleasant enough [even] to arouse periodic protests from Spaniards".{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=189}}

Modern historian [[Thomas F. Madden]] has suggested that the Inquisition "was an attempt to stop unjust executions" and "the Spanish Inquisition was widely hailed as the best run, most humane court in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madden|first=Thomas|title=The Real Inquisition: investigating the popular myth|url=http://nationalreview.com/article/211193/real-inquisition-thomas-f-madden|accessdate=22 September 2013|newspaper=[[National Review]]|date=18 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''auto de fe'' ===
The ''[[auto de fe]]'' that followed trials is the most infamous part of the inquisitions in Spain. The ''auto de fe'' involved prayer, celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=93-94}} Artistic representations{{By whom|date=January 2013}} of the ''auto de fe'' usually depict torture and the burning at the stake. These paintings became a major source for creating the violent image popularly associated with the Spanish inquisitions. However, this type of activity never took place during an ''auto de fe'', which was in essence a religious act. Torture was not administered after a trial concluded and executions were always held after and separate from the ''auto de fe''.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|pp=92–213}}  Because the autos de fe officially separate torture and execution, all these events should be considered separate. Although some torture (routine throughout the continent at the time) may have been caused indirectly by the church, the church did not hold itself officially responsible for the murders committed during the inquisition.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=218}}

Between 1550 and 1800, the inquisitions in Spain focused on not only Protestants, but also the conversos, the supervision of their own clergy, the general problem of non-mainstream religious beliefs among Catholics, and "blasphemous" or "scandalous" behavior.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=86}} Some believe that the Spanish inquisitions may not have been not exceptionally different from other European courts of the time in their prosecution of these offences, as many of these charges were viewed as part of a broad class of moral crimes that raised legitimate concern to spiritual and secular courts in an age when many regarded religion as the fundamental foundation of society.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=87}}

== The Inquisitions in Italy ==
{{Further|Roman Inquisition}}

=== Context ===
Increasing trends in regionalism, the criticism of ecclesiastic abuses, the [[Avignon Papacy]], and [[the Great Schism]] all contributed to the emergence of new religious dissent and unrest in 14th and 15th century Italy. Furthermore, widespread ecclesiastical and clerical reform advanced through the last decades of the 15th century, and by the second decade of the 16th century, reform movements prevailed in many parts of Europe.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=106}}

The protests raised by [[Martin Luther]] that began in 1517 did not initially receive much attention from the papacy.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=107}}  Luther and his supporters concreted the principles of the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 1520s, sparking the development of many reform movements in various regions of Italy. By the time of the [[pontificate]] of [[Paul III]], the Reform movement had swept much of Europe away from the Catholic Church. In response, [[Paul III]] issued the ''Licet ab initio'', establishing inquisitions in Rome in 1542.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=108}} These inquisitions consisted of six cardinals given the authority to investigate heresy and to appoint deputies when they deemed necessary.

=== The creation of the Holy Office ===
Although the Roman inquisitions worked moderately and guardedly during the remainder of the pontificate of Paul III, they became an essential part of the structure of Rome when [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]], who became pope in 1555, launched the [[Counter-Reformation]] that Paul III began.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=108}}  Later, in 1588, [[Pope Sixtus V]] officially organized the inquisitions into the Congregation of the Holy Roman and Universal Inquisition or Holy Office.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=109}}  It is important to note, however, that this was only one of fifteen administrative departments of the papal government and was not the sole operating body of the Church.

=== "Heresies" of the Italian Inquisitions ===
Even though the inquisitions in Spain prosecuted a small quantity of Reformers, the Roman inquisitions were the first to target intentionally and specifically the "heresy" of Protestantism. These inquisitions and their subordinate tribunals were generally successful in keeping any substantial Protestant influence from spreading throughout Italy.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=110}}  Protestants in the decades and centuries to come would use this relatively short-lived persecution as the basis for their accusations about the awful "Inquisition." Protestant movements were reduced by around 1600, so for the duration of the 17th century the Roman inquisitions turned their focus to offences other than Protestantism, notably "[[magic (paranormal)|magical]]" heresy.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=111}}

In many trials involving "[[witchcraft]]" or "sorcery," “the inquisitors understood very well that the lack of catechesis or consistent pastoral guidance could often result in misunderstandings of doctrine and liturgy, and they showed [[Toleration|tolerance]] of all but the most unavoidably serious circumstances. Thus, although both the Spanish and Roman inquisitions prosecuted the offenses of witchcraft and sorcery very early and vigorously, they also were the first courts to be skeptical of the evidence and mechanism of witchcraft accusations, and they consistently offered the most lenient treatment to marginal cases".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=111}}

Italian historian Andrea Del Col estimates that out of 62,000 cases judged by Inquisition in Italy after 1542 only 2% (ca. 1250) ended with death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivio.panorama.it/home/articolo/idA020001038812 INTOLLERANZA RELIGIOSA – ALLE RADICI DELLA VIOLENZA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of the Holy Office ===
By the turn of the 18th century, the Congregation of the Holy Office had virtually no power or influence outside the [[Papal States]].{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=119}}  Its main function shifted yet again to the investigation of clerical immorality and corruption and to the [[Censorship|censoring]] of printed books, the latter of which was the key responsibility of the Congregation of the Index.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=119}} By 1860, the restrictions placed upon ecclesiastical authority and the emerging national Italian state only further reduced the activities of the Holy Office. With its powers reduced to the weakened Papal State, the Office became an advisory committee to the late 19th century popes, where it played a far greater advisory than executive role.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=120}}

In 1965 [[Pope Paul VI]] changed the Office's name to The Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith and abolished the Congregation of the Index entirely in 1966. Since then, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has functioned as a papal advisor on [[theological]] matters and on matters of ecclesiastical discipline. "Although its work is regular, the Congregation can now hardly be thought of as an Inquisition".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=120}}

== The Creation of "The Inquisition" ==
The modern day notion of a unified and horrible "Inquisition" is an assemblage of the "body of legends and myths which, between the sixteenth and the twentieth centuries, established the perceived character of inquisitorial tribunals and influenced all ensuing efforts to recover their historical reality".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=122}} "The [assembled] myth was originally devised to serve variously the political purposes of a number of early modern political regimes, as well as Protestant Reformers, proponents of religious and civil toleration, philosophical enemies of the civil power of organized religions, and progressive modernists..."{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=1}} It was the relatively limited persecution of [[Protestants]], mostly by the inquisitions in Spain and Italy, that provoked the first image of "The Inquisition" as the most [[violent]] and suppressive vehicle of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] against [[Protestantism]]. Later, philosophical critics of religious persecution and the [[Catholic Church]] only furthered this image during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=122}}

=== Catholic opposition to the Spanish Inquisition ===
"...an early major source of anti-Inquisition propaganda happened to be Catholic in origin.  With the outstanding exception of the Holy Roman Empire, every significant Catholic state in Europe, including France, was at some time hostile to Spain."{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=375}} Contemporary political scientist [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (in [[The Prince]]) suggested that King Ferdinand of Spain (who originated the Spanish Inquisition) used religion to his political and financial advantage.  Italians under Spanish rule repeatedly revolted against the imposition of a Spanish Inquisition (such as revolts in Naples in 1547).{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=147}} Unpaid Spanish and Germanic mercenaries of the King of Spain ([[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]) [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] ten years after [[Martin Luther|Luther]] posted his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|theses]], besieging the Pope and ending Rome's pre-eminence in the Renaissance.  Italian diplomats expressed a low opinion of the Spanish and their Inquisition.{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=375}} [[Bartolomé de las Casas|Internal criticism of Spanish policies in the Americas]] was cited by foes of the Inquisition.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=131-132}}

=== "A Protestant Vision..." ===
"When the printing press first began to form public opinion ... the most diligent victims of the Inquisition happened to be supporters of the Reformation, and they set about convincing Europe that Spain's intentions ... were now directed against Christian truth and liberty."{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=374}}  ''The Inquisition'' was characterized by [[cleric]]al organization and support of the inquisitions in Spain and Italy, their "united" success in suppressing Protestant doctrines, and the fear of ''The Inquisition'' being initiated elsewhere.  "Propaganda along these lines proved to be strikingly effective in the context of the political conflicts of the time, and there were always refuges from persecution to lend substance to the story."{{sfn|Kamen|2014|pp=374-375}}  "As a [[Protestant]] vision of Christian history took shape in the 16th century, the contemporary inquisitions were identified with the inquisitorial tribunals of the medieval past, and the Protestant Reformers with earlier victims of ''The Inquisition''".{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=122-123}}  [[Catholic]] defenders of the inquisitorial process used the same argument – that the Reformers were no different from [[medieval]] [[heretics]] and should be prosecuted in the same manner – thus perpetuating the idea of a continuous, masterminded ''Inquisition''.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=123}}  Both sides made emotional appeals; "Thus alongside various kinds of theological and personal polemic, a war of martyrologies commenced."{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=126}}

=== The Revolt of the Netherlands ===
The Netherlands and Spain came to share rulers by marriage and inheritance among royal families.  The Dutch chaffed under the shared monarchy; their many states wanted to retain traditional autonomy while the crown sought centralized authority.  The animosity between the King and the Netherlands had complex origins - political, economic, cultural, religious and personal.{{sfn|Duke|2004|pp=27-34}}

By around 1550, the Dutch "[[printing press]] and propaganda turned to the service of political reform, with The Inquisition as a major focus, on…a wide scale and with…devastating effects".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=144}}{{Efn|Losing a battle of the press was not inevitable.  By 1487 many presses operated in Spain and tax policies favored printers, foreign and domestic.  Queen Isabel was fond of literature, music and paintings.{{sfn|Reston|2006|p=172}}}} Even though the Dutch organized their own state-run [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|inquisitions]], it was feared that King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] would implement a new "Spanish Inquisition" in the [[Netherlands]] to eliminate [[Protestantism]]. Popular literature, circulating pamphlets, and other images painted the picture of a widespread, awful "Spanish Inquisition." A decree of the Spanish Inquisition signed by the King of Spain in 1568 declared most Dutch lives and property forfeit.  The decree was not determined to be a forgery until the 20th century.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=152}}  Such anti-inquisition propaganda motivated ''all'' citizens.
Eventually, "The Inquisition" became viewed as the primary instrument of [[Catholic]] tyranny, not only of [[Protestants]], but also of freedom of thought and religion in general. However, exporting the Inquisition to the Netherlands was never in the plans of the Spanish Habsburg rulers, at least after the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  The Dutch Inquisition was killing heretics much faster than the Spanish Inquisition.{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=377}}

=== Montanus ===
In 1567 ''A Discovery and Plaine Declaration of Sundry Subtill Practices of the Holy Inquisition of Spain'' was published under the pseudonym [[Reginaldus Gonzalvus Montanus]].{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=133}}  While authorship is disputed, it was probably written by [[Antonio del Corro]] and/or [[Casiodoro de Reina]], both previously Spanish Catholic monks who became Protestants and fled the Inquisition.  The former was a theologian, close relative of an inquisitor and ferocious enemy of the Spanish Inquisition in its campaign to destroy Protestantism.  The latter was a student of the Bible from childhood, later translating the Bible into Spanish.  Montanus' text was "brief, intelligently designed, and written in a lively and engaging style."{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=133}}  It was simultaneously accurate about Inquisitional practices (perhaps published for the first time) and misleading.  "Taking some of the most extreme of Inquisitional practices as the norm, Montanus portray[ed] every victim of the Inquisition as innocent, every Inquisition official as venal and deceitful, [and] every step in its procedure as a violation of natural and rational law".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=134}}  The text included 12 case histories of Lutheran martyrs of the Inquisition which were widely read into the early 19th century.  The document, along with a number of successive publications, was reprinted and translated throughout Europe and became the definitive source on ''The Inquisition'' for many years; "histories" about ''The Inquisition'' written after 1567 relied on Montanus as their main source.  The Spanish Inquisition, regarding its procedures as secret, never disputed Montanus.  In a public relations war of the press the Spanish Inquisition forfeited.{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=390}}

For reasons of history England and France were particularly receptive to Montanus.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=134-144}}  English monarchs alternated between persecuting Catholics and persecuting Protestants.  The French could not agree on a jurisdiction; parlementary and royal inquisitions had both failed.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=144}}

A more balanced history awaited the publication of [[Philipp van Limborch]] in 1692.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=167}} [[Juan Antonio Llorente]] later published a more detailed, if exaggerated, history through his access to the archives of the Spanish Inquisition.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=278-283}}

=== William of Orange ===

This document preserved and reinforced all of the anti-"Inquisition" propaganda generated at the beginning and throughout the [[Dutch revolt]].{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=153}}

William of Orange had been a personal friend of his King from childhood. Nonetheless he became the leader of the Dutch revolt.  The King put a price on his head, leading to his assassination.  de Villiers had been William's chaplain.  The ''Apologie'' was William of Orange's rebuttal of the charges made against him (and thus against the revolt).  The assassination and rebuttal made William of Orange a martyr, unifying the opposition in a very long war which ultimately lead to the formation of Belgium and the Dutch Republic as separate countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== The Black Legend ===
During this time, England, under the rule of the [[Protestant]] [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and threatened with military attacks from Spain, found a new surge of nationalism being fueled by anti-Catholic propaganda centered on a series of books and pamphlets that detailed the horror of the "Spanish Inquisition".{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=139–144}} Peters writes, "An image of Spain circulated through late 16th-century Europe, borne by means of political and religious propaganda that blackened the characters of Spaniards and their ruler to such an extent that Spain became the symbol of all forces of repression, brutality, religious and political intolerance, and intellectual and artistic backwardness for the next four centuries. Spaniards&amp;nbsp;... have termed this process and the image that resulted from it as 'The Black Legend', "la leyenda negra".{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=131}}

Henry Kamen has criticized the concept, "Persistent employment of the [Black Legend] label for ideological ends in order to rebut any criticism of Spain's imperial record has made it both unsuitable to use and inaccurate.  In any case many of Spain's actions ... were all too real and no "legend"."  "At all times, imperial nations tend to suffer ... in the arena of public opinion, and Spain was no exception, becoming the first victim of a long tradition of polemic that picked on the Inquisition as the most salient point of attack."{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=379}}

=== The Enlightenment and Art ===
By the 17th century, "The Inquisition" provided political and philosophical thinkers with an ideal symbol of religious intolerance. These [[philosophers]] and politicians passionately denounced "The Inquisition," citing it as the cause for all the political and economic failures in countries where "Inquisitions" were held. From these [[debates]] on toleration, "The Inquisition" was presented by French ''[[philosophes]]'' as the worst of any religious evil to ever come out of Europe.{{sfn|Peters|1988|pp=154-155}}Additionally, writers, artists, and sculptors of the 17th and 18th centuries used "The Inquisition" as one of their main inspirations, retaliating against "The Inquisition's" suppression of creativity, literature, and art.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=189}} These artistic images have arguably become some of the most long-lasting and effective perpetuators of "The Inquisition" myth.{{Efn|"Incredible as it may seem, in the age of the printing press not a single authentic Spanish image of the Holy Office saw the light of day.  In the battle of images, the Inquisition was a clear loser."{{sfn|Kamen|2014|p=266}}  Images of the Spanish Inquisition by [[Pedro Berruguete]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[Philipp van Limborch]], [[Bernard Picart]] (and perhaps [[Francisco Rizi]]?) may be historically inaccurate.}}

{{Dutch Grammar}}
The '''history of Dutch orthography''' covers the changes in spelling of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] both in the [[Netherlands]] itself and in the Dutch-speaking region of [[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]].

== Dutch spelling in the Middle Ages ==
The Dutch spoken between 1150  and 1500 is referred to as [[Middle Dutch]]. During this period there was no standardization of grammar.  Authors generally wrote in their own dialects.  Very often it is possible to tell from the language whether a text comes from [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], or [[Holland]]. There was a lot of variation in the spelling.  Words were often written as they were pronounced:  ''lant'' (land), ''hi vint'' (he finds).  The sound determined the spelling, irrespective of the basic word.  This is no longer the case with modern Dutch, where ''land'' is still pronounced [lant] but spelt to conform with the plural ''landen'', and ''hij vindt'' (he finds) (still [vint]) has both ''d'' of the infinitive (''vinden'') and the 3rd person singular ending ''t''.

From the very start of its written history, Dutch used the [[Latin alphabet]].  At first there were 23 letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, y, z. It was not until later that the j, u, and w were added.

A problem with the Latin alphabet was that it was not easy to make a distinction between long and short [[vowels]] (''a'' / ''aa'').  Various solutions were found.  At the beginning of the 13th century the word ''jaar'' (year) was spelt ''jar'' but other variants soon appeared:  ''jaer'' and ''jair'' and later ''jaar'' or even ''yaer'' and ''iaer''.

Another feature of Middle Dutch is that articles or prepositions were often joined onto the word they belonged to: ''tjaer'' (the year) and ''dlant'' (the land), as in the accompanying fragment from ''[[Elegast|Karel ende Elegast]]''.  The text translates: “I will tell you a marvelous story, and a true one.  Listen!   One evening Charles was sleeping in Ingelheim on the Rhine.  All the land you could see was his.”

There were also regional differences.  Thus a clerk in [[Amsterdam]] in the 14th century would usually write ''lant'', but one in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] would write ''land''.

The invention of printing led to a more standardized approach.

== The Siegenbeek spelling (1804,  the Netherlands) ==
With the spirit of the [[French Revolution]] pervading all areas of thought, attempts were made to unify Dutch spelling and [[grammar]].  Matthijs Siegenbeek, professor at [[Leiden]] was officially asked in 1801 to draw up a uniform spelling; the [[priest]] Petrus Weiland was asked to write a grammar book.  A few years later Siegenbeek published his spelling in  ''Verhandeling over de Nederduitsche spelling ter bevordering van de eenparigheid in dezelve'' (Treatise on Lower Dutch spelling to promote uniformity herein) (1804) and a ''Woordenboek voor de Nederduitsche spelling'' (Dictionary for the Dutch Spelling) (1805). The government of the [[Batavian Republic]] officially introduced Siegenbeek's spelling on 18 December 1804.

Siegenbeek thought that the spelling should reflect refined Dutch pronunciation, taking into account the uniformity, [[etymology]], and analogy.  From the Siegenbeek spelling reforms, one gets the modern Dutch [[IJ (digraph)|''ij'']] (called ''lange ij'' (''long y'') as distinct from the usually identically pronounced ''ei,'' called ''korte ei'' (short ''ei'')).  The word for iron ''ijzer'' used to be written ''yzer''.  Other spellings from Siegenbeek include: ''berigt'' (modern Dutch: ''bericht'' / report), ''blaauw'' (''blauw'' / blue), ''Dingsdag'' (''dinsdag'' / Tuesday), ''gooijen'' (''gooien'' / to throw), ''magt'' (''macht'' / power), ''kagchel'' (''kachel'' / stove), ''koningrijk'' (''koninkrijk'' /kingdom), ''muzijk'' (''muziek'' / music) and ''zamen'' (''samen'' / together).

Siegenbeek's spelling never achieved real popularity.  In particular the [[poet]] [[Willem Bilderdijk]] fought against it, largely out of personal spite. He produced some of his own spellings which were popular in the 1830s and 1840s including the modern ''kachel'' (stove), ''plicht'' (instead of ''pligt'' /duty) and ''gooien'' (to throw). However, other spellings of his did not last:  ''andwoord'' (''antwoord'' / answer), ''hair'' (''haar'' /hair/her), ''ontfangen'' (''ontvangen'' / to receive), ''thands'' (''thans'' / at present) and ''wareld''{{specify|date=November 2013}}&lt;!-- this seems to be a matter of pronunciation, not just spelling --&gt; (''wereld'' / world).

== The Willems spelling (1844, Belgium) ==
In the Dutch-speaking areas in the south of the Netherlands, the Siegenbeek spelling was always unpopular.  After Belgium declared independence in 1830, the spelling was denounced as “Hollandish” and “Protestant”.  The spelling situation was quite chaotic with much discussion about whether to use ''a'' or ''ae'', ''oo'' or ''oó'', ''ee'' or ''eé'', ''ei'' or ''ey'', ''ui'' or ''uy'', ''ambt'' or ''ampt'', ''u'' or ''ue'', and about the spelling of verbs.

In 1836, the Belgian government offered a reward for a proposal for a new spelling.  In the end, the jury, headed by [[Jan Frans Willems]], produced their own suggestion in 1839 which remained quite close to the Siegenbeek spelling in use in the Netherlands.  They retained their own spelling of a few words such as ''kaes'' (cheese), ''ryden'' (to ride) and ''vuerig'' (fiery).  The Willems spelling was given royal approval on January 9, 1844.

==The De Vries and Te Winkel spelling (1864, Belgium; 1883, The Netherlands) ==
The spelling used today both in the Netherlands and in Flanders (Dutch-speaking Belgium) is based on an orthography originally intended only for use in a dictionary.  An ambitious project was proposed in 1851 at the Taal- en Letterkundig Congres (Linguistic and Literary Congress) in [[Brussels]] at which both the Netherlands and Flanders were represented.  The project aimed to produce a large dictionary: Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (WNT) (Dictionary of the Dutch Language), incorporating vocabulary of the past centuries.

There was a problem with this project: which spelling was to be used for the dictionary?  There were three spelling systems in use at the time: the Willems spelling in Belgium, the Siegenbeek spelling in the Netherlands, and several variants of Bilderdijk’s system.  It would have been unacceptable to have used a mixture of these systems.  In addition, the Siegenbeek system did not address certain issues such as when compounds were to be written as one word or the interpolation of letters in between{{vague|date=November 2013}}.  It was proposed to create a special dictionary spelling.

This spelling was established by the linguists Matthias de Vries and L.A. te Winkel. In 1863 Te Winkel published the results in ''De grondbeginselen der Nederlandsche spelling. Ontwerp der spelling voor het aanstaande Nederlandsch Woordenboek'' (The foundations of Dutch spelling.  Project for the spelling of the forthcoming Dutch Dictionary). The spelling of De Vries and Te Winkel combined elements of the three current systems, providing a much needed solution to the chaos.  By 21 November, the decision was accepted by a royal decree in Belgium.  In 1866 De Vries and Te Winkel produced ''Woordenlijst voor de spelling der Nederlandsche taal'' (Vocabulary for the spelling of the Dutch language), which can be seen as a precursor of today’s Groene Boekje ([[Green Booklet]]).

The Netherlands were slower in accepting the De Vries and Te Winkel spelling. Schools continued to use the Siegenbeek spelling until 1870, and in government circles it was not until 1883 that the new spelling started to be used.  The De Vries and Te Winkel spelling eventually led to a large degree of uniformity of spelling in the Netherlands and Belgium.

== The Marchant spelling (1934, the Netherlands) {{anchor|Marchant spelling}} ==
Teachers and linguists continued to object to certain features of the spelling.  It was thought that too great an emphasis was being given to [[etymology]].  For instance, {{IPA|/eː/}} was spelt differently in ''l{{strong|e}}zen'' ("to read", single ''e'' in [[open syllable]] for {{IPA|/eː/}}) and in ''h{{strong|ee}}ten'' ("to be called", double ''e'' in open syllable for the same {{IPA|/eː/}}). This reflected the etymological distinction between "sharp-long" ''e'' (from Old Dutch long ''ē'') and "soft-long" ''e'' (from Old Dutch short ''e'' and ''i'' that were lengthened in open syllables). However, the etymological reasoning was hard to teach, as the distinction was not made by most Dutch speakers anymore.

R.A. Kollewijn produced an article in 1891 ''Onze lastige spelling. Een voorstel tot vereenvoudiging'' (Our awkward spelling: a proposal for simplification).  He emphasized the need for spelling to relate to pronunciation, therefore ''mensch'' (person/human) and ''Nederlandsch'' ought to become ''mens'' and ''Nederlands'', respectively. ''Russisch'' (Russian) he thought should be spelt ''Russies'' and ''moeilijk'' (difficult) ''moeilik''.  ''Heeten'' would be written ''heten'', but ''lezen'' would stay the same.

In 1916, a Dutch commission looked into the possibility of a compromise between De Vries and Te Winkel and the Kollewijn spelling.  This gradually led to adaptations: on 1 September 1934, the minister for Education, Marchant, accepted most of  Kollewijn’s proposals.  The Netherlands and Belgium were starting to diverge once again.

The Marchant spelling included: 
* abolition of declension for cases (e.g. ''den heer'' for accusative form of “de heer” (the gentleman))
* ''oo'' and ''ee'' at the end of open syllables (''zoo'' (so), ''heeten'' (to be called)) changed to ''zo'' and ''heten'', but ''ee'' at the end of a word remained (''zee'' (sea)).
* unpronounced 'ch' in words like ''mensch'' (person/human) and ''visch'' (fish) disappeared.
The endings '-isch' (as in ''logisch'' (logical)) and '-lijk' (''mogelijk'' (possible)) remained unchanged. Kollewijn's proposals '-ies' and '-lik' remain popular in some circles as a "progressive" spelling to the present day.

== The spelling reform of 1946 (Flanders) and 1947 (The Netherlands) ==
During [[World War II]] the governments of the Netherlands and Flanders decided to look for a way to restore the unification of spelling based on De Vries and Te Winkel. This led to the introduction of a simplification of the Marchant spelling being introduced in Flanders in 1946 and in the Netherlands the following year.  A Flemish-Dutch committee compiled a vocabulary which was published in 1954 in a green volume entitled “[[Wordlist of the Dutch language|Woordenlijst van de Nederlandse taal]]” (Vocabulary of the Dutch language), which became known as “het Groene Boekje” (the [[Green Booklet]]).

== The spelling reform of 1996 (The Netherlands and Flanders) ==
There was still dissatisfaction after 1954.  Uncertainty arose about many words which had alternative spellings: one version was the preferred spelling (e.g. ''actie'' (action)), the other was the ''permissible'' or ''progressive'' spelling (e.g. ''aktie'').  The Dutch generally used the former, the Belgians the latter.  Another problem was the speed at which Dutch was developing new vocabulary for which the 1954 dictionary was of no help for spelling definition.

In 1994, after much discussion, the Committee of Ministers of the [[Nederlandse Taalunie]] which had been founded in 1980 issued a new spelling decree.  In the new Groene Boekje which they published the alternative “progressive” spellings were abolished (it was now ''actie'') and there were new rules about the ''n'' linking the compounds of words (''pannekoek'' (pancake) became ''pannenkoek'' and ''bessesap'' (currant juice) became ''bessensap'').  This came into force in 1996.

== The spelling reform of 2006 (The Netherlands and Flanders) ==
In 1994 it was agreed that the vocabulary of ''het Groene Boekje'' should be revised every ten years without changing the actual rules of spelling{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}.  On 15 October 2005 the first of these revisions appeared.  Only one rule concerning exceptions was made (the so-called Dandelion Rule): ''paardebloem'' (dandelion) and ''vliegezwam'' (fly agaric) became ''paardenbloem'' and ''vliegenzwam'' for consistency with other similar compounds, e.g. ''paardenstaart'' (horse-tail) and ''vliegenmepper'' (fly swatter).  (Note that these 'n's are not normally pronounced.)

Apart from this there were a few individual changes.  Here are some of the most important ones:

* Names of population groups are now spelt with a capital letter, even if there is no geographical area connected with the name: ''Kelt'' (Celt), ''Azteek'' (Aztec), and ''Eskimo'' (Inuit) are capitalized.   Exceptions are made for names which cover a number of different ethnic groups: ''indiaan'' (North American Indian, First Nations) and ''zigeuner'' (Gypsy)
* ''Jood/jood'' (Jew) is a special case.  When talking about the Jewish religion it has a small initial letter, but it is capitalized if it refers to the Jewish people.  Thus: ''joden, christenen en moslims'' (Jews, Christians, and Muslims); BUT: ''Joden, Europeanen en Marokkanen'' (Jews, Europeans, and Moroccans).
*There are changes for new English compounds: ''online'' instead of ''on line'', ''full colour'' instead of ''fullcolour''.
* A few rules for the hyphen have been changed: ''extreem-rechts'' (extreme right) is now spelt: ''extreemrechts'',  ''ikroman'' (novel written in first person) is now ''ik-roman'' and a few more.
* A few compounds which had still not acquired the ''n'' now conform: ''paddenstoel'' (toadstool), ''dronkenman'' and ''dronkenlap'' (drunkard).

Although government and educational establishments are required to conform, some newspapers and other publications in the Netherlands are refusing to use the new spelling and have released ''Het [[Witte Boekje]]'' (The [[White Booklet]]) as an alternative to the latest edition of ''Het Groene Boekje''. This "white spelling" allows more than one spelling in several cases, e.g. presence or absence of linking ''n''s, hyphens and capitalisation. It has, in return, been accused of being even more inconsistent than ''Het Groene Boekje''. In Flanders, the white spelling is not used by any large media.

The '''Honkawa Elementary School Peace Museum''' (本川小学校平和資料館 ''Honkawa Shogakkou Heiwa Shiryokan'') is a museum of the Peace in Honkawacho, [[Naka-ku, Hiroshima|Naka-ku]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. 

The school was the closest school to [[ground zero]] of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing]]. They lost about 400 students and more than 10 teachers, and the building took great amounts of damage from the [[atomic bomb]] dropped on August 6, 1945. 

The Peace Museum is the part of the school building with the basement of the former [[Hiroshima City Honkawa Elementary School]]; it is kept as a place to learn about the importance of peace. The museum is operated by the Honkawa Elementary School [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]], as well as former members of the PTA, and is cleaned and maintained by the students.  

The memorial service for the students and teachers killed in the blast is held  every August 5 at the school. The school has also appeared in the [[manga]] ''[[Barefoot Gen]]'', written by [[Keiji Nakazawa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_j/tour/ireihi/tour_01.html About Honkawa Elementary School on Hiroshima City official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Honkawa Elementary School Peace Museum 1935h.jpg|thumb|right|Before the atomic bomb around 1935]]
[[Image:Honkawa Elementary School Peace Museum at.jpg|thumb|right|After the atomic bomb]]The school opened in the Myocho-ji, a temple of the [[Nichiren sect]], on January 10, 1873. They built an independent schoolhouse at the current address in 1884. In July 1928 the school constructed a new building, which was the first reinforced concrete school building in Hiroshima.

During [[World War II]] students in third grade or older were evacuated to another school in the suburbs in April 1945. A few months later, on August 6, 1945, about 400 students and more than 10 teachers were killed by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb]] that was dropped on Hiroshima. In February 1946 the school reopened with 45 students with 4 teachers, but they didn't have any school supplies and the building still hadn't been fully repaired. In 1947 Reverend [[A. Powell Davies|Arthur Powell Davies]] encouraged his congregation at the [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church]] to donate half a ton of school supplies to Honkawa Elementary school. The students drew pictures in thanks, and sent them to the All Souls Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamashita|first=Samuel Hideo|date=March 2013|title=Pictures for Our “Honorable American Friends”|url=https://cross-currents.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/e-journal/photo-essays/yamashita.pdf|journal=Cross-currents: East Asian history and culture review|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1947 the school was renamed as Hiroshima City Honkawa Elementary School. In 1950 it was designated as the "School of the Peace Memorial City" by the Ministry of Education. The new school building was built and part of the old building was opened as the Peace Museum in April 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sah.org/community/sah-blog/sah-blog/2017/04/03/reclaimed-sites-of-conflict-industry-and-population-change-in-japan|title=Reclaimed: Sites of Conflict, Industry and Population Change in Japan|website=www.sah.org|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial for the atomic bomb victims was built in November 1998.

The total number of visitors for the museum reached 100,000 in September 1998. A collection of the stories about the atomic bomb, ''Negai'' was written in March 2005. Students participated in the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony]] and performed the Commitment to Peace as the Children's representatives on August 6, 2005. Most recently, [[Cherry|cherry trees]] were planted in remembrance of the bombing in March 2006.

The '''Kikuyu Central Association''' (KCA), led by [[James Beauttah]] and [[Joseph Kang'ethe]], was a political organisation in colonial [[Kenya]] formed in 1924/5 to act on behalf of the [[Kikuyu people|Gĩkũyũ]] community by presenting their concerns to the [[British government]]. One of its greatest grievances was the expropriation of the most productive land by British settlers from African farmers. Most members of the organisation were from the Gĩkũyũ tribe.

KCA was formed after the colonial government banned the earlier [[Young Kikuyu Association]] founded by [[Harry Thuku]] and the [[East African Association]].In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, although remained in contact with Kenyatta. When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to [[London]] as their representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta who had a good command of the [[English language]] go in his place. Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage. He thus became the group's secretary. [[Jomo Kenyatta]], later the first president of Kenya, joined it to become its General Secretary in 1927.

The Kikuyu Central Association was banned in 1940 when World War II reached East Africa. Some fighters of the later [[Mau-Mau]] still understood their struggle as continuation of KCA and even called themselves KCA.

The end of World War II, however, saw the new type of African organisation that went beyond tribal boundaries with the rise of the [[Kenya African Union]] that later was to become [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]].

KCA published the ''Muiguithania'' ("the reconciler"), a Kikuyu language newspaper. It was banned alongside KCA in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;SHIRAZ DURRANI :[http://eprints.rclis.org/7239/1/NBS_Final_13June2006.pdf NEVER BE SILENT: PUBLISHING &amp; IMPERIALISM IN KENYA 1884 - 1963] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109165525/http://eprints.rclis.org/7239/1/NBS_Final_13June2006.pdf |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Labor Party''' ({{lang-ro|Partidul Muncei}},&lt;ref name="gb&amp;al668"&gt;George Baiculescu, Georgeta Răduică, Neonila Onofrei, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. II: Catalog alfabetic 1907–1918. Supliment 1790–1906'', p. 668. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al84"&gt;Tamara Teodorescu, Rodica Fochi, Florența Sădeanu, Liana Miclescu, Lucreția Angheluță, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831-1918). Vol. II: D&amp;ndash;K'', [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1986, p.84.  {{OCLC|462172635}}&lt;/ref&gt; modernized ''Partidul Muncii'', PM) was a minor left-wing political group in [[Romania]]. Based in the city of [[Iași]], and founded by [[George Diamandy]], in its inception it was a split from the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL). The PM responded to the major social and political crisis sparked by World War I, with the southern regions of Romania having been [[Romania in World War I|invaded and occupied by Germany]]. It notably pushed for urgent [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[labor rights]], also wishing to replace the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]] with a more democratic one, and advocating [[class collaboration]]. Through Diamandy, its roots were planted in the "generous youth" current of 19th-century [[reformism]].

Co-chaired by [[Nicolae L. Lupu]], the PM grouped together disgruntled members of the PNL, old affiliates of homegrown [[Poporanism]], and [[Agrarian socialism|left-agarianists]] with republican leanings, inspired by the success of [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Russian Revolutionary Socialists]] (or "Esers"). It was perceived as a nuisance by the institutions of the [[Romanian Kingdom]], but largely dismissed as shambolic, and reportedly criticized as "bourgeois" by Russian radicals. Pushed into obscurity by the events of the war, which drove its leaders into exile, the PM divided itself into factions, one of which continued to survive as a separate wing of the anti-PNL [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's League]]. Lupu and his supporters were among those who established the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]].

==History==
===Origins===
A rebellious aristocrat and landowner, Diamandy was introduced to socialism ca. 1887, when he wrote his first articles in the [[Marxist]] review ''[[Contemporanul]]''.&lt;ref name="ffmoșierul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Florin Faifer]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FAIFERap.html "Moșierul"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, he had set up in Paris his own ''L'Ère Nouvelle'', which represented a heterodox form of Marxism,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zeev Sternhell]], ''Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France'', pp. 72–73. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1986.  {{ISBN|0-691-00629-6}}; [[André Voisin]], "Revue des périodiques. ''L'Ère Nouvelle''", in ''Revue Internationale de Sociologie'', Vol. II, 1894, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; and helped launch the writing career of [[Georges Sorel]]. As the latter noted, Diamandy was an "unreliable" character, who "simply disappeared" from his life at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamandy's pragmatic Marxism was developed during his years in the [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR), where he sought to introduce a policy of alliances with the establishment parties: first a cartel with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romlit.ro/c._stere_i_duelul_su_de_la_1894 "C. Stere și duelul său de la 1894"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 1/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and later a form of close cooperation with the PNL, to the point of merger.&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Petrescu, pp. 131–134&lt;/ref&gt; By 1899, he supported making the PSDMR into a [[Reformism|reformist]] "National Democratic" or "Progressive Democratic" party, and sealed deals with the PNL's own "[[Poporanism|Poporanist]]" (agrarian) wing. This effectively split the PSDMR into two or more factions: the "generous youth" faction, led by Diamandy and [[Vasile Morțun]], registered with the PNL.&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Petrescu, pp. 143–151. See also Ornea I, pp. 244–248, 261–262, 268–269, 313&lt;/ref&gt; During the following 10 years, Diamandy, still calling himself a [[Dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea I, pp. 522, 538&lt;/ref&gt; became an internal critic of National Liberalism. His ''Revista Democrației Române'' accused the PNL establishment of having turned [[reactionary]]&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Radu, "Liberalii și problema reformei electorale în România (1866 — 1914) (I)", in ''Annales Universitatis Apulensis, Series Historica'', Nr. 4–5, 2000–2001, pp. 140, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; and sketched out a plan for the introduction of [[universal male suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;M., "Noutăți. Svonul despre revizuirea Constituției", in ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', Nr. 8/1910, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Pushed out of political affairs by the PNL's leadership before the [[Romanian general election, 1911|March 1911 elections]],&lt;ref&gt;A.C.C., "Noutăți. Doi copii teribili în politica noastră", in ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', Nr. 7/1911, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Diamandy focused on his activity as a comedic writer. He returned into the mainstream during the early stages of World War I, when Romania preserved a policy of neutrality under PNL [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]]. The latter selected Diamandy as his semi-official envoy to [[Allies of World War I|Entente countries]], where he negotiated deals and treaties of mutual assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Butnaru I, p. 143; Ornea II, p. 77; Sorel, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; He was again elected to [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber]] [[Romanian general election, 1914|in 1914]], where he showed himself to be a cautious supporter of an alliance between Romania and the Entente.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/36771/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_PIV1902_1916_026_0001.pdf "Din Camera română"], in ''Unirea'', January 1, 1916, p.3 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1916, Brătianu agreed to a political and territorial deal, and Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entered the war as an Entente country]]. Diamandy fought in the [[Battle of Transylvania|subsequent campaign]], but was soon hospitalized for a heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;Butnaru I, p. 148. See also Averescu, pp. 15–16, 88–89; Gorovei, pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

In short while, Romania was overwhelmed by the [[Central Powers]], losing the [[Battle of Bucharest]]; the government and the Chamber were moved to Iași, the provisional capital, and Romania continued to fight alongside the [[Russian Empire]]. Retaking his seat, Diamandy reemerged as one of Brătianu's extreme critics, accusing him of having mismanaged the whole campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 133–137&lt;/ref&gt; The [[February Revolution]] of 1917 installed a left-leaning and republican [[Russian Provisional Government|Government of Russia]], which rekindled Diamandy's radicalism. Reportedly, he argued that the new [[Russian Republic|Russian democracy]] was incompatible with Brătianu's "tyrannical" government.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
On April 27&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; or May 1, 1917,&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Diamandy formed the PM as a [[parliamentary party]], centered on the issue of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]]. Described in literature either a "broad bourgeois democratic" tendency&lt;ref&gt;Agrigoroaiei, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; or the parliament's "socialist faction",&lt;ref name="rpenigma2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Petrescu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131009200046/http://www.contrafort.md/numere/enigma-ilie-c-t-r-u-ii "Enigma Ilie Cătărău (II)"], in ''[[Contrafort]]'', Nr. 7–8/2012&lt;/ref&gt; it supposedly comprised "mainly [politicians] formed at the school of socialism."&lt;ref name="ctp312"&gt;C. T. Petrescu, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Diamandy openly criticized the PNL for wanting to enact a redistribution of land, since, he claimed, Brătianu no longer had a "moral right" to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea II, pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; According to the PNL's [[Ion G. Duca]], Diamandy was bluffing, as he himself did not support a complete land reform.&lt;ref&gt;Butnaru II, p. 178; Duca, pp. 196, 198, 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Minister of Agriculture]], [[Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu]], was also a critic of Diamandy's politics, describing them as an elaborate "operetta" production "for the benefit of the peasants".&lt;ref name="gifînszil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe I. Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUnov4.html "Însemnări zilnice din anii Primului Război Mondial"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer and civil servant [[Arthur Gorovei]], his friend Diamandy was known locally for persecuting the peasants living on his own estate.&lt;ref&gt;Gorovei, pp. 156–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamandy soon became noted for his displays of Russian socialist symbolism, in particular [[Calico (textile)|calico]] redshirts,&lt;ref name="ffmoșierul"/&gt; "Russian worker's blouse[s]",&lt;ref name="igd176"&gt;Duca, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Kosovorotka|tolstovka]]'' garments.&lt;ref name="gifînszil"/&gt; He was the PM theoretician, authoring its program and publishing it as a brochure.&lt;ref name="tt&amp;al84"/&gt; Calling for the union of "clean souls" and "healthy energies",&lt;ref name="ctp312"/&gt; it proposed a universal land reform giving each peasant 5 [[hectare]]s of land, and a vote for all citizens over the age of 20, women included.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, p. 21; Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Also included as demands were the [[right to strike]], [[child labor law]]s, a nationalization of the [[National Bank of Romania|National Bank]], and a new constitution enshrining [[class collaboration]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 21–22. See also Rășcanu Gramaticu, pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; The party also drew up plans for decentralization with [[economic interventionism]], [[cooperative farming]], [[progressive taxation]], and the expropriation of the subsoil.&lt;ref&gt;Rășcanu Gramaticu, pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; The brochure was immediately confiscated by military censorship, allegedly not because of its demands, but because of its combative nature in a time of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 187. See also Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; According to Duca's hostile account, the PM was largely shaped by Diamandy's "pathological state", his heart disease having led him to lose his sense of control and moderation.&lt;ref name="igd176"/&gt; Gorovei also dismissed the PM as a "prank".&lt;ref&gt;Gorovei, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The radical agrarianist [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] was the PM co-chairman. A physician and civil servant, he had published in the Poporanist press indictments of the social misery and political repression prevalent in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Lupu's advocacy of land reform took the form of a personal conflict with Mârzescu, carried out in Chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the party was joined by [[Grigore Iunian]], [[Grigore Trancu-Iași]], [[Mihail Macavei]], and four other PNL with various grievances against their former party: Mihai Carp, Tilică Ioanid, Ioan P. Rădulescu-Putna, and Numa "Nunucă" Protopopescu.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 136–137, 174–175, 176, 177, 187–189. See also Agrigoroaiei, p. 175; Ornea II, p. 167; C. T. Petrescu, p. 312; Popescu, p. 21; Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the party also claimed to have registered a verbal pledge of support from the "peasant deputy" Andrei Marinescu, who died in the [[typhus]] epidemic. Marinescu's funeral, Duca reports, was a "macabre scene", in which the PNL and PM speakers "fought over the corpse".&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; Outside parliament, several figures from civil society also signed their names to the party manifesto: journalist Eugen Goga (brother of [[Octavian Goga|the more famous poet]]), lawyer [[Deodat Țăranu]], teachers [[Mihai Pastia]] and [[Spiridon Popescu]], and chemist [[Petre Bogdan]].&lt;ref name="ctp312"/&gt; Other affiliates included socialist-and-Poporanist physicians [[Ioan Cantacuzino]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea II, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Ion Parhon]],&lt;ref name="rpenigma2"/&gt; and [[Alexandru Slătineanu]].&lt;ref name="gifînszil"/&gt;

In addition to promoting land and electoral reforms, the PM was widely suspected of being republican and conspiratorial. [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] feared "the growth of a socialist movement in our country", and more particularly Diamandy's contacts with the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Esers]].&lt;ref&gt;Averescu, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; On its left, the PM included republicans such as Lupu, who allegedly carried out secret negotiations with other politicians, and with the Russians, in order to bring down both the king and Brătianu through a putsch.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 173, 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; According to Duca, these negotiations stalled when the envoy of the Iași military [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] discovered that the "oligarchic" and "bourgeois" PM had no backing in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;

The PM was founded just days after a street demonstration organized by the Russian soviet, described by Duca as an attempted coup spurred on by the socialist [[Christian Rakovski]], supposedly thwarted by a Romanian demonstration of strength. According to Duca, the PM intended to partake in the putsch, but "in the end got scared [...] because they sensed that if the Russian revolutionaries are to stage a coup, it would not go in their favor".&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Diamandy, who was structurally a monarchist,&lt;ref name="ffmoșierul"/&gt; printed a call to order, addressed to the Romanian proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Gorovei, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the Laborites portrayed themselves as patriotic resisters, and Lupu even threatened to duel those who questioned his loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, pp. 180, 189–190, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; The PM continued to have links with the revolutionary activist [[Ilie Cătărău]], who was Lupu's emissary among the Romanian-speakers of the Russian [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. He contacted the [[National Moldavian Party]], whose leader [[Pan Halippa]] dismissed the PM as irrelevant.&lt;ref name="rpenigma2"/&gt;

===Dissolution===
In June 1917, during a [[Battle of Mărăști|renewed offensive]] of the Central Powers, the ailing Diamandy became one of the various Romanian public figures taking refuge in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Butnaru II, p. 178; Duca, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; He was caught there by the [[October Revolution]], and again took flight, died on board a refugee ship sailing the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="ffmoșierul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Lupu also left Romania as a delegate of the University Professors' Association,&lt;ref&gt;Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; campaigning for the Romanian cause in the United States—according to Duca, his escaping was the equivalent of a desertion, leaving typhus-stricken Romania without a highly trained physician.&lt;ref&gt;Duca, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Simeon G. Murafa]], Cătărău founded his own "Romanian Revolutionary Party", a blend of anarchism and Romanian nationalism, before the Russian government arrested him for his propaganda in Bessarabia.&lt;ref name="rpenigma2"/&gt;

Lupu was still PM president in early 1918, when a Conservative cabinet, presided upon by [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], was called in to sign [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace with the Central Powers]]. The PM, which coalesced around a Iași newspaper called ''Tribuna'',&lt;ref name="gb&amp;al668"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agrigoroaiei, ''passim''; Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; fought against that measure, and against Marghiloman's other policies, presenting its own candidates for the [[Romanian general election, 1918|1918 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea II, pp. 209, 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; These were held with universal male suffrage, the Laborites having been instrumental in blocking legislation for [[demeny voting]] and other such forms of disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;Agrigoroaiei, pp. 176–180&lt;/ref&gt; Although the PM's Carp announced a worldwide "rapid evolution to the left" and the transfer of social control toward "the grand army of labor",&lt;ref&gt;Agrigoroaiei, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; the party itself was soon joined by the civil servant [[Grigore Filipescu]], formerly a dissident Conservative. He was close to the politically ambitious General [[Alexandru Averescu]], supporting a broad front against the PNL, to be established under Averescu's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1919, represented by Trancu-Iași, it signed up to the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's League]] (PL), created in Iași by Averescu.&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Petrescu, p. 313; Popescu, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Various other former PM members opted to return into the PNL.&lt;ref name="ctp313"&gt;C. T. Petrescu, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

The PM was generally considered defunct by late 1918 or early 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Agrigoroaiei, p. 183; Victor Mitocaru, "Restituiri. Ion Borcea", in ''Vitraliu'', Nr. 1–2/2004, p. 6; C. T. Petrescu, p. 312; Rășcanu Gramaticu, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LP was purposefully created as a federation, allowing for the existence of individual parties–Filipescu personally moderated between the LP's far-right, represented by [[A. C. Cuza]], and his PM colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the interval, the Laborites had talks with the consolidated [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]] (PS), a nominal successor of the PSDR. Lupu and his followers negotiated directly with the PS, but found it impossible to agree on a common platform for the [[Romanian general election, 1919|1919 elections]].&lt;ref name="ctp313"/&gt;

Defining himself as a "socialist in my own way", a "[[Left-wing nationalism|national socialist]]" and a monarchist, Lupu ran as an ally of [[Ion Mihalache]]'s [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] (PȚ), strongly opposed to Averescu's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Rășcanu Gramaticu, pp. 425–426&lt;/ref&gt; To his old proposals for reform, he added mandatory leasing and [[rent regulation]], in an effort to ensure [[affordable housing]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu &amp; Ungureanu, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he registered the PM as a component of the "Parliamentary Bloc" governing alliance, which comprised the PȚ, the [[Romanian National Party]], the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]], the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]], and the [[Democratic Union Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Union Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu &amp; Ungureanu, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Lupu continued to claim leadership of the PM, when, in 1921, it formalized its fusion with the PȚ;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea II, pp. 213-214; C. T. Petrescu, p. 313. See also Popescu, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Parhon, affiliated with the short-lived Laborer Party, had rallied with the PȚ in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Agrigoroaiei, pp. 183–184; Ion Ilincioiu, "Studiu introductiv", in Vasile Niculae, Ion Ilincioiu, Stelian Neagoe (eds.), ''Doctrina țărănistă în România.

[[File:Tax ruling luxembourg.png|thumb|One of the leaked tax rulings signed by [[Marius Kohl]]]]

'''Luxembourg Leaks''' (sometimes shortened to '''Lux Leaks''' or '''LuxLeaks''') is the name of a financial scandal revealed in November 2014 by a journalistic investigation conducted by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]]. It is based on confidential information about [[Luxembourg|Luxembourg's]] [[Advance tax ruling|tax rulings]] set up by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] from 2002 to 2010 to the benefits of its clients. This investigation resulted in making available to the public tax rulings for over three hundred multinational companies based in Luxembourg.

The LuxLeaks' disclosures attracted international attention and comment about [[tax avoidance|tax avoidance schemes]] in Luxembourg and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wayne |first1=Leslie |last2=Carr |first2=Kelly |title=Lux Leaks Revelations Bring Swift Response Around World |date= 6 November 2014 |work=  International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |url=http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/lux-leaks-revelations-bring-swift-response-around-world}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scandal contributed to the implementation of measures aiming at reducing tax dumping and regulating tax avoidance schemes beneficial to multinational companies.

The judicial aspects of this case concern the persons charged by Luxembourg justice for participating in the revelations. No multinational company was charged. The LuxLeaks trial took place in spring 2016 and led to the condemnation of the two whistleblowers. The appeal trial's judgment was delivered in March 2017, uphelding monetary fines and reducing the suspended jail sentence for Deltour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Ana |title=LuxLeaks appeal: Fine upheld, suspended jail sentence reduced for key whistleblower |date= 16 March 2017 |url=https://ecpmf.eu/news/legal/luxleaks-appeal-fine-upheld-suspended-jail-sentence-reduced-for-key-whistleblower}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelations==
===Two waves of ICIJ revelations===
On 5 November 2014, the Washington, D.C.–based [[Center for Public Integrity#International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)]] released LuxLeaks investigation. Eighty journalists from media organizations around the globe had been involved in collaboratively reviewing 28,000 pages of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Hamish |last1=Boland Rudder |first2=Cécile |last2=Schilis-Gallego |url=http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/luxembourg-leaks-stories-around-world |title=Luxembourg Leaks Stories Around the World |publisher=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All documents are available online in a searchable database categorized by industry and corporation published by the ICIJ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1= Matthew |last1=Caruana Galizia |first2=Mar |last2=Cabra |first3=Margot |last3=Williams |first4=Emilia |last4=Díaz-Struck |first5=Hamish |last5=Boland Rudder |date=9 November 2014 |url=http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/explore-documents-luxembourg-leaks-database |title=Explore the Documents: Luxembourg Leaks Database |publisher=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cloudfront-files-1.publicintegrity.org/apps/2014/12/luxleaks/index.html |title=Luxembourg Leaks |work=publicintegrity.org |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents disclose tax rulings between Luxembourg and more than 340 companies worldwide aiming at reducing their tax payments.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Bowers |first=Simon |date=5 November 2014 |title=Luxembourg tax files: how tiny state rubber-stamped tax avoidance on an industrial scale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keena |first=Colm |date=7 November 2014 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/luxembourg-leaks-controversy-a-game-changer-1.1992650|title=Luxembourg leaks controversy a 'game changer'|work=[[Irish Times]]|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Luxembourg Leaks provide insight into 548 tax rulings, dating from 2002 to 2010.

On 9 December 2014, ICIJ revealed new names of about 30 large companies benefiting from tax rulings and tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg. This second wave is labeled "LuxLeaks 2" in complement to the first revelation wave in November labeled "LuxLeaks 1".

The LuxLeaks revelations have had a worldwide impact, as ICIJ partnered its investigations with many media around the world: CNBC (USA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dina |last=Gusovsky |date=6 November 2014 |title=Taxes, multinational firms &amp; Luxembourg—revealed |work=[[CNBC]] |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102141877 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBC (Canada),&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; ''The Irish Times'' (Ireland),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keena |first=Colm |date=6 November 2014 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/lux-leaks/northern-and-shell-used-west-dublin-address-to-cut-luxembourg-tax-bill-on-1bn-1.1990627 |title=Northern and Shell used west Dublin address to cut Luxembourg tax bill on €1bn |work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Monde'' (France),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Michel |first=Anne |date=5 November 2014 |work=[[Le Monde]] |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2014/11/05/le-luxembourg-plaque-tournante-de-l-evasion-fiscale_4518742_3234.html |title=Le Luxembourg, plaque tournante de l'évasion fiscale |trans-title=Luxembourg, hub of tax evasion |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tagesanzeiger'' (Switzerland),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Titus |last1=Plattner |first2=Mario |last2=Stäuble |date=6 November 2014 |work=Der Tagesanzeiger |location=Switzerland |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/geld/Luxemburgs-Milliardenrabatte-fuer-Grosskonzerne/story/26143177 |title=Luxemburgs Milliardenrabatte für Grosskonzerne |language=German |trans-title=Luxembourg billion discounts for large corporations |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' (Germany),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1= Bastian |last1=Brinkmann |first2=Cerstin |last2=Gammelin |first3=Bastian |last3=Obermayer |date=5 November 2014 |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/luxemburg-leaks-konzerne-ertricksen-sich-in-luxemburg-milliarden-an-steuern-1.2206997 |title=Konzerne ertricksen sich in Luxemburg Milliarden an Steuern |language=German |trans-title=Corporate tricks in Luxembourg billion in taxes |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asahi Shimbun'' (Japan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASGC54QGHGC5ULZU008.html |work=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |title=ルクセンブルク当局と各国企業、課税で秘密合意 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Luxembourg authorities and international companies, taxed at a secret agreement |date=7 November 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

After publishing LuxLeaks investigation, ICIJ was awarded one of the United States' top journalism awards, the [[George Polk Awards]] in the Business Reporting category (ICIJ is jointly awarded for 2 other investigations) in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2015/02/icij-work-offshore-secrecy-awarded-polk-prize|title=ICIJ work on offshore secrecy awarded Polk prize|publisher=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |date=16 February 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICIJ was also awarded 'Investigation of the Year' for the LuxLeaks and [[Swiss Leaks|SwissLeaks]] investigations at the [[Global Editors Network#Activities|Data Journalism Awards]] in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2015/06/luxleaks-swissleaks-win-top-data-journalism-award |title=LuxLeaks, SwissLeaks win top Data Journalism Award |publisher=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |date=18 June 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ICIJ LuxLeaks and [[WikiLeaks]] show similarity in names and operating mode (as international, online, non-profit, journalistic organisations publishing confidential or secret information), this does not imply any known connection between them.

===Luxembourgish tax regime illuminated===
[[File:Administrative and financial building for KPMG.jpg|thumb|[[KPMG]] builds a new office building for 1,600 staff in Luxembourg&lt;ref name="wort.lu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wort.lu/de/lokales/kpmg-setzt-ein-zeichen-in-kirchberg-4f8c34d3e4b020e15e03e19c |title= KPMG setzt ein Zeichen in Kirchberg |language=German |trans-title=KPMG sets an example in Kirchberg |work=[[Luxemburger Wort]] |date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
LuxLeaks revelations shed light on  the Luxembourgish tax regime, highly beneficial to multinational companies. Foreign [[corporations]] started settling in Luxembourg in large numbers in the early 1990s, when  Luxembourg transposed in its national law a [[Directive (European Union)|EU directive]] that allowed companies to pay taxes in a European headquarters country other than where their subsidiaries operated.&lt;ref name="Matthew Karnitschnig and Robin van Daalen"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Matthew |last1=Karnitschnig |first2=Robin |last2=van Daalen |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/luxembourg-tax-deals-under-pressure-1413930593 |title=Business-Friendly Bureaucrat Helped Build Tax Haven in Luxembourg |date=21 October 2014 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advance tax ruling|Tax rulings]] are set up by large accounting firms (the "[[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]]") for the benefits of their clients, multinational companies, and then approved by the Luxembourgish tax administration. Tax rulings include schemes to transfer revenues to Luxembourg. [[Transfer pricing]] is one of the mechanisms used by multinational corporations to reallocate profits. Intra-group loans are another possible mechanism: a company based in a high-tax country gives a loan at a low interest rate to a subsidiary in Luxembourg. The interest rate reflects the credit rating of the company group, for example 1%. The subsidiary in Luxembourg is typically set up with the purpose of loaning money at high interest rates, for example 9%,  back to another subsidiary outside Luxembourg. Since the tax regime in Luxembourg is tailored to be advantageous for financial arm of multinational companies, the profits generated there are taxed at very low rates. Such mechanisms are effective means to erode tax bases in countries with high tax rates and to shift profits to countries where they are less taxed (see also [[Base erosion and profit shifting]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theconversation.com/luxembourg-leaks-how-harmful-tax-competition-leads-to-profit-shifting-33940|title=Luxembourg leaks: how harmful tax competition leads to profit shifting |first=Antony |last=Ting |date=10 November 2014 |work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keena |first=Colm |work=The Irish Times |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/luxembourg-corporate-tax-regime-saves-companies-cash-1.1989504 |title=Luxembourg corporate tax regime saves companies cash |date= 6 November 2014 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the companies' presence in Luxembourg is only symbolic. For instance, 1,600 companies are registered at the same address – 5, rue Guillaume Kroll – in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=SBS |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/11/06/luxembourg-under-fire-over-tax-deals |title=Luxembourg under fire over tax deals |date=6 November 2014 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax rulings legality under question===
The legality of tax rulings is under question. Even if they exist in many European countries, tax rulings tend to become considered as state aids able to distort competition. The [[European Commission]] [[Directorate-General for Competition]] launched several investigations in the last years.

In October 2015, the European Commission concluded that the tax deals in favour of [[Fiat Finance and Trade]] in Luxembourg and [[Starbucks]] in the Netherlands are illegal state aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 October 2015 |access-date=27 October 2015 |url= http://euranetplus-inside.eu/eu-commission-declares-tax-rulings-as-illegal-state-aid/ |title= EU Commission declares tax rulings as illegal state aid |work=Euranet Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her press conference, the European Commission Competition Commissioner [[Margrethe Vestager]] confirmed: "We used the information coming from the LuxLeaks as market information [...] The whistleblower also plays an important role here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 October 2015 |access-date=27 October 2015 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=I110761&amp;sitelang=en |title= press conference by Commissioner Margrethe VESTAGER |work=European Commission Audiovisual Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the LuxLeaks revelations, several investigations were launched against other multinational companies. Since December 2015, the McDonald's company is subject to an investigation launched by the European Commission [[Directorate-General for Competition]]. It looks into  a system of licenses paid by the European subsidiaries of McDonald's to its Luxembourg branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=3 December 2015 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/commission-investigates-mcdonald-s-tax-rulings-in-latest-luxleaks-twist/ |title=Commission investigates McDonald's tax rulings in latest Luxleaks twist |work=Euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than one billion Euros of tax loss for the European states between 2009 and 2013 would be at stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/heres-how-mcdonalds-avoided-12b-european-taxes-after-shifting-operations-luxembourg-1828354 |title=Here's How McDonald's Avoided $1.2B In European Taxes After Shifting Operations To Luxembourg |work=ibtimes.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's doesn't wait for the investigations' conclusions and announces in December 2016 the moving of its tax branch from Luxembourg to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 December 2016 |access-date=3 February 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/08/mcdonalds-to-scrap-luxembourg-tax-structure |title=McDonald's to scrap Luxembourg tax structure |newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Bowers |first1=Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations are also now opened against Amazon in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=16 September 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/interview/vestager-we-have-amazon-and-macdonalds-in-the-pipeline |title= Vestager: 'We have Amazon and McDonald's in the pipeline' |work=Euractiv.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and against GDF-Suez (now [[Engie]]) in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=19 September 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= http://www.wort.lu/en/business/previously-gdf-suez-eu-probes-french-gas-giant-engie-s-luxembourg-tax-deals-57dfdffbac730ff4e7f66a32 |title= EU probes French gas giant Engie's Luxembourg tax deals |work=Luxemburger Wort }}&lt;/ref&gt; for their tax schemes in Luxembourg.

On 11 January 2016, the European Commission concluded that the preferential tax system established since 2005 in [[Belgium]] was illegal. Consequently, thirty-five large multinational companies which benefited from this illegal tax system will have to reimburse a tax shortfall estimated to at least 700 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.wort.lu/en/business/in-wake-of-luxleaks-eu-says-belgium-s-tax-breaks-for-multinationals-are-illegal-5693a21b0da165c55dc50ffe |title= EU says Belgium's tax breaks for multinationals are illegal |work=Luxemburger Wort}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the change of momentum about corporate taxation in Europe, EU Competition Commissioner [[Margrethe Vestager]] said: "I think everyone should thank both the whistleblower and the investigative journalists who put a lot of work into this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/interview/vestager-we-should-thank-the-luxleaks-whistleblowers/ |title=Vestager: We should thank the LuxLeaks whistleblowers |work=Euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LuxLeaks impacts==
[[File:Jean-Claude Juncker (13598372024).jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Claude Juncker]]]]

When revealed, LuxLeaks impact on the public opinion was particularly high, as it put in front line the controversial role of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], president of the European Commission newly appointed a few days before LuxLeaks revelations. Juncker was [[Luxembourg]]'s prime minister at the time when many of his country's [[Tax avoidance|tax-avoidance]] rules were enacted.&lt;ref name="ICIJ"&gt;{{cite web |first1= Hamish |last1=Boland-Rudder |first2=Leslie |last2=Wayne |first3=Kelly |last3=Carr |date=19 November 2014 |url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2014/11/lux-leaks-causes-tax-storm-government-media-response |title='Lux Leaks' causes 'tax storm' of government, media response |work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourg's finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, described the leak as "the worst attack" his country had ever experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 November 2014 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/24/jean-claude-juncker-defensive-parliament-censure-motion-luxembourg-tax-schemes |title= Juncker on defensive in censure motion over Luxembourg tax schemes |newspaper=The Guardian |last1=Bowers |first1=Ian Traynor Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LuxLeaks raised discussion on tax avoidance in Luxembourg and other countries.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Zach |last1=Dubinsky |first2=Harvey |last2=Cashore |first3=Frédéric |last3=Zalac |first4=Verena |last4=Klein |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-pension-board-used-offshore-scheme-to-skirt-foreign-taxes-1.2824959|title=Federal pension board used offshore 'scheme' to skirt foreign taxes |date=6 November 2014 |website=CBC.ca |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 November 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29933050 |title=EU to press Luxembourg over tax breaks amid fresh allegations |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=James |last1=Kanter |first2=Andrew |last2=Higgins |date=6 November 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/world/europe/head-of-european-commission-under-pressure-over-luxembourg-tax-revelations.html |title=Jean-Claude Juncker, Top E.U.

===Follow up in the European Parliament===
Following the LuxLeaks scandal, anti-EU groups at the [[European Parliament]], including the [[UK Independence Party]] and France's [[National Rally (France)|National Front]], proposed a [[Motion of no confidence|motion of censure]] against European Commission's team with J.C. Juncker as its president. On 27 November 2014, the vote led to the European Parliament rejecting the motion of censure, as mainstream political groups supported Jean-Claude Juncker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Georgi |last=Gotev |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-priorities-2020/juncker-emerges-stronger-luxleaks-censure-motion-310401 |title=Juncker emerges stronger from Luxleaks censure motion |date=27 November 2014 |website=EurActiv.com |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 February 2015, the [[European Parliament]] set up a special committee on tax rulings in the European Union Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=12 February 2015 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150206IPR21203/html/Parliament-sets-up-a-special-committee-on-tax-rulings |title=Parliament sets up a special committee on tax rulings |publisher=European Parliament |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee is composed of 45 members and initially had six months to report its findings. This special committee was preferred to a committee of inquiry which would have implied a higher power of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Aline |last=Robert |date=6 February 2015 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/parliament-shuns-committee-inquiry-luxleaks-311886 |title=Parliament shuns committee of inquiry into Luxleaks |website=EurActiv.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This choice is considered by some parliamentarians as a political willingness not to embarrass Jean-Claude Juncker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=12 February 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015 |url=http://euranetplus-inside.eu/meps-vote-for-special-committee-on-tax-evasion/ |title=MEPs vote for special committee on tax evasion |work=Euranet Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of its investigations, the special committee requested information to the Commission and Member States, it commissioned research briefings, held public hearings and Committee's delegations visited several countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/2015/05/18/a-short-faq-on-the-european-parliaments-probe-into-tax-rulings/|title=A short FAQ on the European Parliament's probe into tax rulings|work=Tax Justice Network |date=18 May 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/taxe/home.html |website=European Parliament Committees |title=The Committee on Tax Rulings and Other Measures Similar in Effect |publisher=European Parliament |date=19 June 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://euranetplus-inside.eu/europe-stacks-the-cards-against-corporate-tax-evasion/ |website=EuraNet Plus |title=Europe stacks the cards against corporate tax evasion |publisher=EuraNet Plus |date=15 July 2015 |access-date=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee faced multinational corporations' unwillingness to testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=25 June 2015 |access-date=19 July 2015 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/tax-rulings-committee-flexes-muscles-over-luxleaks-hearings-315709 |title=Tax rulings committee flexes muscles over Luxleaks hearings |work=EurActiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2015, the committee published at the end of its mandate a report with several recommendations: country-by-country reporting of multinationals' activities; introducing [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base]] (CCTB) in Europe; including the European Commission into the tax rulings automatic information sharing; better protection for [[whistleblower]]s. At the end of November 2015, the report was approved by the European Parliament in a plenary session vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=26 October 2015 |access-date=26 October 2015 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20151023IPR99008/html/Fairer-corporate-taxes-Special-Committee-on-Tax-Rulings-votes-recommendations |title=Fairer corporate taxes: Special Committee on Tax Rulings votes recommendations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special committee of the European Parliament has been reactivated until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=26 November 2015 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/taxe-committee-to-fight-tax-evasion-for-another-six-months/ |title=TAXE committee to fight tax evasion for another six months |work=Euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactivation of the committee follows press' disclosure of documents, which demonstrates how some countries within the European Commission have been obstructive for more than ten years regarding any reform of the systems allowing aggressive tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 November 2015 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-documents-reveal-how-benalux-blocked-tax-haven-laws-a-1061526.html |title= Internal EU Documents: How the Benelux Blocked Anti-Tax Haven Laws |work=Spiegel Online International|last1=Becker |first1=Markus |last2=Müller |first2=Peter |last3=Pauly |first3=Christoph }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new special committee includes the same members as the initial committee. It aims at following and deepening previous investigations on tax rulings and tax policies in European Union states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/tax2/home.html |title=European Parliament Committees: Tax Rulings and Other Measures Similar in Nature or Effect (TAXE 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow up in the European Commission===
The first action at the European Commission level was a Tax Transparency Package that commissioner [[Pierre Moscovici]] presented on 18 March 2015. It mainly consisted in setting up a system of automatic exchange of information on [[advance tax ruling]] between Member States' tax administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Fox |date=31 March 2015 |url=https://euobserver.com/news/128202 |title=EU plans 'revolution' on sweetheart tax deals |website=EU Observer |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-governmental organizations (NGO) and Members of European Parliament (MEP) consider these measures insufficient as no public release of the rulings is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brien |first=James |date=31 March 2015 |url=https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/meps-unconvinced-commissions-revolutionary-eu-tax-transparency-proposals |title=MEPs unconvinced by commission's 'revolutionary' EU tax transparency proposals |work=The Parliament Magazine |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=18 March 2015 |url=http://www.eurodad.org/Entries/view/1546360/2015/03/17/European-Commission-s-Tax-Transparency-Package-keeps-tax-deals-secret |title=European Commission's Tax Transparency Package keeps tax deals secret |work=European Network on Debt and Development |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical document accompanying the Tax Transparency Package considers LuxLeaks as a major motive for the Commission's decision to act on corporate tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fitzgibbon |first=Will |date=18 March 2015 |url=http://www.icij.org/blog/2015/03/fundamental-change-eu-tax-rules-after-luxleaks |title='Fundamental change' in EU tax rules after LuxLeaks |work=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That's why some anti federalist politicians fear that the European Commission will use LuxLeaks to push for tax harmonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vieuws.eu/financial-competition/tax-transparency-package-commission-will-use-luxleaks-to-push-for-harmonisation-ecr-group-fears/ |title=Tax Transparency Package: Commission will use LuxLeaks to push for harmonization, ECR Group fears |date=24 March 2015 |website=viEUws |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, European finance ministers evaluated the system of automatic exchange of information on tax rulings between Member States administrations, leaving however the European Commission and the public in general outside of this information exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Pigman |date=6 October 2015 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/eu-agrees-greater-transparency-tax-deals-luxleaks-scandal-111909637.html |title=EU agrees greater transparency on tax deals after LuxLeaks scandal |website=Yahoo!

The European Commission made a second move on 17 June 2015 by presenting an "Action Plan for Fair and Efficient Corporate Taxation in the EU". In introducing the action plan, Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said "Corporate taxation in the EU needs radical reform [and] everyone must pay their fair share".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5188_en.htm |title=Commission presents Action Plan for Fair and Efficient Corporate Taxation in the EU |date=17 June 2015 |location=Brussels |publisher=European Commission |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action plan on fairer taxation proposes to re-launch the [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base]], four years after its previous attempt met Member States' opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/commission-propose-common-tax-base-multinationals-again-315464 |title=Commission to propose common tax base for multinationals – again |date=17 June 2015 |website=EurActiv.com |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also proposes several measures in order to reach effective taxation of companies in the countries where the profits are made. The Commission also published a list of Top 30 [[tax haven]]s among non-EU Member States. NGOs expressed doubts that this action plan would successfully eradicate multinational companies' profit shifting and underlined the lack of willingness in acting quickly on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxjustice.net/2015/06/17/european-commission-half-measures-will-exacerbate-profit-shifting/ |title=European Commission half measures will exacerbate profit shifting |website=Tax Justice Network |date=17 June 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission released on 27 January 2016 a new Action Plan, including anti-tax avoidance measures such as the automatic exchange of key information related to multinationals' activities. However, in order to be enacted, this plan will have to be unanimously approved by the member states of the European Union. The new Action Plan has already been assessed by tax justice NGOs as being too weak a measure to counteract tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=28 January 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/eu-s-anti-tax-avoidance-package-likely-to-fail-say-ngos/ |title=EU's anti-tax avoidance package likely to fail, say NGOs |work=Euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2016, the European Commission presented a new plan to tackle corporate tax dodging. A European Parliament's study  estimates that EU countries lose between €50 billion and €70 billion in tax revenue every year, due to corporate income tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 April 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-eu-idUSKCN0X91G9 |title=EU offers new plan to tackle corporate tax dodging |work=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, European Member States came to an agreement on fighting against the main tax optimization tools used by companies in Europe. However, the agreement could be reached only with the inclusion of exemptions and an increased implementation time length, which are expected to weaken the effects of this deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=22 June 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= https://euobserver.com/economic/133931 |title= EU struggles to close tax loopholes with new law |work=EU Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the European Commission proposed to create a [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base]] for companies operating in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=27 October 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/brussels-aims-to-harmonise-corporate-tax-by-2021/ |title= Brussels aims to harmonise corporate tax by 2021 |work=Euractiv.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow up in G-20===
Measures to combat tax minimization were discussed by leaders attending the [[2014 G-20 Brisbane summit]] and included in the G-20 Leaders' Final Communiqué: "We are taking actions to ensure the fairness of the international tax system and to secure countries' revenue bases. Profits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://g20.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/brisbane_g20_leaders_summit_communique.pdf |format=PDF |title=G20 Leaders' Communiqué Brisbane Summit, 15-16 November 2014 |work=G20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424163904/https://g20.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/brisbane_g20_leaders_summit_communique.pdf |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the [[2015 G-20 Antalya summit]] adopted the action plan released by the OECD in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=16 November 2015 |access-date=17 November 2015 |url=https://g20.org/g20-leaders-endorse-oecd-measures-to-crackdown-on-tax-evasion-reaffirm-its-role-in-ensuring-strong-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth/ |title=G20 leaders endorse OECD measures to crackdown on tax evasion; reaffirm its role in ensuring strong, sustainable and inclusive growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[base erosion and profit shifting]] plan includes a list of 15 measures.

===Follow up in Luxembourg===
LuxLeaks revelations stress the fact that tax rulings are a priori legal but secret under the law of Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Numerous European Member States sign tax rulings (22 out of 28 States), but European statistics show that in 2014, Luxembourg is the European country having the highest number of these ongoing 'sweetheart tax deals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=25 February 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.eurodad.org/SweetheartTaxDealsTrendingInEU |title=Sweetheart tax deals trending in the EU |work=Eurodad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After LuxLeaks revelations, tax rulings kept on being agreed in Luxembourg. The Luxembourgish tax administration indicated that 715 new tax rulings were signed in 2014 and 726 in 2015. The content of these rulings remains secret: neither the name of benefiting companies nor the tax rates obtained are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Véronique |last=Poujol|date=18 March 2015 |language=French

In May 2016, some press articles reported that Luxembourg has started to propose to multinationals some verbal tax rulings instead of written ones, in order to keep them secret. Luxembourg denied this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 May 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-taxavoidance-luxembourg-idUSL5N18L4OO |title=Luxembourg denies report it offers unwritten tax rulings |work=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Luxembourg government shows good will and changes its tax rules for companies, making it more difficult for multinationals to avoid paying taxes through international structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=28 December 2016 |access-date=3 February 2017 |url=https://euobserver.com/tickers/136412 |title=Luxembourg changes tax rules for companies |work=EUObserver }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2017, [[The Guardian]] publishes revelations showing that Luxembourg continues obstructing tax reforms efforts in Brussels, as was the case when Jean-Claude Juncker was the Grand-Duchy Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 January 2017 |access-date=3 February 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/jean-claude-juncker-blocked-eu-curbs-on-tax-avoidance-cables-show |title=Jean-Claude Juncker blocked EU curbs on tax avoidance, cables show |newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Bowers |first1=Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Luxembourg, LuxLeaks revelations are often considered as a national trauma due to the stigma made to the country, perceived abroad as "tied to banking secrecy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=28 January 2016 |access-date=3 June 2016 |url=http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/luxembourg-nation-branding-nation-branding-the-cultural-divide-56a9efe50da165c55dc51ff3 |title=Nation branding: the cultural divide |work=Luxemburger Wort}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the LuxLeaks, the Luxembourg government set up a [[nation branding]] policy to improve the image of the country. Nevertheless, with the trial of the whistleblowers and journalist who are involved in the disclosure of the leaks, Luxembourg continued to be perceived as a tax and judicial haven.

===Follow up in the United Kingdom===
In December 2014, the British parliamentary [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] interviewed Kevin Nicholson (head of tax division in PwC UK) for the second time in two years. [[Margaret Hodge]], the chairwoman of the committee, accused Nicholson of having lied in the first hearing before LuxLeaks. She said: "It's very hard for me to understand that this is anything other than a mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme," and "I think there are three ways in which you lied and I think what you are doing is selling tax avoidance on an industrial scale."

On 6 February 2015, the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] published the report "Tax avoidance: the role of large accountancy firms". Commenting on the report, [[Margaret Hodge]], chairwoman of the committee, says PwC's activities represent "nothing short of the promotion of tax avoidance on an industrial scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=6 February 2015 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/report-tax-avoidance-the-role-of-large-accountancy-firms-follow-up/ |title=Tax avoidance: the role of large accountancy firms report published |work=UK Parliament |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its investigation, the committee heard the British subsidiary of PwC and large companies that benefited from tax rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bowers |first=Simon |date=5 February 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/06/pricewaterhousecoopers-boss-kevin-nicholson-misled-mps |title=PwC chief misled us over Luxembourg tax avoidance schemes, claim MPs |work=The Guardian |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the government of the United Kingdom announced the introduction of a [[Google tax|diverted profits tax]] to deter firms setting up tax avoidance schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31942639 |title=Budget 2015: 'Google Tax' introduction confirmed |work=BBC News |date=18 March 2015 |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LuxLeaks whistleblowers and their trial==
{{update|section|date=May 2018}}
According to the [[Center for Public Integrity#International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)]], files used for the LuxLeaks revelations come from employees or former employees of Luxembourgish subsidiaries of the international accounting firms: PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG (the "[[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]]").

Between December 2014 and April 2015, three people were indicted in Luxembourg in connection with LuxLeaks revelations. No multinational corporation faces charges in any country or at the international level, due to the so far legality of [[Advance tax ruling|tax rulings]].

===Antoine Deltour, main leak source===
On 12 December 2014, the Luxembourg prosecutor's office announced that an investigating judge had charged someone with theft, disclosing of confidential information and trade secrets, money laundering and fraud, following the complaint filed by PwC in 2012 against a former employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.justice.public.lu/fr/actualites/2014/12/inculpation-vol-domestique-plainte-pwc/index.html |title=Inculpation d'une personne pour vol domestique suite à une plainte de PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS |language=French |trans-title=Indictment of a person for domestic flights following a complaint from PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS |date=12 December 2014 |publisher=La Justice de Grand-Duché de Luxembourg |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 14 December 2014, Antoine Deltour - a 28-year-old Frenchman - identified himself and said that his motivation was public good and not financial motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dalton |first=Matthew |date=15 December 2014 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/12/15/suspected-luxleaks-leaker-i-am-part-of-a-bigger-movement/ |title=Suspected LuxLeaks Leaker: I Am Part of a Bigger Movement |work=Wall Street Journal |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Renaud |last=Lecadre |date=14 December 2014 |url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2014/12/14/luxleaks-j-ai-agi-par-conviction-la-coherence-etait-d-assumer_1163498 |title=LuxLeaks : "J'ai agi par conviction, la cohérence était d'assumer" |language=French |trans-title= |work=Liberation |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the files he copied were not protected, he did not hack any system. He said he had no contact with ICIJ which had disclosed the LuxLeaks documents and he did not attempt to hide what he was doing. He copied the files because he thought "this type of data could document the tax ruling practice, which was widely unknown, especially in terms of scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Chenoweth |date=17 December 2014 |url=http://www.afr.com/p/national/luxleaks_accused_antoine_deltour_tkMhteFJSnTKVUQQYPLhhO |title=LuxLeaks accused Antoine Deltour: 'I did my duty' |work=Financial Review |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support to the young French whistleblower progressively grew. On 23 December 2014, more than 70 politicians, academics, union heads and charity leaders around the world signed in [[The Guardian]] an open letter in opposition to the decision by Luxembourg to prosecute Antoine Deltour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/prosecution-source-luxleaks-tax-scandal-letter-luxembourg-auditor-antoine-deltour |title=World unites to decry prosecution of source behind LuxLeaks tax scandal |first=Simon |last=Bowers |date=23 December 2014 |work=The Guardian |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 2015, the French newspaper Libération released an Op-Ed article signed by multiple French and International signatories including [[Edward Snowden]], Thomas Piketty and Eva Joly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Thomas |last1=Piketty |first2=Eva |last2=Joly |first3=Daniel |last3=Cohn-Bendit |first4=Edward |last4=Snowden |date=9 March 2015 |url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2015/03/09/soutien-a-antoine-deltour-lanceur-d-alerte-luxleaks_1217470 |title=Soutien à Antoine Deltour, lanceur d'alerte LuxLeaks |language=French |trans-title=Support Antoine Deltour, whistleblower LuxLeaks |work=Liberation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A support committee to Antoine Deltour set up a public petition that got more than 212,000 signatures in November 2016.

On 3 June 2015, Antoine Deltour was awarded the [[European Citizens' Prize]] by the European Parliament, a prize annually awarding Europeans contributing to the promotion of European citizenship and mutual cultural understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wort.lu/en/international/european-citizen-award-2015-luxleaks-whistleblower-awarded-citizen-prize-557068c40c88b46a8ce5a8db |title=Luxleaks whistleblower awarded citizen prize |date=4 June 2015 |work=Luxemburger Wort |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150604STO62606/html/European-Citizen%27s-Prize-honouring-engaged-Europeans |title=European Citizen's Prize: honouring engaged Europeans |date= 4 June 2015 |work=European Parliament |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 2015, Antoine Deltour was jointly nominated, together with two other whistleblowers – Stéphanie Gibaud and Edward Snowden - for the 2015 [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 September 2015 |access-date=27 October 2015 |url=http://www.taxjustice.net/2015/09/11/offshore-whistleblowers-deltour-gibaud-nominated-for-sakharov-prize/ |title=Offshore whistleblowers Deltour, Gibaud, nominated for Sakharov prize |work=Tax Justice Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Antoine Deltour was recognized as the "Person of the Year 2015" by Tax Notes International professional magazine, for the influential role he played in shaping new international tax law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  press release |date=10 December 2015 |access-date=31 March 2016 |url=http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/pressrel.nsf/Releases/EACB52B357B0267685257F1B005FA988?OpenDocument |title=Tax Analysts Announces Person of the Year Features for 2015 |work=taxanalysts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other leak sources===
New names of companies which benefited from tax rulings were revealed in December 2014 ("LuxLeaks 2"). These names show that other leaks originated from PwC but also from other accountancy firms based in Luxembourg.
 
On 23 January 2015, Raphaël Halet, another former [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] employee was charged for similar accusations as was Antoine Deltour, following the leak of 16 tax returns of US companies. This employee was fired due to the leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 January 2015 |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/luxembourg-economy.zkl |title=Second French suspect charged over Luxleaks tax probe |location=Luxembourg |agency=AFP |work=EU Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; His identity was kept secret until the trial began, as Halet signed a secret agreement with PwC forcing him to silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 April 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |url=http://www.wort.lu/en/business/luxleaks-trial-secret-agreement-between-pwc-whistleblower-revealed-5724838b1bea9dff8fa76f2d |title=LuxLeaks trial: Secret agreement between PwC &amp; whistleblower revealed |work= Luxemburger Wort}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2015, the journalist Edouard Perrin was indicted in Luxembourg for being the co-author or accomplice of the offences committed by the former PwC employee charged on 23 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/luxembourg-court-charges-french-journalist-over-luxleaks-role |title=Luxembourg court charges French journalist over LuxLeaks role |work=The Guardian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426083155/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/23/luxembourg-court-charges-french-journalist-over-luxleaks-role |archivedate=26 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luxembourg charges French journalist over LuxLeaks |date=23 April 2015 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/us-luxembourg-tax-court-idUSKBN0NE1D820150423 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist organizations consider this judicial decision as an attempt against [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.rsf.org/luxembourg-shock-at-luxembourg-s-decision-to-23-04-2015,47804.html |date=23 April 2015 |title=Shock at Luxembourg's decision to charge LuxLeaks reporter |work=Reporters without Borders |access-date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The LuxLeaks trial===
[[File:2016-05-03 Procès Luxleaks.jpg|thumb|Antoine Deltour and his lawyers Philippe Penning (at the centre) and [[William Bourdon]] (on the right) at the [[Criminal Court of Luxembourg]].]]
Following Price Waterhouse Coopers' complaint, the trial of the three people involved in the disclosure of secret tax agreements was held from 26 April to 11 May 2016 at the Criminal Court of Luxembourg, for eight half-day hearings, instead of the five initially scheduled.

The [[prosecutor]] and lawyers for the plaintiff ([[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]) emphasized the disclosure of secret documents as an act of delinquency. According to the lawyers of the former employees of the audit firm, Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet only acted with the motivation of defending the general interest. During their hearings, Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet emphasized their role of whistleblowers disclosing multinational companies' aggressive tax planning practices, which are immoral and extremely detrimental to the common good. The journalist Edouard Perrin's lawyers argued that he only acted professionally and that he was not the sponsor of the leaks.

At the end of the trial, the prosecutor requested a 18-month jail sentence for the two whistleblowers (possibly a fully conditional sentence), as well as fines against them and against the journalist (of a non specified amount). PricewaterhouseCoopers' lawyers asked the defendant's conviction and 1 euro in damages. The defense lawyers have all pleaded acquittal of their clients, on the basis of freedom of expression as interpreted by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/luxleaks-prosecutors-whistleblowers-tax-evasion-luxembourg-deltour-halet/ |title= LuxLeaks prosecutors seek jail term of 18 months for whistleblowers |newspaper= The Guardian|last1=France-Presse |first1=Agence }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment was delivered on 29 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=29 June 2016 |access-date=30 June 2016 |url= http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/luxleaks-whistleblowers-found-guilty-given-suspended-sentence/ |title= Luxleaks whistleblowers found guilty, given suspended sentence |work= EurActiv with agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Deltour is sentenced to a suspended 12-month jail time and a 1,500 € fine. Raphaël Halet is sentenced to a suspended 9-month jail time and a 1,000 € fine. Edouard Perrin, the journalist who first released the revelations, is acquitted.

The media coverage of the LuxLeaks trial was high, as it is symbolic of the current difficulties faced by [[whistleblowers]] and their insufficient protection in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=30 April 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |url= https://www.economist.com/news/business/21697864-beancounter-who-exposed-cosy-tax-deals-multinationals-goes-trial-deltour-dock |title= Corporate whistleblowers: Deltour in the dock |journal= The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the EU adopted new rules on companies' [[trade secrets]]; in the meantime, the project of a directive on the general whistleblowers' protection doesn't go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=19 July 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= http://euranetplus-inside.eu/eu-dragging-its-feet-on-new-whistleblower-protections/ |title= EU dragging its feet on new whistleblower protections |work=EU Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial also raised the issue of tax practices legitimacy revealed by Luxleaks case. Faced with the unfairness of the trial, the defendants found many supporters during the trial and in front or in the Luxembourg Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=26 April 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |url= http://www.dw.com/en/trial-opens-against-luxleaks-whistleblowers/a-19214701 |title= Trial opens against LuxLeaks whistleblowers |work= Deutsche Welle with AFP/Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
In July 2016, Antoine Deltour and Raphaël Halet both decided to [[appeal]] against their respective sentence. Late July, the [[prosecutor]] of Luxembourg also appealed the verdict, in order to ensure a full trial and avoid truncating the case. The acquittal of journalist Edouard Perrin was subject to review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=5 August 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= https://euobserver.com/economic/134580 |title= New court appeal clouds LuxLeaks whistleblowers future |work=EU Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the appeal trial began, 108 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] signed an open letter addressed to the whistleblowers "to express [their] support and solidarity with [the whistleblowers] in light of the ongoing judicial proceedings against [them] in Luxembourg. [They] salute their courage over the past years and their tenacity in trying to overturn the 29 June verdict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 September 2016 |access-date=3 December 2016 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/meps-support-convicted-luxleaks-whistleblowers-luxembourg? |title= MEPs offer support to convicted LuxLeaks whistleblowers |newspaper=The Guardian |last1=Pegg |first1=David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal trial took place in Luxembourg from 12 December 2016 to 9 January 2017 and included five half-day hearings. The appeal trial mainly focused on contradictory arguments about the [[European Court of Human Rights]]' criteria used to recognize someone as a [[whistleblower]]. All the criteria were fulfilled according to Deltour and Halet's lawyers, but challenged by the prosecutor and the plaintiff. Halet's defense also argued on the illegality, at the time of the facts, of Luxembourg tax authorities policies regarding tax rulings. In his indictment, the prosecutor required reduced sentences, compared to the sentences delivered in first instance. He also requested journalist Edouard Perrin's acquittal. The defense pleaded for acquittal of each of the three defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=10 January 2017 |access-date=15 February 2017 |url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/luxleaks-whistleblowers-to-hear-appeal-result |title=LuxLeaks whistleblowers to hear appeal result |work=The Business Times with AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Antoine Deltour's and Raphaël Halet's sentences were reduced as a result of their respective appeals. Deltour was given a 6-month suspended prison sentence and charged with a 1500 euro fine while Halet was given a 1000 euro fine. The journalist Edouard Perrin was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 March 2017 |access-date=25 April 2017 |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2017/03/15/proces-luxleaks-les-lanceurs-d-alerte-antoine-deltour-et-raphael-halet-condamnes-a-des-peines-allegees-en-appel_5094960_3214.html|title=Procès " LuxLeaks " : les peines des lanceurs d'alerte allégées en appel|newspaper=Le Monde.fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Scholars trace back Malawi's food crisis to 1991 and 1992, when a drought in southern Africa severely reduced Malawi's maize production. The price of maize shot up: the cost of maize, which is 54% of the average caloric intake for Malawians,&lt;ref name=Number1&gt;Minot 2010&lt;/ref&gt; almost doubled between 1992 and 1993.&lt;ref name=Number2&gt;United Nations 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was a maize surplus in 1993 due to improved rainfall and government-subsidized hybrid maize seed and fertilizer, food consumption did not increase because of people’s eating and coping habits during the famine.&lt;ref name=Number3&gt;Hayes 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ILRI, Stevie Mann - Household takes refuge from the rain in central Malawi.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Flooding in Malawi.|Malawi's agriculture suffers from natural disasters such as floods.]] A government agency [[Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation|ADMARC]] controlled the purchasing and trading of smallholder cash crops and fertilizers prior to 1998.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; Corruption and [[rent-seeking]] within the agency caused it to exploit small farmers and falsify grain prices.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; When tobacco prices fell in 1985, [[ADMARC]] nearly went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=Number32&gt;Lele 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In order to acquire loans from the World Bank, [[ADMARC]] became a partially privately owned company and eliminated its fertilizer subsidies in 1988/1989.&lt;ref name=Number32 /&gt; [[ADMARC]]’s inability to provide fertilizer and seeds to small farmers also contributed to the food crisis in 1992.&lt;ref name=Number33&gt;Mkandawire 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, periodic droughts and floods have continued to affect Malawi.&lt;ref name=Number5&gt;ActionAid 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 2006, there were 33 weather-related disasters, a rise from the 7 that occurred between 1970 and 1989, according to [[ActionAid]].&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt;  Malawi's economy is heavily agricultural; most people survive on their own harvest and sell the excess to make a small income.&lt;ref name=Number6&gt;Dorward and Kydd 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The high number and increasing severity of droughts and floods since 1990 has affected much of the country's population—farmers had little ability to adapt to or recover from disasters, making them more vulnerable to future events, and the [[cycle of poverty]] and hunger worsened.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; From the early 1970s to 1994, the government subsidized hybrid maize growth. When the government stopped this program because it was becoming too expensive support, maize production fell and price increased again.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt;

==Contributing factors==
===Demographic===
The population of Malawi had increased rapidly in the decades before the food crisis. From 3 million in 1950 the population grew to 9,6 million in 1991. So at least two thirds of the people affected by this crisis, were suffering because of the population growth in the previous decades. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://populationpyramid.net/malawi/1991/|title=Population Pyramids of the World from 1950 to 2100|website=PopulationPyramid.net|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that two thirds of this crisis was caused by the population growth since 1950. So the number of people suffering because of the food crisis, was much higher than it would have been without the rapid population growth in the preceding decades.

===Political===
After gaining independence in 1964, Malawi was under the presidency of [[Hastings Banda]].&lt;ref name=Number35&gt;globalEDGE 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although the people had voting rights, Malawi was a one-party state, and Banda was the leader of the [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP), the only existing party at the time.&lt;ref name=Number35 /&gt; Banda therefore had the authority of a dictator, and there were many human rights violations during his reign such as the killings of political dissenters.&lt;ref name=Number35 /&gt; It wasn’t until 1993 when people voted for a multiparty state that Banda and the [[Malawi Congress Party|MCP]] were voted out of power.&lt;ref name=Number35 /&gt; A new constitution was established in 1995, creating a government with an executive, unicameral legislative, and judicial branch.&lt;ref name=Number34&gt;CIA 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, under the democratic presidency of B[[Makili Muluzi|akili Muluzi]], the government established the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) to manage the strategic grain reserve in disaster relief. The NFRA, a government-owned agency with a board of trustees appointed by the Malawian government, and it managed not only the physical grain reserve, but also the finances and imports and exports involved with the reserve.&lt;ref name=Number36&gt;NFRA 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the NFRA quickly incurred a debt of 1 billion [[Malawian kwacha]] (MK) due to the high interest rate of 56% at which it bought 165,000 metric tons of maize, according to the [[IMF]].&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; In 2001, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) recommended that the government sell the grain reserve because harvest had been ample in 2000. There seemed to be little use for such a large reserve, and the grain itself was rotting. The [[IMF]]’s recommendation also came as a result of a 2000 study requested by the European Commission that showed that only 30,000-60,000 metric tons of maize would be necessary to support the country in the case of a localized disaster.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; Maintaining such a large supply of maize is expensive, and the study recommended developing better importation strategies in the case of an unexpectedly large food crisis.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; NFRA followed the [[IMF]]’s advice and sold a majority of its reserve to Kenya and Mozambique decreasing the reserve from 165,000 metric tons of maize to 60,000.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; One of the popular opinions about the causes of the food crisis, according to a 2002 [[ActionAid]] report, is that the food crisis was in part caused by the [[IMF]]'s advice to sell the grain reserve.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt; However, the [[IMF]] and [[ActionAid]] recognize that the grain was old and expensive to store, and at the time, it made sense to advise NFRA to sell.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt;

By 2002, when the worst of the famine hit, the grain reserve was depleted, and the government did not have any additional resources. The situation was exacerbated by the government’s poor preparation in replenishing the reserve sources as they were used.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; Furthermore, private traders bought out much of the grain reserve, and resold it at excessive prices when food was scarce in 2001.&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; The government began importing maize from neighboring countries and abroad, but the maize was slow to arrive.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; From congested roads to inefficiently rerouted trucks and overcrowded ports, there were a variety of transportation bottlenecks that delayed the arrival of food aid.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt; Additionally, poor relationships with some donor countries made them slow to respond; many were suspicious of the IMF’s involvement in depleting the strategic grain reserve, and others were wary of government corruption.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt;

Furthermore, the current policies in place to address food crises are insufficient. Malawi's policies for disaster management, called the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), do not take into consideration gender and health, only agriculture and environment.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; Most disaster and climate change management occurs on a national level, and not all policies and practices trickle down to local communities; district leaders in Nsanje and Salima did not know that the NAPA existed when asked in 2006.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt;

===Economic===
In 2009, the [[UN]] reported that 80% of Malawi’s population was rural;&lt;ref name=Number30&gt;UN 2009&lt;/ref&gt; there are few industry- or service-related jobs.&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; Some were able to work on large tobacco plantations, find jobs in cities, or migrate to neighboring countries for low-wage jobs, but there are few openings.&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; [[Britannica Online]] claims that in the 2000s, over 80% of the population worked in agriculture.&lt;ref name=Number37&gt;Britannica Online 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 33% of the national GDP came from agriculture, as well as over 50% of the export earnings (namely tobacco, sugar, tea, and cotton).&lt;ref name=Number37/&gt;

[[ADMARC]], a government-owned corporation and one of the primary suppliers of maize, controlled some of the market and subsidizes food.&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; A study by the [[Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy]] found that the market price of maize increased from 4MK/kg in June 2001 to 40+MK/kg in January 2002.&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; The daily wage for workers, however, remained the same at 20MK/day.&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; The liberalization of the market, especially in regards to the loss of control by [[ADMARC]], has made tracking and controlling the maize market difficult. The price of maize is dependent on the market, and the NFRA does not have the power to intervene in the market.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt;

Malawi's agricultural policies are also problematic: the country's food supply is heavily reliant on [[maize]], and efforts to diversify crops have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Number12 /&gt; Therefore, a majority of its population suffered when the crop production, especially maize production, failed in 2001, because people could no longer grow food for themselves and did not have an income to purchase food.

[[Tobacco]], the main export product in Malawi, has declined in international sales. Since the 1980s, its revenue has decreased by 50%, and thus the income and purchasing power of small farmers has decreased, according to the [[Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy]].&lt;ref name=Number15 /&gt; In 2000/2001, many small farmers failed to repay their private and government loans. Therefore, in 2001/2002, many were unable to receive credit with which to buy seeds and fertilizer for their crops.&lt;ref name=Number22&gt;FAO 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts to strengthen the agricultural sector such as encouraging [[mixed land usage]], improving irrigation schemes, offering crop storage and protection, constructing roads and buildings, and providing credit and marketing opportunities, have been mainly offered to estate farmers, not small farmers.&lt;ref name=Number37/&gt;

===Social and health===
[[File:Malawi AIDS Orphans.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=HIV/AIDS orphans in Malawi.|The food crisis made [[HIV/AIDS orphans]] in Malawi especially vulnerable to poverty, hunger, etc.]]Poverty is widespread in Malawi, with 50% of its population living under the poverty line of $2/day according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name=Number17&gt;World Bank 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The rural poor were especially vulnerable to the food crisis because they could not afford to buy food when their harvests failed.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt;

A 2002 [[ActionAid]] report speculates that since 1994, when democracy was established in Malawi, there has been a social shift away from community solidarity. During the 1991/1992 drought, communities banded together and supported one another, giving food and employment to those that needed it. During the 2001/2002 food crisis, however, people's philosophies changed to an "anarchic mob justice," an "everyone for himself" attitude, according to the 2002 [[ActionAid]] report.&lt;ref name=Number1 /&gt;

[[HIV/AIDS in Malawi]] is widespread: in 2012, the Malawian Government estimated that the disease affected about 17% of urban Malawians and 9% of rural Malawians.&lt;ref name=Number55&gt;Government of Malawi 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Households with adults affected by HIV/AIDS and households without adults due to HIV/AIDS have significantly lower agricultural productivity. Not only are those with HIV/AIDS prevented from working the fields, but other people must take care of them and a portion of the household income must go to medication and funerals. Thus, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has made many Malawians vulnerable during the food crisis.&lt;ref name=Number18&gt;Meera, et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2002 famine, 70% of deaths in hospitals were due to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Number31&gt;Avert 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological===
The soil in Malawi is in poor condition due to many farmers' historical inability to afford fertilizer.&lt;ref name=Number4&gt;Hardy 1998&lt;/ref&gt; There are few easy solutions to maintaining soil fertility; Malawi is too poor to import organic materials to restore soil nutrients, and land is too scarce to allocate large plots of land to soil restoration.&lt;ref name=Number4 /&gt; Individual farmers cannot afford fertilizer for their land.&lt;ref name=Number16 /&gt; Therefore, food production levels are also largely affected by declining soil fertility and land shortages.d shortage in Malawi by changing the climate. As rainfall patterns change and temperatures increase, the length of the productive growing season decreases and farmers must purchase more costly hybrid crops in order to obtain an adequate harvest.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; Some farmers shifted their [[maize]] season from November to December, while others shifted it earlier, in order to handle the changing weather.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; As aforementioned, the increasing frequency of droughts and floods has made farmers especially vulnerable to food shortages.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt;

The rainfall in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 was sporadic, with recurrent dry spells and floods that prevented sufficient harvests.&lt;ref name=Number8&gt;Lameck 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many farmers, in order to cope with the unpredictable weather, harvested their crops prematurely, which further decreased the crop production in 2001/2002. Furthermore, the changing weather patterns made the methods of predicting crop prediction unreliable; the existing warning systems that predicted crop production based on weather forecasts and regular crop assessments only predicted that a decrease in maize production in the 2001/2002 season would be compensated for by an increase in other crops such as roots and tubers production.&lt;ref name=Number8 /&gt; However, all crops suffered in the 2001/2002 season. Thus, the government was unprepared for a food crisis in 2002.&lt;ref name=Number8 /&gt;

==Response &amp; relief efforts ==
The Malawian government implemented a fertilizer subsidy program called the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) in 2005, under which the government subsidized fertilizer and seed to vulnerable farmers. Fertilizer was priced at $7 per 50&amp;nbsp;kg bag, a marked discount from the market price of $27 per 50&amp;nbsp;kg bag.&lt;ref name=Number7 /&gt; A study by [[Michigan State University]] found that although the erratic rainfalls curbed the program’s effectiveness in 2005/2006, improved weather in 2007 allowed the program to flourish and Malawi had a record maize harvest of 3.4 million tons, a surplus of 1.4 million.&lt;ref name=Number7&gt;Jayne, Chapoto, Minde, Donovan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 2007, Malawi was able to export maize for profit and donate maize to other countries in need; Zimbabwe imported 40,000 metric tons of maize from Malawi, and Lesotho and Swaziland both received 5,000 metric tons of maize donated by Malawi.&lt;ref name=Number7 /&gt;

International and local NGOS, including the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[European Union|EU]], [[UK]], and [[USAID]], donated food to Malawi after it was declared a state of disaster in 2002. In 2005, the WFP estimated that its food aid was feeding 11% of Malawi’s population.&lt;ref name=Number20 /&gt;

==Long-term effects==

===Health===
The food crisis has made children especially vulnerable to malnutrition and disease. In 2006, [[UNICEF]] estimated that 46% of children under five were chronically malnourished and 19% were underweight.&lt;ref name=Number13&gt;UNICEF 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, when the roots of the food crisis began, children’s nutritional status has not changed.&lt;ref name=Number13 /&gt;

In 2001/2002 and 2005/2006, during seasons of severe food shortage, there were large [[cholera]] outbreaks throughout the country. [[UNICEF]] recognized that the outbreaks were prompted by poor hygiene and unsafe water sources compounded with the food crisis, which made people susceptible to disease.&lt;ref name=Number13 /&gt; Similarly, a study conducted by [[Save the Children|Save The Children]] UK in February 2002 found that the food crisis affected people's health by causing swelling in the hands and feet of both adults and children.&lt;ref name=Number21&gt;Kamowa 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The food shortage has resulted in several thousand hunger-related deaths; the exact numbers are unknown.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; Many of these deaths have further exacerbated the problem of HIV/AIDS, leaving those afflicted by the disease especially vulnerable and also producing a large orphan population. [[UNICEF]] estimates that 17% of children do not have living parents due to HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Number13 /&gt;

During the peak of the food crisis, from April to May 2002, the [[WHO]] conducted a health assessment in Malawi. It found that between October 2001 and March 2002, there was an average of 1.9 deaths per 10,000 every day. There was a cholera epidemic with 33,150 detected cases and 981 deaths, a fatality rate of 3%. Yet, the number of people seeking aid at health facilities decreased by 25% in that same period. The study suggested that the health facilities were crippled by shortages of staff and drugs and poor communication and transportation systems. As people began to prioritize food security over all else, health and seeking treatment at poorly-maintained health facilities fell to the wayside.&lt;ref name=Number50&gt;WHO 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Starving people began to eat unsafe roots, maize cobs, sawdust, and boiled fruits and contracted food poisoning and other stomach illnesses.&lt;ref name=Number21 /&gt; A report in [[The Lancet]] found that many families, even considerably wealthy ones, in [[Nsanje]], a southern district in Malawi, were eating water-lily bulbs called nyika. These bulbs, which used to be considered snack foods but are now staple foods, cause diarrhea if eaten in abundance.&lt;ref name=Number51&gt;Tenthani 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, the eldest son of a family of ten found a collection of poisonous yams. The father gave the children and mother the yams to eat because they had no other food; he did not eat the yams himself because he prioritized his children's hunger and his wife's hunger over his own. The mother and all eight children died, one after another, due to vomiting and food poisoning.&lt;ref name=Number51 /&gt;

===Policy===
The government's food security policy, the FISP, has raised agricultural productivity. As aforementioned, maize production surpassed domestic demand after the implementation of FISP. Between 2005 and 2011, Malawi’s [[GDP]] grew at an average of 11.7% per year, and many experts contributed the agricultural [[GDP]] growth to FISP. However, recent studies have suggested that FISP is not a sustainable program: as the number of needy households increase, the amount of fertilizer and seed provided has decreased from 85&amp;nbsp;kg per farmer in 2005/2006 to 60&amp;nbsp;kg per farmer in 2012/2013.&lt;ref name=Number25&gt;Pauw and Thurlow 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

New food security policies were developed in 2002 and 2003. The Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy was a framework policy document intended to direct and inform budget decisions for the central government. At the heart of the policy were economic growth, human capital, safety nets, and governance; by making budget decisions that encouraged agricultural economic growth and create effective safety nets, the government could promote food security and food availability.&lt;ref name=Number27&gt;Sahey 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Agriculture collaborated with civil society organizations, other ministries, private companies, and donors to create a Food and Nutrition Security Policy. The policy aimed to: 1) increase food availability by extending irrigation systems and access to fertilizer and land, 2) strengthen the rural market, 3) create a number of health and dietary guidelines and services, and 4) establish and strengthen disaster management plans, the strategic grain reserve, and food production monitoring/predicting systems.&lt;ref name=Number27 /&gt; Finally, the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development developed a growth strategy policy that would increase access to food by promoting trade and investment in rural Malawi to increase income and employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=Number27 /&gt;

===Culture and society===
During the food crisis, people began to change their lifestyles to obtain food. Some have begun taking casual jobs in exchange for food. Many have sold household items and livestock at low prices to purchase food, making it difficult for them to regain stability after the food crisis.&lt;ref name=Number39&gt;TearFund 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some have migrated to [[Zambia]] and other neighboring countries to work for low wages or food.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt;

The food crisis has also affected education. In some areas, the dropout rate has increased to 25% due to hunger. Many skip school in order to work or search for food, while others can no longer afford the school fees.&lt;ref name=Number39 /&gt; Some teachers have complained that schools have lost their control over students because they cannot force students to stay, study, or do their homework if they are hungry and sick.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; [[UNICEF]] claims that in some areas where the food crisis is especially severe, one-half to three-quarters of school-aged children have stopped going to school.&lt;ref name=Number51 /&gt; In response to this drop in school attendance, [[UNICEF]] and [[WFP]] began implementing programs that fed children in school and provide extra support and materials to teachers and staff. [[UNICEF]] reported that the program brought a "great improvement" in school attendance, in some cases even causing school buildings to overflow with children seeking food.&lt;ref name=Number51 /&gt;

The overall social order has also worsened, as people have begun stealing from their neighbors, abandoning children, fighting for food, and exchanging sex for food.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; Theft of food and money has become much more common. In some areas, captured thieves are tortured and mutilated as punishment.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; The elderly, orphans, and women are increasingly vulnerable, not only because it is more difficult for them to provide for themselves, but also because they are bigger targets for theft and violence.&lt;ref name=Number5 /&gt; In 2005, many women reported being attacked at the [[ADMARC]] market when purchasing their allotted 25&amp;nbsp;kg of maize.&lt;ref name=Number40&gt;Global Policy Forum 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The price of [[sex work]] has decreased from MK1000 to MK200, heightening the risk for women and girls that must engage in such behaviors at a higher rate to earn money.&lt;ref name=Number40 /&gt; The social structure of marriage has also changed as a result of the food crisis: many girls were forced to marry young because their families could not support them during the food crisis, leading to an increase in failed and abusive marriages.&lt;ref name=Number39 /&gt; Other married men and women turned to infidelity to earn money and food, again leading to an increase in failed and abusive marriages.&lt;ref name=Number39 /&gt;

[[File:William Kamkwambas old windmill.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Kamkwamba's first windmill.|The windmill that [[William Kamkwamba]] built.]]There is a personal account of the famine by [[William Kamkwamba]] in his book "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind." At the age of 14, Kamkwamba dropped out of school because his family could no longer afford the tuition.&lt;ref name=Number41&gt;Kamkwamba 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He began studying electronics in the local library and realized that he could use wind power to supply electricity to his village. His first windmill was used to power light bulbs and charge cell phones; others were used to pump irrigation systems and clean water wells.&lt;ref name=Number41 /&gt; His story gained national publicity in 2007, from [[TED talks]] to [[The Daily Show]], and his windmill projects gained the support of donors from around the world.&lt;ref name=Number41 /&gt; According to the memoir, the government estimate of famine deaths appears to be severely understated.&lt;ref name=Number132&gt;Moving Windmills Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012-2013 food shortage==
The maize harvest in 2012 decreased by 7% from 2011, and harsh flooding at the beginning of 2013 in southern Malawi destroyed 10,000 homes, according to a 2013 report by the [[Global Policy Forum]].&lt;ref name=Number8 /&gt; The Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee estimated in 2012–2013 that 2 million people were suffering from food shortages.&lt;ref name=Number9&gt;MVAC 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, the World Food Programme reported that "households in parts of the country have harvested almost nothing."&lt;ref name=Number42&gt;ActAlliance 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank estimated that Malawi would require at least 57,000 metric tons of maize in the 2013/2014 season in order to address the food scarcity.&lt;ref name=Number17 /&gt; The price of maize increased by 162% in 2013,&lt;ref name=Number28&gt;WFP 2014&lt;/ref&gt; due to low harvest, high cost of transportation, and devaluing of the MK.&lt;ref name=Number42 /&gt; In July 2013, the UK announced that it would donate $20 million to Malawi for the “looming food crisis.”&lt;ref name=Number29&gt;BBC 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ADMARC]] [[rationing|rationed]] maize sales to 10&amp;nbsp;kg per person. The Ministry of Agriculture claimed that this policy was created to prevent vendors from buying all the maize and reselling it to the poor at higher prices.&lt;ref name=Number11&gt;Musa 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, news reporters from Blantyre Newspapers Limited, a Malawi-based news publisher, have found that [[ADMARC]] itself may also be suffering from a grain shortage because people have reported not being able to receive even their allotted 10&amp;nbsp;kg of grain.&lt;ref name=Number11 /&gt;

'''Media coverage of global warming''' has had effects on [[public opinion on climate change]],&lt;ref name=Antilla/&gt; as it mediates the [[scientific opinion on climate change]] that the global [[instrumental temperature record]] shows increase in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. Almost all [[scientific]] bodies of national or international standing [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Statements by dissenting organizations|agree with this view]],&lt;ref name=AQAonAAPG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Julie Brigham-Grette|title=Petroleum Geologists' Award to Novelist Crichton Is Inappropriate |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]] |volume=87 |issue=36 |quote=The [[AAPG]] stands alone among scientific societies in its denial of human-induced effects on global warming. |url=http://www.agu.org/fora/eos/pdfs/2006EO360008.pdf |date=September 2006 |format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book |title= Climate Change: What It Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren |last1=DiMento |first1=Joseph F.

[[Media (communication)|Media]] attention is especially high in [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita|carbon]] dependent countries with commitments under the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The way the media report on climate change in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] countries, especially in the United States, has been widely studied, while studies of reporting in other countries have been less expansive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00207230903448490 |author=Lyytimäki, J., Tapio, P. |title=Climate change as reported in the press of Finland: From screaming headlines to penetrating background noise |journal=[[International Journal of Environmental Studies]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=723–735 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Andreas|last2=Ivanova|first2=Ana|last3=Schäfer|first3=Mike S.|title=Media attention for climate change around the world: A comparative analysis of newspaper coverage in 27 countries|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.020|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1233–1248|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have shown that particularly in the United States and in the UK [[Tabloid journalism#Red top|tabloid press]], the media significantly understated the strength of [[scientific consensus on climate change]] established in [[IPCC]] Assessment Reports [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|in 1995]] and [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|in 2001]].

A peak in media coverage occurred in early 2007, driven by the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] and [[Al Gore]]'s documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''.&lt;ref name=Boykoff2010India/&gt; A subsequent peak in late 2009, which was 50% higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/media_coverage/ |title=2004–2010 World Newspaper Coverage of Climate Change or Global Warming |work=Center for Science and Technology Policy Research |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have been driven by a combination of the November 2009 [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] and December [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].&lt;ref name=Boykoff2010India&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-010-9807-8 |author=Boykoff, M. |title=Indian media representations of climate change in a threatened journalistic ecosystem |journal=Climatic Change |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=17–25 |year=2010 |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2812-2010.11.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/03/07/study-how-broadcast-networks-covered-climate-ch/208881 STUDY: How Broadcast Networks Covered Climate Change In 2015] March 7, 2016 [[Media Matters for America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Media and Climate Change Observatory team at the University of Colorado Boulder found that 2017 “saw media attention to climate change and global warming ebb and flow” with June seeing the maximum global media coverage on both subjects.  This rise is “largely attributed to news surrounding United States (US) President Donald J. Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 United Nations (UN) [[Paris agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]], with continuing media attention paid to the emergent US isolation following through the [[43rd G7 summit|G7 summit]] a few weeks later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boykoff|first1=M.|last2=Andrews|first2=K.|last3=Daly|first3=M.|last4=Katzung|first4=J.|last5=Luedecke|first5=G.|last6=Maldonado|first6=C.|last7=Nacu-Schmidt|first7=A.|title=A Review of Media Coverage of Climate Change and Global Warming in 2017|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/icecaps/research/media_coverage/summaries/special_issue_2017.html|publisher=Media and Climate Change Observatory, Center for Science and Technology Policy Research, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers and journalists believe that media coverage of political issues is adequate and fair, while a few feel that it is biased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lichter|first=S.R.|author2=Rothman|title=The media and national defense|journal=National Security Policy|year=1984|pages=265–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozell|first=L.B.|author2=Baker, B.H.|title=Thats the way it is(n't)|journal=Alexandria, VA|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nissani|first=Moti|date=Sep 1999|title=Media Coverage of the Greenhouse Effect|url=|journal=Population and Environment|volume=21|issue=1|pages=27–43|doi=10.1007/BF02436119|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most studies on media coverage of the topic are neither recent nor concerned with coverage of [[environmental issue]]s. Moreover, they are only rarely concerned specifically with the question of [[bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=A|title=Media (mis)communication on the science of Climate change.|journal=[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]|year=1994|pages=3, 259–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trumbo|first=C.|title=Constructing climate change: Claims and frames in US news coverage of an environmental issue|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=1996|volume=5|pages=269–283|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/5/3/006|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.891.3467&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common distortions ==
=== Factual ===
Bord et al. claim that a substantial portion of the United States public has a flawed understanding of global warming, seeing it as linked to general "pollution" and causally connected in some way to atmospheric [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;Bord et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists and media scholars who express frustrations with inadequate science reporting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M.T.|author2-link=Jules Boykoff|author2=Boykoff, J.M.|title=Balance as bias: Global warming and the US prestige press|journal=[[Global Environmental Change]]|year=2004|volume=14|issue=2|pages=125–136|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=B|author2=Singletary, M.|title=Scientific sources’ perceptions of network news accuracy|journal=Journalism Quarterly|publisher=[[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]|year=1985|volume=62|issue=4|pages=816–823|doi=10.1177/107769908506200415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelkin|first=D|title=Selling science: How the press covers science and technology|journal=New York: W.H. Freeman|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=S|title=Mediarology: The role of citizens, journalists, and scientists in debunking climate change myths|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Mediarology/Mediarology.html|accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer, E., &amp; Endreny, P.

W.,|author2=Ryan, M.|title=News source perceptions of accuracy in science coverage|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1974|volume=51|issue=2|pages=219–225|doi=10.1177/107769907405100204}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that it can lead to at least three basic distortions. First, journalists distort reality by making scientific errors. Second, they distort by keying on human-interest stories rather than scientific content. And third, journalists distort by rigid adherence to the construct of balanced coverage.  Bord, O’Connor, &amp; Fisher (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bord|first=R.J.|author2=O'Connor |author3=Fisher|title=Public perceptions of global warming: United States and international perspectives|journal=Climate Research|year=1998|volume=11|issue=1|pages=75–84|doi=10.3354/cr011075|bibcode=1998ClRes..11...75B}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that responsible citizenry necessitates a concrete knowledge of causes and that until, for example, the public understands what causes climate change it cannot be expected to take voluntary action to mitigate its effects.

=== Narrative ===
According to Shoemaker and Reese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoemaker, P. J., &amp; Reese, S. D.|title=Mediating the message: Theories of influence on mass media content|year=1996|publisher=Longman.|location=New York |pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversy is one of the main variables affecting story choice among news editors, along with human interest, prominence, timeliness, celebrity, and proximity. Coverage of climate change has been accused of falling victim to the journalistic norm of "personalistation". W.L Bennet defines this trait as: "the tendency to downplay the big social, economic, or political picture in favor of human trials, tragedies and triumphs" &lt;ref&gt;W.L Bennet,"News: The Politics of Illusion" 5th edition, (2002). Longman, New York. p.45&lt;/ref&gt;  The culture of [[political journalism]] has long used the notion of balanced coverage in covering controversy. In this construct, it is permissible to air a highly [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] opinion, provided this view is accompanied by a competing opinion. But recently scientists and scholars have challenged the legitimacy of this journalistic core value.

=== Balance ===
The notion of balanced coverage may make perfect sense when covering a political convention, but in the culture of science, balancing opposing views may be neither fair nor truthful. As such, many experts argue that it is misleading to give scientific mavericks or advocates equal time with established mainstream scientists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yet there is evidence that this is exactly what the media is doing. In a survey of 636 articles from four top United States newspapers between 1988 and 2002, two scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M.T.|author2=Boykoff, J.M.|title=Balance as bias: Global warming and the US prestige press|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2004|volume=14|issue=2|pages=125–136|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that most articles gave as much time to the small group of [[climate change]] doubters as to the scientific consensus view. Given real consensus among climatologists over [[global warming]], many scientists find the media’s desire to portray the topic as a scientific controversy to be a gross distortion. As [[Stephen Schneider]] put it:&lt;ref name="Schneider"/&gt;{{Quotation| “a mainstream, well-established consensus may be ‘balanced’ against the opposing views of a few extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.”}}

Science journalism concerns itself with gathering and evaluating various types of relevant evidence and rigorously checking sources and facts. Boyce Rensberger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rensberger|first=B|title=Reporting Science Means Looking for Cautionary Signals|journal=Nieman Reports Special Issue on Science Journalism|year=2002|pages=12–14.|url=http://niemanreports.org/articles/reporting-science-means-looking-for-cautionary-signals-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Knight Center for Science Journalism, said, “balanced coverage of science does not mean giving equal weight to both sides of an argument. It means apportioning weight according to the balance of evidence.”

The claims of scientists also get distorted by the media by a tendency to seek out extreme views, which can result in portrayal of risks well beyond the claims actually being made by scientists.&lt;ref name="Boykoff2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boykoff |first=Maxwell T. |year=2009 |title=We Speak for the Trees: Media Reporting on the Environment |journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=431–457   |doi=10.1146/annurev.environ.051308.084254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists tend to overemphasize the most extreme outcomes from a range of possibilities reported in scientific articles. A study that tracked press reports about a climate change article in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] found that "results and conclusions of the study were widely misrepresented, especially in the news media, to make the consequences seem more catastrophic and the timescale shorter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1179/030801805X42036| title = Scientists and the media: the struggle for legitimacy in climate change and conservation science| year = 2005| last1 = Ladle | first1 = R. J.| last2 = Jepson | first2 = P.| last3 = Whittaker | first3 = R. J.| journal = Interdisciplinary Science Reviews| volume = 30| issue = 3| pages = 231–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alarmism{{anchor|Claims_of_alarmism}}===
[[Alarmism]] is described as the use of a linguistic repertoire which communicates climate change using inflated language, an urgent tone and imagery of doom. In a report produced for the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] Gill Ereaut and Nat Segnit reported that alarmist language is frequently employed by newspapers, popular magazine and in campaign literature put out by government and environment groups.&lt;ref name="Ereaut20062"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ereaut|first1=Gill|last2=Segrit|first2=Nat|year=2006|title=Warm Words: How are we Telling the Climate Story and can we Tell it Better?|url=http://www.ippr.org/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/warm_words_1529.pdf|location=London|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; When applied to climate change, alarmist language creates a greater sense of urgency.

The term ''alarmist'' can be used as a [[pejorative]] by critics of mainstream climate science to describe those that endorse it.  [[MIT]] [[meteorologist]] [[Kerry Emanuel]] wrote that labeling someone as an "alarmist" is "a particularly infantile smear considering what is at stake." He continued that using this "inflammatory terminology has a distinctly [[Orwellian]] flavor."&lt;ref name=Emanuel&gt;[http://www.nas.org/polArticles.cfm?doc_id=1444 "Climategate": A Different Perspective], by [[Kerry Emanuel]], [[National Association of Scholars]], July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of motivating people to action, using sensational and alarming techniques often evoke "denial, paralysis [or] apathy"&lt;ref name="Dilling &amp; Moser"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Lisa Dilling|last2=Susanne C. Moser|title=Creating a climate for change: communicating climate change and facilitating social change|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-86923-4|pages=1–27|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not motivate people to become engaged with the issue of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1075547008329201 | title = "Fear Won't Do It": Promoting Positive Engagement with Climate Change Through Visual and Iconic Representations | year = 2009 | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = S. | last2 = Nicholson-Cole | first2 = S. | journal = Science Communication | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[climate refugee]]s—the potential for climate change to [[displaced person|displace people]]—it has been reported that "alarmist hyperbole" is frequently employed by [[private military contractor]]s and [[think tank]]s.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartmann |first=Betsy |year=2010 |title=Rethinking climate refugees and climate conflict: Rhetoric, reality and the politics of policy discourse |journal=Journal of International Development |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=233–246 |issn=0954-1748 |doi=10.1002/jid.1676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way media reports attack global warming is to compare it with a purported episode of alarmism related to [[global cooling]]. In the 1970s, global cooling, a claim with limited scientific support (even during the height of the media frenzy over [[global cooling]], "the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature"&lt;ref name="The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus | author1=Peterson, Thomas | author2=Connolley, William | author3=Fleck, John | lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] | url=http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/Myth-1970-Global-Cooling-BAMS-2008.pdf | date=September 2008 | doi=10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]] | volume=89 | issue=9 | pages=1325–1337 | bibcode=2008BAMS...89.1325P | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114082810/http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/Myth-1970-Global-Cooling-BAMS-2008.pdf | archivedate=2012-01-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was widely reported in the press. Several media pieces have claimed that, since the even-at-the-time-poorly-supported theory of [[global cooling]] was shown to be false, that the well-supported theory of global warming can also be dismissed. For example, an article in ''[[The Hindu]]'' by Kapista and Bashkirtsev wrote: "Who remembers today, they query, that in the 1970s, when global temperatures began to dip, many warned that we faced a new ice age? An editorial in The Time magazine on June 24, 1974, quoted concerned scientists as voicing alarm over the atmosphere 'growing gradually cooler for the past three decades', 'the unexpected persistence and thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland,' and other harbingers of an ice age that could prove 'catastrophic.' Man was blamed for global cooling as he is blamed today for global warming".,&lt;ref name="Kapitsa, Andrei 2008"&gt;Kapitsa, Andrei, and Vladimir Bashkirtsev, "Challenging the basis of Kyoto Protocol", ''[[The Hindu]]'', 10 July 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' published an article claiming that "The widespread alarm over global warming is only the latest scare about the environment to come our way since the 1960s. Let's go through some of them. Almost exactly 30 years ago the world was in another panic about climate change. However, it wasn't the thought of global warming that concerned us. It was the fear of its opposite, global cooling.  The doom-sayers were wrong in the past and it's entirely possible they're wrong this time as well."&lt;ref name="Don 2007, p. 1"&gt;''[[Irish Independent]]'', "Don't believe doomsayers that insist the world's end is nigh", 16 March 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other examples exist.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, David 2002"&gt;Schmidt, David, "It's curtains for global warming", ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 28 June 2002, p. 16B. "If there is one thing more remarkable than the level of alarm inspired by global warming, it is the thin empirical foundations upon which the forecast rests.  Throughout the 1970s, the scientific consensus held that the world was entering a period of global cooling, with results equally catastrophic to those now predicted for global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis Wilson 2009, p. 32"&gt;[[Francis Wilson (meteorologist)|Wilson, Francis]], "The rise of the extreme killers", ''[[Sunday Times]]'', 19 April 2009, p. 32. "Throughout history there have been false alarms: "shadow of the bomb", "nuclear winter", "ice age cometh" and so on. So it's no surprise that today many people are skeptical about climate change. The difference is that we have hard evidence that increasing temperatures will lead to a significant risk of dangerous repercussions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The 2000"&gt;''[[National Post]]'', "The sky was supposed to fall: The '70s saw the rise of environmental Chicken Littles of every shape as a technique for motivating public action", 5 April 2000, p. B1. "One of the strange tendencies of modern life, however, has been the institutionalization of scaremongering, the willingness of the mass media and government to lend plausibility to wild surmises about the future. The crucial decade for this odd development was the 1970s.  Schneider's book excited a frenzy of glacier hysteria.  The most-quoted ice-age alarmist of the 1970s became, in a neat public-relations pivot, one of the most quoted global-warming alarmists of the 1990s."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media, politics, and public discourse==
As McCombs et al.’s 1972 study of the political function of mass media showed, media coverage of an issue can “play an important part in shaping political reality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Shaw, D.|title=The Agenda Setting Function of Mass Media|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1972|volume=36|issue=2|pages=176–187|doi=10.1086/267990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into media coverage of climate change has demonstrated the significant role of the media in determining [[climate policy]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M|title=Flogging a Dead Norm? Newspaper Coverage of Anthropogenic Climate Change in the United States and United Kingdom from 2003-2006|journal=[[Area (journal)|Area]]|year=2007|volume=39|issue=2|pages=000–000, 200|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00769.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media has considerable bearing on public opinion, and the way in which issues are reported, or framed, establishes a particular [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajer|first=M|author2=Versteeg, W|title=A Decade of Discourse Analysis of Environmental Politics: Achievements, Challenges, Perspectives|journal=Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning|year=2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/15239080500339646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general terms, media coverage of climate change in the USA is related to the controversy about media ownership and fairness.  While most media scholars uphold the view that the media in the USA is free and unbiased, a minority disagrees. Historian Michael Parenti,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inventing Reality: The Politics of News Media|last=Parenti|first=Michael|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, alleges that the American media serves corporate interests by "inventing reality."

=== Media-policy interface ===
The relationship between media and politics is [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]. As Feindt &amp; Oels state, “[media] discourse has material and power effects as well as being the effect of material practices and power relations”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feindt|first=P|author2=Oels, A|title=Does Discourse Matter?

As highlighted above, media coverage in the United States during the Bush Administration often emphasized and exaggerated scientific uncertainty over climate change, reflecting the interests of the political elite.&lt;ref name="Boykoff 2007 000-000, 200"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M|year=2007|title=Flogging a Dead Norm?

Ever-strengthening scientific consensus on climate change means that skepticism is becoming less prevalent in the media (although the email scandal in the build up to Copenhagen reinvigorated climate skepticism in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Monibot|first=George|title=The media laps up fake controversy over climate change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/apr/29/george-monbiot-climate-change-scepticism|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2011-11-05|location=London|date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Discourses of action ===

[[File:Polarbearonice.jpg|thumb|The polar bear has become a symbol for those attempting to generate support for addressing climate change]]Commentators have argued that the climate change discourses constructed in the media have not been conducive to generating the political will for swift action. The polar bear has become a powerful discursive symbol in the fight against climate change. However, such images may create a perception of climate change impacts as geographically distant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenzoni|first=I|author2=Pidgeon|title=Public Views on Climate Change: European and USA Perspectives|journal=Climatic Change|year=2006|volume=77|issue=1|pages=73–95|doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MacNaghten argues that climate change needs to be framed as an issue 'closer to home'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= MacNaghten |first=P |title= Embodying the Environment in Everyday Life Practices |journal= The Sociological Review |year=2003 |volume=77 |issue=1 |url= https://www.academia.edu/download/37295167/Macnagthen.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Beck suggests that a major benefit of global media is that it brings distant issues within our consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beck |first=U |title= Risk Society - Towards a New Modernity |year=1992 |publisher= Sage |location= Frankfurt |isbn= 978-0-8039-8345-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, media coverage of climate change (particularly in tabloid journalism but also more generally), is concentrated around extreme weather events and projections of catastrophe, creating “a language of imminent terror”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulme|first=M|title=Why We Disagree About Climate Change|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-72732-7|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some commentators argue has instilled policy-paralysis and inhibited response. Moser et al. suggest using solution-orientated frames will help inspire action to solve climate change.&lt;ref name="Moser &amp; Dilling 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating a Climate for Change|last=Moser &amp; Dilling|first=M., and L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-86923-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominance of catastrophe frames over solution frames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boykoff|first=M|author2=Boykoff, J|title=Climate Change and Journalistic Norms: A case study of US mass-media coverage|journal=[[Geoforum]] |date=November 2007|volume=38|issue=6|pages=1190–1204|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; may help explain the apparent [[value-action gap]] with climate change; the current discursive setting has generated concern over climate change but not inspired action.

Breaking the prevailing notions in society requires discourse that is traditionally appropriate and approachable to common people. For example, Bill McKibben, an environmental activist, provides one approach to inspiring action: a war-like mobilization, where climate change is the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKibben|first1=Bill|title=We Need to Literally Declare War on Climate Change|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii|website=The New Republic|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach would resonate with working Americans who normally find themselves occupied with other news headlines. Dispelling the capitalist [[commodification]] of the environment also requires different rhetoric that breaks certain ingrained notions concerning the human relationship with the environment. This could include incorporating traditional Indigenous knowledge that prioritizes human existence with the environment as a mutualistic and protective one.
 
Additionally, international movements in developing countries in the [[Global South]] are usually excluded in developed nations that assert [[hegemony]] over the economies of developing nations. This especially applies to the people of Latin America, that are battling multinational oil and mineral corporations that seek to cooperate with the ruling class and exploit fragile ecosystems, rather than provide real solutions to working people that mutually benefit the environment. This is apparent in Ecuador, where former President [[Rafael Correa]], a left-leaning [[Populism|populist]], incited “economic growth” as a reason to sell portions of the Amazon rainforest to oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/26/ecuador-chinese-oil-bids-amazon|title=Ecuador auctions off Amazon to Chinese oil firms|last=Kaiman|first=Jonathan|date=2013-03-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These popular movements usually are neglected by the United States due to corporate relationships within the political sphere of influence.

Compared to what experts know about traditional media's and tabloid journalism’s impacts on the formation of public perceptions of climate change and willingness to act, there is comparatively little knowledge of the impacts of social media, including message platforms like Twitter, on public attitudes toward climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auer M.|title=The Potential of Microblogs for the Study of Public Perceptions of Climate Change|journal=WIREs Climate Change|date=2014| doi=10.1002/wcc.273|display-authors=etal|volume=5|issue=3|pages=291–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage by country==

===Australia===
{{See also|Climate change in Australia}}

===Canada===
{{further|Environmental policy of the Harper government#Media coverage of climate change}}

In comparison to other nations, such as the United States, the Canadian Media does not create the same perception of neutrality in the balancing of voices that represent both the scientific consensus and the skeptics equally.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/08941920.2015.1054569 | volume=29 | issue=2 | title=Canadian News Media Coverage of Climate Change: Historical Trajectories, Dominant Frames, and International Comparisons | journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources | pages=218–232| year=2015 | last1=Stoddart | first1=Mark C. J | last2=Haluza-Delay | first2=Randolph | last3=Tindall | first3=David B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian coverage appears to be more driven by national and international political events rather than the changes to carbon emissions or various other ecological factors
.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; The discourse is dominated by matters of government responsibility, policy making, policy measures for mitigation, and ways to mitigate climate change; with the issue coverage by mass media outlets continuing to act as an important means of communicating environmental concerns to the general public.
&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;

Within various provincial and language media outlets, there are varying levels of articulation regarding scientific consensus and the focus on ecological dimensions of climate change
.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; Within Quebec, specifically, these outlets are more likely to position climate change as an international issue, and to link climate change to social justice concerns to depict an image of Quebec as a pro-environmental society
&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;

Across various nations, including Canada, there has been an increased effort in the use of celebrities in climate change coverage, which is able to gain audience attention, but in turn it reinforces individualized rather than structural interpretations of climate change responsibility and solutions

===Japan===
{{See also|Climate change in Japan}}
In Japan, a study of newspaper coverage of climate change from January 1998 to July 2007 found coverage increased dramatically from January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.005 |author=Sampei, Y., Aoyagi-Usui, M. |title=Mass-media coverage, its influence on public awareness of climate-change issues, and implications for Japan's national campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions |journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=203–212 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{See also|Climate change in India}}
A 2010 study of four major, national circulation English-language newspapers in India examined "the frames through which climate change is represented in India", and found that "The results strongly contrast with previous studies from developed countries; by framing climate change along a 'risk-responsibility divide', the Indian national press set up a strongly nationalistic position on climate change that divides the issue along both developmental and [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Billett, Simon |title=Dividing climate change: global warming in the Indian mass media |journal=Climatic Change |volume=99 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–16 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/s10584-009-9605-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a qualitative analysis of some mainstream Indian newspapers (particularly opinion and editorial pieces) during the release of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report and during the Nobel Peace Prize win by Al Gore and the IPCC found that Indian media strongly pursue scientific certainty in their coverage of climate change. This is in contrast to the skepticism displayed by American newspapers at the time. Indian media highlights energy challenges, social progress, public accountability and looming disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mittal, Radhika |title=Climate Change Coverage in Indian Print Media: A Discourse Analysis |journal=The International Journal of Climate Change: Impacts and Responses |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=219–230 |year=2012 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/181298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Climate change in New Zealand}}
A six-month study in 1988 on climate change reporting in the media found that 80% of stories were no worse than slightly inaccurate. However, one story in six contained significant misreporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Allan|year=1994|title=Media (mis)communication on the science of climate change|journal=[[Public Understanding of Science (journal)|Public Understanding of Science]]|publisher=[[IOP Publishing]]|issue=3|pages=259–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Gore's film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' in conjunction with the [[Stern Review]] generated an increase in media interest in 2006.

The popular media in New Zealand often give equal weight to those supporting [[anthropogenic climate change]] and those who deny it. This stance is out of step with the findings of the scientific community where the vast majority support the [[climate change scenario]]s. A survey carried out in 2007 on climate change gave the following responses:&lt;ref&gt;ShapeNZ research report. 13 April 2007, ''New Zealanders' views on climate change and related policy options''&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the UK tabloid press (''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and their Sunday equivalents) covering the years 2000 to 2006 found that "UK tabloid coverage significantly diverged from the scientific consensus that humans contribute to climate change. Moreover, there was no consistent increase in the percentage of accurate coverage throughout the period of analysis and across all tabloid newspapers, and these findings are not consistent with recent trends documented in United States and UK 'prestige press' or broadsheet newspaper reporting. Findings from interviews indicate that inaccurate reporting may be linked to the lack of specialist journalists in the tabloid press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/2/024002 |author=Boykoff, M.T., Mansfield, M. |title='Ye Olde Hot Aire': Reporting on human contributions to climate change in the UK tabloid press |journal=[[Environmental Research Letters]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=024002 |year=2008 |format=PDF|bibcode = 2008ERL.....3d4002B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of the same dataset found that "news articles on climate change were predominantly framed through weather events, [[charismatic megafauna]] and the movements of political actors and rhetoric, while few stories focused on [[climate justice]] and risk. In addition, headlines with tones of fear, misery and doom were most prevalent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.05.002 |author=Boykoff, M.T. |title=The cultural politics of climate change discourse in UK tabloids |journal=Political Geography |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=549–569 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-year study of media coverage of [[climate change feedback]] loops found that "non-US news organizations, especially in the UK, are at the forefront of the discourse on climate feedback loops. Poor US press coverage on such climate thresholds might be understood not only as self-censorship, but as a "false negative" error."&lt;ref name="Antilla"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0963662508094099 |author=Antilla, L. |title=Self-censorship and science: A geographical review of media coverage of climate tipping points |journal=Public Understanding of Science |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=240–256 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study looked at "prominent, disruptive direct action around the climate change issue, in the context of comparable activity across a range of political groupings" and found that "they garner significant but unflattering attention from [the conventional mass media], partly as a consequence of the persistent pressures and imperatives that drive conventional journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-856X.2010.00411.x |author=Gavin, N.T. |title=Pressure group direct action on climate change: The role of the media and the web in Britain — a case study |journal=British Journal of Politics and International Relations |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=459–475 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Climate change in the United States|Propaganda model#Applications}}
One of the first critical studies of media coverage of climate change in the United States appeared in 1999. The author summarized her research:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Following a review of the decisive role of the media in American politics and of a few earlier studies of media bias, this paper examines media coverage of the greenhouse effect. It does so by comparing two pictures. The first picture emerges from reading all 100 greenhouse-related articles published over a five-month period (May–September 1997) in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]], [[The New York Times|New York Times]], [[San Francisco Chronicle|The San Francisco Chronicle]],'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The second picture emerges from the mainstream scientific literature. This comparison shows that media coverage of environmental issues suffers from both shallowness and pro-corporate bias.&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Peter J. Jacques et al., the mainstream news media of the United States is an example of the effectiveness of [[environmental skepticism]] as a tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental skepticism is "a tactic of an elite-driven counter-movement designed to combat environmentalism, and ... the successful use of this tactic has contributed to the weakening of US commitment to environmental protection." — {{cite journal |last=Jacques |first=P.J. |author2=Dunlap, R.E.|author3=Freeman, M. |date=June 2008 |title=The organization of denial: Conservative think tanks and environmental skepticism |journal=Environmental Politics |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=349–385 |doi=10.1080/09644010802055576}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2005 study reviewed and analyzed the US [[mass-media]] coverage of the environmental issue of [[climate change]] from 1988 to 2004. The authors confirm that within the journalism industry there is great emphasis on eliminating the presence of [[media bias]]. In their study they found that — due to this practice of journalistic [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]] — "Over a 15-year period, a majority (52.7%) of prestige-press articles featured balanced accounts that gave 'roughly equal attention' to the views that humans were contributing to global warming and that exclusively natural fluctuations could explain the earth's temperature increase."  As a result, they observed that it is easier for people to conclude that the issue of global warming and the accompanying [[scientific evidence]] is still hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=M. T.| authorlink2=Jules Boykoff | last1=Boykoff | first2=J.

A study of US newspapers and television news from 1995 to 2006 examined "how and why US media have represented conflict and contentions, despite an emergent consensus view regarding
anthropogenic climate science." The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] Assessment Reports [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|in 1995]] and [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|in 2001]] established an increasingly strong scientific consensus, yet the media continued to present the science as contentious. The study noted the influence of [[Michael Crichton]]'s 2004 novel ''[[State of Fear]]'', which "empowered movements across scale, from individual perceptions to the perspectives of US federal powerbrokers regarding human contribution to climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-5661.2007.00270.x |author=Boykoff, M.T.  |title=From convergence to contention: United States mass media representations of anthropogenic climate change science |journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=477–489 |year=2007 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.132.9906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study concluded that "Mass media in the U.S. continue to suggest that scientific consensus estimates of global climate disruption, such as those from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are 'exaggerated' and overly pessimistic. By contrast, work on the Asymmetry of Scientific Challenge (ASC) suggests that such consensus assessments are likely to understate climate disruptions [...] new scientific findings were more than twenty times as likely to support the ASC perspective than the usual framing of the issue in the U.S. mass media. The findings indicate that supposed challenges to the scientific consensus on global warming need to be subjected to greater scrutiny, as well as showing that, if reporters wish to discuss "both sides" of the climate issue, the scientifically legitimate 'other side' is that, if anything, global climate disruption may prove to be significantly worse than has been suggested in scientific consensus estimates to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.04.003 |author=Freudenburg, W.R., Muselli, V. |title=Global warming estimates, media expectations, and the asymmetry of scientific challenge |journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=483–491 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the association of climate change with the Arctic in popular media may undermine effective communication of the scientific realities of anthropogenic climate change. The close association of images of Arctic glaciers, ice, and fauna with climate change might harbor cultural connotations that contradict the fragility of the region. For example, in cultural historical narratives, the Arctic was depicted as an unconquerable, foreboding environment for explorers; in climate change discourse, the same environment is sought to be understood as fragile and easily affected by humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0163443716655985|author=Stenport, Anna Westerstahl, Vachula, Richard S |title=Polar bears and ice: cultural connotations of Arctic environments that contradict the science of climate change|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=282–295 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallup's annual update on Americans' attitudes toward the environment shows a public that over the last two years has become less worried about the threat of [[global warming]], less convinced that its effects are already happening, and more likely to believe that scientist themselves are uncertain about it occurrence. In response to one key question, 48% of Americans now believe that the seriousness of global warming is generally exaggerated, up from 41% in 2009 and 31% in 1997, when Gallup first asked the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=Americans'Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop: Multiple indicators show less concern, more feelings that global warming is exaggerated|journal=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] Poll News Service|date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the Media Matters for America organization has shown that, despite 2015 being “a year marked by more landmark actions to address climate change than ever before,” the combined climate coverage on the top broadcast networks was down by 5% from 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Broadcast Networks Covered Climate Change in 2015|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/302896750/Media-Matters-Climate-Broadcast-Study|website=Scribd|publisher=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
Ireland has quite a low coverage of climate change in media. a survey created shows how the Irish Times had only 0.84% of news coverage for climate change in the space of 13 years. This percentage is incredibly low compared to the rest of Europe, for example- Coverage of climate change in Ireland 10.6 stories, while the rest of Europe lies within 58.4 stories &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robbins|first1=David|agency=The Irish Times|date=November 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33799">'''Military use of schools''' is a term used to refer to the various activities that national [[armed forces]] and non-state armed groups carry out in and around schools, universities, and other education facilities, in support of their military effort.&lt;ref name="Lessons in War 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lessons in War: Military Use of Schools and other Education Institutions during Armed Conflict|url=http://www.protectingeducation.org/sites/default/files/documents/lessons_in_war.pdf|publisher=Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attach|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this include using a school or a university as [[barracks]] or [[Military base|bases]], for offensive or defensive deployments, for storage of weapons or ammunition, for military training of soldiers, as observation posts, and as a detention facility.

The United Nations [[Security Council]] has encouraged all "Member States to take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed groups."&lt;ref name="Resolution 2225"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 2225 (2015)|url=http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/2225|publisher=United Nations Security Council|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]]: "The use of schools for military purposes puts children at risk of attack and hampers children’s [[right to education]]... Such use of schools not only results in reduced enrolment and high drop out rates, especially among girls, but also may lead to schools being considered legitimate targets for attack."&lt;ref name="SG 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and Armed Conflict 2013|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N13/311/67/PDF/N1331167.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=23 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129063353/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N13/311/67/PDF/N1331167.pdf?OpenElement|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries and groups involved in military use of schools ==

According to the [http://www.protectingeducation.org/ Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack], between 2005 and 2015 there were instances of military use of schools in Afghanistan, Burma/Myanmar, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Uganda, Ukraine, Yemen and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="Lessons in War 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lessons in War - 2015: Military Use of Schools and Other  Education Institutions during Conflict|url=http://www.protectingeducation.org/sites/default/files/documents/lessons_in_war_2015_0.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Education under Attacks 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education under Attack 2014|url=http://protectingeducation.org/sites/default/files/documents/eua_2014_full_0.pdf|publisher=Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 UN Secretary-General’s Children and Armed Conflict report documented military use of schools in 14 countries by at least 10 national armed forces and multiple armed groups. According to the report, the following groups used schools for military purposes during 2015: Afghan National Defence and Security Forces as well as the [[Taliban]] and an [[ISIL]]-affiliated group in Afghanistan; former [[Séléka]] factions in the Central African Republic; the [[Military Forces of Colombia|Colombian military]] and the [[FARC-EP]] in Colombia; the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese armed force]]s and armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Iraqi security forces and ISIL in Iraq; the Darnah Mujahideen Shura Council in Libya; armed groups in Mali; the [[Tatmadaw]] (government armed forces) in Myanmar; the [[Nigerian Armed Forces|Nigerian security forces]] and [[Boko Haram]] in Nigeria; the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and paramilitary groups, and the [[Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters]] in the Philippines; the [[Somali Armed Forces|Somali National Army]] in Somalia; the [[Sudan People’s Liberation Army]] and other government forces and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition in South Sudan; government forces in Syria; Houthi forces, popular committees, and unknown armed groups in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2016/360 Report of the Secretary-General: Children and Armed Conflict]," 20 April 2016, United Nations General Assembly, Retrieved 06 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations Security Council Action ==

Under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1998]] in 2011, the Security Council urged "parties to armed conflict to refrain from actions that impede children’s access to education," and requested that the UN [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] "monitor and report ... on the military use of schools ... in contravention of international humanitarian law...".&lt;ref name="Resolution 1998"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 1998 (2011)|url=http://watchlist.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/SC-Resolution-1998.pdf|publisher=United Nations Security Council|accessdate=23 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030541/http://watchlist.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/SC-Resolution-1998.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2143 in 2014, the Security Council expressed "deep concern at the military use of schools in contravention of applicable [[international law]], recognizing that such use may render schools legitimate targets of attack, thus endangering children's and teacher's safety as well as children's education."&lt;ref name="Resolution 2143"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 2143 (2014)|url=http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/2143|publisher=United Nations Security Council|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Security Council urged "all parties to armed conflict to respect the civilian character of schools in accordance with [[international humanitarian law]];" encouraged "Member States to consider concrete measures to deter the use of schools by armed forces and armed non-State groups in contravention of applicable international law;" urged "Member States to ensure that attacks on schools in contravention of international humanitarian law are investigated and those responsible duly prosecuted;" and called "upon United Nations country-level task forces to enhance the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1612|monitoring and reporting]] on the military use of schools."&lt;ref name="Resolution 2143"/&gt;

In 2015, the Security Council strengthened its language and in Resolution 2225 encouraged all "Member States to take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed groups."&lt;ref name="Resolution 2225"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution 2225 (2015)|url=http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/2225|publisher=United Nations Security Council|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==

The legality of military use of schools is governed by a combination of [[international humanitarian law]] (also known at the "law of armed conflict"), [[international human rights law]], and [[domestic law]].&lt;ref name="Sheppard &amp; Kizuka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Bede|author2=Kennji Kizuka|title=Taking Armed Conflict Out of the Classroom: International and Domestic Legal Protections for Students When Combatants Use Schools|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|year=2012|volume=2|issue=2|pages=281–324|doi=10.1163/18781527-00202001|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mnp/jhls/2012/00000002/00000002/art00005|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Humanitarian Law ===

Military use of schools is restricted, but not always prohibited, by international humanitarian law. Parties to an armed conflict are required, to the maximum extent feasible, to a) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas, including where schools and universities are likely to be located; b) endeavour to remove the civilian population,  individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military  objectives; and c) take the other necessary precautions to protect those schools and  universities under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.&lt;ref name="Additional Protocol I"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection  of Victims of International Armed Conflicts|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/ProtocolII.aspx|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICRC, CIL, rule 22"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary International Law, rule 22|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule22|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICRC, CIL, rule 23"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary International Law, rule 23|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule23|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICRC, CIL, rule 24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary International Law, rule 24|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule24|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN Special Representative to the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict: "International humanitarian law prohibits armed forces and groups from using schools while children and teachers are using them for educational purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, [[A/68/267]], 5 August 2013, para. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to [[Human Rights Watch]] it is "unlawful to use a school simultaneously as an armed stronghold and as an educational center."&lt;ref name="Sabotaged Schooling"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabotaged Schooling: Naxalite Attacks and Police Occupation of Schools  in India’s Bihar and Jharkhand States|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/india1209webwcover_0.pdf|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], applicable during international armed conflicts, an occupying power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, "facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children."&lt;ref name="Geneva IV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/380?OpenDocument|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Protocol II|Additional Protocol II]], applicable during non-international armed conflicts, it is a "fundamental guarantee" that children shall receive an education, in keeping with the wishes of their parents.&lt;ref name="Additional Protocol II"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977.|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/475?OpenDocument|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roerich Pact]] states that "[E]ducational … institutions shall be considered as neutral and as such respected and protected by belligerents … The same respect and protection shall be accorded to … educational … institutions in time of peace as well as in war."&lt;ref name="Roerich Pact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments (Roerich Pact)|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/325?OpenDocument|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Human Rights Law ===

International human rights law guarantees students, teachers, and  education staff the right to life, personal liberty, and security.&lt;ref name=ICCPR&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm|publisher=G.A. res. 2200A (XXI), 21 U.N.

Moreover, everyone has the right to education.&lt;ref name=CRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=ICESCR&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a view to achieving the full realisation of this right, states shall make primary education compulsory and available free to all; secondary education generally available and accessible to all; and higher education equally accessible to all on the basis of capacity.&lt;ref name=CRC /&gt;&lt;ref name=ICESCR /&gt; Under the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], states are required to take measures to encourage regular attendance by children at schools and the reduction of child drop-out rates.&lt;ref name=CRC /&gt;

Explaining the right to education provided for by the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the UN's [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] has stated that "There is a strong presumption of impermissibility of any retrogressive measures taken in relation to the right to education… If any deliberately retrogressive measures are taken, the State party has the burden of proving that they have been introduced after the most careful consideration of all alternatives and that they are fully justified by reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the State party's maximum available resources."

The [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the body of independent experts who review countries' adherence to the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], has responded to evidence of military use of schools by calling for its cessation,&lt;ref name="CRC Col"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding observations: Colombia (2010)|url=http://www.bayefsky.com/docs.php/area/conclobs/treaty/crc/state/37/node/3/filename/colombia_t4_crc_opac_54|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC SYR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: Syria (2012)|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC_C_SYR_CO_3-4_en.doc|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC ISR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: Israel (2013)|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/AdvanceVersions/CRC-C-ISR-2-4.pdf|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC THA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: Thailand (2012)|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC.C.THA.3-4.doc|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impartial investigation and prosecution of those responsible,;&lt;ref name="CRC Col" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC India"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: India (2014)|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC/C/OPAC/IND/CO/1&amp;Lang=En|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any damage caused to be promptly and fully restored.&lt;ref name="CRC LKA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: Sri Lanka (2010)|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-OPAC-LKA-CO-1.doc|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the prohibition of military use of schools in domestic legislation.&lt;ref name="CRC Yemen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: Yemen (2014)|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2fC%2fOPAC%2fYEM%2fCO%2f1&amp;Lang=en|publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]], the body of independent experts who review countries’ adherence to the International [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], has also called for the prohibition of occupation of schools by security forces in areas affected by armed conflict, in response to evidence of sexual harassment of girls and school drop-out due to the presence of security forces on school grounds and for the prohibition of military use of schools in domestic legislation.&lt;ref name="CEDAW India"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concluding Observations: India (2014)|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CEDAW%2FC%2FIND%2FCO%2F4-5&amp;Lang=en|publisher=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic Law ===

Some countries have adopted [[legislation]] banning or restricting the military use of schools and/or universities. Some national armed forces and non-state armed groups have banned or regulated the practice, through military manuals or [[general order]]s. Meanwhile, domestic courts have also called upon national forces to vacate schools.&lt;ref name="Sheppard &amp; Kizuka" /&gt;

==== Practice of non-state armed groups ====

International humanitarian law binds non-state armed groups that are engaged in an armed conflict. To regulate the conduct of their forces, many such groups issue orders, directives, principles, rules, or make declarations of their intentions to adhere to certain standards.

The [[Free Syrian Army]], Syria: "[O]ccupation [of schools] by military forces represents a direct violation of domestic and international law… [T]he Free Syrian Army today states its official position prohibiting the militarization of schools and... and will amend its Proclamation of Principles to reflect the same. This statement will be circulated among all of our battalions and guide the actions of our members.

== Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict ==

On 26–28 November 2012, experts from around the world met at [[Lucens Castle]] in [[Lucens]], Switzerland, to discuss developing international guidelines to better protect schools and universities from military use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://protectingeducation.org/draft-lucens-guidelines-protecting-schools-and-universities-military-use-during-armed-conflict Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict],&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting document is known as the ''Draft Lucens Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict''. The author of the Draft Lucens Guidelines is Professor [http://www2.gre.ac.uk/about/faculty/ach/study/law/staff/steven-haines Steven Haines], Chair of Public International Law in the [[University of Greenwich]] in London who served for over 30 years as an officer in the [[British Armed Forces]]. Throughout the drafting process, over thirty states and international organizations made public statements in support of the initiative.

In June 2014, [[Norway]] announced that it would lead the process to finalize the ''Guidelines'' and promote their endorsement and implementation.&lt;ref name="Press release Norway"&gt;{{cite web|title= Norway: Leading the Way to End Military Use of Schools|url=http://protectingeducation.org/news/norway-leading-way-end-military-use-schools|publisher=Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, 13 June 2014|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final ''[http://protectingeducation.org/sites/default/files/documents/guidelines_en.pdf Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict]'' were unveiled in December 2014 in Geneva at a meeting organized by Norway and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="Press release Dec 16"&gt;{{cite web|title= New International Guidelines Address an Insidious Gap in Protecting Education during War|url=http://protectingeducation.org/news/new-international-guidelines-address-insidious-gap-protecting-education-during-war|publisher=Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, 16 December 2014|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guidelines'' urge parties to armed conflict not to use schools and universities for any purpose in support of their military effort. While acknowledging that certain uses would not be contrary to the law of armed conflict, the ''Guidelines'' outline concrete measures as a guide to responsible practice for all parties to conflict to avoid impinging on students’ safety and education. A [[Safe Schools Declaration]] was developed through consultations led by Norway and Argentina throughout the first half of 2015. The Declaration provides States the opportunity to express broad political support for the protection and continuation of education in armed conflict, and for the implementation of the Guidelines. The Safe Schools Declaration was opened for endorsement at an international conference in Oslo on May 29, 2015. &lt;ref name="Press release Oslo conference"&gt;{{cite web|title= 37 Countries Start Process of Protecting Schools and Universities during Conflict |url=http://www.protectingeducation.org/news/countries-join-safe-schools-pact|publisher=Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, 29 May 2015|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her 2014 annual report to the UN [[Human Rights Council]], [[Leila Zerrougui]], the Special Representative to the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, welcomed the release of the ''Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict'' and encouraged Member States to adopt them."&lt;ref name="A/HRC/28/54"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, 29 December 2014|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/28/54%20&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Muldergate scandal''', also known as the '''Information Scandal''', was a [[South Africa]]n [[political scandal]] involving the Department of Information.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/articles_papers/information-scandal.htm|title=The Information Scandal|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South African]] Prime Minister [[B. J. Vorster]], [[Connie Mulder|Dr. Connie Mulder]] (Minister of Information) and [[Eschel Rhoodie|Dr. Eschel Rhoodie]] (Secretary of the Department of Information) were implicated in plans to use government resources to fight a propaganda war for the then [[apartheid]] government. In 1973 John Vorster had agreed to Mulder's plan to shift about 64 million [[South African rand|rand]] from the defense budget to undertake a series of propaganda projects.  Plans included bribes of international news agencies and the purchase of the ''[[Washington Star]]'' newspaper.

Vorster was also implicated in the use of a secret slush fund to establish ''[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]'', the only major English-language newspaper that was favourable to the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].

A commission of inquiry concluded in mid-1979 that Vorster knew "everything" about the corruption and had tolerated it. He resigned from the [[State President of South Africa|presidency]] in disgrace.

The [[Nelson, New Zealand | Nelson]]–[[Blenheim, New Zealand |Blenheim]] notional railway (1957–1979) was part of the political management of the backlash from the [[New Zealand Railways Department]]'s closure of the isolated [[Nelson Section]], which ended hopes for a southern connection of Nelson to the rest of the [[South Island]] railway [[List of railway lines in New Zealand | network]].

== Background ==

The Nelson Section was an isolated, 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge, government-owned railway line running south from Nelson to Glenhope in the [[Tasman Region |Tasman district]] of [[New Zealand]]'s South Island.  Begun in 1876, it reached Glenhope, about 96&amp;nbsp;km south of Nelson, in 1912.  Desultory work beyond Glenhope went on until 1931, but the Nelson section was never connected to the rest of the South Island rail network.  

While the line was profitable in its early years, falling revenues and increasing costs of maintenance resulted in closure in 1955, despite protest meetings, sit-ins to stop demolition trains, and a 12,000 strong petition calling for the re-opening of the line and an investigation of an alternative link-up with the rest of the network via a line to Blenheim.&lt;ref name="Churchman"&gt;Churchman, G. and Hurst, T., 1990, ‘The Railways of New Zealand; a Journey Through History' (2nd edition 2001), Transpress New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand, {{ISBN|0-908876-20-3}}, pps 172 -173&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political response ==

In response to the call for an alternative connection to the rest of the South Island network, [[Prime Minister of New Zealand | Prime Minister]] [[Sidney Holland]] promised completion of a survey of possible northern routes from Nelson to Blenheim, and reports on other potential routes via the [[West Coast Region |West Coast]].  A decision on a rail link would be made after the surveys and reports were completed.&lt;ref name="Churchman"/&gt;  In the meantime, in recognition of transport problems caused by Nelson's lack of a rail connection, Prime Minister Holland announced the government would [[subsidy |subsidise]] the cost of transporting passengers and goods by road between Nelson and Blenheim so that the charges to the users would be the same as if a railway already existed.&lt;ref name="Churchman"/&gt; 

So on 4 November 1957, with an eye to the imminent [[New Zealand general election, 1957 | general election]], the [[New Zealand National Party |National]] government announced that [[New Zealand State Highway 6 | State Highway 6]] between Blenheim and Nelson would be deemed by law to be a 'notional railway', connecting with the rest of the South Island network at Blenheim.&lt;ref name="Leitch"&gt;Leitch, D. and Stott, B., 1988, ‘New Zealand Railways; The First 125 Years', Heinemann Reid, Octopus Publishing Group (NZ) Ltd, Birkenhead, Auckland, New Zealand, {{ISBN|0-7900-0000-8}}, pps 112 -113&lt;/ref&gt; Various points on the highway were designated as stations.  This meant that passenger fares and freight rates from any railway station in the South Island to designated stations on the notional railway, or to Nelson, were calculated as if there were continuous railway mileage between the two points, even though in reality passengers or freight travelling on the notional railway were transported by road carriers.&lt;ref name="Leitch"/&gt; As rail rates for both passengers and freight were significantly cheaper than road carrier rates, this was obviously to the user's advantage.

== Costs ==

From the start the scheme inflicted significant costs on the government via the Railways Department, and later via the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)| Department of Internal Affairs]] who took over administering the scheme in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hoare"&gt;Hoare, G., 1990, 'Nelson's Notional Railway: The Political Distortion of Geographical Space', Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie, Volume 81, Issue 1,  pages 48–57, February 1990, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9663.1990.tb01746.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first year of operation cost the Railways Department ₤105,000.  However, unlike a real railway that can benefit from attracting more custom, and hence more revenue, the more patronage the notional railway attracted the greater the subsidy paid by the Railways Department or (later) by the Department of Internal Affairs – and ultimately, by the taxpayer.  In the 1972 [[fiscal year]] the government paid $660,745 in subsidies to keep the notional railway in existence.&lt;ref name="Bromby"&gt;Bromby, R., 2003, ‘Rails That Built a Nation: an Encyclopedia of New Zealand Railways', Grantham House Publishing, Oriental Bay, Wellington, New Zealand, {{ISBN|1-86934-080-9}}, pps 111 -112&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demise ==

On 1 March 1960 the [[Second Labour Government of New Zealand | Labour government]], elected with a one-seat majority in 1957, [[Groundbreaking |broke ground]] on a line from Nelson to Blenheim.  In Nelson [[Land reclamation | reclamation work]] was begun to create space for a new station and rail yards.  However the Labour government lasted only one three-year term, and on 14 December 1960 the new National Party Prime Minister [[Keith Holyoake]] announced that all work on the Nelson–Blenheim line was to stop immediately, and the [[enabling act |enabling legislation]] would be [[repeal |repealed]] in the first session of the new [[New Zealand Parliament |parliament]].&lt;ref name="Churchman"/&gt;

This ended all hopes of Nelson being connected to the rest of the railway network by a line of rail. Despite this, the Nelson–Blenheim notional railway persisted for another 19 years until the subsidy was finally abolished on 1 October 1979, by which time it was costing around $10 million a year to run.&lt;ref name="Churchman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4895">The '''No Land Tax Campaign''' was a minor Australian political party formed prior to the [[New South Wales state election, 2015|2015 New South Wales state election]]. It was formed in opposition to the levying of [[land tax]], which in New South Wales applies to investment properties and holiday homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nsw-state-election-2015/no-land-tax-candidate-list-reveals-party-may-be-all-in-the-family-20150314-1441qv.html|title=No Land Tax candidate list reveals party may be all in the family|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party achieved 1.90% of Legislative Council and 2.02% of Legislative Assembly votes at the election, but its failure to honour a promise to 3,600 workers to pay them $30 an hour ultimately led to legal trouble for the party. 

The party letterboxed homes in some parts of New South Wales with a flyer bearing the state's coat of arms, and advertising a website "electionwork.com.au".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/2986209/no-land-tax-workers-worried-about-payment/|title=NSW election 2015: No Land Tax workers worried about payment|last=Pearson|first=Andrew|work=Illawarra Mercury|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website offered $30 an hour to "reliable, enthusiastic people" to hand out flyers and approach voters — bonuses were offered if candidates achieved certain vote levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionwork.com.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314195506/http://www.electionwork.com.au/|title=Election Day Workers Needed|author=No Land Tax Campaign|archive-date=14 March 2015|accessdate=14 December 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electoral Commissioner, Colin Barry, commented that in 30 years, he had never seen a situation like it: "I'm not aware of any political party paying people to hand out material on election day. This was a very novel approach to say the least."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-18/no-land-tax-party-workers-still-waiting-to-be-paid/6478452|title=No Land Tax Party workers still waiting for payment as NSW electoral commissioner expresses concern|last=Collins|first=Antoinette|work=ABC Online|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the ensuing months, Peter Jones, the party secretary, repeatedly promised to pay the 3,600 workers, blaming delays on various administrative and other causes. However, no money was paid and the party's website was taken offline. In August 2015, following an investigation which commenced in May, the [[Fair Work Ombudsman]] announced that they were taking legal action against Jones and the party, accusing them of a lack of co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/news-and-media-releases/2015-media-releases/august-2015/20150811-no-land-tax-party-litigation|title=No Land Tax Party faces legal action|author=Fair Work Ombudsman|date=11 August 2015|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/fair-work-ombudsman-launches-legal-action-against-no-land-tax-party-and-peter-jones-20150811-giwly0.html|title=Fair Work Ombudsman launches legal action against No Land Tax party and Peter Jones|last=Patty|first=Anna|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2017, the Federal Circuit Court fined Jones $13,315 and the party $67,575.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/political-party-leader-fined-81-000-for-short-changing-workers-20171212-p4yxmq.html|title=Political party, leader fined $81,000 for short-changing workers|last=Patty|first=Anna|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 December 2017|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones admitted contravening the workplace laws, but was criticised by the judge for his arrogant attitude and lack of remorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/news-and-media-releases/2017-media-releases/december-2017/20171213-no-land-tax-penalty-release|title=Political party leader who short-changed workers criticised for “arrogant” attitude|author=Fair Work Ombudsman|date=13 December 2017|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Nyaya [[Panchayat]]''' is a system of dispute resolution at village level in [[India]]. Nyaya panchayats can be endowed with functions based on broad [[principles of natural justice]] and can tend to remain procedurally as simple as possible. They can be given civil and minor criminal jurisdiction. But they should never follow civil and criminal procedure code in toto.

==Brief history==
The earliest nyaya panchayats were the village courts established under the ''Village Courts Act of 1888''. The ''Royal Commission on Decentralisation'' of 1909, recommended of revival of nyaya panchayats having both civil and criminal jurisdiction in petty cases arising within the village. In May 1915, by a resolution passed by the [[Government of India]], the matters regarding the establishmentof nyaya panchayat was left to the State Government. In 1920, ''Bombay Village Panchayat Act'' was passed and that resulted in the conduct of a series of panchayat adalats. But select committee of the legislative council opposed the investing of judicial powers on panchayats. In 1933, a village bench consisting of elected members and outsiders were created as per provisions of the ''Bombay Village Panchayat Act'' in Bombay. Since independence, almost all States enforced Village Panchayat Acts as guided by the directive principles and have resulted in the creation of statutory nyaya panchayat legislation. The village Panchayat and nyaya panchayat existed as dual entities in order to have separation of judiciary from the executive.&lt;ref&gt;nyaya panchayat : Need for decentralised administration by K Rajasekharan, ''Kerala Calling'' December 1997 PP 27 -29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current movements in India==
Legislation to formalize these bodies and bring them within the ambit of organised justice in India was planned as part of the [[Panchayati Raj]] reforms of [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in the 1980s, but was put on hold to coincide with broader reform of the justice system, which was never carried out. Following the victory of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]]-led [[United Progressive Alliance]] in the [[2004 General Elections]], the [[National Advisory Council]] advised the [[Government of India]] to introduce legislation. To draft legislation in this regard a drafting committee, under the chairmanship of Professor [[Upendra Baxi]], has been formed by the '''Ministry of Panchayati Raj''', [[Government of India]]. The [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] on the issue is proposed to be debated in the winter session of the [[Indian Parliament]]. [http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/25/stories/2006062503201000.htm]

==Constitutional support for nyaya panchayat==
Since a forum for the resolution of disputes with the participation of people in local justice administration is the goal envisaged by Article 39A of the [[Constitution of India]], it is strongly felt by some jurists and social scientists that it is incumbent on the government to take immediate steps to activate nyaya panchayats, given that it might not be possible to render access justice in rural areas simpler and quicker. It is also argued that nyaya panchayats guided by local traditions, culture and behavioural pattern of the village community instill confidence in the people towards the administration of justice.

==114th law commission report==
The Law Commission, in its &lt;ref&gt;[http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/101-169/Report114.pdf One Hundred and Fourteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt; August 1986 (Chapter V para. 5.3) indicating that nyaya panchayats made precisely this point, observing that ''“Article 39A of the Constitution of India directs the State to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by economic or other disabilities. This is the constitutional imperative. Denial of justice on the grounds of economic and other disabilities is in nutshell referred to what has been known as problematic access to law. The Constitution now commands us to remove impediments to access to justice in a systematic manner. All agencies of the Government are now under a fundamental obligation to enhance access to justice. Article 40 which directs the State to take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government, has to be appreciated afresh in the light of the mandate of the new article 39A.”''the law evensays that there should not be khap panchayat

==Judicial backlog==
With a rapid increase in the number of people approaching the courts, the primary concern faced by the Judiciary is the escalation in the amount of new cases coming in and an ever-increasing backlog, which seems to have assumed insurmountable propositions making access to justice to the public at large a far delayed and long drawn process. There are more than three crore cases pending before the various courts of India as stated by the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of India]].

==Other reasons==
The following considerations seem to have prompted the Law Commission and the Study Team on nyaya panchayats to recommend the revitalisation of nyaya panchayats: (The Law Commission, Fourteenth Report and the Report of the Study Team on nyaya panchayats extracted from an article written by '''K.N. Chandrasekharan Pillai''' titled “Criminal Jurisdiction of nyaya panchayats” Journal of the  Indian Law Institute Vol. 19, October–December 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;443)
# They would dispose of a large number of cases and thus relieve the burden of regular courts.
# They would succeed in getting a large number of cases compromised through peaceful conciliation.
# The villagers in general would be satisfied with the administration of justice obtaining in village or panchayat courts and that the decisions of these courts on the whole would do substantial justice.
# Appeals and revisions from these decisions would be small in number.
# There should be speedy and cheap disposal of cases.
# The litigants and witnesses who are mostly agriculturists can conveniently attend the courts and thus there would be no interference with agricultural activities in the village.
# The panchayat could bring justice nearer to the villager without involving the expenditure which would otherwise have to be incurred in establishing regular courts.
# Panchayat would have an educative value.
# Local courts acquainted with the customs of the neighbourhood and nuances of the local idiom are better able to understand why certain things are said or done.
# An institution nearer to the people holds out greater opportunities for settlement and a decision taken by it does not leave behind that trial of bitterness which generally follows in the wake of litigation in ordinary courts.
# There are better chances of conciliatory method of approach in nyaya panchayats.
# People in a village are so closely known to each other that the parties to a dispute would not be able to conceal or produce false evidence easily and those who tell lies before the nyaya panchayat face the risk of being looked down upon and even boycotted by others.
# Panchas being drawn from among simple village folk strive at decisions which are fair and at the same time consistent with the peculiar conditions of the parties.

'''''Hon’ble Justice S.B Sinha, Judge Supreme Court of India''''', emphasising the importance of nyaya panchayats in a lecture delivered to District Judges observed that, “There is also a need to deliberate on the methodologies to be adopted for encouraging justice dispensation through the traditional forum of Panchayats. This age-old institution has found new vigour with the introduction of the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution, and most accordingly to be considered another pillar in the edifice that symbolizes justice. Strengthening the institution of Panchayats and empowering people at the grass-root level to resolve their disputes amicably would solve many of the problems that is faced by conventional justice dispensation machinery in its attempts to percolate to the lowest levels. This would provide a, solution to the problems of access to those living in remote regions.”

==State-level reforms==
Certain states like [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]] have already made provisions for establishing village courts.[http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&amp;leaf=12&amp;filename=9470&amp;filetype=html]

== Notable Movement and Actions ==

=== Marriage ===

OutFront Minnesota, with the support of Sen. [[Allan Spear]] and Rep. [[Karen Clark]], led the effort to amend the state's Human Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity, a change which was achieved in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Joshua. "Allan Spear and the Minnesota Human Rights Act." ''Minnesota History'' 65 (2016): 76-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

OutFront Minnesota also led a successful three-year campaign to defeat an anti-equality constitutional amendment to bar Minnesota's same-sex couples from marrying. On May 14, 2013, there was a 37-30 bipartisan vote to allow same-sex couples to marry Executive Director Monica Meyer stated on the matter, "We want to thank House Speaker Thissen, Senate Majority Leader Bakk and all of the legislators who voted yes -- and, of course, [[Mark Dayton|Governor Dayton]] who has been so supportive of LGBT equality. We also want to thank each and every person who dedicated their time and energy to make this happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marriage {{!}} OutFront Minnesota|url = https://outfront.org/takeaction/marriage|website = outfront.org|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OutFront Minnesota worked with individuals to use personal stories to lobby the Minnesota legislature. OutFront Minnesota helped Minnesota become the twelfth state to legalize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marriage {{!}} OutFront Minnesota|url = https://outfront.org/takeaction/marriage|website = outfront.org|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safe Schools ===

[[File:OutFront MN Bill Siging.jpg|thumb|Youth at Mark Dayton Safe Schools Act signing]]
Before the Safe School Act was signed into law 2014, Minnesota had relatively weak anti-bullying policies. The "Safe and Supportive school Act" was passed on April 4, 2014 with a 36-31 vote after hours of long debate in the Minnesota Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bullying crackdown passes Minnesota Senate|url = http://www.startribune.com/senate-passes-antibullying-bill-dayton-is-expected-to-sign/253847681/#|website = Star Tribune|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OutFront Minnesota lobbied the state of Minnesota legislature for education reform. Anti-bullying legislation became a larger issue within the state of Minnesota, as a result of a string of bullying incidents within [[Anoka County, Minnesota|Anoka County]]. The bullying incidents became so severe within the county that the [[United States courts of appeals|United States Judicial department]] became involved. The Safe and Support School Act protected from; religious, racial, [[gender identity]], and [[Sexualism|sexual orientation discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Safe Schools {{!}} OutFront Minnesota|url = https://www.outfront.org/safeschools|website = www.outfront.org|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act does not mandate private or home school to follow the law. After hours of debate the Safe and Supportive Act was passed. A compromise that occurred that the law no longer required school to report and collect date about these bullying cases. Additionally under the compromise, school districts did not have train volunteers. Much of the opposition toward the legislation came from the [[Republican Party of Minnesota|Minnesota Republican Party]]. This contention spurred from the cost of the law, and inclusion of sexual orientation. The estimated cost of the Safe and Support Schools Act was to around $19 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti-bullying bill passes Minn.

The '''Peace of [[Acilisene]]''' was a treaty between the [[East Roman Empire]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] sometime between 384 and 390 (usually dated to 387) which divided [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Greater Armenia]] between these two empires. Persia received the greater share. By this treaty the Byzantine Empire/East Roman Empire also finally admitted the loss of [[Kingdom of Iberia|Kartli-Iberia]] to Sassanid Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Peace+of+acilisene&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9BCmVMzFJ8TmapbzgtgL&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Peace%20of%20acilisene&amp;f=false|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, Iranian influence grew once again in [[eastern Georgia]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] appeared to have become something like the second established religion alongside [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Peace+of+acilisene&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9BCmVMzFJ8TmapbzgtgL&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Peace%20of%20acilisene&amp;f=false|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of early European colonies in the [[New World]] were largely plantocracies, usually consisting of a small European [[settler colonialism|settler population]] relying on a predominantly West African [[Chattel slavery|chattel slave]] population (as well as smaller numbers of [[indentured servant]]s, both European and non-European in origin), and later, [[free black|freed Black]] and poor white [[sharecropper]]s for labor. These plantocracies proved to be a decisive force in the [[Abolitionism|anti-abolitionist]] movement. 

One prominent organization largely representing (and collectively funded by) a number of plantocracies was the "[[West India Interest]]", which lobbied in the [[British Parliament]]. It is credited (or conversely, discredited) in constituting a significant impetus in delaying the abolition of the slave trade from taking place in the 1790s to being implemented in 1806-1808; and likewise, with respect to prospects of emancipation being proclaimed in the 1820s (instead, a policy known as "Amelioration" was formally adopted throughout 1823-1833), to it being implemented in 1834-1838.

{{Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The '''Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' is the three-member body which collectively serves as [[head of state]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/hron/default.aspx?id=10074&amp;langTag=en-US&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Article V of the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of three members: one [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] and one [[Croat]] elected from the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation]] and one [[Serb]] elected from [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/nadl/default.aspx?id=18268&amp;langTag=en-US&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they serve one four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/nadl/default.aspx?id=18268&amp;langTag=en-US&lt;/ref&gt;

The member with the most votes becomes the [[Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|chairperson]] unless he or she was the incumbent chairman at the time of the election, but the chairmanship rotates every eight months, to ensure equality.

==History and period before elections (1945–1992)==

===Heads of State of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina===
{{Main|Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

===Presidency of the early Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina===
{{see also|Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian War}}

When the country declared independence in 1992, the Presidency consisted of:
* two Bosniak members - [[Alija Izetbegović]] and [[Fikret Abdić]]
* two Serb members - [[Biljana Plavšić]] and [[Nikola Koljević]]
* two Croat members - [[Stjepan Kljujić]] and [[Franjo Boras]]
* one other member - [[Ejup Ganić]]

Over the course of the [[Bosnian War]], the Presidency underwent several changes: the Serb members Plavšić and Koljević, as well as the Croat member Boras, left the Presidency early on and were replaced by [[Nenad Kecmanović]], [[Mirko Pejanović]] and [[Ivo Komšić]], respectively. Kecmanović soon also left, and was replaced by [[Tatjana Ljujić-Mijatović]]. After a while, Abdić was replaced with [[Nijaz Duraković]].

==Presidency elections==

===Presidency elected in 1996===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina general election, 1996}}

Elected members:
* [[Alija Izetbegović]] for the [[Bosniaks]]
* [[Momčilo Krajišnik]] for the [[Serbs]]
* [[Krešimir Zubak]] for the [[Croats]]

===Presidency elected in 1998===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina general election, 1998}}

Elected members:
* [[Alija Izetbegović]] for the [[Bosniaks]], since 5 October 1996 (chairman between 14 February and 14 October 2000)
* [[Živko Radišić]] for the [[Serbs]], since 13 October 1998
* [[Ante Jelavić]] for the [[Croats]], September 1998 to March 2001

Živko Radišić with 52% of the Serb vote was elected chairman of the collective presidency for the first 8 months; Ante Jelavić with 52% of the Croat vote followed Radišić in the rotation; Alija Izetbegović with 87% of the Bosniak vote won the highest number of votes in the election but was ineligible to serve a second term until Radišić and Jelavić had each served a first term as Chairman of the Presidency. Ante Jelavić was replaced by [[Jozo Križanović]] for the remainder of his term based on a decision issued by [[Wolfgang Petritsch]], [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

===Presidency elected in 2002===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina general election, 2002}}

Elected members:
*[[Dragan Covic|Dragan Čović]] for the [[Croats]]
*[[Mirko Sarovic|Mirko Šarović]] for the [[Serbs]]
*[[Sulejman Tihic|Sulejman Tihić]] for the [[Bosniaks]]

Mirko Šarović with 35.5% of the Serb vote was elected chairman of the collective presidency for the first eight months; Dragan Čović received 61.5% of the Croat vote; Sulejman Tihić received 37% of the Bosniak vote.

Mirko Šarović resigned in 2003 due to his implication in the scandal regarding the selling of arms to [[Iraq]]. The Parliament replaced him with [[Borislav Paravac]].

Dragan Čović was dismissed by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] [[Paddy Ashdown]], after Čović was indicted for financial corruption; however, the trial hasn't taken place yet. The Parliament replaced him with [[Ivo Miro Jovic|Ivo Miro Jović]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">:''For the general topic, see [[Political science of religion]]
'''Religious rejection of politics''' is a philosophy that can be found in several religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Followers of this philosophy may withdraw from politics for several reasons, including the view that politics is artificial, divisionary, or corrupt.

Several religious groups reject any involvement in politics. Many [[Taoism|Taoists]] have rejected political involvement on the grounds that it is insincere or artificial and a life of contemplation in nature is preferable, while some [[Asceticism|ascetic]] schools of [[Hinduism]] or [[Buddhism]] also reject political involvement for similar reasons. 

In [[Christianity]], some groups like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Amish]], the [[Hutterites]], and the [[Exclusive Brethren]] reject politics on the grounds that they believe Christ's statements about the kingdom not being of the world mean that earthly politics can or should be rejected. Not necessarily all forms of politics are rejected. For example, among the Old Order Amish running for office is not allowed but voting is only discouraged, not forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Kraybill|Donald B. Kraybill]], Karen M. Johnson-Weiner and [[Steven M. Nolt]]: ''The Amish'', Baltimore, 2013, pages 361-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, like the [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'is]], do not take part in partisan politics.  They neither endorse particular candidates, or join political parties.  They are told to vote their consciences as individuals.  If asked to register they tend to do so as independent.

In other religious systems it can relate to a rejection of nationalism or even the concept of nations. In certain schools of Islamic thinking, nations are a creation of Western imperialism and ultimately all Muslims should be united religiously in the [[ummah]]. Therefore, Muslims should be in [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]] as nations, in the Western sense, are basically deemed [[apostate]]. 

There are some aspects of the early days of the radical [[Takfir wal-Hijra]] that hint at this. Likewise various Christian denominations reject any involvement in national issues considering it to be a kind of idolatry called [[statolatry]]. Most Christians who rejected the idea of nations have associated with the [[Christian Left]]. [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidic Judaism]] rejects the state of [[Israel]] being created before the return of the Messiah, therefore members of this group refuse to vote in Israel. This group does not reject all politics, but it does reject participation in Israeli politics.

Lastly, some religions do not specifically reject politics per se, but believe existing political systems are so inherently corrupt they must be ignored. In some respects the view of governments as apostate relates to that. In the early stages of the [[Nation of Islam]], for example, many adherents rejected the idea of voting because the US political system was rejected in strong terms. In recent decades, however, this view has declined in popularity among Nation of Islam adherents or been rejected outright.

In the [[United States]], a recent survey indicated that 2% of those who did not register to vote cited religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=292 Pew Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey reported that 22% of Americans are not registered to vote.

      <comment>Update to Colorado risk audit procedures for the 2018 election</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19310">A '''risk limiting post-election audit''' is one of several types of [[election audits]]. It is based on hand counts of [[statistical]] samples of paper ballots, which are stored from election day to the time of the audit. It tests whether [[election]] results identified the correct winner(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving throw: securing democracy with stats, spreadsheets, and 10-sided dice|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/saving-american-elections-with-10-sided-dice-one-stats-profs-quest/|publisher=Ars Technica|author=Cyrus Farivar|date=2012-07-25|accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if samples find few discrepancies, the public knows there is a limited risk that the initial winners are wrong. If samples find substantial discrepancies, the risk-limiting audit, like most but not all other [[Election_audits#Current_practices_in_election_results_auditing_in_the_United_States|election audits]], requires a 100% recount by hand, to identify the correct winner(s). 

[[File:Election Audit Sizes.png|thumb|Sample sizes depend on: winning margin, number of ballots voted, confidence level, and type of audit.]]
==Categories of audits==

There are two types of election audits: ''process audits'', which determine whether appropriate procedures were followed, and ''results audits'', which determine whether votes were counted accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lwv.org/files/Report_ElectionAudits.pdf|title=Report on Election Auditing by the Election Audits Task Force of the League of Women Voters of the United States|last=|first=|date=2009|website=League of Women Voters|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk-limiting audits are one form of a results audit. 

There are three types of risk-limiting audits:&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/RLAwhitepaper12.pdf |title=Risk-Limiting Post-Election Audits: Why and How |last=Lindeman |first=Mark (executive editor), Jennie Bretschneider, Sean Flaherty, Susannah Goodman, Mark Halvorson, Roger Johnston, Ronald L. Rivest, Pam Smith, Philip B. Stark |date=2012-10-01 |website=University of California at Berkeley |pages=3, 16 |access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Ballot comparison.''' Know how computers counted each ballot ("cast vote record"), compare the computer and manual interpretations of a random sample of ballots, count and report differences in these interpretations
#'''Ballot polling.''' Know computer total for the election, count a random sample of ballots, report differences between computer and manual percentages
#'''Batch comparison.''' Know computer total for each batch of ballots (e.g. precinct), hand-count all ballots in a random sample of batches, report any differences between computer and manual totals for each batch

Colorado uses the first system in most counties, and the second in a few counties which lack "cast vote records."&lt;ref name="systems"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VotingSystems/riskAuditFiles/2018/20180104VotingSystemsPublic.xlsx |title=Voting Systems Public |last=Volkosh |first=Dan |date=2018-01-04 |website=Colorado Secretary of State |access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

The process starts with election officials selecting a ‘risk limit,’ such as 9% in Colorado,&lt;ref name="co1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/RLA/files/2017/round_1/state_report.xlsx |title=Round #1 State Report |date=2017-11-20 |website=www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/auditCenter.html |access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that if there are any erroneous winners in the initial results, the audit will catch at least 91% of them and let up to 9% stay undetected and take office.&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gentle" /&gt; Using formulae,&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="super-simple"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stark |first=Philip |date=2010-08-01 |title=Super-Simple Simultaneous Single-Ballot Risk-Limiting Audits |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/evt/tech/full_papers/Stark.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the USENIX Electronic Voting Technology Workshop/Workshop on Trustworthy Elections (EVT/WOTE), Aug. 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Lindeman  |first=Mark, Philip B. Stark, Vincent S. Yates |date=2012-08-06 |title=BRAVO: Ballot-polling Risk-limiting Audits to Verify Outcomes |url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/evtwote12/evtwote12-final27.pdf |journal=EVT/WOTE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="wald"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Wald |first=A. |date=1945-06-01 |title=Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses |url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177731118 |journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics |language=EN |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=117–186 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731118 |issn=0003-4851}}&lt;/ref&gt;
officials identify a sample size for each race they intend to verify. The size of the sample depends primarily on the margin of victory in the targeted race. They then generate a series of random numbers identifying specific ballots to pull from storage, such as the 23rd, 189th, 338th, 480th ballots in precinct 1, and other random numbers in other precincts. Paper ballots in the sample are then manually compared to the computer results. If the audit sample produces the same result as the computer results, the outcome is confirmed, subject to the risk limit, and the audit is complete. If the audit sample shows enough discrepancies to call the outcome into question, a larger sample is selected and counted. This process can continue until the sample confirms the original winner or a different winner is determined by hand-counting all ballots.&lt;ref&gt;http://electionaudits.org/bp-risklimiting&lt;/ref&gt;

The three approaches are listed in order of increasing numbers of ballots which need to be hand-counted. For example in a jurisdiction with 64,000 ballots, an 8% margin of victory, and allowing 10% of any mistakes to go undetected, ballot comparison, on average, needs 80 ballots, ballot polling needs 700 ballots, and batch comparison needs 13,000 ballots (in 26 batches).&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; 

Sample sizes rise rapidly for narrower margins, with all methods. Even in a smaller jurisdiction, with 4,000 ballots, ballot comparison would need 300 ballots for a race with a 2% margin of victory and 3,000 ballots for a 0.1% margin of victory. Ballot polling or batch comparison would need a full hand count. Margins under 0.1% occur in [[List_of_close_election_results#Distribution_of_elections_by_winning_margin|one in sixty to one in 460 races]]. Large numbers of races on a ballot raise the chances that these small margins and large samples will occur in a jurisdiction.

If the samples do not confirm the initial results, more rounds of sampling may be done, but if it appears the initial results are wrong, risk-limiting audits require a 100% hand count to change the result.&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;

Jurisdictions using method 1, compare paper ballots to the computer's cast vote records. A bug or smart hacker could generate cast vote records which match the physical ballots, but the computers can still print out totals which create a different outcome from the true sum of the honest ballot-by-ballot records. So the system needs an independent check that the computer totals match the ballot-by-ballot records.&lt;ref name="gentle"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stark |first=Philip |date=2012-03-16 |title=Gentle Introduction to Risk-limiting Audits |url=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/gentle12.pdf |journal=IEEE Security and Privacy |via=University of California at Berkeley, pages 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="asa" /&gt; 
Colorado says it has such a system, but it is not yet publicly documented.&lt;ref name="stat2018"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VotingSystems/riskAuditFiles/NotesOnStatistics-2018ColoradoPrimariesElectionAudit.pdf |title=Comments re statistics of auditing the 2018 Colorado elections |last=Lindeman |first=Mark, Ronald L. Rivest, Philip B. Stark and Neal McBurnett |date=2018-01-03 |website=Colorado Secretary of State |access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Method 1 also requires the ballots to be kept in strict order so one can compare the computer interpretations of sampled ballots with those exact physical ballots.&lt;ref name="lovato"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bowencenterforpublicaffairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Risk-Limiting-Audit-Presentation.pdf |title=Colorado Risk-Limiting Audit:Conception to Application |last=Lovato |first=Jerome, Danny Casias, and Jessi Romero |website=Bowen center for Public Affairs and Colorado Secretary of State |access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the methods, when done for a state-wide election, involve manual work throughout the state, wherever ballots are stored, so the public and candidates need observers at every location to be sure procedures are followed. However in Colorado and most states the law [[Election_audits#Election_audit_practices,_by_state |does not require]] any of the audit work to be done in public.&lt;ref name="vvstates"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.verifiedvoting.org/state-audit-laws/ |title=State Audit Laws |date=2017-02-10 |website=Verified Voting |language=en-US |access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costs of actual hand counts in 2004 ranged from $0.36 per ballot to count one race in Washington State, including overhead (training, supervision, space rental), to $3.39 per ballot to count 21 contests on each ballot in Nevada, excluding overhead, or $0.18 per contest per ballot.&lt;ref name="cost"&gt;{{Cite web |url=www.votersunite.org/info/CostEstimateforHandCounting.pdf |title=Cost Estimate for Hand Counting 2% of the Precincts in the U.S. |last=Theisen |first=Ellen |date=2004 |website=votersunite.org |access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These involved hand-counting all ballots in a precinct, so they are relevant to 100% hand-counts, when needed. Sample counts have fewer ballots, but extra costs for pulling out the sampled ballots and putting them back, and similar overheads for training and supervision.

==Keeping paper ballots secure==

Auditing is done several days after the election, so paper ballots and computer files need to be kept securely. [[Physical security]] has its own large challenges. No US state has adequate laws on physical security of the ballots.&lt;ref name="evote"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Krimmer/publication/320618317_TUT_Press_Proceedings_of_the_Second_International_Conference_on_Electronic_Voting_E-Vote-ID/links/59f10905458515bfd07fb73b/TUT-Press-Proceedings-of-the-Second-International-Conference-on-Electronic-Voting-E-Vote-ID.pdf#page=132 |title=Electronic voting : second International Joint Conference, E-Vote-ID 2017, Bregenz, Austria, October 24-27, 2017, proceedings |last=Benaloh et al |first=Public Evidence from Secret Ballots |year=2017 |isbn=9783319686875 |location=Cham, Switzerland |pages=122 |oclc=1006721597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Security recommendations for elections include: starting audits as soon as possible after the election, preventing access by anyone alone,&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://electionaudits.org/files/bestpracticesfinal_0.pdf |title=Best Practices: Chain of Custody and Ballot Accounting,  ElectionAudits.org |last=Lindeman |first=Mark, Mark Halvorson, Pamela Smith, Lynn Garland, Vittorio Addona, Dan McCrea |date=2008-09-01 |website=Brennan Center for Justice et al. |language=en |access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which would typically require two locks, and no one having keys to both locks, having risks identified by people other than those who design or manage the system, using background checks and tamper-evident seals,&lt;ref name="eac-phys"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/260.pdf |title=Chapter 3.

&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;
although seals can typically be removed and reapplied without damage, especially in the first 48 hours, and detecting subtle tampering requires substantial training.&lt;ref name="seals"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.alu.army.mil/alog/issues/JulAug12/Choose_Use_Seals.html |title=How to Choose and Use Seals |last=Johnston |first=Roger G., and Jon S.

Experienced testers can usually bypass all physical security systems. Security equipment is vulnerable before and after delivery.

==State variations==

As of early 2017, about [[Election_audits#Election_audit_practices,_by_state |half the states]] require some form of results audit.&lt;ref name="vvstates" /&gt; Typically, these states prescribe audits that check only a small flat percentage, such as 1%, of voting machines. As a result, few jurisdictions conduct audits that are rigorous or timely enough to detect and correct counting errors before election results are declared final.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.verifiedvoting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CountingVotes2012_Final_August2012.pdf Counting Votes 2012: A State by State Look at Voting Technology Preparedness]'',  Pamela Smith, Verified Voting Foundation; Michelle Mulder, Rutgers School of Law-Newark; Susannah Goodman, Common Cause Education Fund, 2012.

Hall, eds., Palgrave MacMillan, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2017, Colorado&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/22/colorado-election-audit-complete/ |title=Colorado’s first-of-its-kind election audit is complete, with all participating counties passing |last=Paul |first=Jesse |date=2017-11-22 |work=The Denver Post |access-date=2018-04-10 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the first state to implement rigorous risk-limiting audits, auditing one race in each of 50 of its 64 counties.&lt;ref name="casias"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/RLA/files/2017/SelectedContestsForThe2017RLA.XLSX |title=Audited contests in each county for 2017 RLA (XLSX) |last=Casias |first=Danny |date=2017-11-08 |website=www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/auditCenter.html |access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2018 General Election, Colorado will conduct audits in the 62 of its 64 counties that use automated vote counting equipment (the two remaining counties hand count the ballots).  [http://electls.blogs.wm.edu/2018/01/29/passing-vote-security-rise-risk-limiting-audits-rhode-island/ Rhode Island passed legislation] requiring that state's Board of Elections to implement risk-limiting audits beginning in 2018. Individual jurisdictions elsewhere may be using the method on the local election clerks' initiative. 

==Endorsements==

In 2010, the [[American Statistical Association]] endorsed methods 1 and 3, ballot comparisons and batch comparisons, as long as there is public verifiability:
*"A batch is a group of ballots (or even one ballot) for which machine and hand counts can be compared."
*"Ensuring verifiability... publishing machine counts for all batches prior to their being sampled demonstrates that the numbers that the audit checks are the same as the subtotals included in the machine-count outcome."&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;''[http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-Risk-Limiting_Endorsement.pdf Statement on Risk-limiting Auditing]'', American Statistical Association, April 2010. Accessed May 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2008 the Brennan Center for Justice and several election integrity groups endorsed methods 2 and 3, ballot polling and batch comparisons, similarly insisting on public verifiability:
*"For each selected audit unit, the audit must compare vote count subtotals from the preliminary reported election results for the contest, with hand-to-eye counts of the corresponding paper records... subtotals for each batch must be reported prior to the audit as part of the election results."
*"The public is given sufficient access to witness and verify the random selection of the audit as well as the manual count."&lt;ref name="bp" /&gt;
In 2014, the [https://bipartisanpolicy.org/the-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/ Presidential Commission on Election Administration] recommended the methods in broad terms:
*"Commission endorses both risk-limiting audits that ensure the correct winner has been determined according to a sample of votes cast, and performance audits that evaluate whether the voting technology performs as promised and expected."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/Amer-Voting-Exper-final-draft-01-09-14-508.pdf The American Voting Experience: Report and Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration]'', January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

By selecting samples of varying sizes dictated by statistical risk, risk-limiting audits eliminate the need to count all the ballots to obtain a rapid test of the outcome (that, is, who won?), while providing some level of statistical confidence. 

In 2011, the federal [[Election Assistance Commission]] initiated grants for pilot projects to test and demonstrate the method in actual elections.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/28/AUDIT%20PILOT%20FINAL%20REPORT%20TO%20EAC%20FINAL.pdf Post-Election Risk-Limiting Audit Pilot Program 2011-2013]'', Final Report to the United States Election Assistance Commission, California Secretary of State 2013. Accessed May 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

Professor Phillip Stark of the University of California at Berkeley has posted tools for the conduct of risk-limiting audits on the university's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/auditTools.htm|title=Tools for Comparison Risk-Limiting Election Audits|website=www.stat.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{uk-gov-positions}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''secretary of state''' ('''SofS''') is a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] [[Political minister|minister]] in charge of a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government department]] (though not all departments are headed by a secretary of state, e.g. [[HM Treasury]] is headed by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]). 

There are a number of secretaries of state, each formally titled "'''Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for ...'''". Legislation generally only refers to "the Secretary of State" without specifying which one; by virtue of the [[Interpretation Act 1978]] this phrase means "one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State".&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-SLD-Subdivision|1838190|Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; These positions can be created without [[primary legislation]], nowadays at the behest of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

==History==
===Kingdom of England===
{{Main|Secretary of State (England)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
In the [[Middle Ages]] the kings of [[Kingdom of England|England]] were attended by a cleric called the "king's clerk" and later "secretary", who dealt with their correspondence. Until the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], there was usually only one secretary, but under him a second appeared. In the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) these men gained the title "Secretary of State". With [[Cabinet government]] after 1688, the Secretaries of State took on higher duties. Their posts came to be known as the [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]] and the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]].  Both dealt with home affairs, but they divided foreign affairs, so that one dealt with the Protestant states of northern Europe and the other with the Roman Catholic states of southern Europe. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department ranked above the one for the Northern Department.

===After the Union===
In 1708, after [[Act of Union 1707|Union with Scotland]], a [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] was appointed, but the third secretaryship disappeared from 1742 until 1768, when a newly re-instituted third secretary began to take charge of the increasing administrative work of the [[British Empire]]. In 1782 came the new posts of [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], dealing with home affairs, and [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], dealing with foreign relations. The third secretary again disappeared, and the charge of the colonies was transferred to the [[Home Secretary]]. However, owing to the [[War of the First Coalition]] with [[France]] in 1794, a third secretary re-appeared to superintend the activities of the [[War Office|War Department]]. Seven years later, the colonial business became attached to [[Colonial Office|his Department]]. In 1854, a fourth secretary of state gained the exclusive charge of the War Department, and in 1858 a fifth secretary (for [[British Raj|India]]) began duties.

These five secretaries of state remained constant thereafter until after the first world war.  In the post-war decade, three new secretaries of state were instituted – one for the [[Royal Air Force]] was split out of the War Office; one for relations with Britain's self-governing [[Dominion]]s was carved out of the Colonial Office, and the minister responsible for Scottish affairs was raised to the level of a secretary of state.

This situation remained constant until after the [[World War II|Second World War]].  At the independence of India in 1947, the India Office and the Dominions Office were merged under a single Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.  A year before, the Secretaries for War and Air had lost their status as cabinet-level ministers, due to a reorganisation of British military command, being subordinated to a new Minister of Defence, and were finally abolished in 1964 and replaced with a new [[Secretary of State for Defence]].  A few years later, with the increasing contraction of the British Empire, the Colonial and Commonwealth Relations offices were merged, and in 1968 their responsibilities were subsumed within those of the Foreign Secretary.

By this time, however, the entire concept of a secretary of state had been largely transformed, as Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] began in 1964 the process of transforming nearly all of the various ministers and board presidents which made up the British cabinet into secretaries of state.  By the end of the twentieth century, virtually all departmental cabinet ministers were secretaries of state, with the notable exception of the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].  In contrast to the general stability of the secretaryships before the 1960s, the exact number and duties of the various secretaries of state has been very fluid, with only the Foreign and Home Secretaries, the two original secretaries of state, maintaining a consistent portfolio.

==Current positions==

{{sex differences}}

Research has examined whether or not there are '''sex differences in leadership''', and these differences can be seen from a relationship based or task based perspective. ''Leadership'' is the process through which an individual guides and motivates a group towards the achievement of common goals. In studies that found a gender difference, women adopted participative styles of leadership and were more transformational leaders than men. Other studies that found no significant gender differences in leadership exist.

Until recently, leadership positions have predominantly been held by men and men were therefore [[stereotype]]d to be more effective leaders. Women were rarely seen in senior [[leadership]] positions leading to a lack of data on how they behave in such positions.&lt;ref name="Ascited"&gt;as cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Andersen | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Hansson | first2 = P. H. | year = 2011 | title = At the end of the road? On differences between women and men in leadership behavior | url = | journal = Leadership and Organization Development Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 428–441 | doi=10.1108/01437731111146550}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, current research has found a change in trend and women have become more prevalent in the workforce over the past two decades, especially in management and leadership positions. The gender gap is decreasing and these stereotypes are changing as more women enter leadership roles.  The data from the primary literature on this topic is inconclusive as the two main lines of research contradict one another, the first being that there are small, but nevertheless significant [[Sex differences in humans|sex differences]] in leadership and the second being that gender does not have an effect on leadership.

==Studies that find gender differences==
Alice Eagly, a frontrunner in the research on gender differences in leadership, found through multiple studies that differences between men and women are small and that the overlap is considerable. Nevertheless, these small differences have statistical significance in the way men and women are perceived in leadership roles and their effectiveness in such positions, as well as their leadership styles.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;Levy, P. (2010). ''Industrial organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace'' (3rd ed.). New York: NY: Worth Publishers, p. 372-373&lt;/ref&gt;  In early studies, from the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was found that women adopted participative styles of leadership and were more transformational leaders than men who adopted more directive and transactional styles of leadership.&lt;ref name="Ascited" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;  Women in management positions tended to place more emphasis on communication, cooperation, affiliation, and [[nurture|nurturing]] than men as well as having more communal qualities.&lt;ref name="Ascited" /&gt;  Communal leadership behaviors tend to be more open, fair, pleasant and persons in these roles show responsibility. According to these studies, men were seen to be more “agentic” and be more goal and task oriented. Agentic leaders tend to be more active, task oriented, independent and focused decision makers. One of the main questions that the research has raised is if being relationship oriented or task oriented correspond to sex differences in leadership, where, women are likely to be more relationship oriented and men are likely to be more task oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forsyth|first1=Donelson|title=Group Dynamics|date=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=USA|isbn=978-0-495-59952-4|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies conducted by Trinidad and Normure in 2005, Yukl in 2002, and a study conducted by Hagberg Consulting Group in 2000 found a similar trend the leadership behaviors of men and women .  Specifically according to Yukl, women have a “feminine advantage” because they are “more adept at being inclusive, interpersonally sensitive, and nurturing."&lt;ref name="Levy_a"&gt;Levy, P. (2010). ''Industrial organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace'' (3rd ed.). New York: NY: Worth Publishers, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;  The study conducted by Hagberg Consulting Group also found women managers to be ranked higher in 42 out of 52 traits and skills measured, including teamwork,  stability, motivation, recognizing trends, and acting on new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Kinicki, A. &amp; Williams, B. (2009). ''Management: A practical introduction'' (4th ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Irwin, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend connect more with their group members by exhibiting behaviors such as smiling more, maintaining eye, and are more diplomatic with their comments &lt;ref name="Group Dynamics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forsyth|first1=Donelson|title=Group Dynamics|date=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=USA|isbn=978-0-495-59952-4|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Forsyth, 2010). The differences between men and women may suggest evolutionary stressors that have contributed to the development of these relationship and task oriented tendencies between men and women.&lt;ref name="Group Dynamics"/&gt; Another explanation, proposed by Eagly and Carli (2007), attributes many of these findings not to average gender differences per se, but to a "selection effect" caused by gender bias and discrimination against women, whereby easier standards for men in attaining leadership positions as well as the fact that men make up the majority of executives results in a higher average of exceptionally skilled women than men in some leader roles.&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A. &amp; Carli, L. (2007). ''Through the labyrinth: the truth about how women become leaders.'' Boston, MA:  Harvard Business School Press., p. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend to feel more excluded from career related and informal interactions with the senior management compared to men. In fact, the term "glass ceiling" can be used to describe the hindrance women face in career advancement to top management positions.&lt;ref name="Group Dynamics"/&gt; The tendency of men to dominate women in informal discussion groups has been observed in a number of scenarios including when both sexes were deemed to be androgynous, when group members were committed to equality of sexes, when women were more dispositionally dominant than men, and when both sexes were extroverted. Furthermore, it has been observed that the dispositionally dominant person is more likely to emerge as a leader in same-sex dyads, but in mixed-dyads, the dominant male is more likely to emerge as leader compared to a dominant female.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forsyth|first1=Donelson|title=Group Dynamics|date=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage|location=USA|isbn=978-0-495-59952-4|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar study conducted by the Management Research Group of 17,491 questionnaires found that out of common leadership competency areas surveyed, women were rated higher by their superiors in areas like credibility with management, future potential, insight, sensitivity, and working with diverse people. Men were ranked higher in business aptitude, financial understanding, and strategic planning, which the researchers note are seen to be critical to corporate advancement. No gender differences were found in competencies such as team performance, effective thinking, and willingness to listen and no differences were found in overall effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrg.com/uploads/PDFs/Glass_Ceiling_Revisited_2012.pdf |title=The Glass Ceiling Revisited: Gender and Perceptions of Competency (2013) |publisher=Management Research Group |format=PDF |accessdate=20 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these studies on gender differences in leadership style rely on leader-only self-report data, which many leadership scholars describe as unreliable at best.&lt;ref&gt;Hamori-Ota, V. E. (2007) ''Gender differences in leadership style: Predictors of level of agreement between leader self-ratings and supervisory ratings, peer ratings, and ratings by direct reports.'' University of Michigan, pp 288.&lt;/ref&gt; These sex differences are only trends and may not be seen across all groups and situations. It would be very difficult to determine how men and women would behave once they become leaders. Additionally, though relationship orientation in women and agentic orientation in men has been observed in laboratory settings, they have not been seen in studies conducted in organizational settings &lt;ref name="Group Dynamics"/&gt;

==Differences in perception==
When studying perception and effectiveness of men and women in leadership, in multiple studies, it was  found that men and women are perceived better by subordinates and are seen as more effective leaders when in positions in accordance to traditional gender roles.  In a study conducted in 1990, it was found that women “lose authority... if they employ feminine styles of leadership in male-dominated roles."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, P. (2010). ''Industrial organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace'' (3rd ed.). New York: NY: Worth Publishers, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis conducted later yielded similar results in which men and women are both perceived as more effective leaders in stereotypical roles and both are found ineffective in non-traditional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, P. (2010). ''Industrial organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace'' (3rd ed.). New York: NY: Worth Publishers, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; Female leaders are perceived as less dominant than male leaders by their subordinates. Furthermore, a single male in a group is more likely to assume leadership than a single female in a group, who is likely to have less influence over the group members. Members of the group are more likely to agree with a male leader when power is exerted than a female leader.&lt;ref name="Group Dynamics"/&gt; However, in a study conducted by Shelby et al. (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosette|first1=Ashleigh|last2=Tost|first2=Leigh|title=Agentic Women and Communal Leadership: How Role Prescriptions Confer Advantage to Top Women Leaders|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2010|volume=95|issue=2|pages=221–35|url=http://users.phhp.ufl.edu/lwaxenbe/Leadership/Agentic%20women%20and%20communal%20leadership.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0018204|pmid=20230065}}&lt;/ref&gt; female leadership advantage was investigated by specifying contextual factors that moderate the likelihood that such an advantage would emerge. These authors considered if female gender role and the leader role were incongruent and led to a disadvantage or if instead, an advantage. They conducted two studies and found that only when success was seen as internal that top women leaders were considered more agentic and more communal than top men leaders. They also found that the effect on agentic attributes were mediated by perceptions of double standards, while communal traits were mediated by expectations of feminized management skills. This particular study showed the presence of qualified female leader advantage.

Even though women exhibit many effective leadership qualities in some studies, men still assume far more leadership positions and are more likely to be seen as leaders &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Studies that do not find gender differences==
In contradiction to Eagly’s findings of gender differences in leadership, multiple studies have also claimed that there are no significant differences and that both men and women can and will have differing and similar styles of leadership.

As recent as 2011, Andersen and Hansson conducted a study to determine if there were significant differences in leadership behaviors as claimed by previous studies and authors.  Andersen and Hansen studied public managers on leadership styles, decision-making styles, and motivation profiles and found that the only differences were in decision-making styles, but none were great enough to be considered significant.&lt;ref name="Ascited"/&gt;

Additionally, in a 2010 study, men and women leaders in a large German sample were found to be the same with respect to transformational leadership behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kent | first1 = T. W. | last2 = Schuele | first2 = U. | year = 2010 | title = Gender Differences and Transformational Leadership Behavior: Do Both German Men and Women Lead in the Same Way?. | url = | journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 52–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff (2005) studied male and female business owners, who are free to manage as they see fit, as opposed to middle managers who are more constrained, and found that no significant differences exist in men and women's leadership behavior. According to the researchers, the findings "challenge the gender-stereotypic argument that a leader's sex plays an important role when it comes to organizational design and management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cliff | first1 = J. E. | doi = 10.1177/0170840605046490 | title = Walking the Talk? Gendered Rhetoric vs. Action in Small Firms | journal = Organization Studies | volume = 26 | pages = 63–91 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar study Dobbins and Platz (1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobbins|first1=Gregory|last2=Platz|first2=Stephanie|title=Sex Differences in Leadership: How Real Are They?|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=January 1986|volume=11|issue=1|pages=118–27|url=http://amr.aom.org/content/11/1/118.short|doi=10.5465/amr.1986.4282639}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that even men and women show equal amounts of relationship orientation and task orientation and have equally satisfied subordinates. Even though male leaders are rated as more effective than female leaders, these findings are based on laboratory research and may not hold in organizational settings.

These studies correlate with other research cited by Vecchio (2002), Dobbins and Platt (1986), Gibson (1995), and van Engen et al. (2001), who all argue that no significant gender differences in leadership exist.&lt;ref name="Ascited" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy_a" /&gt;

==Preference for a boss==
Women and men have been surveyed by Gallup each year concerning workplace topics, and when questioned about preferences of a female boss or a male boss, women chose a preference for a male boss 39% of the time, compared to 26% of men displaying preference for a male boss.  Only 27% of females would prefer a boss of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallup.com/poll/178484/americans-prefer-male-boss-female-boss.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-16/women-dislike-having-female-bosses-more-than-men-do&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference, among both sexes, for male leadership in the workplace has continued unabated for sixty years, according to the survey results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4922">'''Shifta''' ([[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]]: ሽፍታ, or "shufta") is term used in [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Somalia]] for ''[[Rebellion|rebel]]'', ''[[outlaw]]'', or ''[[bandit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/about/projects/womrep/General-73.htm#P1346_327642 |title=Somali Refugees in Kenya |accessdate=2007-03-29 |format= |work=Human Rights Watch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316084627/http://www.hrw.org/about/projects/womrep/General-73.htm#P1346_327642 |archivedate=2007-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.brunel.ac.uk/gate/entertext/4_2/crummey.pdf |format=PDF |title=African Banditry Revisted |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811213428/http://arts.brunel.ac.uk/gate/entertext/4_2/crummey.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from ''shúfto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hamilton |first= David   |author2=Shinn, Thomas P. Ofcansky, Chris Prouty |title= [[Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia]] |publisher= [[Scarecrow Pres]] | date=September 2004 |isbn=9780810849105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_701709848/shifta.html shifta Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030545/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_701709848/shifta.html |date=2008-04-11 }}, [[Encarta]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, shifta served as local militia in the lawless rural mountainous regions on the [[Horn of Africa]]. The word shifta can be translated as 'bandit' or 'outlaw', but can include anyone who rebels against an authority or an institution that is seen as illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/ethiopia/Hunt-for-tourists-moves-to.3351416.jp |title=Hunt for tourists moves to Eritrea |accessdate=2007-03-29 |format= |work=Scotland on Sunday }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Concepts==
The term shifta has positive and negative connotations, that of a common bandit and that of a revolutionary; both concepts being distinct but not necessarily mutually exclusive. They are often considered as highly respected, politically minded outlaws struggling for social order or a political cause. When applied in this context, ''shiftinnet'' (being a shifta) in its diverse forms has a social function as a form of [[conflict resolution]].

In Eritrea during the British administration, military units were used to police the lawless areas and stop common shifta activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Shifta.html |title=Battling the Shifta in Eritrea |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209005156/http://britains-smallwars.com/RRGP/Shifta.html |archivedate=2007-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.farmersboys.com/Battle_Honours/eritrea.htm |title=THE ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGIMENT THE LAST TWELVE YEARS |accessdate=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Ethiopia, individuals who started as shifta have risen to the level of warlord or Emperor thus legitimizing the concept of shifta itself. Two nineteenth-century shiftas, [[Kassa Hailu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |author=Jon Abbink |author2=Mirjam de Bruijn, Klaas van Walraven |editor= |others= |title=Rethinking Resistance: revolt and violence in African history |origdate= |origyear=2003 |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |location= |language= |isbn=90-04-12624-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=95–96 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gondar]] and [[Kassai Mircha]] of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], became respectively, [[Tewodros II|Emperor Tewodros]] and [[Yohannes IV|Emperor Yohannes]] in the later 19th century. Thus the shiftas formed the military elite and became the core of the resistance, using their military skills against the Italians. 

A shifta, however, whose acts surpassed social norms would be called ''t'era-shifta'' and would be regarded as a thief or bandit. The Italians labelled all shiftas as t'era-shiftas, of the criminal type.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Nevertheless, to be described as a shifta, especially during the [[Italian East Africa|Italian occupation]], was an honour for an Ethiopian and this was how resistance started and spread. 

Both [[Isaias Afewerki]] of Eritrea and [[Meles Zenawi]] of Ethiopia were called shifta when they served respectively as rebel leaders of the [[EPLF]] and [[TPLF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Abbink |first= Jon |author2=Mirjam de Bruijn, Klaas van Walraven |title= [[Rethinking Resistance: Revolt and Violence in African History]] |publisher= Brill Academic Publishers | date=September 2003 |isbn= 9789004126244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subversive activities registration''' is sometimes required by [[government]]s.

==Registration in the United States==
{{UnitedStatesCode|18|2386}}, requires the [[wikt:registration|registration]] of any private group engaged in "[[civilian]] [[Militia|military]] activity" or in "[[Activism|political activity]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sec. 2386.

The [[statute]] requires that such groups provide [[Information#As records|detailed information]] on their [[Leadership|leaders]], [[Meeting|meeting places]], [[asset]]s, [[publication]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES v.

'''''The Immobile Empire''''' is the English translation of ''L'empire Immobile, Ou, Le Choc Des Mondes: Récit Historique'', a book of history published in French 1989 by the French politician and writer [[Alain Peyrefitte]] and translated into English in 1992. The book gives a sweeping narrative of the British [[Macartney Embassy|Embassy of Sir George Macartney]] to the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of China in 1793. Published originally in French, the book  was then translated into English, Chinese, Dutch, and Portuguese. Peyrefitte contends that the frustration of the mission and the stand off in relations between Great Britain and China over diplomatic and audience ritual was caused by the ignorant intransigence and cultural conceit of the imperial court. The empire was "immobile" because these attitudes stifled China's natural creativity and kept it bureaucratic, static, and feeble over the following century and a half.

In doing the research for the book, Peyrefitte used his official connections to gain then unprecedented access to archives in Beijing's [[Palace Museum]] and organized a team of researchers to explore them. They found documents concerning the mission, some of which had not been opened since the 1790s, and translated a collection of them.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Peyrefitte, Jean-Paul Desroches, ''Un Choc De Cultures''. Paris: Fayard,  1998. 2 vols {{ISBN|2-213-02341-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and debate==
The book was widely reviewed, and eventually came out in 36 editions between 1989 and 2007 in 7 languages  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-n50-940 WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; The
range of opinions in the major reviews reflect differences over how to interpret China's relations with the west over the last two centuries, particularly attitudes toward globalization and empire. Jane Kate Leonard writing in the [[American Historical Review]] was critical, concluding that the book was "a pretentious and undigested work of limited antiquarian interest."&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kate Leonard, "REVIEW: The Immobile Empire, by Peyrefitte, Alain," ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' 98.5 (1993):  1661-1662.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/2167196&lt;/ref&gt; The review also contends that Peyrefitte's work does not add to earlier scholarship by J.L. Cranmer-Byng and [[Earl H. Pritchard]].  The [[University of Chicago]] historian James L. Hevia published a revisionist study which specifically argued that Peyrefitte and others of the "free trade" interpretation overemphasized economic motives and suggested instead that the British and the Manchu empires both were expanding and both were as much concerned with "ritual" (in the sense of cultural forms) as with profits as such.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Hevia. ''Cherishing Men from Afar: Qing Guest Ritual and the Macartney Embassy of 1793''. Durham, NC;  London: Duke University Press,  1995.  ISBN ), p. 57 n. 1, 242.

Elman]] commented that Peyrefitte painted a "dark picture" of China and recommended that readers consult other works as a corrective.&lt;ref&gt;''A Cultural History of Modern Science in China'' (Harvard University Press, 2009), p. 244 n. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SDd-A_uZmCYC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Immobile+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HNzRTo_VCMrUgQfqiLi7DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Immobile%20empire&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union of the Baltic Cities''' (''UBC'') is a voluntary, proactive network mobilizing the shared potential of over 100 member cities for democratic, economic, social, cultural and environmentally sustainable development of the [[Baltic Sea]] region.

== Origins ==
The Union of the Baltic Cities was founded in Gdańsk, Poland in September 1991, by 32 cities, with the aim of developing cooperation and exchange between its member cities. Inspired in part by the historic example of the [[Hanseatic League]]&lt;ref&gt;Leif Beck Fallesen, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-15583575.html "Urban Ambassadors"], ''The WorldPaper'', July 22, 1998 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported by the [[European Union]]'s [[Interreg]] programs to stimulate regional cooperation within the EU, it was one of the first formal institutions established to bolster the Baltic as a cohesive region within Europe. The city of [[Kalmar]] in Sweden took the initiative in founding the organization, but Gdańsk was chosen as the organization's headquarters to emphasize the desire to break down historic barriers between Western and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tassilo Herrschel and Peter Newman,

The '''United States Constitution''' is the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|2010|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution]], comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], whereby the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] is divided into three branches: the [[United States Congress|legislative]], consisting of the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]]; the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive]], consisting of the [[President of the United States|President]]; and the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|judicial]], consisting of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and other federal courts. Articles [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Four]], [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Five]] and [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Six]] embody concepts of [[federalism]], describing the rights and responsibilities of [[State governments of the United States|state governments]], the [[U.S. state|states]] in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. [[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article Seven]] establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen [[U.S. state|States]] to [[Ratification|ratify]] it. It is regarded as the oldest written and codified national constitution in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2014/sep/22/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-us-has-oldest-working-national-cons/ Goodlatte says U.S. has the oldest working national constitution], Politifact Virginia website, September 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|History of the United States Constitution}}

===First government===
From September 5, 1774, to March 1, 1781, the [[Continental Congress]] functioned as the [[provisional government]] of the United States. Delegates to the First (1774) and then the Second (1775–1781) Continental Congress were chosen largely through the action of [[Committee of correspondence|committees of correspondence]] in various colonies rather than through the colonial or later state legislatures.  In no formal sense was it a gathering representative of existing colonial governments; it represented the dissatisfied elements of the people, such persons as were sufficiently interested to act, despite the strenuous opposition of the loyalists and the obstruction or disfavor of colonial governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLaughlin |first1=Andrew C. |title=A constitutional History of the United States |url=http://www.constitution.org/cmt/mclaughlin/chus.htm |publisher=D. Appleton-Century Company |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |location=New York, London |pages=83–90 |year=1936 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916051358/http://www.constitution.org/cmt/mclaughlin/chus.htm |archivedate=September 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of selecting the delegates for the First and Second Continental Congresses underscores the revolutionary role of the people of the colonies in establishing a central governing body. Endowed by the people collectively, the Continental Congress alone possessed those attributes of external sovereignty which entitled it to be called a state in the international sense, while the separate states, exercising a limited or internal sovereignty, may rightly be considered a creation of the Continental Congress, which preceded them and brought them into being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last= Morris |first= Richard B. |url= http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/presidential-addresses/richard-b-morris |title= Presidential Address |publisher= American Historical Association |date= December 28, 1976 |accessdate= June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Articles of Confederation ===
{{Main|Articles of Confederation}}
The [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] was the first constitution of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Christian G. |last= Fritz |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA168 |title= American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |date= 2008 |page= 131 |isbn= 978-0-521-88188-3 |postscript= ;}} noting that "Madison, along with other Americans clearly understood" the Articles of Confederation "to be the first federal Constitution".&lt;/ref&gt; It was drafted by the Second Continental Congress from mid-1776 through late 1777, and ratification by all 13 states was completed by early 1781. Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was quite limited.  The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers.  Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jensen |first= Merrill |title= The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781–1789 |year= 1950 |location= Boston |publisher= Northeastern University Press |isbn= 978-0-930350-14-7 |pages= 177–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, in a way, the Congressional powers in Article 9 made the "league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wood |first= Gordon S. |title= The Creation of the American Republic, 1776–1787 |year= 1972 |location= Chapel Hill |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |isbn= 978-0-807-84723-7 |page= 359}}&lt;/ref&gt; the chief problem was, in the words of [[George Washington]], "no money".&lt;ref name=maier11-13&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|2010|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Continental Congress could print money but the currency was worthless.  (A popular phrase of the times called a useless object or person ''...&amp;nbsp;not worth a Continental'', referring to the Continental dollar.)  Congress could borrow money, but couldn't pay it back.&lt;ref name=maier11-13/&gt; No state paid all their U.S. taxes; some paid nothing.  Some few paid an amount equal to interest on the national debt owed to their citizens, but no more.&lt;ref name=maier11-13/&gt; No interest was paid on debt owed foreign governments. By 1786, the United States would default on outstanding debts as their dates came due.&lt;ref name=maier11-13/&gt;

Internationally, the Articles of Confederation did little to enhance the United States' ability to defend its sovereignty.  Most of the troops in the 625-man United States Army were deployed facing&amp;nbsp;– but not threatening&amp;nbsp;– British forts on American soil.  They had not been paid; some were deserting and others threatening mutiny.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=12–13, 19}} [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spain]] closed [[New Orleans]] to American commerce; U.S. officials protested, but to no effect. [[Barbary pirates]] began seizing American ships of commerce; the Treasury had no funds to pay their ransom.  If any military crisis required action, the Congress had no credit or taxing power to finance a response.&lt;ref name=maier11-13/&gt;

Domestically, the Articles of Confederation was failing to bring unity to the diverse sentiments and interests of the various states.  Although the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] was signed between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the U.S., and named each of the American states, various individual states proceeded blithely to violate it.  New York and South Carolina repeatedly prosecuted [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] for wartime activity and redistributed their lands.&lt;ref name=maier11-13/&gt;  Individual state legislatures independently laid embargoes, negotiated directly with foreign authorities, raised armies, and made war, all violating the letter and the spirit of the Articles.

In September 1786, during an [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|inter–state convention]] to discuss and develop a consensus about reversing the protectionist trade barriers that each state had erected, [[James Madison]] angrily questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a binding compact or even a viable government. Connecticut paid nothing and "positively refused" to pay U.S. assessments for two years.{{sfn|Bowen|2010|pp=129–130}} A rumor had it that a "[[Sedition|seditious]] party" of New York legislators had opened a conversation with the [[Governor General of Canada|Viceroy of Canada]]. To the south, the British were said to be openly funding [[Muscogee|Creek]] Indian raids on white settlers in Georgia and adjacent territory. Savannah (then-capital of Georgia) had been fortified, and the state of Georgia was under [[martial law]].{{sfn|Bowen|2010|p=31}} Additionally, during [[Shays' Rebellion]] (August 1786 – June 1787) in Massachusetts, Congress could provide no money to support an endangered constituent state.  General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] was obliged to raise funds from Boston merchants to pay for a volunteer army.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=15–16}}

Congress was paralyzed. It could do nothing significant without nine states, and some legislation required all thirteen. When a state produced only one member in attendance, its vote was not counted. If a state's delegation were evenly divided, its vote could not be counted towards the nine-count requirement.{{sfn|Maier|2010|p=13}} The Articles Congress had "virtually ceased trying to govern".{{sfn|Wood|1998|pp=356–367, 359}} The vision of a "respectable nation" among nations seemed to be fading in the eyes of revolutionaries such as [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Rufus King]]. Their dream of a [[republic]], a nation without hereditary rulers, with power derived from the people in frequent elections, was in doubt.{{sfn|Maier|2010|pp=14, 30, 66}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Dawes|Dawes, Thomas]].  ''An Oration, Delivered July 4, 1787, at the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston, in Celebration of the Anniversary of American Independence,'' pp.15-19, printed by Samuel Hall, Boston, 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 1787, the Confederation Congress called a convention of state delegates at Philadelphia to propose a plan of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a7s1.html |title= Resolution of Congress, 21 Feb. 1787 |work= The Founders' Constitution |publisher= University of Chicago Press |postscript= ;}} The Articles Congress thus echoed a previous resolution of a conference at Annapolis; see {{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/annapoli.asp |title= Proceedings of Commissioners to Remedy Defects of the Federal Government: 1786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier attempts, the convention was not meant for new laws or piecemeal alterations, but for the "sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation". The convention was not limited to commerce; rather, it was intended to "render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the Union." The proposal might take effect when approved by Congress and the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|2010|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|[[Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States|Signing the Constitution]], September 17, 1787]]

On the appointed day, May 14, 1787, only the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations were present, and so the convention's opening meeting was postponed for lack of a quorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|2010|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quorum of seven states met and deliberations began on May 25. Eventually twelve states were represented; 74 delegates were named, 55 attended and 39 signed.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_founding_fathers.html|title=America's Founding Fathers-Delegates to the Constitutional Convention|publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates were generally convinced that an effective central government with a wide range of enforceable powers must replace the weaker Congress established by the Articles of Confederation. 

Two plans for structuring the federal government arose at the convention's outset:
* The [[Virginia Plan]] (also known as the ''Large State Plan'' or the ''Randolph Plan'') proposed that the legislative department of the national government be composed of a [[Bicameralism|Bicameral]] Congress, with both chambers elected with apportionment according to population. Generally favoring the most highly populated states, it used the philosophy of [[John Locke]] to rely on consent of the governed, [[Montesquieu]] for divided government, and [[Edward Coke]] to emphasize [[Civil liberties in the United States|civil liberties.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/vatexta.asp|title=Variant Texts of the Virginia Plan, Presented by Edmund Randolph to the Federal Convention|publisher=The [[Avalon Project]] at Yale Law School|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[New Jersey Plan]] proposed that the legislative department be a [[unicameral]] body with one vote per state. Generally favoring the less-populous states, it used the philosophy of English [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] such as [[Edmund Burke]] to rely on received procedure and [[William Blackstone]] to emphasize sovereignty of the legislature. This position reflected the belief that the states were independent entities and, as they entered the United States of America freely and individually, remained so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_615.asp#1|title=The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 reported by James Madison : on June 15|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, the Convention devolved into a "[[Committee of the whole#United States|Committee of the Whole]]" to consider the Virginia Plan.  On June 13, the Virginia resolutions in amended form were reported out of committee.  The New Jersey plan was put forward in response to the Virginia Plan.

A "Committee of Eleven" (one delegate from each state represented) met from July 2 to 16&lt;ref name=committeest&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee Assignments Chart and Commentary|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/convention/delegates/committee_table/|publisher=TeachingAmericanHistory.org|accessdate=April 16, 2016|location=Ashland, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; to work out a compromise on the issue of representation in the federal legislature. All agreed to a republican form of government grounded in representing the people in the states. For the legislature, two issues were to be decided: how the votes were to be allocated among the states in the Congress, and how the representatives should be elected. In its report, now known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]] (or "Great Compromise"), the committee proposed proportional representation for seats in the House of Representatives based on population (with the people voting for representatives), and equal representation for each State in the Senate (with each state's legislators generally choosing their respective senators), and that all money bills would originate in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_716.asp|title=Madison Debates July 16|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Compromise ended the stalemate between "patriots" and "nationalists", leading to numerous other compromises in a spirit of accommodation. There were sectional interests to be balanced by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]; reconciliation on Presidential term, powers, and method of selection; and jurisdiction of the federal judiciary.

On July 24, a "[[Committee of Detail]]"&amp;nbsp;– [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina), [[Edmund Randolph]] (Virginia), [[Nathaniel Gorham]] (Massachusetts), [[Oliver Ellsworth]] (Connecticut), and [[James Wilson]] (Pennsylvania)&amp;nbsp;– was elected to draft a detailed constitution reflective of the Resolutions passed by the convention up to that point.&lt;ref name=CCCs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constcmte.html|title=Committees at the Constitutional Convention|publisher=U.S. Constitution Online|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention recessed from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of this "[[Committee of Detail]]". Overall, the report of the committee conformed to the resolutions adopted by the Convention, adding some elements. A twenty-three article (plus preamble) constitution was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_915.asp|title=Madison Debates August 6|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 6 to September 10, the report of the committee of detail was discussed, section by section and clause by clause. Details were attended to, and further compromises were effected.&lt;ref name=committeest/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCCs/&gt; Toward the close of these discussions, on September 8, a "Committee of Style and Arrangement"&amp;nbsp;– [[Alexander Hamilton]] (New York), [[William Samuel Johnson]] (Connecticut), [[Rufus King]] (Massachusetts), James Madison (Virginia), and [[Gouverneur Morris]] (Pennsylvania)&amp;nbsp;– was appointed to distill a final draft constitution from the twenty-three approved articles.&lt;ref name=CCCs/&gt; The final draft, presented to the convention on September 12, contained seven articles, a [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|preamble]] and a [[eschatocol|closing endorsement]], of which Morris was the primary author.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;  The committee also presented a proposed letter to accompany the constitution when delivered to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_915.asp|title=Madison Debates September 12|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final document, [[Western calligraphy|engrossed]] by [[Jacob Shallus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vile|first1=John R.|title=The Constitutional Convention of 1787: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of America's Founding (Volume 1: A-M)|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-669-8|page=705|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyFpDS8p33sC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;dq=Jacob+Shallus#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacob%20Shallus&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were disappointed in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, [[Benjamin Franklin]] summed up, addressing the Convention: "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them." He would accept the Constitution, "because I expect no better and because I am not sure that it is not the best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_915.asp|title=Madison Debates September 15|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the Constitution were anxious to obtain unanimous support of all twelve states represented in the Convention. Their accepted formula for the closing endorsement was "Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the States present." At the end of the convention, the proposal was agreed to by eleven state delegations and the lone remaining delegate from New York, Alexander Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/appa.htm|title = Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution|id=CMH Pub 71-25|chapter = Appendix A: The Annapolis Convention|page=264|lccn= 87001353|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=United States Army Center of Military History|first1 =Robert K.|last1=Wright Jr.|first2= Morris J.|last2=MacGregor Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1788 ratification ===

{{Further|History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution}}
[[File:Dates US Constitution ratified by the 13 States.png|thumb|Dates the 13 states ratified the Constitution]]
Transmitted to the [[Congress of the Confederation]], then sitting in New York City, it was within the power of Congress to expedite or block ratification of the proposed Constitution. The new frame of government that the Philadelphia Convention presented was technically only a revision of the Articles of Confederation. After several days of debate, Congress voted to transmit the document to the thirteen states for [[ratification]] according to the process outlined in its [[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article VII]].  Each state legislature was to call elections for a "Federal Convention" to ratify the new Constitution, rather than consider ratification itself; a departure from the constitutional practice of the time, designed to expand the [[Suffrage|franchise]] in order to more clearly embrace "the people".  The frame of government itself was to [[Coming into force|go into force]] among the States so acting upon the approval of nine (i.e. two-thirds of the 13) states; also a departure from constitutional practice, as the [[Articles of Confederation]] could only be amended by unanimous vote of all the states.

Three members of the Convention&amp;nbsp;– [[James Madison|Madison]], [[Nathaniel Gorham|Gorham]], and [[Rufus King|King]]&amp;nbsp;– were also Members of Congress. They proceeded at once to New York, where Congress was in session, to placate the expected opposition. Aware of their vanishing authority, Congress, on September 28, after some debate, resolved unanimously to submit the Constitution to the States for action, "in conformity to the resolves of the Convention",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ressub02.asp|title=Resolution of Congress of September 28, 1787, Submitting the Constitution to the Several States|publisher=The [[Avalon Project]] at Yale Law School|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with no recommendation either for or against its adoption.

Two parties soon developed, one in opposition, the [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]], and one in support, the [[Federalist#United States|Federalists]], of the Constitution; and the Constitution was debated, criticized, and expounded upon clause by clause. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]], [[James Madison|Madison]], and [[John Jay|Jay]], under the name of [[The Federalist Papers#Origins|Publius]], wrote a series of commentaries, now known as ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', in support of ratification in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], at that time a hotbed of anti-Federalism.  These commentaries on the Constitution, written during the struggle for ratification, have been frequently cited by the Supreme Court as an authoritative contemporary interpretation of the meaning of its provisions.  The dispute over additional powers for the central government was close, and in some states ratification was effected only after a bitter struggle in the state convention itself.

On June 21, 1788, the constitution had been ratified by the minimum of nine states required under Article VII.  Towards the end of July, and with eleven states then having ratified, the process of organizing the new government began.  The Continental Congress, which still functioned at irregular intervals, passed a resolution on September 13, 1788, to put the new Constitution into operation with the eleven states that had then ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu01.asp

|}
Several ideas in the Constitution were new. These were associated with the combination of consolidated government along with federal relationships with constituent states.

The [[Due Process Clause]] of the Constitution was partly based on [[common law]] and on [[Magna Carta]] (1215), which had become a foundation of English liberty against arbitrary power wielded by a ruler.

Among the most prominent political theorists of the late eighteenth century were [[William Blackstone]], [[John Locke]], and [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=John F.|date=2011 |title=Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=1939–2039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the influence of [[Edward Coke]] and William Blackstone were evident at the Convention. In his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', Edward Coke interpreted Magna Carta protections and rights to apply not just to nobles, but to all British subjects. In writing the [[London Company|Virginia Charter of 1606]], he enabled the King in Parliament to give those to be born in the colonies all rights and liberties as though they were born in England. William Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' were the most influential books on law in the new republic.

British political philosopher John Locke following the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) was a major influence expanding on the contract theory of government advanced by [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Locke advanced the principle of [[consent of the governed]] in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Government's duty under a [[social contract]] among the sovereign people was to serve the people by protecting their rights. These basic rights were [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness#Lockean roots hypothesis|life, liberty and property]].

Montesquieu's influence on the framers is evident in Madison's [[Federalist No. 47]] and Hamilton's [[Federalist No. 78]]. Jefferson, Adams, and Mason were known to read Montesquieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=William Seal |date=1928 |title=The Separation of Powers in the Eighteenth Century |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=32–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justices]], the ultimate interpreters of the Constitution, have cited to Montesquieu throughout the Court's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalejreg.com/nc/d-c-circuit-review-reviewed-the-baron-montesquieu-by-aaron-nielson/|first=Aaron|last=Nielson|title=D.C. Circuit Reviewed: The Baron Montesquieu|date=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See, ''e.g.'', {{cite court |litigants=Green v. Biddle |vol=21 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=1|pinpoint=1, 36 |date=1823}}{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Peterson |vol=136 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=1310 |pinpoint=1330|date=2016}})  Montesquieu emphasized the need for balanced forces pushing against each other to prevent tyranny (reflecting the influence of [[Polybius]]'s 2nd century BC treatise on the [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] of the [[Roman Republic]]). In his ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', Montesquieu argues that the separation of state powers should be by its service to the people's liberty: legislative, executive and judicial.

A substantial body of thought had been developed from the literature of [[republicanism in the United States]], including work by [[John Adams]] and applied to the creation of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]].

The constitution was a federal one, and was influenced by the study of other federations, both ancient and extant. 
 
The [[United States Bill of Rights]] consists of 10 amendments added to the Constitution in 1791, as supporters of the Constitution had promised critics during the debates of 1788.&lt;ref name="National Archive Article on the Bill of Rights"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=National Archives Article on the Bill of Rights|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights (1689)]] was an inspiration for the American Bill of Rights. Both require [[jury trial]]s, contain a [[right to keep and bear arms]], prohibit excessive [[bail]] and forbid [[cruel and unusual punishment|"cruel and unusual punishments".]] Many liberties protected by state constitutions and the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] were incorporated into the Bill of Rights.

==Original frame==
[[File:Constitution.ogg|alt=Reading of the Constitution |thumb|left|Reading of the Original United States Constitution, 1787 ]]
Neither the Convention which drafted the Constitution, nor the Congress which sent it to the thirteen states for ratification in the autumn of 1787, gave it a lead caption. To fill this void, the document was most often titled "A frame of Government" when it was printed for the convenience of ratifying conventions and the information of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States and Amendments Thereto|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government|page=i (of foreword)|editor-first= James J. |editor-last= Kilpatrick|others=Foreword by Denys P. Myers}}{{Full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''Frame of Government'' consisted of a preamble, seven articles and a signed closing endorsement.

===Preamble===
[[File:Constitution We the People.jpg|thumb|right|"We the People" in an original edition]]
The [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|preamble]] to the Constitution serves as an [[Preamble|introductory statement]] of the document's fundamental purposes and guiding principles. It neither assigns powers to the federal government,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]]'', 197 U.S. 11, 22 (1905) ("Although th[e] preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the government of the United States, or on any of its departments."); ''see also United States v. Boyer'', 85 F. 425, 430–31 (W.D. Mo. 1898) ("The preamble never can be resorted to, to enlarge the powers confided to the general government, or any of its departments. It cannot confer any power ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. It can never amount, by implication, to an enlargement of any power expressly given. It can never be the legitimate source of any implied power, when otherwise withdrawn from the constitution. Its true office is to expound the nature and extent and application of the powers actually conferred by the constitution, and not substantively to create them." (quoting 1 JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES § 462 (1833)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it place specific limitations on government action. Rather, it sets out the origin, scope and purpose of the Constitution. Its origin and authority is in "We, the people of the United States". This echoes the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. "One people" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, "to form a more perfect Union" than had previously existed in the "perpetual Union" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to "secure the blessings of liberty", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, "our posterity".{{sfn|Adler|Gorman|1975|p=26, 80, 136}}

===Article One===
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] describes the [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the federal government. Section 1, reads, "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]." The article establishes the manner of [[Elections in the United States|election]] and the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a citizen of the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature. Financially, Congress has the power to tax, borrow, pay debt and provide for the common defense and the general welfare; to regulate commerce, bankruptcies, and coin money. To regulate internal affairs, it has the power to regulate and govern military forces and militias, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. It is to provide for naturalization, standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads, and patents; to directly govern the federal district and cessions of land by the states for forts and arsenals. Internationally, Congress has the power to define and punish piracies and offenses against the Law of Nations, to declare war and make rules of war. The final [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], also known as the Elastic Clause, expressly confers incidental powers upon Congress without the Articles' requirement for express delegation for each and every power. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]] lists eight specific limits on congressional power.

The Supreme Court has sometimes broadly interpreted the [[Commerce Clause]] and the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly allowed by the [[enumerated powers]] nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Supreme Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that would "enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most beneficial to the people",&lt;ref name="17US421"&gt;17. U.S. at 421&lt;/ref&gt; even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] clarified: "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional."&lt;ref name="17US421" /&gt;

===Article Two===
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The President is head of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], as well as the nation's [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Article two is modified by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] which tacitly acknowledges political parties, and the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] relating to office succession. The president is to receive only one compensation from the federal government. The inaugural oath is specified to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.

The president is the [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and state militias when they are mobilized. He or she makes treaties with the [[Advice and Consent Clause|advice and consent]] of a two-thirds quorum of the Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the federal government as Congress directs; he or she may require the opinions of its principal officers and make "[[recess appointments]]" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president is to see that the laws are faithfully executed, though he or she may grant reprieves and pardons except regarding Congressional [[impeachment]] of himself or other federal officers. The president reports to Congress on the [[State of the Union]], and by the [[Recommendation Clause]], recommends "necessary and expedient" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress under special circumstances.

Section 4 provides for removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is removed on [[impeachment]] for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

===Article Three===
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] describes the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|court system]] (the [[judiciary|judicial branch]]), including the Supreme Court. There shall be one court called the Supreme Court. The article describes the kinds of cases the court takes as [[original jurisdiction]]. Congress can create lower courts and an appeals process. Congress enacts law defining crimes and providing for punishment. Article Three also protects the right to [[jury trial|trial by jury]] in all [[criminal law|criminal cases]], and defines the crime of [[treason]].

Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, and with it, the authority to interpret and apply the law to a particular case. Also included is the power to punish, sentence, and direct future action to resolve conflicts. The Constitution outlines the U.S. judicial system. In the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], Congress began to fill in details. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}} describes judicial powers and administration.

As of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from the [[United States district court|district courts]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] established six Supreme Court justices. The number was periodically increased, reaching ten in 1863, allowing Lincoln additional appointments. After the Civil War, vacancies reduced the number to seven. Congress finally fixed the number at nine.}} In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have [[original jurisdiction]]. Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with [[exclusive jurisdiction]] heard regional appeals before consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds [[discretionary jurisdiction]], meaning that it does not have to hear every case that is brought to it.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}

To enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both [[Contempt of court|criminal contempt]] and [[Contempt of court|civil contempt]] powers. The court's summary punishment for contempt immediately overrides all other punishments applicable to the subject party. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court may imprison for [[contumacy]], bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of [[mandamus]]. Judicial power includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by statute. Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}

[[Case or Controversy Clause|Clause 1 of Section 2]] authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to [[Standing (law)|standing]], [[mootness]], or [[ripeness]] issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have some interest genuinely at stake in the case.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The four concepts which determine "justiciability", the formula for a federal court taking and deciding a case, are the doctrines of (a) standing, (b) real and substantial interests, (c) adversity, and (d) avoidance of political questions.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}

Clause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has [[original jurisdiction]] in cases involving ambassadors, ministers and consuls, for all cases respecting foreign nation-states,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ FindLaw for legal professionals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116032730/http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ |date=January 16, 2013 }}, with links to United States Government Printing office official Web site, Cornell Law School, Emory Law School, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions since 1893, (1998, 2000 Supplement). Viewed November 28, 2011. {{cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116032730/http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/constitution/ |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in those controversies which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party. Cases arising under the laws of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Cases under international maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come under federal courts. Cases between U.S. citizens in different states, and cases between U.S. citizens and foreign states and their citizens, come under federal jurisdiction. The trials will be in the state where the crime was committed.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}

No part of the Constitution expressly authorizes [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Judicial review|judicial review]], but the Framers did contemplate the idea. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under "pendent" jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Judicial Review is explained in Hamilton's [[Federalist No. 78]]. It also has roots in Natural Law expressions in the Declaration of Independence. The Supreme Court first ruled an act of Congress unconstitutional in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', the second was [[Dred Scott]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}} To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of [[comity]] between federal government and states. By the doctrine of '[[Res judicata]]', federal courts give "full faith and credit" to State Courts.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For instance, 'collateral estoppel' directs that when a litigant wins in a state court, they cannot sue in federal court to get a more favorable outcome.}} The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law only on a case by case basis, and only by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state legislators motives, their policy outcomes or its national wisdom.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Recently numerous [[habeas corpus]] reforms have tried to preserve a working "relationship of comity" and simultaneously streamline the process for state and lower courts to apply Supreme Court interpretations.{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}

Section 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal [[Treason laws in the United States|law on treason]] by simple majority statute.  This section also defines treason, as an [[overt act]] of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States.  Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses.  Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason.  This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition.  However, Congress does provide for other lesser subversive crimes such as [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Contrary to this source when viewed, the Constitution provides that punishments, including forfeiture of income and property, must apply to the person convicted. "No attainder of treason shall work [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|corruption of blood]] or forfeiture" on the convicted traitor's children or heirs. This avoids the perpetuation of civil war into the generations by Parliamentary majorities as in the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|O'Connor|2010}}}}

===Article Four===
[[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article Four]] outlines the relations among the states and between each state and the federal government. In addition, it provides for such matters as [[admission to the Union|admitting new states]] and border changes between the states.  For instance, it requires states to give "[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]" to the public acts, records, and court proceedings of the other states.  Congress is permitted to [[regulation|regulate]] the manner in which proof of such acts may be admitted.  The [[Privileges and Immunities Clause|"privileges and immunities" clause]] prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens. For instance, in [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|criminal sentencing]], a state may not increase a penalty on the grounds that the convicted person is a non-resident.

It also establishes [[extradition]] between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for [[freedom of movement]] and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, but in the days of the [[Articles of Confederation]], crossing state lines was often arduous and costly. The [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Federal property and the Territorial Clause|Territorial Clause]] gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States.  Finally, the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a [[Republic|republican form of government]], and to protect them from invasion and violence.

===Article Five===
[[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five]] outlines the process for amending the Constitution. Eight state constitutions in effect in 1787 included an amendment mechanism. Amendment making power rested with the legislature in three of the states and in the other five it was given to specially elected conventions. The Articles of Confederation provided that amendments were to be proposed by Congress and ratified by the unanimous vote of all thirteen state legislatures. This proved to be a major flaw in the Articles, as it created an insurmountable obstacle to constitutional reform. The amendment process crafted during the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention was, according to The [[Federalist No. 43]], designed to establish a balance between pliancy and rigidity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= England |first1= Trent |last2= Spalding |first2= Matthew |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Essays on Article V: Amendments |url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/129/amendments |publisher= The Heritage Foundation |accessdate= July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults. It moreover equally enables the General and the State Governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other.}}

There are two steps in the amendment process. Proposals to amend the Constitution must be properly adopted and ratified before they change the Constitution. First, there are two procedures for adopting the language of a proposed amendment, either by (a) [[United States Congress|Congress]], by [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or (b) [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|national convention]] (which shall take place whenever two-thirds of the state legislatures collectively call for one). Second, there are two procedures for ratifying the proposed amendment, which requires three-fourths of the states' (presently 38 of 50) approval: (a) consent of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]], or (b) consent of [[state ratifying conventions]]. The ratification method is chosen by Congress for each amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clayton.edu/arts-sciences/Constitution-Day/Proposed-Amendments |title= Proposed Amendments |work= Constitution Day Observance Events |publisher= Clayton State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; State ratifying conventions were used only once, for the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Toward a Theory of Constitutional Amendment |journal=The American Political Science Review |last=Lutz |first=Donald |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the [[Archivist of the United States]] is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of [[Title 1 of the United States Code|1 U.S. Code]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|1|106b}}. The Archivist submits the proposed amendment to the states for their consideration by sending a letter of notification to each [[Governor (United States)|Governor]]. Each Governor then formally submits the amendment to their state's legislature. When a state ratifies a proposed amendment, it sends the Archivist an original or certified copy of the state's action. Ratification documents are examined by the [[Office of the Federal Register]] for facial legal sufficiency and an authenticating signature.&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{cite web |title= The Constitutional Amendment Process |url= https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/ |publisher= National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article Five ends by shielding certain clauses in the new frame of government from being amended. Article One, Section 9, Clauses 1 prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[History of slavery|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808, plus the fourth clause from that same section, which reiterates the Constitutional rule that [[direct tax]]es must be apportioned according to state populations. These clauses were explicitly shielded from Constitutional amendment prior to 1808. On January 1, 1808, the first day it was permitted to do so, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the country. On February 3, 1913, with ratification of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], Congress gained the authority to levy an [[income tax]] without apportioning it among [[U.S. state|the states]] or basing it on the [[United States Census]]. The third textually entrenched provision is Article One, Section 3, Clauses 1, which provides for equal representation of the states in the Senate. The shield protecting this clause from the amendment process is less absolute&amp;nbsp;– "no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate"&amp;nbsp;– but permanent.

===Article Six===
[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] establishes the Constitution, and all federal laws and treaties of the United States made according to it, to be the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law]] of the land, and that "the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding." It validates [[government debt|national debt]] created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all federal and state legislators, officers, and judges take oaths or affirmations to support the Constitution. This means that the states' constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution and that in case of a conflict, state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state. Article Six also states "[[No Religious Test Clause|no religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."

===Article Seven===
[[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|Article Seven]] describes the process for establishing the proposed new frame of government. Anticipating that the influence of many state politicians would be Antifederalist, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention provided for [[ratification]] of the Constitution by popularly elected [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|ratifying conventions]] in each state. The convention method also made it possible that judges, ministers and others ineligible to serve in state legislatures, could be elected to a convention. Suspecting that Rhode Island, at least, might not ratify, delegates decided that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states (two-thirds rounded up) ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Samuel Eliot Morison |first= Samuel Eliot |last= Morison |title= The Oxford History of the American People |year= 1965 |location= Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press |page= 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ratified by this minimum number of states, it was anticipated that the proposed Constitution would become ''this Constitution'' between the nine or more that signed. It would not cover the four or fewer states that might not have signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Gordon |last= Lloyd |title= The Six Stages of Ratification of the Constitution: Stage I&amp;nbsp;– Now For the Bad News |url= http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/stageone/ |website= TeachingAmericanHistory.org |publisher=The Ashbrook Center at Ashland University |accessdate= June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing endorsement===
[[File:Constitution signatures.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Closing endorsement section of the United States Constitution]]
The [[Signing of the United States Constitution]] occurred on September 17, 1787, when 39 delegates to the Constitutional Convention endorsed the constitution created during the convention. In addition to signatures, this closing endorsement, the Constitution's [[eschatocol]], included a brief declaration that the delegates' work has been successfully completed and that those whose signatures appear on it subscribe to the final document. Included are, a statement pronouncing the document's adoption by the states present, a formulaic dating of its adoption, and the signatures of those endorsing it. Additionally, the convention's secretary, [[William Jackson (secretary)|William Jackson]], signed the document to authenticate the validity of the delegate signatures. He also made a few secretarial notes.

The language of the concluding endorsement, conceived by [[Gouverneur Morris]] and presented to the convention by [[Benjamin Franklin]], was made intentionally ambiguous in hopes of winning over the votes of dissenting delegates. Advocates for the new frame of government, realizing the impending difficulty of obtaining the consent of the states needed to make it operational, were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of the delegations from each state. It was feared that many of the delegates would refuse to give their individual assent to the Constitution. Therefore, in order that the action of the Convention would appear to be unanimous, the formula, ''Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present ...'' was devised.&lt;ref name=attest&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spaulding|first1=Matthew|title=Attestation Clause|url= http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/7/essays/137/attestation-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document is dated: "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord" 1787, and "of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."  This two-fold [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] dating serves to place the Constitution in the context of the religious traditions of [[Western civilization]] and, at the same time, links it to the [[regime]] principles proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.  This dual reference can also be found in the Articles of Confederation and the [[Northwest Ordinance]].&lt;ref name=attest/&gt;

The closing endorsement serves an [[authentication]] function only. It neither assigns powers to the federal government nor does it provide specific limitations on government action. It does however, provide essential [[Evidence (law)|documentation]] of the Constitution's validity, a statement of "This is what was agreed to." It records who signed the Constitution, and when and where.

[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''[[United States Bill of Rights]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Currently housed in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Constitution has twenty-seven amendments. Structurally, the Constitution's original text and all prior amendments remain untouched. The precedent for this [[Constitutional amendment#Form of changes to the text|practice]] was set in 1789, when [[1st United States Congress|Congress]] considered and proposed the first several Constitutional amendments. Among these, Amendments 1–10 are collectively known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and Amendments 13–15 are known as the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. Excluding the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]], which was pending before the states for {{Age in years and days|1789|09|25|1992|05|07}}, the longest pending amendment that was successfully ratified was the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], which took {{Age in years and days|1947|03|21|1951|02|27}}. The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] was ratified in the shortest time, {{Age in days|1971|03|23|1971|07|01}} days. The [[Arithmetic mean|average]] ratification time for the first twenty-six amendments was 1 year, 252 days, for all twenty-seven, 9 years, 48 days.

A proposed amendment becomes an operative part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (currently 38 of the 50 States). There is no further step. The text requires no additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification by the required number of states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Neale |first= Thomas H. |title= The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues |url= http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/CRS_2013_summary.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Congressional Research Service |accessdate= July 27, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102306/http://equalrightsamendment.org/misc/CRS_2013_summary.pdf |archivedate= August 31, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when the Office of the Federal Register verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid and has become part of the nation's frame of government. This certification is published in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' and ''[[United States Statutes at Large]]'' and serves as official notice to Congress and to the nation that the ratification process has been successfully completed.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;

===Safeguards of liberty (Amendments 1, 2, and 3)===
The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (1791) prohibits Congress from obstructing the exercise of certain individual freedoms: [[Freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[right to petition]]. Its [[Free Exercise Clause]] guarantees a person's right to hold whatever religious beliefs he or she wants, and to freely exercise that belief, and its [[Establishment Clause]] prevents the federal government from creating an official national church or favoring one set of religious beliefs over another. The amendment guarantees an individual's right to express and to be exposed to a wide range of opinions and views. It was intended to ensure a free exchange of ideas, even unpopular ones.  It also guarantees an individual's right to physically gather or associate with others in groups for economic, political or religious purposes.  Additionally, it guarantees an individual's right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment I |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-1-freedom-of-religion-press-expression |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Henry had rhetorically asked, shall we be stronger, "when we are totally disarmed, and when a British [[Guards Division|Guard]] shall be stationed in every house?"{{sfn|Moncure|1990}}

The [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]] (1791) prohibits the federal government from forcing individuals to provide lodging to soldiers in their homes during peacetime without their consent.  Requested by several states during the Constitutional ratification debates, the amendment reflected the lingering resentment over the [[Quartering Acts]] passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] during the Revolutionary War, which had allowed British soldiers to take over private homes for their own use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment III |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-3-quartering-of-soldiers |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safeguards of justice (Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8)===
The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] (1791) protects people against unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]] of either self or [[property]] by government officials. A search can mean everything from a frisking by a police officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual or something in his or her possession. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is charged with a crime. It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IV |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-4-search-and-seizure |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (1791) establishes the requirement that a [[trial]] for a major [[crime]] may commence only after an [[indictment]] has been handed down by a [[grand jury]]; protects individuals from [[double jeopardy]], being tried and put in danger of being punished more than once for the same criminal act; prohibits punishment without [[due process]] of law, thus protecting individuals from being imprisoned without fair procedures; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to reveal to the police, prosecutor, judge, or jury any information that might [[self-incrimination|incriminate or be used against]] him or her in a court of law. Additionally, the Fifth Amendment also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without "[[just compensation]]", the basis of [[eminent domain]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment V |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-5-trial-and-punishment-compensation-for-takings |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] (1791) provides several protections and rights to an individual accused of a crime. The accused has the right to a fair and speedy trial by a local and impartial [[jury]]. Likewise, a person has the right to a public trial. This right protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, and serves to keep the public informed. This amendment also guarantees a right to [[Lawyer|legal counsel]] if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require [[witness]]es to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused, and guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VI |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-6-right-to-speedy-trial-confrontation-of-witnesses |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] (1791) extends the right to a [[jury trial]] to federal [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cases, and inhibits courts from overturning a jury's [[Question of fact|findings of fact]]. Although the Seventh Amendment itself says that it is limited to "suits at common law", meaning cases that triggered the right to a jury under English law, the amendment has been found to apply in lawsuits that are similar to the old common law cases. For example, the right to a jury trial applies to cases brought under federal statutes that prohibit race or gender discrimination in housing or employment. Importantly, this amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial only in federal court, not in state court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VII |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-7-trial-by-jury-in-civil-cases |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] (1791) protects people from having [[bail]] or [[fine (penalty)|fines]] set at an amount so high that it would be impossible for all but the richest defendants to pay and also protects people from being subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Although this phrase originally was intended to outlaw certain gruesome methods of punishment, it has been broadened over the years to protect against punishments that are grossly disproportionate to or too harsh for the particular crime. This provision has also been used to challenge prison conditions such as extremely unsanitary cells, overcrowding, insufficient medical care and deliberate failure by officials to protect inmates from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment VIII |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-8-cruel-and-unusual-punishment |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unenumerated rights and reserved powers (Amendments 9 and 10) ===
The [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] (1791) declares that individuals have other fundamental rights, in addition to those stated in the Constitution. During the Constitutional ratification debates Anti-Federalists argued that a Bill of Rights should be added.  The Federalists opposed it on grounds that a list would necessarily be incomplete but would be taken as [[enumerative definition|explicit and exhaustive]], thus enlarging the power of the federal government by implication.  The Anti-Federalists persisted, and several state ratification conventions refused to ratify the Constitution without a more specific list of protections, so the First Congress added what became the Ninth Amendment as a compromise. Because the rights protected by the Ninth Amendment are not specified, they are referred to as "unenumerated".  The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to privacy, and the right to make important decisions about one's health care or body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IX |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-9-construction-of-constitution |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] (1791) was included in the Bill of Rights to further define the balance of power between the federal government and the states. The amendment states that the federal government has only those powers specifically granted by the Constitution. These powers include the power to declare war, to collect taxes, to regulate interstate business activities and others that are listed in the articles or in subsequent constitutional amendments. Any power not listed is, says the Tenth Amendment, left to the states or the people. While there is no specific list of what these "reserved powers" may be, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws affecting family relations, commerce within a state's own borders, and local law enforcement activities, are among those specifically reserved to the states or the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment X |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-10-powers-of-the-states-and-people |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental authority (Amendments 11, 16, 18, and 21)===
The [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] (1795) specifically prohibits federal courts from hearing cases in which a state is sued by an individual from another state or another country, thus extending to the states [[Sovereign immunity in the United States|sovereign immunity]] protection from certain types of legal liability. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Cases and controversies|Article Three, Section 2, Clause 1]] has been affected by this amendment, which also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment11/annotation01.html#1|title=Annotation 1: Eleventh Amendment, State Immunity|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment XI |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-11-judicial-limits |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] (1913) removed existing Constitutional constraints that limited the power of Congress to lay and collect taxes on income. Specifically, the apportionment constraints delineated in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Apportionment of direct taxes|Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4]] have been removed by this amendment, which also overturned an 1895 Supreme Court decision, in  ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'', that declared an unapportioned federal income tax on rents, dividends, and interest unconstitutional. This amendment has become the basis for all subsequent federal income tax legislation and has greatly expanded the scope of federal taxing and spending in the years since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XVI|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-16-status-of-income-tax-clarified|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] (1919) prohibited the making, transporting, and selling of alcoholic beverages nationwide. It also authorized Congress to enact legislation enforcing this prohibition. Adopted at the urging of a national [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], proponents believed that the use of alcohol was reckless and destructive and that [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] would reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, decrease the need for welfare and prisons, and improve the health of all Americans. During prohibition, it is estimated that alcohol consumption and alcohol related deaths declined dramatically. But prohibition had other, more negative consequences. The amendment drove the lucrative alcohol business underground, giving rise to a large and pervasive [[Rum-running|black market]]. In addition, prohibition encouraged disrespect for the law and strengthened [[organized crime]]. Prohibition came to an end in 1933, when this amendment was repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XVIII|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-18-liquor-abolished|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] (1933) repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and returned the regulation of alcohol to the states. Each state sets its own rules for the sale and importation of alcohol, including the drinking age. Because a federal law provides federal funds to states that prohibit the sale of alcohol to minors under the age of twenty-one, all fifty states have set their drinking age there. Rules about how alcohol is sold vary greatly from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XXI|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-21-amendment-18-repealed|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safeguards of civil rights (Amendments 13, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, and 26) ===
The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (1865) abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]], except [[Penal labor in the United States|as punishment for a crime]], and authorized Congress to enforce [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]. Though millions of slaves had been declared free by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]], their post [[American Civil War|Civil War]] status was unclear, as was the status of other millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Emancipation Proclamation |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/ |publisher= National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress intended the Thirteenth Amendment to be a proclamation of freedom for all slaves throughout the nation and to take the question of emancipation away from politics. This amendment rendered inoperative or moot several of the original parts of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment XIII |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-13-slavery-abolished |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) granted [[United States nationality law|United States citizenship]] to former slaves and to all persons "subject to U.S. jurisdiction". It also contained three new limits on state power: a state shall not violate a citizen's privileges or immunities; shall not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; and must guarantee all persons equal protection of the laws. These limitations dramatically expanded the protections of the Constitution. This amendment, according to the Supreme Court's Doctrine of [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|Incorporation]], makes most provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to state and local governments as well.  It superseded the mode of apportionment of representatives delineated in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, and also overturned the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment XIV |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-14-citizenship-rights |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] (1870) prohibits the use of [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude in determining which citizens may vote. The last of three post Civil War Reconstruction Amendments, it sought to abolish one of the key vestiges of slavery and to advance the civil rights and liberties of former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment XV |url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-15-race-no-bar-to-vote |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] (1920) prohibits the government from denying women the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]] on the same terms as men. Prior to the amendment's adoption, only a few states permitted women to vote and to hold office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XIX|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-19-womens-suffrage|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] (1961) extends the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens residing in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] by granting the [[Federal district|District]] electors in the Electoral College, as if it were a state. When first established as the nation's capital in 1800, the District of Columbia's five thousand residents had neither a local government, nor the right to vote in federal elections. By 1960 the population of the District had grown to over 760,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda

The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] (1964) prohibits a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] for voting. Although passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments helped remove many of the discriminatory laws left over from slavery, they did not eliminate all forms of discrimination. Along with literacy tests and durational residency requirements, poll taxes were used to keep low-income (primarily African American) citizens from participating in elections.  The Supreme Court has since struck down these discriminatory measures, opening democratic participation to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda

The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] (1971) prohibits the government from denying the right of United States citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to vote on account of age. The drive to lower the [[Voting age#United States|voting age]] was driven in large part by the broader [[student activism]] movement protesting the [[Vietnam War]]. It gained strength following the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda

=== Government processes and procedures (Amendments 12, 17, 20, 22, 25, and 27) ===
The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] (1804) modifies the way the Electoral College chooses the President and Vice President. It stipulates that each elector must cast a distinct vote for President and Vice President, instead of two votes for President. It also suggests that the President and Vice President should not be from the same state. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]] is superseded by this amendment, which also extends the [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|eligibility requirements]] to become President to the Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment XII|url=

The [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] (1913) modifies the way senators are elected. It stipulates that senators are to be elected by [[direct election|direct popular vote]]. The amendment supersedes [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Senate|Article 1, Section 2]], Clauses 1 and 2, under which the two senators from each state were elected by the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].

The [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] (1933) changes the date on which a new President, Vice President and Congress take office, thus shortening the time between [[Election Day (United States)#History|Election Day]] and the beginning of Presidential, Vice Presidential and Congressional terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt20_user.html#amdt20_hd4|title=CRS/LII Annotated Constitution Twentieth Amendment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the Constitution provided that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December unless otherwise provided by law.  This meant that, when a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a "[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]" Congress convening in the interim.  By moving the beginning of the president's new term from March 4 to January 20 (and in the case of Congress, to January 3), proponents hoped to put an end to lame duck sessions, while allowing for a speedier transition for the new administration and legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XX|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-20-presidential-congressional-terms|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] (1951) limits an elected president to two terms in office, a total of eight years. However, under some circumstances it is possible for an individual to serve more than eight years. Although nothing in the original frame of government limited how many presidential terms one could serve, the nation's first president, George Washington, declined to run for a third term, suggesting that two terms of four years were enough for any president. This precedent remained an unwritten rule of the presidency until broken by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who was elected to a third term as president 1940 and in 1944 to a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XXII|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-22-presidential-term-limits|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] (1967) clarifies what happens upon the death, removal, or resignation of the President or Vice President and how the Presidency is temporarily filled if the President becomes disabled and cannot fulfill the responsibilities of the office. It supersedes the [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] succession rule established in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]].  A concrete plan of succession has been needed on multiple occasions since 1789.  However, for nearly 20% of U.S. history, there has been no vice president in office who can assume the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XXV|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-25-presidential-disability-and-succession|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] (1992) prevents members of Congress from granting themselves pay raises during the current session. Rather, any raises that are adopted must take effect during the next session of Congress. Its proponents believed that Federal legislators would be more likely to be cautious about increasing congressional pay if they have no personal stake in the vote. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: Compensation and legal protection|Article One, section 6, Clause 1]] has been affected by this amendment, which remained pending for over two centuries as it contained no time limit for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monk|first=Linda|title=Amendment XXVII|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-27-limiting-congressional-pay-increases|website=www.annenbergclassroom.org|publisher=Annenberg Classroom|accessdate=August 6, 2014|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unratified amendments==
Collectively, members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] typically propose around 200 amendments during each two-year term of [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name="C-SPAN's Capitol Questions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/questions/weekly54.asp |title=Capitol Questions |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141821/http://www.c-span.org/questions/weekly54.asp |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most however, never get out of the [[United States congressional committee|Congressional committees]] in which they were proposed, and only a fraction of those that do receive enough support to win Congressional approval to actually go through the constitutional ratification process.

Six amendments approved by Congress and proposed to the states for consideration have not been ratified by the required number of states to become part of the Constitution. Four of these are technically still pending, as Congress did not set a time limit (see also ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'') for their ratification. The other two are no longer pending, as both had a time limit attached and in both cases the time period set for their ratification expired.

===Still pending===
* The [[Congressional Apportionment Amendment]] (proposed 1789) would, if ratified, establish a formula for determining the appropriate size of the House of Representatives and the appropriate [[United States congressional apportionment|apportionment]] of representatives among the states following each constitutionally mandated decennial [[United States Census|census]]. At the time it was sent to the states for ratification, an affirmative vote by ten states would have made this amendment operational.  In 1791 and 1792, when [[Vermont]] and [[Kentucky]] joined the Union, the number climbed to twelve.  Thus, the amendment remained one state shy of the number needed for it to become part of the Constitution.  No additional states have ratified this amendment since. To become part of the Constitution today, ratification by an additional twenty-seven would be required. The [[Apportionment Act of 1792]] apportioned the House of Representatives at 33,000 persons per representative in consequence of the 1790 census. Reapportionment has since been effected by statute.
* The [[Titles of Nobility Amendment]] (proposed 1810) would, if ratified, strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign country. When submitted to the states, ratification by thirteen states was required for it to become part of the Constitution; eleven had done so by early 1812. However, with the addition of [[Louisiana]] into the Union that year (April 30, 1812), the ratification threshold rose to fourteen. Thus, when [[New Hampshire]] ratified it in December 1812, the amendment again came within two states of being ratified. No additional states have ratified this amendment since. To become part of the Constitution today, ratification by an additional twenty-six would be required.
* The [[Corwin Amendment]] (proposed 1861) would, if ratified, [[Entrenched clause|shield]] "[[institution|domestic institution]]s" of the states (which in 1861 included [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]) from the constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress. This proposal was one of several measures considered by Congress in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to attract the seceding states back into the Union and to entice [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Samuel Eliot |last= Morison |title= The Oxford History of the American People |year= 1965 |location= Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five states ratified the amendment in the early 1860s, but none have since. To become part of the Constitution today, ratification by an additional 33 states would be required. The subject of this proposal was subsequently addressed by the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery.
* The [[Child Labor Amendment]] (proposed 1924) would, if ratified, specifically authorize Congress to limit, regulate and prohibit labor of persons less than eighteen years of age. The amendment was proposed in response to Supreme Court rulings in ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]]'' (1918) and ''[[Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.]]'' (1922) that found federal laws regulating and taxing goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 and 16 unconstitutional. When submitted to the states, ratification by 36 states was required for it to become part of the Constitution, as there were forty-eight states. Twenty-eight had ratified the amendment by early 1937, but none have done so since. To become part of the Constitution today, ratification by an additional ten would be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Constitution of the United States and Amendments Thereto |year= 1961 |publisher= Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government |pages= 68–69 |editor-first= James J. |editor-last= Kilpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fair Labor Standards Act|federal statute]] approved June 25, 1938, regulated the employment of those under 16 or 18 years of age in interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, by unanimous vote in ''[[United States v. Darby Lumber Co.]]'' (1941), found this law constitutional, effectively overturning ''Hammer v. Dagenhart''. As a result of this development, the movement pushing for the amendment concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ODVCW93-bgoC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89 |title= American Constitutionalism: From Theory to Politics |first= Stephen M. |last= Griffin |year= 1998 |isbn= 9780691002408 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No longer pending===
* The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (proposed 1972) would have prohibited deprivation of equality of rights ([[discrimination]]) by the federal or state governments on account of sex. A seven-year ratification time limit was initially placed on the amendment, but as the deadline approached, Congress granted a three-year extension. Thirty-five states ratified the proposed amendment prior to the original deadline, three short of the number required for it to be implemented (five of them later voted to rescind their ratification). No further states ratified the amendment within the extended deadline, thus it failed to be adopted.  On March 22, 2017, the 45th anniversary of Congress' submission of the ERA to the nation's state lawmakers, the [[Nevada Legislature]] became the first to ratify the ERA after the expiration of both deadlines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520962541/nevada-on-cusp-of-ratifying-equal-rights-amendment-35-years-after-deadline|title=Nevada Ratifies The Equal Rights Amendment ... 35 Years After The Deadline|author1=Colin Dwyer|author2=Carrie Kaufman|date=March 21, 2017|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its adoption of Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 (designated as "POM-15" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of April 5, 2017, at pages S2361 and S2362).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2017-04-04/pdf/CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2361.pdf#page=1|title=Congressional Record - April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Illinois General Assembly]] ratified the ERA on May 30, 2018.
* The [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]] (proposed 1978) would have granted the District of Columbia full representation in the United States Congress as if it were a state, repealed the 23rd Amendment, granted the District unconditional Electoral College voting rights, and allowed its participation in the process by which the Constitution is amended. A seven-year ratification time limit was placed on the amendment. Sixteen states ratified the amendment (twenty-two short of the number required for it to be implemented) prior to the deadline, thus it failed to be adopted.

==Judicial review==
{{See also|Judicial review in the United States|Judicial review|Appeal#Appellate review}}

The way the Constitution is understood is influenced by court decisions, especially those of the Supreme Court. These decisions are referred to as [[precedent]]s. Judicial review is the power of the Court to examine federal legislation, federal executive, and all state branches of government, to decide their [[constitutionality]], and to strike them down if found unconstitutional.

Judicial review includes the power of the Court to explain the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to particular cases. Over the years, Court decisions on issues ranging from governmental regulation of [[radio]] and [[television]] to the rights of the accused in criminal cases have changed the way many constitutional clauses are interpreted, without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution.

Legislation passed to implement the Constitution, or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect. If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged, however, it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the Courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say "what the law is".{{refn|group= lower-alpha |[[Downes v. Bidwell]], 182 U.S. 244, 261 (1901), commenting on an earlier Supreme Court decision, Loughborough v. Blake, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 317 (1820); Rasmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516, 529–530, 536 (1905)(concurring opinions of Justices Harlan and Brown), that once the Constitution has been extended to an area, its coverage is irrevocable; [[Boumediene v. Bush]] – That where the Constitution has been once formally extended by Congress to territories, neither Congress nor the territorial legislature can enact laws inconsistent therewith. The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply.}}

===Scope and theory===
Courts established by the Constitution can regulate government under the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. First, they have jurisdiction over actions by an officer of government and state law. Second, federal courts may rule on whether coordinate branches of national government conform to the Constitution. Until the twentieth century, the Supreme Court of the United States may have been the only high tribunal in the world to use a court for constitutional interpretation of fundamental law, others generally depending on their national legislature.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=134}}

The basic theory of American Judicial review is summarized by constitutional legal scholars and historians as follows: the written Constitution is fundamental law. It can change only by extraordinary legislative process of national proposal, then state ratification. The powers of all departments are limited to enumerated grants found in the Constitution. Courts are expected (a) to enforce provisions of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, and (b) to refuse to enforce anything in conflict with it.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=136}}

'''In Convention.''' As to judicial review and the Congress, the first proposals by Madison (Va) and Wilson (Pa) called for a supreme court veto over national legislation. In this it resembled the system in New York, where the Constitution of 1777 called for a "[[Council of Revision]]" by the Governor and Justices of the state supreme court. The Council would review and in a way, veto any passed legislation violating the spirit of the Constitution before it went into effect. The nationalist's proposal in Convention was defeated three times, and replaced by a presidential veto with Congressional over-ride. Judicial review relies on the jurisdictional authority in Article III, and the Supremacy Clause.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=137–138}}

The justification for judicial review is to be explicitly found in the open ratifications held in the states and reported in their newspapers. [[John Marshall]] in Virginia, [[James Wilson]] in Pennsylvania and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] of Connecticut all argued for Supreme Court judicial review of acts of state legislature. In [[Federalist No. 78]], Alexander Hamilton advocated the doctrine of a written document held as a superior enactment of the people. "A limited constitution can be preserved in practice no other way" than through courts which can declare void any legislation contrary to the Constitution. The preservation of the people's authority over legislatures rests "particularly with judges".{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=138}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The Supreme Court found 658 cases of invalid state statutes from 1790 to 1941 before the advent of civil rights cases in the last half of the twentieth century{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=142}}}}

The Supreme Court was initially made up of jurists who had been intimately connected with the framing of the Constitution and the establishment of its government as law. [[John Jay]] (New York), a co-author of ''The Federalist Papers'', served as Chief Justice for the first six years. The second Chief Justice for a term of four years, was [[Oliver Ellsworth]] (Connecticut), a delegate in the Constitutional Convention, as was [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina), Washington's recess appointment as Chief Justice who served in 1795. [[John Marshall]] (Virginia), the fourth Chief Justice, had served in the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788. His service on the Court would extend 34 years over some of the most important rulings to help establish the nation the Constitution had begun. In the first years of the Supreme Court, members of the Constitutional Convention who would serve included [[James Wilson]] (Pennsylvania) for ten years, [[John Blair Jr.]] (Virginia) for five, and [[John Rutledge]] (South Carolina) for one year as Justice, then Chief Justice in 1795.

=== Establishment ===
When John Marshall followed Oliver Ellsworth as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1801, the federal judiciary had been established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]], but there were few cases, and less prestige. "The fate of judicial review was in the hands of the Supreme Court itself." Review of state legislation and appeals from state supreme courts was understood. But the Court's life, jurisdiction over state legislation was limited. The Marshall Court's landmark ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'' held that the Bill of Rights restricted only the federal government, and not the states.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=138}}

In the landmark ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' case, the Supreme Court asserted its authority of judicial review over Acts of Congress.  Its findings were that Marbury and the others had a right to their commissions as judges in the District of Columbia.  Marshall, writing the opinion for the majority, announced his discovered conflict between Section 13 of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] and Article III.{{refn|group= lower-alpha |In this, John Marshall leaned on the argument of Hamilton in [[Federalist No. 78]].}}{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=140}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Although it may be that the true meaning of the Constitution to the people of the United States in 1788 can only be divined by a study of the state ratification conventions, the Supreme Court has used ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' as a supplemental guide to the Constitution since their co-author, John Jay, was the first Chief Justice.}} In this case, both the Constitution and the statutory law applied to the particulars at the same time. "The very essence of judicial duty" according to Marshall was to determine which of the two conflicting rules should govern. The Constitution enumerates powers of the judiciary to extend to cases arising "under the Constitution". Further, justices take a Constitutional oath to uphold it as [[Supremacy Clause|"Supreme law of the land"]].{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=140–141}} Therefore, since the United States government as created by the Constitution is a limited government, the Federal courts were required to choose the Constitution over Congressional law if there were deemed to be a conflict.

"This argument has been ratified by time and by practice..."{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The entire quote reads, "This argument has been ratified by time and by practice, and there is little point in quibbling with it. Of course, the President also takes an oath to support the Constitution."{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=141}}}}{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The presidential reference is to Andrew Jackson's disagreement with Marshall's Court over ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', finding Georgia could not impose its laws in Cherokee Territory. Jackson replied, "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!", and the Trail of Tears proceeded. Jackson would not politically interpose the U.S. Army between Georgia and the Cherokee people as Eisenhower would do between Arkansas and the integrating students.}}  The Supreme Court did not declare another Act of Congress unconstitutional until the controversial [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision in 1857, held after the voided [[Missouri Compromise]] statute had already been repealed.  In the eighty years following the Civil War to World War II, the Court voided Congressional statutes in 77 cases, on average almost one a year.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=141–142}}

Something of a crisis arose when, in 1935 and 1936, the Supreme Court handed down twelve decisions voiding Acts of Congress relating to the New Deal. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] then responded with his abortive "[[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|court packing plan]]". Other proposals have suggested a Court super-majority to overturn Congressional legislation, or a Constitutional Amendment to require that the Justices retire at a specified age by law. To date, the Supreme Court's power of judicial review has persisted.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=142}}

==== Self-restraint ====
The power of judicial review could not have been preserved long in a democracy unless it had been "wielded with a reasonable measure of [[judicial restraint]], and with some attention, as [[Finley Peter Dunne|Mr. Dooley]] said, to the election returns." Indeed, the Supreme Court has developed a system of doctrine and practice that self-limits its power of judicial review.&lt;!-- ref name=autogenerated11 --&gt;{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=145}}

The Court controls almost all of its business by choosing what cases to consider, writs of [[certiorari]]. In this way, it can avoid opinions on embarrassing or difficult cases. The Supreme Court limits itself by defining for itself what is a "justiciable question." First, the Court is fairly consistent in refusing to make any "[[advisory opinion]]s" in advance of actual cases.{{refn|group= lower-alpha |"Advisory opinions" are not the same as "[[declaratory judgment]]s." (a) These address rights and legal relationships in cases of "actual controversy", and (b) the holding has the force and effect of a final judgment. (c) There is no coercive order, as the parties are assumed to follow the judgment, but a "declaratory judgment" is the basis of any subsequent ruling in case law.}} Second, "[[friendly suit]]s" between those of the same legal interest are not considered. Third, the Court requires a "personal interest", not one generally held, and a legally protected right must be immediately threatened by government action. Cases are not taken up if the litigant has no [[Standing (law)|standing to sue]]. Simply having the money to sue and being injured by government action are not enough.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=145}}

These three procedural ways of dismissing cases have led critics to charge that the Supreme Court delays decisions by unduly insisting on technicalities in their "standards of litigability".  They say cases are left unconsidered which are in the public interest, with genuine controversy, and resulting from good faith action.  "The Supreme Court is not only a court of law but a court of justice."{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=148–149}}

====Separation of powers====
The Supreme Court balances several pressures to maintain its roles in national government. It seeks to be a co-equal branch of government, but its decrees must be enforceable. The Court seeks to minimize situations where it asserts itself superior to either President or Congress, but federal officers must be held accountable. The Supreme Court assumes power to declare acts of Congress as unconstitutional but it self-limits its passing on constitutional questions.&lt;!-- ref name=autogenerated5 --&gt;{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=149}} But the Court's guidance on basic problems of life and governance in a democracy is most effective when American political life reinforce its rulings.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=154}}

[[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] summarized four general guidelines that the Supreme Court uses to avoid constitutional decisions relating to Congress:{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Louis Brandeis concurring opinion, ''Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority'', 1936.}} The Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law nor decide open questions unless a case decision requires it. If it does, a rule of constitutional law is formulated only as the precise facts in the case require. The Court will choose statutes or general law for the basis of its decision if it can without constitutional grounds. If it does, the Court will choose a constitutional construction of an Act of Congress, even if its constitutionality is seriously in doubt. {{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=149}}

Likewise with the Executive Department, Edwin Corwin observed that the Court does sometimes rebuff presidential pretensions, but it more often tries to rationalize them. Against Congress, an Act is merely "disallowed". In the executive case, exercising judicial review produces "some change in the external world" beyond the ordinary judicial sphere.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=150}} The "political question" doctrine especially applies to questions which present a difficult enforcement issue. Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] addressed the Court's limitation when political process allowed future policy change, but a judicial ruling would "attribute finality". Political questions lack "satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination".{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=151}}

John Marshall recognized that the president holds "important political powers" which as [[Executive privilege]] allows great discretion. This doctrine was applied in Court rulings on President [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]'s duty to enforce the law during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. It extends to the sphere of foreign affairs. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] explained, Foreign affairs are inherently political, "wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the government&amp;nbsp;... [and] not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry."{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|pp=150–151}}

Critics of the Court object in two principal ways to self-restraint in judicial review, deferring as it does as a matter of doctrine to Acts of Congress and Presidential actions.
# Its inaction is said to allow "a flood of legislative appropriations" which permanently create an imbalance between the states and federal government.
# Supreme Court deference to Congress and the executive compromises American protection of civil rights, political minority groups and aliens.{{sfn|Pritchett|1959|p=153}}

===Subsequent Courts===
{{main |History of the Supreme Court of the United States }}

Supreme Courts under the leadership of subsequent Chief Justices have also used judicial review to interpret the Constitution among individuals, states and federal branches. Notable contributions were made by the Chase Court, the Taft Court, the Warren Court, and the Rehnquist Court.

{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Chase Court}}
[[Salmon P. Chase]] was a Lincoln appointee, serving as Chief Justice from 1864 to 1873. His career encompassed service as a U.S. Senator and Governor of Ohio. He coined the slogan, "Free soil, free Labor, free men." One of Lincoln's "team of rivals", he was appointed Secretary of Treasury during the Civil War, issuing "greenbacks". To appease radical Republicans, Lincoln appointed him to replace Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] of [[Dred Scott]] case fame.

In one of his first official acts, Chase admitted [[John Rock (abolitionist)|John Rock]], the first African-American to practice before the Supreme Court. The "Chase Court" is famous for ''[[Texas v. White]]'', which asserted a permanent Union of indestructible states. ''[[Veazie Bank v. Fenno]]'' upheld the Civil War tax on state banknotes. ''[[Hepburn v. Griswold]]'' found parts of the Legal Tender Acts unconstitutional, though it was reversed under a late Supreme Court majority.

[[William Howard Taft]] was a Harding appointment to Chief Justice from 1921 to 1930. A [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)#Progressive Republicans|Progressive Republican]] from Ohio, he was a one-term President.

As Chief Justice, he advocated the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] that brought the Federal District Courts under the administrative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Taft successfully sought the expansion of Court jurisdiction over non- states such as District of Columbia and Territories of Alaska and Hawaii.

In 1925, the Taft Court issued a ruling overturning a Marshall Court ruling on the Bill of Rights. In ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', the Court established the doctrine of "[[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation]] which applied the Bill of Rights to the states. Important cases included the ''[[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]]'' that upheld Congressional regulation of commerce. ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' allowed exclusion of evidence obtained without a warrant based on application of the 14th Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches. ''[[Wisconsin v. Illinois]]'' ruled the equitable power of the United States can impose positive action on a state to prevent its inaction from damaging another state.

[[Earl Warren]] was an Eisenhower nominee, Chief Justice from 1953 to 1969. Warren's Republican career in the law reached from County Prosecutor, California state attorney general, and three consecutive terms as Governor. His programs stressed progressive efficiency, expanding state education, re-integrating returning veterans, infrastructure and highway construction.

In 1954, the Warren Court overturned a landmark [[Melville Fuller#Chief Justice|Fuller Court]] ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment interpreting racial segregation as permissible in government and commerce providing "separate but equal" services. Warren built a coalition of Justices after 1962 that developed the idea of natural rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' banned segregation in public schools. ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' established Court ordered "one-man-one-vote". Bill of Rights Amendments were incorporated into the states. Due process was expanded in ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]].'' First Amendment rights were addressed in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' concerning privacy, and ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' relative to free speech.

{{further|List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court}}
[[William Rehnquist]] was a Reagan appointment to Chief Justice, serving from 1986 to 2005. While he would concur with overthrowing a state supreme court's decision, as in ''Bush v. Gore'', he built a coalition of Justices after 1994 that developed the idea of federalism as provided for in the Tenth Amendment. In the hands of the Supreme Court, the Constitution and its Amendments were to restrain Congress, as in ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]''.

Nevertheless, the Rehnquist Court was noted in the contemporary "culture wars" for overturning state laws relating to privacy prohibiting late-term abortions in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', prohibiting sodomy in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', or ruling so as to protect free speech in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'' or affirmative action in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]''.

==Civic religion==
{{Main|American civil religion}}

There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the documents of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], as being a cornerstone of a type of [[civil religion]]. This is suggested by the prominent display of the Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, in massive, bronze-framed, bulletproof, moisture-controlled glass containers vacuum-sealed in a rotunda by day and in multi-ton bomb-proof vaults by night at the [[National Archives Building]].&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite news |last= Wood |first= Gordon S., |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/aug/14/dusting-off-the-declaration/ |title= Dusting off the Declaration |work= The New York Review of Books |date= August 14, 1997 |accessdate= December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of displaying the documents struck one academic critic looking from the point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as "idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution".&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; By 1816, Jefferson wrote that "[s]ome men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the [[Ark of the Covenant]], too sacred to be touched". But he saw imperfections and imagined that there could potentially be others, believing as he did that "institutions must advance also".{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=115}}

Some commentators depict the multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian United States as held together by a political orthodoxy, in contrast with a [[nation state]] of people having more "natural" ties.{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=118}}{{sfn|Levinson|1987|p=119}}

The United States Constitution has been a notable model for governance around the world.  Its international influence is found in similarities of phrasing and borrowed passages in other constitutions, as well as in the principles of the [[rule of law]], [[separation of powers]] and recognition of [[civil liberties|individual rights]].  The American experience of fundamental law with amendments and [[judicial review]] has motivated [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] at times when they were considering the possibilities for their nation's future.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}  It informed [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]],{{refn|group= lower-alpha |"Secession was indeed unconstitutional&amp;nbsp;... military resistance to secession was not only constitutional but also morally justified.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=3}} "the ''primary'' purpose of the Constitution was&amp;nbsp;... to create 'a more perfect union'&amp;nbsp;... the Constitution was an exercise in nation building.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=198}}}} his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juárez]] of Mexico,{{refn|group= lower-alpha |Juarez regarded the United States as a model of republican democracy and consistently supported Abraham Lincoln.{{sfn|Stacy|2003|p=436}}}} and the second generation of 19th-century constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines{{refn|group= lower-alpha |The institutions of the two countries which have most influenced constitutional development are Spain and the United States".

==Criticisms==
{{further|History of the United States Constitution#Criticism of the Constitution}}
The United States Constitution has faced various criticisms since its inception in 1787.

The Constitution did not originally define who was [[Voting rights in the United States|eligible to vote]], allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only [[White American|white]] male adult property owners to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties – The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Voting Rights|url=http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Voting in Early America|journal=Colonial Williamsburg|volume=Spring 2007|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Reconstruction Amendments]] were adopted between 1865 and 1870, the five years immediately following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Constitution did not abolish slavery, nor give citizenship and voting rights to former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/reconstruction/essays/reconstruction-amendments-official-documents-social-history |last= Foner |first= Eric |title= The Reconstruction Amendments: Official Documents as Social History |publisher= The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |accessdate= December 5, 2012 |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These amendments did not include a specific prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex; it took another amendment&amp;nbsp;– the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]], ratified in 1920&amp;nbsp;– for the Constitution to prohibit any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/amendment_19/ |title= The Constitution: The 19th Amendment |publisher= National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate= December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vassal state''' is any [[State (polity)|state]] that is [[wikt:subordinate|subordinate]] to another.  The [[vassal]] in these cases is the ruler, rather than the state itself.  Being a vassal most commonly implies providing [[military]] assistance to the dominant state when requested to do so; it sometimes implies paying [[tribute]], but a state which does so is better described as a [[tributary state]].  In simpler terms the vassal state would have to provide military power to the dominant state.  Today, more common terms are [[puppet state]], [[protectorate]], [[client state]], or [[associated state]].

==Ancient China==
{{Main|Ancient Chinese states}}
From the time of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1046&amp;ndash;770 BC) until the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD), a varying number of vassal states existed in ancient [[China]].

These ranged in size from small city states to vassals which controlled large swathes of territory such as the States of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. One of these vassal states would go on to conquer China and unite the country under the first emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]].

==Ottoman Empire==
{{Main|Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire}}
The [[Ottoman Empire]] (1299&amp;ndash;AD 1923 ) controlled a number of tributary or vassal states in the peripheral areas of its territory. Vassalage took a number of different forms with some states permitted to elect their own leaders. Other states paid tribute for their lands.

During the 18th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled many vassal and tributary states such as the principalities of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], or the [[Crimean Khanate]].

==Troy under the Hittites==
{{main|Hittites}}
[[Troy]] was a vassal state of the [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]]s, along with other [[Arzawa]] lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Trojans and their neighbours |first=Trevor |last=Bryce |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZelJgdu9mkC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=vassal+state&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TZo6T7fGHYOJhQef_qzpCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vassal%20state&amp;f=false|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2005|isbn=9780203695340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
