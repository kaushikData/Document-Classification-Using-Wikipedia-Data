[[File:Compass Card B+W.svg|thumb|300px|A compass rose, showing absolute bearings in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.]]  
In nautical [[navigation]] the '''absolute bearing''' is the [[clockwise]] angle between [[north]] and an object observed from the vessel.  If the north used as reference is the true geographical [[true north|north]] then the bearing is a ''true bearing'' whereas if the reference used is [[magnetic north]] then the bearing is a ''magnetic bearing''. 

An absolute bearing is measured with a [[bearing compass]].

The measurement of absolute bearings of fixed landmarks and other navigation aids is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the [[nautical chart]] together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel.

[[File:Francis Ayscough with the Prince of Wales (later King George III) and Edward Augustus, Duke of York and Albany by Richard Wilson.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francis Ayscough]], Dean of Bristol and tutor to [[George III of England]] with his pupils. By [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], circa 1749.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp00192&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit Francis Ayscough], National Portrait Gallery, London, Accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Ainscough''' is an [[Old Norse]], [[Scandinavia]]n [[surname]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |contribution=Ainscough |contribution-url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Ainscough |title=Surname Database }}.&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled Ayscough, [[Aiskew]], Askew, Ascough and Aynscough.

==Origins and variants==
It is thought that the name is derived from the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] words "ask skog". Although other sources suggest that Aiskew is a corruption of the words "Eiki Skogr" translating to [[Oak]] Wood. An alternative [[Swedish language|Swedish]] translation for the name "enskog" is "[[juniper]] forest". The "en" part of the word meaning juniper, "skog" meaning wood or forest.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Today the name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|n|z|k|oʊ}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Wells|Wells, John C.]] (2008), ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'' (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suggestions indicate that the name Ainscough is of French origin. When [[William the Conqueror]] invaded England, he brought his army of [[knight]]s. These knights from [[Normandy]] were given land for their effort during the invasion and were placed as his head of government in each [[Shire]]. Wikipedia has information about a plaque placed in Normandy [[Cathedral]] before leaving for England.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} This plaque has a list of knights. There are 2 knights listed as "[[Ansgot]]" which would have been the French spelling for Ainscough. However, further evidence is required to support this translation of the name.

Name variations are: Ainscough, Ayscough, Ayscue, Ascough, Askew, Anscow, Askow, Ascow, Ascoe, Arscow, Anescoe, Aniscoe, Anscow, Ascoughe, Aynstowe, Askoes, Asckoe, Askoe, Askowes, Aynscow, Ainscow, Ainscowe, Ainscoe, Asque, Eskew, Escue and Insker.&lt;ref&gt;[[P. H. Reaney|Reaney]]'s Dictionary of British Surnames&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Ainscoughs==

[[Image:ayscough brass.jpg|thumb|left|Mediaeval brass of Sir William Ayscough of Stallingborough. Image: Barbara Ainscough 2007.]]
*[[William Ayscough]] (or William Aiscough) (?-d.1450), Bishop of Salisbury and Confessor to King Henry VI - of the Bedale/ Lincolnshire Ayscough line. He was nominated on 11 February 1438 and consecrated on 20 July 1438. ''"Many of his tenants intending to joyne with Jack Cade, came to Edendon, took him from masse and drew him-to ye top of a hill, where they cleft his head as he kneeled and prayed, not farre fro Edendon and spoyl’d him to ye skin June ye 29, 1450."''
*[[Anne Askew]] (Ayscough) Kyme (1521–1546), English Protestant and persecuted heretic, daughter of Sir William of Stallingborough, Lincolnshire. In 1546 Anne was arrested three times for heresy, committed to the Tower, subjected to the rack, and burnt at Smithfield 16 July 1546.
*[[William Askew|Sir William Ayscough]] of [[Stallingborough]] (1497–1541), knighted in 1513 by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] at the [[battle of Guinegate (1513)|siege of Tournai]]. Alabaster busts and brasses dated c.1612 of Sir Edward, Sir Francis and Sir William can be found in the church of St Peter &amp; St Pauls, [[Stallingborough]].
*[[Sir Francis Ayscough]] (c1509-1564) son of Sir William was knighted "at the wining of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]", Sheriff of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] in 1545, 1549 and 1554. Buried at St Mary's Church, [[South Kelsey]], Lincolnshire.

*Hannah Ayscough (1623–1679), mother of [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727). Hannah was born in [[Market Overton]] in [[Rutland]] in 1623. Her father was James Ayscough. Isaac Newton the elder (1606–1642) married Hannah Ayscough in April 1642 in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth|Woolsthorpe]], a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] within the [[Parish]] of [[Colsterworth]].
*[[Francis Ayscough]] (1700–1763), Dean of Bristol; tutor to George III. In 1756, Ayscough became the Canon for Winchester Cathedral (1756–1763). Ayscough's children included Anne Augusta (Lady Cockburn) and George Edward, a Guards officer.
*[[Augusta Anne Ayscough]] (1749–1837), the daughter of [[Francis Ayscough]]. The second wife of [[Sir James Cockburn, 8th Baronet|Sir James Cockburn]] and became [[Lady Cockburn of Langton]] in Berwick in 1769.
*[[James Ayscough]] (?-1759) scientist and optician, an English designer and maker of scientific instruments. He became known for his microscopes. His shop was in London between 1740 and 1759. In 1752 James Ayscough designed the first spectacles with double-hinged side pieces.

==Lancashire Ainscoughs==
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;'Townships: Scarisbrick', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3 (1907), pp. 265-276. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41332&amp;strquery=Aykescough Date accessed: 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; shows that there are references to Ainscoughs in the [[Ormskirk]] area as early as the 13thC - William of Ainscough was a beneficiary to the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk|church in Ormskirk]]; and there is a reference in 'The Cartulary of Burscough Priory' (1199-c1230) to a piece of land in the [[Scarisbrick]] estate called Aykescogh (Oak Wood) in the 12thC. In the same document the spelling of the name changes, in 1199 this is referred to as a place called 'Ayscogh', but then changes just 50 years later to 'Aykescogh' (1245-c1260).

Some genealogical sources give the English-Scottish borders as the origin of the family, others claim [[Cumberland]] as the source. Given the various theories on the derivation of the name, it is possible that there were other, independent lineages with the same surname.

Ralph Ainscough (b. 1899 in [[Horwich]]) recorded his grandfather Ralph (b. 1841 in [[Aspull]]) telling him that older generations of the Ainscoughs - e.g. William (b. 1816 in [[Blackrod]]) had pronounced the name as "Ainsker". There is some documentary evidence for this as William’s younger brother Charles (b. 1818 in [[Blackrod]]) gave his name as "Insker" on moving to [[Staffordshire]] in the 1840s. Some [[Yorkshire]] names acquired an internal "n" when crossing the [[Pennines]] into [[Lancashire]]. "Ainsker" may well have originated as "Aisker" - which is not far removed from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] "Aiks keogh" or oak wood. Given the common nature of places as surname origins, it is possible that there was more than one distinct line with the same surname.

Evidence of origin from the [[International Genealogical Index]] (IGI) is mixed and inconclusive. The IGI itself is a valuable but flawed resource. The current online database - which I shall term "IGI 2" - contains records contributed by members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS), many of which are questionable. The original pass through Britain’s parish records by LDS members was free of personal contributions and was available on microfiches in such centres as the library of the [[Society of Genealogists]]. I shall term this database "IGI 1". This original database excluded many [[Catholic]] records, owing to the reluctance of [[Catholic]] priests to allow their records being transcribed by the LDS. It also failed to record some [[nonconformist register]] entries. Given these caveats, an examination of the 1,623 records of Ainscoughs in [[Lancashire]] in the original IGI 1 shows that the earliest recorded event was the christening of Thomas Ainscough - son of John - on 27 April 1549 in [[Chorley]]. The next was the marriage of Kateryn Aynscow to John Brindill (Katherine Ainscough &amp; John Brindle) on 17 January 1550 in the parish of [[Chorley]]. In the same year, on 20 January and in the same parish, Richard Aynscow married "Jone Leeds". John, Katherine and Richard may have been siblings and quite possibly were born in the 1520s. The records in IGI 1 are drawn almost exclusively from [[Anglican]] records, but these three Ainscoughs may well have come from the [[Lincolnshire]] connection.

==Lincolnshire Ayscoughs (also known as Askews)==
The following theory was put forward by researchers in the 1970s but seems unlikely, since earlier evidence has been found showing Ainscoughs existed in [[Lancashire]] prior to a possible migration from [[Lincolnshire]].

The ''Lincolnshire Ayscough'' family originated from [[Bedale]] and owned estates around [[Stallingborough]], [[Ashby, Lincolnshire|Ashby]], [[South Kelsey]], [[Basford, Nottinghamshire|Basford]], [[Nuthall]] and [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]]. [[Ayscoughfee Hall]], now a preserved manor house in Spalding, was originally built by the rich wool merchant, Richard Alwyn in 1420 and then it was owned by the Lincolnshire Ayscough family in the early part of the 16th Century. The grant of land at Spalding was made to Sir William Ayscough (b.1490-d.1541) by Henry VIII. E.H. Gooch writes about "Ayscoughfee Hall" in his book "The History of Spalding", 1940.

In the 15th Century the Ayscoughs had supported the Lancastrian side during the [[Wars of the Roses]] and later held posts at the Courts of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Sir [[William Askew]] of [[Stallingborough]] was knighted in 1513 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], his eldest son [[Sir Francis Ayscough]] was knighted "at the wining of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]" and was Sheriff of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] in 1545, 1549 and 1554. He died in 1564 and is buried at St Mary's Church, [[South Kelsey]], Lincolnshire. Sir William's youngest son [[Edward Ayscough (died 1558)|Edward Ayscough]] (d.1558) was cup-bearer to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] from 1539-1547. [[Anne Askew]] (Ayscough) Kyme (1521–1546), the English Protestant and persecuted heretic was also the daughter of Sir William. Unfortunately for Anne her zealousness led to her execution and she was burned at the stake for heresy in 1546.
Reluctantly, the Ayscough family got caught up in the [[Lincolnshire Rising]] in 1536, a [[Catholic]] uprising against [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of England, against the dissolution of the monasteries. Sir William had ridden to [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] to keep the peace and uphold the law but instead found himself taken 'prisoner' by the rebels and was expected to represent their cause. Following this the Ayscough family fell out of favour with Henry VIII. However, Sir Francis continued to prosper by his own volition taking every opportunity to acquire land and so add to his estates. He died a convinced Protestant, clearly shown by the wording of his will.
It is claimed (evidence required) that over the period which followed many of the Lincolnshire Ayscough family lost their estates, they migrated west to [[Lancashire]], where they settled in the area around [[Mawdesley]], near [[Croston]], bleak wastes in the 16thC, as Farmers and Millers. However it does not seem possible to find specific evidence for this link, and without evidence the Lincolnshire origin seems increasingly tenuous. Researchers are requested to continue to investigate.

Sir [[Isaac Newton]] is also from an Ayscough family line, Hannah Ayscough his mother and possibly James Ascough born 1585, [[Ormskirk]], Lancashire, his grandfather.

==Gloucestershire and Middlesex Askews==
[[Image:Askew Road, Shepherds Bush - geograph.org.uk - 1708720.jpg|thumb|right|Askew Road, Shepherd's Bush]]
Another Askew family, from [[Gloucestershire]], also owned land in [[Hammersmith]], near [[Shepherd's Bush]], historically part of [[Middlesex]]. Once the area was built up in the 19th century, a formerly rural road west of Shepherd's Bush, previously called Starch Green, was named Askew Road, while another nearby road was named Askew Crescent, both after the family. There was also once a pub at the north end of Askew Road called ''The Askew Arms'', which is now an Irish pub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lbhflibraries.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/askew-road-over-the-centuries/|title=Askew Road over the centuries|publisher=Hammersmith and Fulham Libraries|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion, employment and trade==
[[Image:burscough flourmill.jpg|thumb|left|Derelict flour mill - H&amp;R Millers, Burscough. Image: Barbara Ainscough 2007.]]
Early records come from the Churches of [[Croston]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Standish, Greater Manchester|Standish]] in [[Lancashire]]. Many Lancashire Ainscough families were [[Yeoman]] farmers and some of the family continued farming until the period of industrialisation. The Milling company of H &amp; R Ainscough (Hugh and Richard of Parbold) established a successful business at [[Burscough]] and [[Southport]]. Branches of the family developed around [[Blackrod]], and by the 19thC, across the whole of [[Lancashire]]. As industrialisation came to Lancashire, the women took work in [[cotton mills]] and the men on the [[railways]], particularly the [[L&amp;YR]] and the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]].

In the early 19th century, most male - and some female - Ainscoughs in the villages of [[Blackrod]], [[Haigh, Greater Manchester|Haigh]], [[Aspull]] were [[coal miners]]. They started as drawers, pulling coal carts, at the age of ten (until this was stopped by legislation), graduating to miners at around the age of sixteen. The area was rich in [[cannel coal]], a high-grade, rich but volatile coal, and many mines were on the estate of the [[Earl of Crawford]] and Balcarres who lived at [[Haigh, Greater Manchester|Haigh]] Hall. All but one of the five sons of Ralph (b.1782 in Blackrod) were miners - and nearly all male descendants of these Ainscoughs were also miners, as censuses from 1841 to 1901 attest. In the 1850s and 1860s, some of the Ainscough miners moved further afield to [[Westhoughton]], [[Pemberton, Greater Manchester|Pemberton]], [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]] and [[Ince]], with some members of their families going into the silk and cotton weaving industries.

In 2006 several Ainscoughs featured in the [[Sunday Times Rich List]].

==Catholic tradition==
Many branches of the family maintained the [[Catholic]] tradition after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], for 300 years till religious tolerance eased in the 19th century, members of the family being charged with [[recusancy]], as recorded in "[[Return of the Papists]]". Many became priests, most prominently [[Anthony Ainscough]], Prior of [[Ampleforth Abbey]]. Business men H&amp;R Ainscough [[Hugh and Richard Ainscough]] were the benefactors of the RC Church, Our Lady &amp; All Saints, [[Parbold]] founded 1884 and also the local Catholic primary school.

The Catholicism or otherwise of the [[Lancashire]] Ainscoughs in general is also open to speculation. Prior to the Reformation, of course, all [[English people]] were Catholic by default. Evidence suggests that the [[Lincolnshire]]-based line Ayscough families turned away from Catholicism and towards [[Lutheran]] beliefs through the turbulent Reformation and [[Tudor period|Tudor]] religious periods. Many other Lancashire Ainscoughs were baptised in the [[Anglican]] churches of St. Katherine in [[Blackrod]], and St. Peter in [[Bolton-le-Moors]] (now modern [[Bolton]]). [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Methodism]] also appealed to many working-class people in the mid-19th century, who saw the [[Anglican church]] as a bastion of the upper, ruling class, and there were Wesleyan chapels in many towns - such as [[Chorley]] - in [[Lancashire]] - where Ainscoughs were married.

==Notable Australian Ainscough==
*Roy Ainscough (b. 1943), who emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia to play semi-professional football for U.S.C.Lion in 1969, died on 9 October 2007 aged 64. Since his arrival in South Australia Roy had been involved will football (soccer) at all levels, mostly as a coach. Roy also represented South Australia on several occasions including a game against an English FA representative side.
Mr Ainscough was brought up in [[Rawmarsh]] and Parkgate and went on to become a hard tackling defender and midfielder for several top local sides.
He died in the lakeside town of Barmera, South Australia, where he emigrated to in 1969 after leaving his job at the Parkgate Iron and Steel Company.
His wife Carleen telephoned former Denaby United secretary Barrie Dalby with the sad news at the weekend.
Beginning his footballing career at Wath Wanderers, Mr Ainscough moved to Rawmarsh Welfare in the Yorkshire League under the tutelage of former Rotherham United goalkeeper George Warnes.
He then jumped into the Midland League with Denaby United under another former Football League shot stopper, ex-Barnsley keeper Harry Hough.
Mr Ainscough was thrilled to be handed the opportunity to line up beside one of his idols, Millers legend Jack Grainger, who was playing on the wing for Denaby at the time.
He also played for [[Mexborough]] Town who were an emerging force in the Yorkshire League but returned to Denaby's Tickhill Square ground which he always considered his true football home.
The demise of the club greatly saddened Mr Ainscough and he was said to have never understood the reasons given by those responsible for what he saw as depriving the area of part of its heritage.
On the day of the club's final match - 4 May 2002 - he made a poignant telephone call which was greatly appreciated by the team and officials.
Despite being on the other side of the world he continued his keen interest in the fortunes of Rotherham United and was always proud of his South Yorkshire roots.
He and his wife last visited the county in the autumn of 2000 and he stopped in at Tickhill Square to watch his old club and was delighted to meet up with former playing colleague Trevor Whittaker to reminisce about their time in the red and black.
Mr and Mrs Ainscough had planned on coming over again earlier this year but unfortunately he was diagnosed with his illness.
One of his regrets in his final months was the realisation that he would be unable to visit England again.

[[File:PLATEAUS OF SYRIA.jpg|thumb|300px|Aintab plateau]]

'''Aintab plateau''' or '''Gaziantep plateau''' ({{lang-ar|هضبة عنتاب}} &lt;small&gt;[[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-ar|ˈhɑdˤɑbet ʕɪnˈtaːb|}}) is a low, gently undulating [[plateau]] that forms the westernmost part of the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]] in [[Turkey]]. It forms the northwestern end of the [[Arabian Plate]] where it meets the [[Anatolian Plate]] at the [[East Anatolian Fault]]. The plateau lies in the Turkish provinces of [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], and [[Adıyaman Province|Adıyaman]]. In Classical Antiquity, this was the region of [[Commagene]]. [[Gaziantep]] (Aintab) is located nearly in the south-center of the plateau.

==Borders and description==
The average elevation of the Aintab plateau is 400–600 m in the south and 600–700 m in the northern Adıyaman Province. The plateau forms the northernmost part of the [[Syria (region)|Syria geographic region]]. Aintab plateau is a continuation of [[Aleppo plateau]]; Aleppo plateau slopes upward gently in a southeast-northwest direction and then it rises forming the Aintab plateau approximately midway between [[Aleppo]] and [[Gaziantep]]. [[Kurd-Dagh|Mount Kurd]], [[Mount Simeon]], and Mount ʻAqīl are extensions of Aintab plateau into Aleppo plateau.

Aintab plateau is bounded from the east by the valley of River [[Euphrates]] and the [[Manbij plain]], and from the north by the [[Taurus Mountains]]. The [[Maras Triple Junction|Maraş Triple Junction]] forms the western boundary—a valley that runs from [[Kahramanmaraş|Maraş]] to [[Antakya]] separating between the [[Nur Mountains]] and [[Kartal Mountains|Sof (Qarṭal) Mountains]].  The river [[Karasu (Hatay)|ʼAswad (Kara-su)]] runs in the southern half of the valley.

Aintab plateau slopes up in south-north and southeast-northwest direction. The eastern part of the plateau is occupied by the vast plains of Tall Bashar (Oğuzeli), Yavuzeli, and Araban in Gaziantep Province. The western part holds the Sof mountain (1,496 m) and Karadağ mountain (1,081 m).

The [[Alleben]] and [[Sajur]] rivers rise from Sof Mountain and flow southeast to the Euphrates across the plain of Tall Bashar. The Nizip Stream rises from [[Nizip]] and joins the Euphrates near the city. The Merzimen (Bozatlı) river rises from Sof Mountain and flows through the southern part of Yavuzeli plain and joins the Euphrates. The Kara-su runs through the Araban Plain and also joins the Euphrates. [[Afrin river|River Afrin]] rises from the Sof Mountain and flows south in the west of the plateau. River [[Quweiq]] used to rise from the southern Aintab plateau.

In the northern Adıyaman Province, the southern terrain along the Euphrates consists of highlands separated by rivers flowing down from the foothills of the steep Taurus Mountains into the Euphrates. These rivers include the Kahta, Göksu, Sofras, and Ziyaret rivers. The plains in this portion of the plateau make only 10% of the total area. They are usually situated along the rivers and lie in average between 600–700 m above sea level. The most important plains are the Adıyaman and Kahta plains. The foothills of the Taurus Mountains dominate the northern portion of Adıyaman Province. These are known as the Malatya mountains, and they increase towards the north. The highest peaks of the Malatya mountains are the Akdag (2552 m), Dibek (2549 m), Tucak (2533 m), Gorduk (2206 m), [[Mount Nemrut|Nemrut]] (2150 m), Borik (2110 m), Bozdag (1200 m), and Karadag (1115 m).

Forests are scarce on the Aintab plateau. The main trees are [[pine]] and [[oak]].

The '''Amazônia-1''' satellite (or SSR-1), scheduled to launch in 2020,&lt;ref name="latam2020"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amazonia-1 será lanzado en 2020|url=http://latamsatelital.com/16255-2/|accessdate=11 May 2018|agency=LATAM Satelital|date=11 May 2018|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ceos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://database.eohandbook.com/database/missionsummary.aspx?missionID=602 |title=Mission Summary - Amazonia-1 |publisher=CEOS |work=CEOS Database |accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first [[earth observation satellite]] entirely developed by [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inovacaotecnologica.com.br/noticias/noticia.php?artigo=amazonia-1-sera-o-primeiro-satelite-totalmente-desenvolvido-pelo-brasil |trans-title=Amazonia-1 will be the first satellite developed entirely by Brazil |language=Portuguese |title=Amazônia-1 será o primeiro satélite totalmente desenvolvido pelo Brasil |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations will be joint with the [[CBERS]]-4 satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI3465463-EI301,00.html |trans-title=INPE acquires components for the satellite Amazonia-1 |language=Portuguese |title=Inpe adquire componentes para o satélite Amazônia-1 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the early 90s, the design of SSR satellites, Amazônia-1 precursor, was revised and [[Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais|INPE]] technicians proposed replacing the polar orbit by an equatorial orbit, and this proposal was accepted. That made sense at that time as Brazil already had coverage by polar orbit with the CBERS satellites.

The SSR-1 of the project suffered several delays start, either by lack of resources, whether by barriers in the disputes of the bids. The effective start, only occurred in 2001 when a contract was signed for the development of multi-mission platform specifically (at the time) for this purpose.

In 2001, a joint study between the INPE and DLR was published, found that most of the SSR-1 requirements can be met by two sensors: the Camera VIS / NIR and other MIR &lt;ref&gt;Rudorff, Bernardo (10/04/2003). [http://marte.dpi.inpe.br/col/ltid.inpe.br/sbsr/2002/11.18.18.10/doc/17_420.pdf O SATÉLITE DE SENSORIAMENTO REMOTO SSR-1 PARA MONITORAMENTO DA AMAZÔNIA] (PDF). INPE. Retrieved 15 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the publication PNAE review in 2005, the SSR-1 ceased to be a priority.

==Update==
Between September and October 2012, a structural model of the Amazônia-1 satellite was subjected to a series of vibration test. 

In the latest review of the PNAE, published in January 2013, the Amazônia-1 resurfaced with this name, and even successors planned (Amazon-1B in 2017 and Amazon-2 in 2018), however, remains the intention of use in orbit polar and the release dates of these satellites can not be maintained. A delay of two years, at least, already exists in the Amazônia-1 schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeb.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PNAE-Portugues.pdf  PROGRAMA NACIONAL DE ATIVIDADES ESPACIAIS 2012-2021] (PDF). [[Brazilian Space Agency]]. 22/01/2013. Retrieved 15 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The satellite was originally supposed to be launch on a [[VLS-1]], but the program was cancelled. Currently, the project managers are evaluating other alternatives such as the [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] from [[Arianespace]], the [[Minotaur-C]] from [[Orbital ATK]] and the Russian [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr]].&lt;ref name="latam2020" /&gt;
==Features==
The current design features are as follows:

* Orbit: polar orbit
* Period of Earth imaging: 4 days
* Optical sighting wide imaging (camera with 3 bands in the VIS and NIR 1 band)
* Observation range: 720 km with 40 meter resolution.

==Description and history==
The boundary stone is a sandstone block about {{convert|1|ft|m}} square in cross section, extending about {{convert|15|in|cm}} above ground and probably about {{convert|2|ft|m}} below ground.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;  The top is rounded and worn.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;  Standardized inscriptions placed on each side of the stone are only partially visible, due in part to the stone's sinking over time.&lt;ref name=DAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt; 
 
The words "Jurisdiction of the United States" are inscribed on the northeast side, which faced the federal territory (once the District of Columbia; now Arlington County).  The opposite side now facing the City of Falls Church contains the remnant of the word "Virginia".

'''Bushi''' is mainly a traditional region and an African ethnic group in the eastern part of  the Democratic Republic of the Congo(formerly Zaire); mainly located in the South Kivu province. It lies along the [[Mitumba Mountains]] and includes the administrative territories of [[Walungu Territory|Walungu]], [[Kabare Territory|Kabare]], [[Kalehe Territory|Kalehe]], [[Mwenga Territory|Mwenga]], [[Idjwi Territory|Idjwi]] and [[Uvira Territory|Uvira]] surrounding [[Bukavu]], which is its main city.  There are about 7-12 million inhabitants in the region speaking the Mashi or Shi language. The Bushi is also a kingdom that is organized into many localities or sub-chiefdoms. 

The Shi people are exactly close neighbours of Lega; Bavira and Bembe people in the southern part of South Kivu; the Banyarwanda/Barundi people in the Eastern; and are close neighbours of Bahunde and Banyanga people who are located in the North Kivu province.

The inhabitants of Bushi are the [[Shi people]] ([[Shi language|Shi]]: ''Bashi'', singular: ''Mushi'')&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book|last=Mulago |first=Vincent |year=1955 |title=Life Unity among the Bashi, Banyarwanda and Barundi |series=Thesis |publisher=[[Pontifical Urban University]] |location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their language is the [[Shi language]] (''Mashi''), a Central (Zone J) [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]]. People are mainly farmers in this chiefdom; but there are more and more distinguished businessmen; politicians and other intellectuals from this important ethnic group of the Kivu region. The Mwami Desire Kabare is the King of these people.

'''''Captive Society: The Basij Militia and Social Control in Iran''''' is a book written by Saeid Golkar and published by Woodrow Wilson Center Press and Columbia University Press in June 2015. The book presents the first concentrated, in-depth analysis of the [[Basij]], [[Iran]]'s prominent paramilitary organization that suppresses dissidents, votes as a bloc, and indoctrinates Iranian citizens.

Golkar draws from a wealth of both published and unpublished sources, from more standard documents such as Basij and [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]] publications to his own informal communications with Basij members. The book warns that the power of the Basij in Iran has led to the creation of a "captive society"&amp;nbsp;– one that is run on paramilitary-generated fear.&lt;ref&gt;Golkar, Saeid. ''[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/captive-society/9780231704427 Captive Society: The Basij Militia and Social Control in Iran].'' Washington, D.C. and New York: Woodrow Wilson Center Press and Columbia University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Golkar is a Middle East and North African studies lecturer at Northwestern University and a visiting fellow for Iran policy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mena.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/visiting/golkar-saeid.html Golkar Saeid], Northwestern University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/expert/saeid-golkar The Chicago Council]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 to 2014, he was a fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]. Prior to that, he served as a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/people/Saeid_Golkar Saeid Golkar], Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was selected as one of the best human rights books of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://medium.com/@KongTsungGan/best-human-rights-books-of-2015-5aecae214bed#.h57nwpaiw|title = Best human rights books of 2015: THE LIST, Books I haven’t read yet but imagine would have made the list if I had, Best human rights books of 2014|last = 江松澗|first = Kong Tsung-gan /|date = 2015-12-19|website = Medium|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Foreign Affairs'' journal also called the book, a "skillful rendering" .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/2015-12-11/captive-society-basij-militia-and-social-control-iran|title = Captive Society: The Basij Militia and Social Control in Iran|website = Foreign Affairs|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed by ''The Guardian''; New book on basij helps explain how Iran's hardline faction keeps country captive.

'''Cerro Las Tetas''', nicknamed '''Las Tetas de Cayey''', but officially ''Cerro Las Tetas'', and also '''Las Piedras del Collado''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coalicionventanasverraco.org/files/Perfil_Regional_de_la_Region_Sur_de_Puerto_Rico.pdf ''Plan de Uso de Terrenos de Puerto Rico: Perfil Regional - Region Sur. (Borrador Preliminar.)''] Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico. Junta de Planificacion. Oficina del Plan de Uso de Terrenos. San Juan, Puerto Rico. February 2006. Page 22. Retrieved 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pueblodesalinas/&gt; are two [[mountain]] peaks located in the municipality of [[Salinas, Puerto Rico]],&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt; north of the city of Salinas proper. Since September 1, 2000, the peaks have become part of a Puerto Rico Natural Reserve and are protected by law.&lt;ref name=pueblodesalinas/&gt; Their height is {{convert|2762|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

==Source of the name==
The peaks are so named for their resemblance to a woman's [[breasts]]. The word "tetas" is colloquial for "breasts" in Spanish, much like the English word "tits".&lt;ref name="sierra-club"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Jason|title=Puerto Ricans Still Lack Power Months After Hurricane Maria|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/puerto-ricans-still-lack-power-months-after-hurricane-maria|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|date=18 Jan 2018|accessdate=18 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
A common misconception is that ''Las Tetas'' are located in the municipality of Cayey.  ''Las Tetas'' are actually located the municipality of [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]], in Barrio Palmas, a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] on the northwestern part of the municipality of Salinas.&lt;ref name=maptest/&gt; They are located close to—but not in—the municipality of [[Cayey]], thus the "de Cayey" (English "of Cayey") in its name. They are located about 500 meters southwest of the intersection of [[Puerto Rico Highway 1|PR-1]] and [[PR-162]]. Topological maps readily show this.&lt;ref name=maptest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/topo.aspx?panerror=true&amp;z=19&amp;e=814011.076174411&amp;n=2004640.91638673&amp;s=50&amp;size=s&amp;style=drgsr Patillas Topo Map at Lat 18.1078°N Long -66.0331°W Zoom 15 S Size. Map Styles: Map and Shaded. Trails.com. From: United States Geological Survey. Topo Map. Projection: NAD83/WGS84.] Retrieved November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mtnzone/&gt;

===Confusion regarding its location===
The ''Las Tetas'' peaks are part of the "Cayey Mountain Range" (Spanish: "La Sierra de Cayey").&lt;ref name=pr_enc/&gt;  The ''La Sierra de Cayey'' mountain range, just like the [[Cordillera Central, Puerto Rico|Cordillera Central]] and Sierra de Luquillo mountain ranges, extends over several municipalities, not just Cayey.&lt;ref name=solboricua/&gt; The name of the mountain range where ''Las Tetas'' are located (Sierra de ''Cayey'') may be a possible source of confusion regarding the location of the ''Las Tetas'' peaks themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_n/gif/N067.gif ''Puerto Rico Geological Formations Map.''] U.S. Geological Survey. Accessed November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A little-known fact is that the town of Cayey derives its name from Sierra de Cayey, and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prtc.net/~pibc/HistoriadeCayey.htm ''Cayey...Ciudad de las Brumas.''] Accessed November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible source of confusion may lie on the fact that the road to reach the ''Las Tetas'' peaks starts off from within the municipality of Cayey, albeit just meters from its border with the municipality of Salinas.  A third possible source of confusion about the municipality where the mountains are located may be the fact that the peaks are located closer to downtown Cayey than to downtown Salinas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.pr.gov/municipios/Cayey/SobreCayey/PublishingImages/Información%20de%20Cayey%202013.pdf ''Hombres Ilustres.''] Manual de Informacion sobre Cayey: La mejor ciudad de Las Americas. Government of Puerto Rico. p.9. Undated. Retrieved 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayey is also a [[land-locked]] and mostly mountainous municipality, whereas Salinas, as a municipality on the southern coastal plain, consists mostly of flatlands. This may be a fourth reason yet why many people believe ''Las Tetas'' mountain peaks are located in Cayey, and not in Salinas. Another reason yet for the confusion may be that in order to locate ''Las Tetas'' in the official [[USGS]] map, the map for the Cayey Quadrangle is used.&lt;ref name=mtnzone/&gt;

In the mid-2000s the town of [[Salinas, Puerto Rico|Salinas]] took the town of [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]] to court over the location of "Las Tetas" and won the case. The matter involved land development and the Puerto Rico Planning Board. The result was a vindication of the claim that the "Las Tetas" location as being in the municipality of Cayey was incorrect. Las Tetas, the Court agreed, are actually "Las Tetas de Salinas" for they are actually located within the municipality of Salinas, not in Cayey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivo.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=11264CF03A1D48DE8E85E2073084A3D1&amp;year=2005&amp;mon=5&amp;keyword=Tetas ''Aibonito pide teta izquierda.''] Primera Hora. Alex David. May 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been called ''Las Tetas de Salinas.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://archivo.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=4DEA6B359ABF48438AF10ED285918349&amp;year=2005&amp;mon=5&amp;keyword=Tetas ''Lo importante no es de quién son la Tetas, sino qué hacer con ellas.''] Alex David. Primera Hora. 10 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, the name of the mountains are so embedded in Puerto Rican tradition that they continue to be called "Las Tetas de Cayey".

===Viewing location===
The ''Las Tetas'' peaks can be easily viewed from the [[rest area]] on [[Puerto Rico Highway]] [[Puerto Rico Highway 52|52]], located at kilometer post 49.0 of that highway. The rest area is colocated with the [[Monumento al Jíbaro Puertorriqueño]] statue and monument, in the municipality of Salinas.  The two peaks can be seen in the northwestern horizon when viewing from the rest area.&lt;ref name=elnuevodia/&gt;

==Height==
The peaks are contoured at 841 meters high. However, the western ''Teta'' is actually 20 meters higher than its eastern twin.&lt;ref name=maptest/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">An [[endemism|endemic]] [[organism]] is said to be found only in certain areas of the world.  This makes the organism in some cases [[endangered]].
The [[Maltese Islands]], although small in area (316&amp;nbsp;km²), host a large number of endemic [[species]], some of which are unique and unusual.  These endemic species are important to the Maltese Islands because they form part of Maltese national heritage and are topics of scientific research.&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

==Introduction==
Of the 10,000 estimated [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] and [[freshwater]] specimens in the [[Maltese archipelago]],&lt;ref name="Wildlife"&gt;Wildlife of the Maltese Islands, BirdLife Malte and Nature Trust, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 78 species are endemic,&lt;ref name=ecology&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schembri|first1=Patrick|title=The Ecology of the Maltese Islands|url=http://www.geog.plym.ac.uk/malta/Eco1.htm|website=Environmental Themes in the Mediterranean: A Case Study of the Maltese Islands [https://web.archive.org/web/20070513212141/http://www.geog.plym.ac.uk/malta/]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031521/http://www.geog.plym.ac.uk/malta/Eco1.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a very good number considering the country's area. Only 4,500 species have so far been recorded, and others still await correct [[taxonomic classification]],&lt;ref name="Wildlife"/&gt; which means that there may be several more endemic species yet to be discovered.

Twenty-three of the endemic species are [[vascular plants]] and plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, while the remaining 55 species are [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

==Plants==
There are known extinct Maltese plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Archivum%20Melitense/AM.01(1910-1912)/5%20AM.%201(1911-1912)08-10/05.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltese plants are many and varied.  For example, most [[algae]] are found in Maltese waters, approximately 300 are not microscopic.&lt;ref name="Wildlife"/&gt;

Some plants on the Maltese Islands are referred to as [[endemism|endemic]] which means they have no relatives elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref name="ecology"/&gt;

Below is a list of some endemic plants (together with their classification) which can be found throughout the Maltese Islands:

*Maltese Cliff-orache ''Atriplex lanfrancoi'' (previously known as ''Cremnophyton lanfrancoi'')
*Zerafa's Sea-lavender ''Limonium zeraphae''
*[[Maltese Everlasting]] ''Helichrysum melitense''
*[[Maltese Rock-centaury]] ''Cheirolophus crassifolius'' (previously known as ''Palaeocyanus crassifolius'', ''Centaurea crassifolia'' and ''Centaurea spathulata'')
*Maltese Hyoseris/Gozo Hyoseris ''[[Hyoseris frutescens]]''

==Animals==

There are more endemic animals than plants in the Maltese Islands.  Many a time, the animal in question has been confused with a different species from a close country e.g. the Sicilian [[shrew]] in [[Gozo]] which has been defined as a [[subspecies]] of its own.

Below is a list of some endemic animals (together with their classification):

*Maltese Field Beetle ''Pimelia rugulosa'' ssp. ''melitana''

'''Ezinu''' is a large crater on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. It was officially named by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] on July 3, 2015 and being one of the second row of names of a Cerean crater, &lt;ref name="GPN"/&gt; and named it after the [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] goddess of grain.&lt;ref name="GPN"/&gt;

Nearby prominent craters include [[Kaikara (crater)|Kaikara]] to the east, [[Nawish (crater)|Nawish]] to the south and [[Ialonus (crater)|Ialonus]] to the northwest.  Nearly halfway between the crater and Nawish is [[Junina Catenae]]. South of the crater is [[Hanami Planum]].

[[Winnipeg]] lies at the bottom of the [[Red River Valley]], a low-lying flood plain with an extremely flat topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/floods/redriver/geomorphology_e.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604201210/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/floods/redriver/geomorphology_e.php |archivedate=4 June 2011 |title=Geomorphology of the Red River|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This valley was formed by the ancient glacial Lake Agassiz which has rich deposits of black soil. Winnipeg is on the eastern edge of the [[Canadian Prairies]] in [[Western Canada]]; it is known as the 'Gateway to the West'. It is relatively close to many large [[Canadian Shield]] lakes and parks, as well as [[Lake Winnipeg]] ([[List of lakes by area|the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/nam/nam-08.html |title=Lake Winnipeg |author=World Lake Database |accessdate=5 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210173421/http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/nam/nam-08.html |archivedate=10 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winnipeg is bordered by [[tallgrass prairie]] to the west and south and the [[aspen parkland]] to the northeast.

Winnipeg is fairly isolated in that the closest city with equal or greater population is [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]], Minnesota (metro population of 3,317,308), which is 735&amp;nbsp;km (457 miles) southeast from the city. According to the [[Census geographic units of Canada]], the city has a total area of {{convert|464.01|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and an elevation of 240&amp;nbsp;m (786&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winnipeg.ca/census/includes/Geographies.stm|title=City of Winnipeg Community Profile: Overview|publisher=Government of Manitoba|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a [[humid continental climate]] with wide temperature contrasts between winter and summer, and greater precipitation in summer. Mean January temperature is {{convert|-16.4|C|F}}, and mean July temperature is {{convert|19.7|C|F}}. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|521.1|mm|abbr=on|2}}; snow falls on 53 days and lies on 132 days in an average year.

Winnipeg has three major rivers: the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], the [[Assiniboine River]], and the [[Seine River (Manitoba)|Seine River]]. The Red River is a [[Canadian Heritage Rivers System|Canadian heritage river]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverswest.ca/index.cfm?pageID=4 |title=Projects and Progress |publisher=Rivers West |accessdate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704030441/http://www.riverswest.ca/index.cfm?pageID=4 |archivedate=4 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Winnipeg's extremely flat topography and substantial snowfall, Winnipeg is subject to severe flooding. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. The [[Red River Floodway]] protects the city from flooding.

{{further information|List of Winnipeg neighbourhoods|List of tallest buildings in Winnipeg}}
According to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Census]], there are 230 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-561-m/2004004/4144286-eng.htm#box|title=Methodology|date=16 September 2004|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Downtown Winnipeg]], the city's economic core, is centred on the intersection of [[Portage and Main|Portage Avenue and Main Street]] (reputed to be one of the windiest in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert|title=Canadian literary landmarks|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Downtown Winnipeg covers an area of about one square mile (2.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and is the fastest growing high-income neighbourhood in the city.{{citation needed|reason=Dubious claim without citation|date=November 2014}} More than 72,000 people work downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and colleges.{{citation needed|reason=Claim without citation|date=November 2014}} The past few decades have seen downtown undergo major revitalization efforts; since 1999, over [[C$]]1.2 billion has been invested.{{citation needed|reason=Claim without citation|date=November 2014}}

In Winnipeg, there are 10 buildings that stand taller than {{convert|85|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on|0}}. The tallest building in the city is the newer 33-[[storey]], {{convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on|0}} [[201 Portage]].&lt;ref name="Canwest"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Canwest Place |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=4936 |publisher=Skyscraperpage |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second tallest building in the city is the [[Richardson Building (Winnipeg)|Richardson Building]], standing at {{convert|124|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall with 34 storeys.&lt;ref name="Richardson Building"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Richardson Building |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6184 |publisher=Skyscraperpage |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Downtown Winnipeg and the Exchange District, Manitoba, Canada - 20110530.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|The [[Exchange District]].]]
Downtown Winnipeg's [[Exchange District]] is named after the area's original grain exchange from 1880 to 1913.&lt;ref name="BIZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/resource/file/DBIZ_Trends_2010.pdf |title=downtownwinnipegbiz Trends 2010 |date=8 July 2010 |publisher=Downtown Winnipeg BIZ |accessdate=21 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111075234/http://www.downtownwinnipegbiz.com/resource/file/DBIZ_Trends_2010.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 30-block district received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North America's most extensive collection of early 20th-century [[terracotta]] and cut stone architecture, 62 of downtown Winnipeg's 86 heritage structures,&lt;ref name="BIZ"/&gt; [[Stephen Juba]] Park, and Old Market Square, home to [[Jazz Winnipeg Festival|Winnipeg Jazz]] and [[Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival|Fringe Festivals]].&lt;ref name="BIZ"/&gt; Other major downtown areas include [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]], [[Central Park (Winnipeg)|Central Park]], Broadway-Assiniboine and [[Chinatown, Winnipeg|Chinatown]]. Many of Downtown Winnipeg's major buildings are linked with the [[Winnipeg Walkway]] skywalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/pdf_folder/dwntwnprofile.pdf|title=Downtown Winnipeg Profile|publisher=City of Winnipeg|accessdate=16 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928014925/http://www.winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/pdf_folder/dwntwnprofile.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various residential neighbourhoods surround downtown in all directions, but expansion is greatest to the south and west, and has tended to follow the course of the two major rivers. The urbanized area in Winnipeg is about {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west and {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south, although several areas remain underdeveloped. The largest park in the city, [[Assiniboine Park]] next to the affluent neighbourhood of [[Tuxedo, Winnipeg|Tuxedo]],  houses the [[Assiniboine Park Zoo]] and the [[Leo Mol]] Sculpture Garden, Other large city parks include [[Kildonan Park]], [[St. Vital Park]], and Fort Whyte Centre. The major commercial areas in the city are [[Polo Park]] (West End and St. James), Kildonan Crossing (Transcona and East Kildonan), South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan) and the Corydon strip.

[[File:Osborne Village2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osborne Village]]]]

|title=BEST OF WINNIPEG 2008!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne Village is a complex urban community with a rich heritage and diverse built forms. It’s appreciated as a desirable location in which to live, work, and play. As such, it continues to experience development interest. Popular annual events include the Canada Day Festival. Osborne Village is home to one of Winnipeg's most vibrant collection of stores and restaurants with over 175 businesses calling Osborne Village home.

[[Little Italy, Winnipeg|Little Italy]] is a vibrant Italian district. Located on [[Corydon Avenue]], between [[Winnipeg Route 70|Stafford Street]] in the west, and [[Winnipeg Route 42|Pembina Highway]] in the east it is home to many boutiques and some of the city's finest restaurants and [[Gelato]].{{citation needed|reason=Claim without citation|date=November 2014}}

[[Saint Boniface, Manitoba|Saint Boniface]] is the centre of much of the [[Franco-Manitoban]] community. It features such landmarks as the Cathédrale de Saint Boniface (St. Boniface Cathedral), Boulevard Provencher, the Provencher Bridge, Esplanade Riel, St. Boniface Hospital, the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface and the Royal Canadian Mint. It covers the southeast part of the city and has a population of 65,000.

===Roadways and addresses===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
The city uses the [[grid plan]] but there are several different grids in place, as the city was originally thirteen separate municipalities and each developed under different circumstances and under different rules. Although it is common for roadways running north-south to be called "streets" and those running east-west to be called "avenues", the practice is far from universal, and few roadways run in a precise cardinal direction; an "east-west" road may run at a 45 degree angle from true east-west. Attempts in the early 20th century to bring order to the system by giving numerical names to the streets failed; all roadways in the city have proper names, some of which are repeated. (There is, for instance, a Wellington Crescent in River Heights and a Wellington Avenue in the West End, and a Killarney Avenue in Fort Garry and a Killarney Street in St. Vital.)

There is also no universal address numbering system in place. Address numbers usually increase as the distance from either the Red or Assiniboine rivers increases, but this is by no means uniform, even within a specific district. These peculiarities can cause serious problems for newcomers and visitors, especially in the older areas of the city, and may even affect postal and other deliveries.

Many of the main thoroughfares in Winnipeg are wide due to the spring soil conditions and the historical use of the [[Red River ox cart]] which created wide ruts in the (then) muddy roads. Portage Avenue has four lanes of traffic in each direction plus a central boulevard for much of its run through Winnipeg. Few thoroughfares, however, are as wide as the freeways seen in other Canadian cities (such as the 401 in Toronto or [[Deerfoot Trail]] in Calgary). Residential streets are commonly significantly narrower than streets in other Western Canadian cities, so narrow that parking is only possible on one side of the street.

==Climate==
Winnipeg lies in the middle of the North American continent on a low-lying, flat plain. Due to its location in the [[Canadian Prairies]], and its distance from both mountains and oceans, it has an extreme [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf |title=Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |accessdate=8 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USDA [[Hardiness zone|Plant Hardiness Zone]] 2b),&lt;ref name="Plant Hardiness Zones"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/forest/forestcanada/planthardi|title=The Atlas of Canada|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327150913/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/forest/forestcanada/planthardi|archivedate=27 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that there are great differences between summer and winter temperatures. The openness of the prairies leaves Winnipeg exposed to numerous weather systems including blizzards and cold [[Arctic]] [[High-pressure area|high pressure systems]], known as the [[polar high]]. Winnipeg has four distinct seasons, with short transitional periods between winter and summer.

The city averages {{convert|521.1|mm|abbr=on|2}} of precipitation per year, although this can vary greatly from year to year.&lt;ref name="CCN"/&gt;

{{Winnipeg weatherbox}}

Climate data is also available for downtown Winnipeg, with a weather station located at [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]].  This data demonstrates the [[urban heat island effect]] cities have on moderating temperatures compared to airport weather stations.

===Winter===
[[File:River River Curling.jpg|thumb|[[Curling rink]] on the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] at [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]]]]
Typical winter phenomena include the [[Thaw (weather)|bonspiel (January) thaw]], [[ice fog]], and the [[aurora borealis]]. The city is virtually assured of having a [[White Christmas (weather)|white Christmas]] as there is only one 25 December on record in the last century where there was no snow on the ground. Out of Canada's 100 largest cities, Winnipeg's winter is the tenth coldest with an average low of {{convert|-20.2|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=2&amp;submit=Submit |title=Coldest winter |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=22 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120050239/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=2&amp;submit=Submit |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From December through February the maximum daily temperature exceeds {{convert|0|C|0}}, on average, for only 10 days and the minimum daily temperature falls below {{convert|-20|C|0}} on 49 days.

===Summer===
[[File:Winnipeg summer climate graph.jpg|thumb|200px|Winnipeg mid-summer climate chart.]]
Summers are typically warm and generally not overly humid, with average humidity levels around 50% from June to August. Occasionally, [[humidex]] readings exceed 40. The trees will usually be in full bloom by late May and do not lose their leaves until early October. Winnipeg's growing season lasts from 25 May to 22 September;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almanac.com/content/frost-chart-canada|title=Frost Chart for Canada|year=2012|publisher=The Old Farmers Almanac|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and temperatures frequently hover in the mid to high twenties Celsius (77F to 86F). The city frequently gets thunderstorms during the summer, averaging 27 per season.&lt;ref name="Most thunderstorm days"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=35&amp;submit=Submit |title=Most thunderstorm days |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=2012-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120050234/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=35&amp;submit=Submit |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city can occasionally have short blasts of hot weather like on 23 August 2011 the temperature reached {{convert|37.2|C|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=MAN&amp;StationID=47407&amp;dlyRange=2008-07-03%7C2012-10-02&amp;Year=2011&amp;Month=8&amp;Day=01 |title=Daily Data Report for August 2011 |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120050309/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=MAN&amp;StationID=47407&amp;dlyRange=2008-07-03%7C2012-10-02&amp;Year=2011&amp;Month=8&amp;Day=01 |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature reaches at or above {{convert|30|C|0}} 14 times a year, which is ranked the 16th highest in Canada, just above [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=10&amp;submit=Submit |title=Most hot days (30°C or above) |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=4 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120050351/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=10&amp;submit=Submit |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg (since commencement of record-keeping in 1873) was {{convert|42.2|C|0}} on 11 July 1936;&lt;ref name="Daily Data Report for July 1936"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=CA&amp;StationID=3703&amp;Year=1936&amp;Month=7&amp;Day=29 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130120050236/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&amp;Prov=CA&amp;StationID=3703&amp;Year=1936&amp;Month=7&amp;Day=29 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 January 2013 |title=Daily Data Report for July 1936 |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=31 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hottest temperature recorded in the past 25 years was {{convert|38.7|C|0}} on 6 August 1988 and again on 1 August 1989.

===Spring and autumn===
[[File:Forks Riverwalk.jpg|thumb|upright|Assiniboine River walkway near [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]] in fall]]
The weather during these seasons is highly variable, and rapidly changing. For example, temperatures in Winnipeg in April have ranged from {{convert|-6.3|C|0}} to {{convert|34.3|C|0}}, and in October from {{convert|-6|C|0}} to {{convert|30.5|C|0}}.

==Flooding==
{{further information|Red River Floodway}}
[[File:2005 Winnipeg Flood.JPG|thumb|[[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]] during the 2005 flood]]
Because of its flat topography and substantial snowfall, Winnipeg is subject to severe flooding. The [[Red River of the North|Red River]] reached its greatest flood height in 1826, and this event still remains the highest flood stage of the last two hundred years.

[[File:Red River Floodway from the air.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red River Floodway]] from the air]]
A major flood in 1950 caused a State of Emergency to be declared and the Canadian Army was brought in to protect residents and property. Because of the flood, 100,000 residents were evacuated from their homes and approximately 10,000 homes were destroyed, along with many hospitals, schools and businesses. The flood prompted the [[Politics of Manitoba|Government of Manitoba]], under former [[Premier of Manitoba|Premier]] [[Dufferin Roblin]], to build the [[Red River Floodway]]. The floodway is colloquially referred to as Duff's Ditch, and is a {{convert|47|km|abbr=on|0}} long diversion channel that protects Winnipeg from flooding.&lt;ref name=DuffsDitch/&gt;

Construction on the floodway project began 6 October 1962 and cost $63&amp;nbsp;million. The project resulted in excavation of approximately 76.5&amp;nbsp;million cubic metres of earth. Completed in March 1968, it has successfully prevented over $10&amp;nbsp;billion in flood damages.&lt;ref name=DuffsDitch&gt;{{cite web|title=Duff’s Ditch|url=http://www.floodwayauthority.mb.ca/duffsditch_history.html|publisher=Province of Manitoba Floodway Authority|accessdate=7 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622160804/http://www.floodwayauthority.mb.ca/duffsditch_history.html|archivedate=22 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flood control]] system prevented flooding in 1974 and 1979 when water levels neared record levels. However, in the [[1997 Red River Flood]], water threatened the city's relatively unprotected southwest corner. Flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags and the threat was averted. Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to cities without flood control structures, such as [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]].

Other related [[Interbasin water diversion|water diversion]] projects farther away from Winnipeg include the [[Portage Diversion]] (also known as the Assiniboine River Floodway) and the [[Shellmouth Reservoir]].

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Horned1b.jpg|thumb|200px| The great horned owl can be found in Winnipeg.]]

Winnipeg is situated where [[tall grass prairie]] meets [[aspen parkland]] and is not very far from boreal coniferous forests of the rocky [[Canadian Shield]]. The tall grass prairie areas are notable for its endangered [[Platanthera praeclara|western prairie fringed orchid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct1/searchdetail_e.cfm?id=200&amp;StartRow=1&amp;boxStatus=All&amp;boxTaxonomic=All&amp;location=All&amp;change=All&amp;board=All&amp;commonName=orchid&amp;scienceName=&amp;returnFlag=0&amp;Page=1 |title=Fringed-orchid, Western Prairie |publisher=Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada |accessdate=7 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706183933/http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct1/searchdetail_e.cfm?id=200&amp;StartRow=1&amp;boxStatus=All&amp;boxTaxonomic=All&amp;location=All&amp;change=All&amp;board=All&amp;commonName=orchid&amp;scienceName=&amp;returnFlag=0&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Goedeke, T | author2 = Sharma, J | author3 = Delphey, P | author4 = Marshall Mattson, K | title = ''Platanthera praeclara'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2008 | page = e.T132834A3464336 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2008 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/132834/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T132834A3464336.en | access-date = 12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prairie grasses include big bluestem and spear grasses; and wildflowers include aster, goldenrod, prairie crocus and lady's-slipper.&lt;ref name="winnipeg.ca"&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/publicworks/naturalist/ns/natureareas/Background.asp |title=Background (Natural History Perspective of Winnipeg) |publisher=City of Winnipeg |accessdate=7 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306074227/http://www.winnipeg.ca/publicworks/naturalist/ns/natureareas/Background.asp |archivedate=6 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some birds found around Winnipeg include [[Ferruginous hawk|ferruginous]] and [[Swainson's hawk|Swainson's]] hawks; [[Screech owl|screech]] and [[great horned owl|great horned]] owls; as well as [[Canada geese]] and [[mallard]]s.&lt;ref name="winnipeg.ca"/&gt; Winnipeg is also home of the largest remaining mature urban elm forest in North America.&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"&gt;{{vcite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:U7AAwQdD5RsJ:www.winnipeg.ca/publicworks/Forestry/PAMPHLETS/wpgtreefctspamph.doc+winnipegs+urban+forest&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj6twoB9j5pr8LCy-B5at1q3SiNAAg3nB_XX31xYZCcHrUfmlanQ03gMs6lnkSC7xZnc0Q6v6erQz-u9v3Pxd-67LPq7TMIT99mtEJemLGXvO1-0w3otcMT24ef19gHiGsBAcQ8&amp;sig=AHIEtbR4jcb55tkJJWpWhIYoRkD1a0qYaQ|title=WINNIPEG TREE FACTS|publisher=City of Winnipeg|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of Winnipeg's 8 million trees include elm, ash, maple, oak, poplar, basswood, willow, birch, spruce, pine, cedar, as well as some fruit trees and shrubs.&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt; The [[Red River of the North|Red River]] is the home of a number of species of fish including [[catfish]], [[goldeye]], and [[walleye]].

The '''Global Planners Network''' (commonly abbreviated to GPN) is a group of [[spatial planning]] institutes and other organisations, who have signed the [[Vancouver Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Declaration: http://www.globalplannersnetwork.org/pdf/06declarationenglish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Members sign this declaration to show their commitment to working "together, and with others, to tackle the challenges of rapid urbanisation, the urbanisation of poverty and the hazards posed by climate change and natural disasters." Current GPN membership extends to 25 organisations representing more than 150,000 planners.

==History==
The Global Planners Network was founded in 2006 at the first World Planners Congress in [[Vancouver]], as an informal collaboration. This Congress was held on June 17 to June 20, 2006, and was hosted by the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Planning Institute of British Columbia]], in collaboration with the [[Commonwealth Association of Planners]].  It directly preceded and fed into the third World Urban Forum (WUF3), organised by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ([[UN-HABITAT]]) in Vancouver and facilitated and funded by the [[Government of Canada]].

The Global Planners Network held a second Congress directly preceding the fourth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF4) in [[Nanjing]], China 2008, in nearby [[Zhenjiang]]. The Congress was organised by the [[American Planning Association]] and the Zhenjiang Municipal People's Government.&lt;ref&gt;Zhenjiang Municipal People's Government: http://www.zhenjiang.gov.cn&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Planners Network founder members attended WUF4, which was hosted by the UN-HABITAT, and the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development]], PRC. At a WUF4 UN-Habitat Seminar ‘Global Planners Network Messages &amp; Outreach’&lt;ref&gt;UN-HABITAT Seminar http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=535&amp;cid=5933#55&lt;/ref&gt; the GPN presented its Communiqué&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué: http://www.globalplannersnetwork.org/pdf/08gpncommunique.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and latest Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan: http://www.globalplannersnetwork.org/pdf/08closingplenarymemo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission &amp; Priorities==
The Global Planners Network mission was first set out at the first Global Planners Congress World Planners Congress 2006, in the Vancouver Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;As point 1 above - Vancouver Declaration&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives in this Declaration were shaped by discussions at the Congress and a position paper &lt;ref&gt;Reinventing Planning: www.rtpi.org.uk/download/5176/reinventingplanning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on what was termed "new urban planning." At the second Global Planners Congress, held in Zhenjiang from 31 October to 2 November 2008, the commitment was engraved in a commemorative stone at the Congress venue:

''"Building on the 2006 Vancouver Declaration, the Global Planners Network steers towards harmonious settlements, places in harmony with nature and places where there is harmony between people. We champion planning as a strategic, integrative, inclusive and pro-poor process. As a tool for urban development and environmental management, effective planning alleviates poverty, reduces inequality, slows down slum formation, mitigates hazards and builds safe, inclusive settlements. We leave Zhenjiang renewing our commitment to increase the global capacity to plan and manage settlements in timely, affordable and harmonious ways. We will continue to bring planners together and strengthen their links with communities, professionals, politicians and civil society to enhance the quality and future resilience of human settlements."'' Professor Stuart Emin has been made Honorary Member of the organisation.

'''Guting District''' ({{zh|c=古亭區|p=Gǔtíng Qū}}) was a [[District (Taiwan)|district]] in [[Taipei]], [[Republic of China]], located in the southwestern part of Taipei.

== History ==
The name “Guting” is derived from the ancient place name Ku-ting ({{lang-nan|Kóo-tîng}}).

After [[History of Taipei#Japanese rule and leadership|Taihoku City]] was established in 1920, in 1922, the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Colonial Government]] carried out the {{nihongo4|Correction of Villages' Name|町名改正|chōmei kaisei}}. There were 11 {{nihongo|villages|町|chō}} in the area of later Guting District: {{nihongo|Shineichō|新榮町}}, {{nihongo|Chitosechō|千歳町}}, {{nihongo|Kodamachō|兒玉町}}, {{nihongo|Sakumachō|佐久間町}},  {{nihongo|Nanmonchō|南門町}}, {{nihongo|Ryūkōchō|龍口町}}, {{nihongo|Babachō|馬場町}}, {{nihongo|Kawabatachō|川端町}}, {{nihongo|Koteichō|古亭町}}, {{nihongo|Suidōchō|水道町}} and {{nihongo|Tomitachō|富田町}}.

In 1946, the Taiwan Province Administrative Official Public Ministry ({{lang|zh|臺灣省行政長官公署}}) made those villages incorporated as Guting District.

In 1990, 16 districts in Taipei City were consolidated into the current 12 districts. Most of Guting District were merged into [[Zhongzheng District]] ({{lang|zh|中山區}}) along with [[Chengzhong District, Taipei|Chengzhong District]] ({{lang|zh|城中區}}), moreover the rest were annexed into [[Da'an District, Taipei|Daan District]] ({{lang|zh|大安區}}) and [[Wanhua District]] ({{lang|zh|萬華區}}).

== Geography ==
Guting District bordered Chengzhong District ({{lang|zh|城中區}}) to the north, Daan District ({{lang|zh|大安區}}) to the east, [[Shuangyuan District]] ({{lang|zh|雙園區}}) to the west and [[Longshan District, Taipei|Longshan District]] ({{lang|zh|龍山區}}) to the northwest. The [[Xindian River]] ({{lang|zh|新店溪}}) run by its south.

'''Hermann Berghaus''' (born [[Herford]], [[Westphalia]], 16 November 1828; died [[Gotha]], 3 December 1890) was a [[Germany|German]] [[cartographer]].

==Biography==
He was a nephew of [[Heinrich Berghaus]].  During most of his life, he was cartographer in the Geographical Institute of [[Justus Perthes]] at Gotha. His best known work is a chart of the world (1863) which went through at least 11 editions. He also prepared a ''Physikalische Wandkarte von Afrika'' (''Physical wall map of Africa'', 1881). Besides this, he supervised the revision of his famous uncle's ''Physikalischer Atlas'' (1886), which project was participated in by many noted specialists.

'''Hugh C. Brooks''' (June 19, 1922{{snd}}October 8, 2008) was an American [[Economic geography|economic geographer]], author, educator, and [[historian]] who specialized in the history and political economy of Africa.

==Life and career==
Hugh Campbell Brooks was born in Seattle, Washington, on June 19, 1922. He served in the U.S. Army (1941-1946), where he was a member of Regimental HQ Company, 310th Infantry, 78th Division, and received the [[Bronze Star]], [[Purple Heart]], and [[Silver Star]] for his service in the European Theater.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;"Hugh C. Brooks," ''Contemporary Authors Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91478869&amp;ref=acom "PFC Hugh C Brooks," ''Find A Grave'' website].&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, where he received the B.A. in 1947, and then the M.A. from the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|lnstitute of International Relations]] in Geneva in 1948. Brooks began teaching Geography at [[Oregon State University]] in Corvallis (1950-1951), and then taught at [[Teachers College]], [[Columbia University]], where he received the M.A. (1952) and Ed.D. (1954). His dissertation topic was "Directed Studies in Introductory College Geography." He also taught at [[Hunter College]], 1952-1954.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

A [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright award]] enabled Brooks to lecture at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] from 1955-1957, where he worked under Dr. John Wellington, before he began teaching at [[Kean University|Newark State College]] as an Associate Professor of Geography, 1957-1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalmemory.stjohns.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/alumnews1960/id/94/rec/7 "University Establishes African Institute: Brooks Named Director,"] ''St. John's University Alumni News'', Vol. 3, no. 3 (Nov. 1961): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks then joined the faculty of [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in 1961 as Associate Professor of Geography and Director of their Institute of African Studies, to "prepare students to work in Africa, or for organizations working within the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalmemory.stjohns.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/redman/id/1129/rec/2 Brooks, Hugh C. "The African Institute,"] ''Redman: St. John's University Alumni Magazine'', Vol. 10, no. 2 (Winter 1961-62): 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; When the African Center was discontinued, Brooks was made a member of the History Department, where he remained until his retirement, and was the Department Chair in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Brooks was elected as a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society (London)]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalmemory.stjohns.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/humanitas/id/14 "News from the Institutes,"] ''The St. John's University Humanities Newsletter'', Vol. 1, no. 3 (Spring 1965): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks' first wife, Savina Vicini, died in 1994. They had two children, Robert and Alison. (Robert "Bobby" Brooks was an entertainment agent who died in the same helicopter crash with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan#Death|Stevie Ray Vaughan]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-29/news/mn-212_1_bobby-brooks-service "Bobby Brooks Service to Be Held Thursday,"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' Aug. 29, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks then married Beatrice Shelley and lived in Pembroke Pines, Florida, until his death in 2008.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=hugh-campbell-brooks&amp;pid=118682334 "Obituary of Hugh Campbell Brooks,"] ''New York Times'', Oct. 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Brooks co-authored a textbook (with George T. Renner), ''Directed Studies in Introductory College Geography'' (1958), as well as (with Bertrand P. Boucher) ''Field Trips in New Jersey'' (1962), and (with Richard Keppel) ''Effective Teaching With Aero-View Transparencies: A Comprehensive Visual Presentation of the Geography, History and Economic Assets of the United States of America'' (1964). While consulting with McGraw-Hill, Sadlier, and Grolier in the late 1960s, he developed several textbooks for younger students, including ''Africa: A High School Geography'' (1966), ''Africa: A Junior High School Geography'' (1966), and ''The Old World: Africa'' (1968). He co-authored several books on African geography and culture:  (with Michael G. Mensoian) ''Arab World, New Africa'' (1969); (with [[Yosef Ben-Jochannan|Yosef ben-Jochannan]] and Kempton Webb) ''Africa: Lands, Peoples, and Cultures of the World'' (1969); and (with William Norris, and David Dicker) ''The People of New Africa'' (1972).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Brooks also produced three books with colleagues from St. John's: (co-editor with Yassin El-Ayouty) ''Refugees South of the Sahara: An African Dilemma'' (1970); (co-editor with Yassin El-Ayouty) ''Africa and International Organization'' (1974); and (with Francis A. Lees) ''The Economic and Political Development of the Sudan'' (1977). He also contributed articles on seven African countries to Grolier's ''Lands and Peoples'' reference set, which was first published in 1972 but subsequently went through over ten editions. Brooks worked with the Image Bank in the late 1980s to select photographs for a projected coffee-table book, ''Africa: The Land and the People'', but it was never published.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Inclusive fitness in humans''' is the application of [[inclusive fitness]] theory to human social behaviour, relationships and cooperation.

Inclusive fitness theory (and the related [[kin selection]] theory) are general theories in [[evolutionary biology]] that propose a method to understand the evolution of social behaviours in organisms. While various ideas related to these theories have been influential in the study of the social behaviour of non-human organisms, their application to human behaviour has been debated.

Inclusive fitness theory is broadly understood to describe a ''statistical'' criterion by which social traits can ''evolve'' to become widespread in a population of organisms. However, beyond this some scientists have interpreted the theory to make predictions about how the ''expression'' of social behavior is mediated in both humans and other animals – typically that genetic relatedness determines the expression of social behaviour. Other biologists and anthropologists maintain that beyond its statistical evolutionary relevance the theory does not necessarily imply that genetic relatedness ''per se'' determines the ''expression'' of social behavior in organisms. Instead, the expression of social behavior may be mediated by correlated conditions, such as shared location, shared rearing environment, &lt;!--should this item have an "and" before it, as last item in the list? Let us allow that the word 'or' here provides the grammatical conjunction--&gt;familiarity or other contextual cues which correlate with shared genetic relatedness, thus meeting the statistical evolutionary criteria without being deterministic. While the former position still attracts controversy, the latter position has a better empirical fit with anthropological data about human [[kinship]] practices, and is accepted by cultural anthropologists.

==History==

Applying evolutionary biology perspectives to humans and human society has often resulted in periods of controversy and debate, due to their apparent incompatibility with alternative perspectives about humanity. Examples of early controversies include the [[Reactions to On the Origin of Species|reactions to ''On the Origin of Species'']], and the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. Examples of later controversies more directly connected with inclusive fitness theory and its use in [[sociobiology]] include physical confrontations at meetings of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]] and more often intellectual arguments such as Sahlins' 1976 book ''The use and abuse of biology'', Lewontin et al.'s 1984 ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', and Kitcher's 1985 ''Vaulting Ambition:Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature''. Some of these later arguments were produced by other scientists, including biologists and anthropologists, against Wilson's 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'', which was influenced by (though not necessarily endorsed by) Hamilton's work on inclusive fitness theory.

A key debate in applying inclusive fitness theory to humans has been between biologists and anthropologists around the extent to which human [[kinship]] relationships (considered to be a large component of human solidarity and altruistic activity and practice) are necessarily based on or influenced by genetic relationships or blood-ties ('consanguinity'). The position of most [[Social anthropology|social anthropologists]] is summarized by Sahlins (1976), that for humans "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' [kin] vary independently of consanguinal distance and that these categories organize actual social practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;112). Biologists wishing to apply the theory to humans directly disagree, arguing that "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' do not 'vary independently of consanguinal distance', not in any society on earth." (Daly et al. 1997, p282).

This disagreement is central because of the way the association between blood ties/genetic relationships and altruism are conceptualized by many biologists. It is frequently understood by biologists that inclusive fitness theory makes predictions about ''how behaviour is mediated'' in both humans and other animals. For example, a recent experiment conducted on humans by the evolutionary psychologist [[Robin Dunbar]] and colleagues was, as they understood it, designed "to test the prediction that altruistic behaviour is mediated by Hamilton's rule" (inclusive fitness theory) and more specifically that "If participants follow Hamilton's rule, investment (time for which the [altruistic] position was held) should increase with the recipient's relatedness to the participant. In effect, we tested whether investment flows differentially down channels of relatedness." From their results, they concluded that "''human altruistic behaviour is mediated by Hamilton's rule ... humans behave in such a way as to maximize inclusive fitness: they are more willing to benefit closer relatives than more distantly related individuals.''" (Madsen et al. 2007). This position continues to be rejected by social anthropologists as being incompatible with the large amount of ethnographic data on kinship and altruism that their discipline has collected over many decades, that demonstrates that in many human cultures, kinship relationships (accompanied by altruism) do not necessarily map closely onto genetic relationships.

Whilst the above understanding of inclusive fitness theory as necessarily making predictions about how human kinship and altruism is mediated is common amongst evolutionary psychologists, other biologists and anthropologists have argued that it is at best a limited (and at worst a mistaken) understanding of inclusive fitness theory. These scientists argue that the theory is better understood as simply describing an ''evolutionary'' criterion for the emergence of altruistic behaviour, which is explicitly statistical in character, not as predictive of ''proximate'' or ''mediating'' mechanisms of altruistic behaviour, which may not necessarily be determined by genetic relatedness (or blood ties) ''per se''. These alternative non-deterministic and non-reductionist understandings of inclusive fitness theory and human behavior have been argued to be compatible with anthropologists' decades of data on human kinship, and compatible with anthropologists' perspectives on human kinship. This position (e.g. [[nurture kinship]]) has been largely accepted by social anthropologists, whilst the former position (still held by evolutionary psychologists, see above) remains rejected by social anthropologists.

== Theoretical background ==
{{see also|Inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}

===Theoretical overview ===

Inclusive fitness theory, first proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]] in the early 1960s, proposes a selective criterion for the potential evolution of social traits in organisms, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism's survival and reproduction could nevertheless emerge under certain conditions. The key condition relates to the statistical likelihood that significant benefits of a social trait or behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait. [[Inclusive fitness]] theory is a general treatment of the statistical probabilities of social traits accruing to any other organisms likely to propagate a copy of the same social trait. [[Kin selection]] theory treats the narrower but more straightforward case of the benefits accruing to close genetic relatives (or what biologists call 'kin') who may also carry and propagate the trait. Under conditions where the social trait sufficiently correlates (or more properly, ''regresses'') with other likely bearers, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.

The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an "altruism gene" (or complex of genes or heritable factors) that influence an organism's behavior in such a way that is helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior can also increase the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descent. In formal terms, if such a complex of genes arises, Hamilton's rule (rb&gt;c) specifies the selective criteria (in terms of relatedness (r), cost (c) benefit (b)) for such a trait to increase in frequency in the population (see [[Inclusive fitness]] for more details). Hamilton noted that inclusive fitness theory does not by itself predict that a given species will necessarily evolve such altruistic behaviors, since an opportunity or context for interaction between individuals is a more primary and necessary requirement in order for any social interaction to occur in the first place. As Hamilton put it, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start." (Hamilton 1987, 420).&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;Hamilton, W.D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In ''Kin recognition in animals'', edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whilst inclusive fitness theory specifies a set of necessary criteria for the evolution of certain altruistic traits, it does not specify a sufficient condition for their evolution in any given species, since the typical ecology, demographics and life pattern of the species must also allow for social interactions between individuals to occur, before any potential elaboration of social traits can evolve in regard to those interactions.

===Initial presentations of the theory===

The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s, see ''[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]]'') focused on making the general mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution. However, since many [[Ethology|field biologists]] mainly use theory as a guide to their observations and analysis of empirical phenomena, Hamilton also speculated about possible proximate behavioural mechanisms that might be observable in organisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers:

{{quote|The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to [[inclusive fitness]] would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (Hamilton 1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1964 1–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1964 |title=[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour]] |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hamilton here was suggesting two broad proximate mechanisms by which social traits might meet the criterion of correlation specified by the theory:

'''[[Kin recognition]] (active discrimination)''': if a social trait enables an organism to distinguish between different degrees of genetic relatedness when interacting in a mixed population,  and to discriminate (positively) in performing social behaviours on the basis of detecting genetic relatedness, then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough to meet the criterion. In another section of the same paper (page 54) Hamilton considered whether 'supergenes' that identify copies of themselves in others might evolve to give more accurate information about genetic relatedness. He later (1987, see below) considered this to be wrong-headed and withdrew the suggestion.

'''Viscous populations (spatial cues)''': even indiscriminate altruism may achieve the correlation in 'viscous' populations where individuals have low rates of [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] or short distances of dispersal from their home range (their location of birth). Here, social partners are typically genealogically closely related, and so altruism can flourish even in the absence of [[kin recognition]] and kin discrimination faculties – spatial proximity and circumstantial cues provide the necessary correlation.

These two alternative suggestions had important effects on how field biologists understood the theory and what they looked for in the behavior of organisms. Within a few years biologists were looking for evidence that 'kin recognition' mechanisms might occur in organisms, assuming this was a necessary prediction of inclusive fitness theory, leading to a sub-field of 'kin recognition' research.

===Later theoretical refinements===
{{See also|kin recognition}}

A common source of confusion around inclusive fitness theory is that Hamilton's early analysis included some inaccuracies, that, ''although corrected by him in later publications'', are often not fully understood by other researchers who attempt to apply inclusive fitness to understanding organisms' behaviour. For example, Hamilton had initially suggested that the statistical correlation in his formulation could be understood by a correlation coefficient of genetic relatedness, but quickly accepted [[George R. Price|George Price's]] correction that a general regression coefficient was the more relevant metric, and together they published corrections in 1970. A related confusion is the connection between inclusive fitness and [[multi-level selection]], which are often incorrectly assumed to be mutually exclusive theories. The regression coefficient helps to clarify this connection:

{{quote|Because of the way it was first explained, the approach using inclusive fitness has often been identified with 'kin selection' and presented strictly as an alternative to 'group selection'. But the foregoing discussion shows that kinship should be considered just one way of getting positive regression of genotype in the recipient, and that it is this positive regression that is vitally necessary for altruism. Thus the inclusive-fitness concept is more general than 'kin selection'.(Hamilton 1996 [1975], 337)&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1975 |title=Innate social aptitudes of man: an approach from evolutionary genetics |journal=Biosocial anthropology |volume=133 |pages=155 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hamilton also later modified his thinking about likely mediating mechanisms whereby social traits achieve the necessary correlation with genetic relatedness. Specifically he corrected his earlier speculations that an innate ability (and 'supergenes') to recognise actual genetic relatedness was a likely mediating mechanism for kin altruism:

{{quote|But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees. (Hamilton 1987, 425)&lt;ref name="H1987"/&gt;}}

The point about inbreeding avoidance is significant, since the whole genome of sexual organisms benefits from avoiding close inbreeding; there is a different selection pressure at play compared to the selection pressure on social traits (see [[Kin recognition]] for more information).

{{quote|It does not follow… that ability to discriminate degrees of relatedness automatically implies that kin selection is the model relevant to its origin. In fact, since even earlier than Darwin, it had been realised that most organisms tend to avoid closely inbred matings. The reasons must have to do with the function of sexuality and this is not quite yet resolved (see e.g. Bell, 1982; Shields, 1982; Hamilton, 1982); but whatever the function is, here must be another set of reasons for discriminating. Some animals clearly do use discrimination for purposes of mate selection. Japanese quail for example evidently use an early imprinting of their chick companions towards obtaining, much later, preferred degrees of consanguinity in their mates (Bateson 1983). (Hamilton 1987, 419)}}

Since Hamiton's 1964 speculations about active discrimination mechanisms (above), other theorists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] had clarified that there would be negative selection pressure against mechanisms for genes to recognize copies of themselves in other individuals and discriminate socially between them on this basis. Dawkins used his '[[Green-beard effect|Green beard]]' thought experiment, where a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there would be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed via [[Meiotic Drive|meitoic drive]].

===Ongoing misconceptions===

Hamilton's later clarifications often go unnoticed, and because of the long-standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin recognition, some theorists have later tried to clarify the position:

{{quote|[T]he fact that animals benefit from engaging in spatially mediated behaviors is not evidence that these animals can recognize their kin, nor does it support the conclusion that spatially based differential behaviors represent a kin recognition mechanism (see also discussions by Blaustein, 1983; Waldman, 1987; Halpin 1991).  In other words, from an evolutionary perspective it may well be advantageous for kin to aggregate and for individuals to behave preferentially towards nearby kin, whether or not this behaviour is the result of kin recognition per se" (Tang-Martinez 2001, 25)&lt;ref name="TM2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang-Martinez |first=Z. |year=2001 |title=The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00148-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways – kin discrimination or limited dispersal (Hamilton, 1964, 1971,1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p.243 and supplement)&lt;ref name="W2010"&gt;West et al. 2011. Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans. Evolution and Social Behaviour 32 (2011) 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The assumption that 'kin selection requires kin discrimination' has obscured the more parsimonious possibility that spatial-cue-based mediation of social cooperation based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context are commonly found in many organisms that have been studied, including in social mammal species. As Hamilton pointed out, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start" (Hamilton 1987, see above section). Since a reliable context of interaction between social actors is always a [[necessary condition]] for social traits to emerge, a reliable context of interaction is necessarily present to be leveraged by context-dependent cues to mediate social behaviours. Focus on mediating mechanisms of limited dispersal and reliable developmental context has allowed significant progress in applying kin selection and inclusive fitness theory to a wide variety of species, including humans,&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;Holland, Maximilian. (2012) ''[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship]]: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''. North Charleston: Createspace Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of cue-based mediation of [[Social bonding and nurture kinship|social bonding and social behaviours]] (see below).

== Mammal evidence ==

In [[mammal]]s, as well as in other species, [[ecological niche]] and demographic conditions strongly shape typical contexts of interaction between individuals, including the frequency and circumstances surrounding the interactions between genetic relatives. Although mammals exist in a wide variety of ecological conditions and varying demographic arrangements, certain contexts of interaction between genetic relatives are nevertheless reliable enough for selection to act upon. New born mammals are often immobile and always totally dependent (socially dependent if you will) on their carer(s) for nursing with nutrient rich milk and for protection. This fundamental social dependence is a fact of life for all mammals, including humans. These conditions lead to a reliable spatial context in which there is a statistical association of replica genes between a reproductive female and her infant offspring (and has been evolutionary typical) for most mammal species. Beyond this natal context, extended possibilities for frequent interaction between related individuals are more variable and depend on group living vs. solitary living, mating patterns, duration of pre-maturity development, dispersal patterns, and more. For example, in group living [[primate]]s with females remaining in their natal group for their entire lives, there will be lifelong opportunities for interactions between female individuals related through their mothers and grandmothers etc. These conditions also thus provide a spatial-context for cue-based mechanisms to mediate social behaviours.

{{quote|The most widespread and important mechanism for kin recognition in mammals appears to be familiarity through prior association (Bekoff, 1981; Sherman, 1980). During development, individuals learn and respond to cues from the most familiar or most commonly encountered conspecifics in their environment. Individuals respond to familiar individuals as kin and unfamiliar individuals as nonkin. (Erhart et al. 1997, 153–154)}}

{{quote|Mammalian young are born into a wide variety of social situations, ranging from being isolated from all other individuals except their mother (and possibly other siblings) to being born into large social groups. Although siblings do interact in a wide variety of species having different life histories, there are certain conditions, almost all of which have to do with the developmental environment, that will favor a biased occurrence of interactions between littermates and/or different-aged siblings. It will be argued later that it is these, and perhaps other, conditions that ''predispose'' (in a probabilistic way) siblings to interact with one another. However, if two (or more) very young unrelated individuals (assume conspecifics for simplicity) are exposed to these conditions, they too will behave like siblings. That is, although [relatedness] and [familiarity] are tightly linked in many mammals, it is [familiarity] that can override [relatedness], rather than the reverse. (Bekoff 1981, 309)}}

In addition to the above examples, a wide variety of evidence from mammal species supports the finding that shared context and familiarity mediate social bonding, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; Cross-fostering studies (placing unrelated young in a shared developmental environment) strongly demonstrate that unrelated individuals bond and cooperate just as would normal littermates. The evidence therefore demonstrates that bonding and cooperation are mediated by proximity, shared context and familiarity, not via active recognition of genetic relatedness. This is problematic for those biologists who wish to claim that inclusive fitness theory predicts that social cooperation is ''mediated'' via genetic relatedness, rather than understanding the theory simply to state that social traits can ''evolve'' under conditions where there is ''statistical'' association of genetically related organisms. The former position sees the expression of cooperative behaviour as more or less deterministically caused by genetic relatedness, where the latter position does not. The distinction between cooperation mediated by shared context, and cooperation mediated by genetic relatedness ''per se'', has significant implications for whether inclusive fitness theory can be seen as compatible with the anthropological evidence on human social patterns or not. The ''shared context'' perspective is largely compatible, the ''genetic relatedness'' perspective is not (see below).

==Human kinship and cooperation==

The debate about how to interpret the implications of Inclusive fitness theory for human social cooperation has paralleled some of the key misunderstandings outlined above.  Initially, evolutionary biologists interested in humans wrongly assumed that in the human case, 'kin selection requires kin discrimination' along with their colleagues studying other species (see West et al., above). In other words, many biologists assumed that strong social bonds accompanied by altruism and cooperation in human societies (long studied by the anthropological field of kinship) were necessarily built upon recognizing genetic relatedness (or 'blood ties'). This seemed to fit well with historical research in anthropology originating in the nineteenth century (see [[Kinship#History of kinship studies|history of kinship]]) that often assumed that human kinship was built upon a recognition of shared blood ties.

However, independently of the emergence of inclusive fitness theory, from 1960s onwards many anthropologists themselves had reexamined the balance of findings in their own ethnographic data and had begun to reject the notion that human kinship is 'caused by' blood ties (see [[Kinship]]). Anthropologists have gathered very extensive [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] data on human social patterns and behaviour over a century or more, from a wide spectrum of different cultural groups. The data demonstrates that many cultures do not consider 'blood ties' (in the genealogical sense) to underlie their close social relationships and kinship bonds. Instead social bonds are often considered to be based on location-based shared circumstances including living together (co-residence), sleeping close together, working together, sharing food (commensality) and other forms of shared life together. Comparative anthropologists have shown&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; that these aspects of shared circumstances are a significant component of what influences kinship in most human cultures, notwithstanding whether or not 'blood ties' are necessarily present (see [[Nurture kinship]], below).

Although blood ties (and genetic relatedness) often correlate with kinship, just as in the case of mammals (above section), evidence from human societies suggests that it is not the genetic relatedness ''per se'' that is the mediating mechanism of social bonding and cooperation, instead it is the shared context (albeit typically consisting of genetic relatives) and the familiarity that arises from it, that mediate the social bonds. This implies that genetic relatedness is not the ''determining mechanism'' nor required for the formation of social bonds in kinship groups, or for the expression of altruism in humans, even if statistical correlations of genetic relatedness are an ''evolutionary criterion'' for the emergence of such social traits in biological organisms over evolutionary timescales. Understanding this distinction between the ''statistical role of genetic relatedness in the evolution of social traits'' and yet its ''lack of necessary determining role in mediating mechanisms of social bonding and the expression of altruism'' is key to inclusive fitness theory's proper application to human social behaviour (as well as to other mammals).

===Nurture kinship===
{{Main article|Nurture kinship}}

Compatible with biologists' emphasis on familiarity and shared context mediating social bonds, the concept of [[nurture kinship]] in the anthropological study of human social relationships highlights the extent to which such relationships are brought into being through the performance of various acts of sharing, acts of care and performance of [[nurture]] between individuals who live in close proximity. Additionally the concept highlights ethnographic findings that, in a wide swath of human societies, people understand, conceptualize and symbolize their relationships predominantly in terms of giving, receiving and sharing nurture. The concept stands in contrast to the earlier anthropological concepts of human kinship relations being fundamentally based on "blood ties", some other form of shared substance, or a proxy for these (as in [[fictive kinship]]), and the accompanying notion that people universally understand their social relationships predominantly in these terms.

The nurture kinship perspective on the ontology of social ties, and how people conceptualize them, has become stronger in the wake of [[David M. Schneider]]'s influential ''Critique of the Study of Kinship''&lt;sup&gt;[[Nurture kinship|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and Holland's subsequent ''[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship]]: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological approaches'', demonstrating that as well as the ethnographic record, ''biological theory and evidence'' also more strongly support the ''nurture'' perspective than the ''blood'' perspective. Both Schneider and Holland argue that the earlier ''blood'' theory of kinship derived from an unwarranted extension of symbols and values from anthropologists' own cultures (see [[ethnocentrism]]).

'''''Lady Washington''''' is a ship name shared by at least four different 80-100 ton-class [[Sloop-of-war]] and merchant sailing vessels during two different time periods. The original sailed during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and harassed British shipping.  Post war, the vessel was used as a merchant trading vessel in the Pacific. A somewhat updated modern replica was created in 1989. The replica has appeared in numerous films and television shows, standing in as other real or fictional ships.

== ''Lady Washington'' (18th century original) ==
The original ''Lady Washington'', or more commonly, ''Washington''{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, was a 90-ton [[brig]]. Her early history is documented in the ''Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Massachusetts soldiers and sailors of the Revolutionary War: A compilation from the archives, prepared and published by the Secretary of the Commonwealth in accordance with chapter 100, resolves of 1891 | publisher=Wright and Potter Printing Co., State Printers | series=Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War: A Compilation from the Archives | issue=v. 7 | year=1900 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zucQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA498 |  page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other documents. As part of the [[Columbia Expedition]], she left [[Boston Harbor]] on October 1, 1787. She sailed around [[Cape Horn]] and participated in the [[maritime fur trade]] with the coastal [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and in [[tea]] and [[porcelain]] across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] in [[China]]. She was the first American-flagged vessel to round Cape Horn. She was the first recorded vessel to make landfall on the Oregon coast near [[Tillamook, Oregon]]. [[John Meares]] claimed that she was the first non-native vessel to circumnavigate [[Vancouver Island]].

Named in honor of [[Martha Washington]], she was captained during the [[American Revolutionary War]] by Naler Hatch, and post war by [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]], and [[John Kendrick (American sea captain)|John Kendrick]], former captain of her larger sailing partner, ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'' and commander of the expedition. At the end of the first trading season, Kendrick ordered Gray to sail ''Columbia'' to China, while Kendrick took command of ''Lady Washington'' . Under the command of Kendrick, she was refitted in [[Macau]] as a [[brigantine]].

''Lady Washington'' became the first American vessel to reach [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alexa Chipman|url=http://ladywashington.net/|title=Lady Washington: Age of Exploration Merchant Vessel|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an unsuccessful attempt to move some unsold [[Fur|pelt]]s. ''Lady Washington'' remained in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] trade and eventually foundered in the [[Philippines]] in 1797. She was lost at the mouth of the Mestizo River, near Vigan, northwest Luzon in July 1797.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.shipwrecks-Philippines.com|title=Shipwrecks of the Philippines|type=ebook|author=Tom Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Lady Washington'' (20th-century replica)==
[[Image:Lady Washington replica.jpg|thumb|left|''Lady Washington'' at Port of [[Edmonds, Washington|Edmonds]]]]
[[Image:Lady Washington 2007.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Lady Washington'' on [[Morro Bay]] in California]]

A [[ship replica]] of ''Lady Washington'' was built in [[Aberdeen, Washington]], [[United States]] in time for the 1989 Washington State Centennial celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/lady-washington/|title=Lady Washington|work=historicalseaport.org|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberdeen is located on [[Grays Harbor]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean named for Robert Gray, the man who entered the harbor under sail for the first time as [[Master Mariner|master]] of ''Columbia''.

Named "[[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State's]] [[Tall ship|Tall Ship]] Ambassador", as well as the State Ship,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Symbols/|title=State Symbols|publisher=Washington State Legislature|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new ''Lady Washington'' is operated by a professional and volunteer crew under the auspices of the [[Grays Harbor Historical Seaport Authority]]. She sails up and down the Pacific coast, regularly in pair with ''[[Hawaiian Chieftain]]'', educating students in the history of merchant trading, life of common sailors, and responsibilities of the ship's officers.

The current replica's mainmast is rigged with a [[topgallant sail]] and [[topsail]] above a [[gaff sail|gaff mainsail]], as based on the post-Macau refit configuration. Old World (UK/international) terminology refers to this sail plan as [[brigantine]], and New World (American) terminology refers to this as a [[brig]]. (Refer to the explanation sections on the [[brig]], [[brigantine]], and [[sail plan]] pages for more information.)

===Film and television appearances===
''Lady Washington'' has appeared in various films, portraying HMS ''Interceptor'' in the film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' and the [[brig]] ''Enterprise'', a namesake of the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']], on the [[holodeck]] in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. She provided the basis for the RLS ''Legacy'' in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated feature ''[[Treasure Planet]]''. She also transported Chinese immigrants to America in the IMAX film ''[[The Great American West]]''. On television, the ship played a prominent role in the miniseries ''[[Blackbeard (2006 film)|Blackbeard]]'', and has appeared in the music video for rapper [[Macklemore| Macklemore's]] ''[[Can't Hold Us]]'' and as [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Captain Hook]]'s ship the ''Jolly Roger'' on [[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|''Once Upon a Time'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4043">'''Laurence Pullar''' [[FRSE]] [[Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]] FRSGS LLD (1838–1926) was a 19th-century Scottish businessman, geographer and philanthropist. A close friend of [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]] he appears to have done much to fund and/or underwrite the cost of the [[Challenger Expedition]].&lt;ref name="19thcenturyscience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/Chall-Medal/archive/Challenger%20Medal-RETRY.htm|website=19thcenturyscience.org|title=HMSC/Chall-Medal/archive/Challenger%20Medal-RETRY|accessdate=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Pullar Memorial, Logie Kirkyard.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pullar Memorial, Logie Kirkyard]]
He was born on 13 September 1838 at 36 Mill Street&lt;ref&gt;Perth Post Office Directory 1838&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] the son of [[John Pullar]] (1803–1878) a dyer who later founded '''Pullars of Perth''' and who was Provost of Perth 1867 to 1873. He later became a principal partner in the company, and ran the huge Keirfield Manufacturing Works on the south side of [[Bridge of Allan]], assisted by his younger brother [[Edmund Pullar]].

A keen amateur geographer, Pullar's name attaches to an impressive bathymetric chart of [[Loch Assynt]] dated 1885, and he appears to have been a competent surveyor and draughtsman.&lt;ref&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scottish_geographical_magazine_(1885)_(14597429968).jpg&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this task he appears to have utilised the same equipment as later used by Sir John Murray and entitled by Sir John "Pullar's Sounding Machine".&lt;ref name="rsgsexplorers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsgsexplorers.com/2016/05/03/sir-john-murray-beneath-the-surface/|title=Sir John Murray: beneath the surface &amp;#8211; Jo Woolf|website=rsgsexplorers.com|accessdate=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 Sir John Murray awarded him a Challenger Medal for his contributions to the Challenger Expedition. The Medal reads "in recognition of his generosity in the promotion of scientific research".&lt;ref name="19thcenturyscience"/&gt;

In 1897 Pullar funded the four year survey of Scottish fresh water lochs by Sir John Murray, but on condition that Murray employed his son, Frederick, on the project (who proved more than able). The study resulted in the publication of the "Bathymetrical Survey of Scottish Fresh-Water Lochs" (1908).&lt;ref name="maps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.nls.uk/bathymetric/chart/2156|title=Loch Calder; Loch Shurrery (Vol. 5, Plate 7) - Coasts of Scotland on marine charts, 1580-1831|website=maps.nls.uk|accessdate=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]], [[Alexander Buchan (meteorologist)|Alexander Buchan]], [[George Chrystal]] and [[Arthur Mitchell (physician)|Sir Arthur Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Bridge of Allan]] on 22 December 1926 and was buried in Logie Kirkyard, east of [[Stirling]] with his son [[Frederick Pullar]] and other family members. The double sided memorial has a bronze by sculptor [[George Frampton]].

==Family==

He was married to Ellen Ferguson Pattison. Their children included [[Frederick Pullar]] tragically drowned in 1901.

Laurence's siblings included [[James Pullar|James Frederick Pullar]] and Sir [[Robert Pullar]].

'''Lexus Link''', launched October, 2000, is a subscription-based safety and security service from Lexus. It has been offered as a factory-installed option, available on certain Lexus models (LX, GX, LS, and GS), offering call-center-based [[telematics]] services to owners with equipped vehicles in the United States and Canada. The second-generation Lexus Link system utilizes a dedicated cellular phone (dual-mode CDMA/analog), Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology and 24-hour live-operator support. In 2009, an expanded system with added functionality, [[Safety Connect#Lexus Enform| Lexus Enform]] with [[Safety Connect]], succeeded Lexus Link.

==History==
The first-generation Lexus Link system was a private-labeled brand of OnStar, operating on Verizon Wireless’ cellular network, available as a factory-installed option on the following vehicles in Model Years 2001-04: LS 430 ('01-'04), GX 470 ('03-'04), LX 470 ('03-'04), SC 430 ('03-'04) and RX 330 ('04). The first-generation system was analog-only and is no longer operational.&lt;ref&gt;FCC Report and Order 67 FR 77191, Dec. 17, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-generation Lexus Link system was launched October 2005 as a private-label brand of OEM Telematics Services, available as a factory-installed option on MY 2006 and later LX, GX (vehicles produced October 1, 2005 and later) and MY 2007 and later  LX, GX, LS, GS vehicles and uses dual-mode (digital/analog) technology operating on Verizon Wireless’ cellular network.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

The differences between the first- and second-generation systems are as follows:

==Services==

==Analog Sunset==
Due to the growth and acceptance of digital cellular systems, many cellular carriers have abandoned analog coverage in favor of digital service. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that cellular telephone companies operating in the United States are no longer required to provide analog service after February 2008. As a result, beginning January 1, 2008, Lexus Link service in the U.S. and Canada will only be available through vehicles equipped with dual-mode (analog/digital) equipment.

Since the first-generation Lexus Link system uses analog cellular technology and cannot be modified to digital operation, Lexus offered to disable the Lexus Link system and remove the button panel from the vehicle at no cost for owners of model year 2001–2004 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexus.com/models/allModels/lexuslink_changes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204000550/http://www.lexus.com/models/allModels/lexuslink_changes.html |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }} Upcoming changes to First-Generation Lexus Link Service&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of Munro mountains and Munro Tops in Scotland by height'''.

The list that was originally drawn up by Sir H.T. Munro in the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal in 1891 was unfinished at the time of his death. Munro did not write down a precise definition of what he meant by "sufficient separation", though the character of a mountain did enter into it. Through regular use these hills have become known as the Munros.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   {{As of | October 2018}}, there were 282 Scottish Munros, and 227 Scottish Munro Tops, on the SMC list; totaling 509 summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/hill-lists#Munros|title=Hill Lists: Munros and Munro Tops|quote=The current Munro list contains 282 peaks. The SMC maintains the list of Munros. In recent times the list has only been altered to reflect updates to nationally recognised topographic data (i.e. data recognised and adopted by the Ordnance Survey). We record all such changes as hill news. Munro Tops are the list of distinct Scottish peaks of 3000ft and over, that fail to meet the criteria of "sufficient separation" from their neighboring peaks (see above). There are currently 227 Munro Top.|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the SMC does not use an explicit prominence metric for classifying Munros, all but one of the 282 Munros have a prominence above {{convert|30|m|0}}, the exception being [[Maoile Lunndaidh]] at {{convert|11|m|0}};{{efn|name="maoile"|281 of the 282 Scottish Munros have an official OSI prominence above 30 m, except Maoile Lunndaidh, who was found in a 2014 survey to be lower than nearby [[Creag Toll a' Choin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rhb.org.uk/marhofn/marhofn294/marhofn29409.htm|title=Surveying Report 2014|author=Alan Dawson|publisher=The Relative Hills of Britain (rhb.org.uk)|quote=Creag Toll a'Choin was never officially a twin but turned out to be 0.35m higher than Maoile Lunndaidh. This was a surprise, as some OS maps show Maoile Lunndaidh to be 2m higher, so a second survey was carried out to confirm the finding.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Maoile Lunndaidh had its official prominence downgraded from 400 m to just under 11 m, and the 400 m of prominence given to [[Creag Toll a' Choin]]. Note that Creag Toll a' Choin had previously been a Munro until older surveys downgraded its status in favour of Maoile Lunndaidh.  However, some climbers reject the official prominence figure of 11 m for Maoile Lunndaidh and thus state that all Munros are in fact Murdos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/munros.html|title=Munros | date=2018 | publisher=SteveFallonMunroAdventures|author=Steve Fallon|quote=In addition to Munros, there are also Munro Tops and Murdos.

There are 442 Murdos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?qu=S&amp;rf=890|title=Maoile Lunndaidh|publisher=HillBaggingUK|date=2018|quote=Prominence 10.5m Class Munro}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and apart from [[Am Basteir]], all other Munros have a prominence above {{convert|50|m|1}}.  In contrast, 69 Munro Tops have a prominence below {{convert|30|m|0}}, however, 14 Munro Tops have a prominence above {{convert|100|m|0}}, and the most prominent, [[Stob na Doire]], is {{convert|144|m|0}}.  The Munro Top, Carn na Criche, would rank as the 5th largest Munro, if judged only on height.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;  

{{As of | October 2018}}, 202 of the 282 Munros had a prominence above {{convert|150|m|0}}, often called ''Real Munros'' or [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Marilyns|Marilyns]], while no Munro Top had a prominence above {{convert|150|m|0}} (e.g. no Munro Top was a [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Marilyns|Marilyn]]).

==Munro Tops by height==

This list was downloaded from the DoBIH in October 2018, and is restricted to peaks which the DoBIH marks as being Munro Tops ("MT").{{efn|name="dobih"}}&lt;ref name="dobih"/&gt;  The SMC updates their list of official Munro Tops from time to time, and the DoBIH also updates their measurements as more detailed surveys are recorded, so these tables should not be amended or updated unless the entire DoBIH data is re-downloaded again.

For Munro Tops the hierarchy is shown in Munro's Tables. For a few tops the parent is topographically incorrect on current mapping (i.e. not the hill linked by the highest col), e.g. the SMC parent of 527 Carn Lochan is Cairn Gorm rather than Ben Macdui, the parent of 1015 Stob Cadha Gobhlach is Sgurr Fiona instead of Bidein a' Ghlas Thuill, and the parent of 811 Ciste Dhubh is Mam Sodhail not Carn Eighe."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37894">A '''location-based service''' ('''LBS''') is the name for a general class of policies in software-level services that provide for accessing data, files, pipes, memory objects, streams  and other or online services. Access policies are controlled by [[location (geography)|location]] data and/or time-of-day constraints, or a combination thereof. As such, an LBS is an [[information service|information service]] and has a number of uses in [[social networking]] today as information, in entertainment or security, which is accessible with [[mobile device]]s through the [[mobile network]] and which uses information on the geographical position of the mobile device.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf |conference=2010 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining|doi=10.1109/ICDM.2010.152|title=Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data|year=2010|last1=Quercia|first1=Daniele|last2=Lathia|first2=Neal|last3=Calabrese|first3=Francesco|last4=Di Lorenzo|first4=Giusy|last5=Crowcroft|first5=Jon|isbn=978-1-4244-9131-5|pages=971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "sst"&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot/files/w_other_freegis_documents/articles/lbs_lecturenotes_steinigeretal2006.pdf/download "Foundations of Location Based Services"], Stefan Steiniger, Moritz Neun and Alistair Edwardes, [[University of Zurich]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmworld.com/documents/se23.pdf "Permanent Reference Document SE.23: Location Based Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231095124/http://gsmworld.com/documents/se23.pdf |date=2009-12-31 }}, [[GSM Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shuwang"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://to.swang.googlepages.com/ICC2008LBSforMobilessimplifiedR2.pdf|title=Location Based Services for Mobiles: Technologies and Standards|author1=Shu Wang, Jungwon Min  |author2=Byung K.

LBS is critical to many businesses as well as government organizations to drive real insight from data tied to a specific location where activities take place. The spatial patterns that location-related data and services can provide is one of its most powerful and useful aspects where location is a common denominator in all of these activities and can be leveraged to better understand patterns and relationships. Banking, surveillance, on-line commerce, and many weapon systems are dependent on LBS. 

LBS include services to identify the location&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmapsolutions.com/mobile-location-apps "Mobile Location Apps Review"]&lt;/ref&gt; of a person or object, such as discovering the nearest cash machine ([[Automated teller machine|ATM]]) or the whereabouts of a friend or employee. LBS include parcel tracking and [[vehicle tracking]] services. LBS can include [[mobile commerce]] when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location. They include personalized weather services and even location-based games. They are an example of [[telecommunication convergence]].

This concept of location based systems is not compliant with the standardized concept of [[real-time locating system]]s (RTLS) and related local services, as noted in ISO/IEC 19762-5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=50718&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=40 ISO/IEC 19762-5] Information technology – Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) techniques – Harmonized vocabulary – Part 5: Locating systems&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO/IEC 24730-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38840 ISO/IEC 24730-1] Information technology – Real-time locating systems (RTLS) – Part 1: Application program interface (API)&lt;/ref&gt;  While networked computing devices generally do very well to inform consumers of days old data, the computing devices themselves can also be tracked, even in real-time. LBS privacy issues arise in that context, and are documented below.

==History==
Location-based services (LBS) are a part of virtually all control and policy systems which work in computers today&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Location-based services|date=Dec 7, 2010|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7848765|inventor-last=Phillips|inventor2-last=Schroth|inventor3-last=Palmer|inventor-first=Alan|inventor2-first=Frank|inventor3-first=Geoffrey M.|issue=US7848765 B2|accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=This may be true but needs a source|date=August 2015}}. They have evolved from simple synchronization based service models to authenticated and complex tools for implementing virtually any location based service model or facility.

LBS is the ability to open and close specific data objects based on the use of location and/or time as (controls and triggers) or as part of complex [[cryptography|cryptographic]] key or hashing systems and the data they provide access to. Location based services today are a part of everything from control systems to smart weapons. They are actively used trillions of times a day and may be one of the most heavily used [[application-layer]] [[Decision support system|decision framework]] in computing today. The vision for this was created by Todd Glasey and others in the mid 1990s working inside the American Bar Associations Information Security Committee. Glassey designed basic control policies, which were filed for US patent US6370629 by Glassey's patent agents in 1998 finally. 

Research forerunners of today's location-based services include the infrared Active Badge system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/ab.html Active Badge system, Cambridge University Computer Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; (1989–1993), the [[Ericsson]]-Europolitan [[GSM]] LBS trial by Jörgen Johansson (1995), and the master thesis written by Nokia employee Timo Rantalainen in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Rantalainen, Timo (1995), "Location of Mobile Station in the GSM network", Master's thesis available at Aalto University Otaniemi Main Library (P1 Ark S80).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 International Teletrac Systems (later [[PacTel]] Teletrac), founded in Los Angeles CA, introduced the world's first dynamic real-time [[stolen vehicle recovery]] services. As an adjacency to this they began developing location based services that could transmit information about location-based goods and services to custom-programmed alphanumeric [[Motorola]] [[pager]]s.  In 1996 the US [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC) issued rules requiring all US mobile operators to locate [[emergency call]]ers. This rule was a compromise resulting from US mobile operators seeking the support of the emergency community in order to obtain the same protection from lawsuits relating to emergency calls as fixed-line operators already had.

In 1997 Christopher Kingdon, of Ericsson, handed in the Location Services (LCS) stage 1 description to the joint GSM group of the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) and the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI). As a result, the LCS sub-working group was created under ANSI T1P1.5. This group went on to select positioning methods and standardize Location Services (LCS), later known as Location Based Services (LBS). Nodes defined include the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC), the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC) and concepts such as Mobile Originating Location Request (MO-LR), Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR) and Mobile Terminating Location Request (MT-LR). These use models were not really functional at the application context layer and needed more user-interface controls to make them ubiquitous. Those control came from Glassey's evolving models which expanded these and provided a secondary, more robust and very simple system for controlling digital objects and decision processes based on location and time.

As a result of these efforts in 1999 the first Digital Location Based Service Patent was filed in the US and ultimately issued after nine (9) office actions in March 2002. The patent&lt;ref&gt;US6370629 [http://www.patsnap.com/patents/view/US6370629.html]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} - Controlling Access to Stored Information Based on Location And/Or Time&lt;/ref&gt; has controls which when applied to today's networking models provide key value in all systems.

In 2000, after approval from the worlds 12 largest telecom operators, Ericsson, Motorola and [[Nokia]]  jointly formed and launched the Location Interoperability Forum Ltd (LIF). This forum first specified the [[Mobile Location Protocol]] (MLP), an interface between the telecom network and an LBS application running on a server in the Internet Domain. Then, much driven by the [[Vodafone]] group, LIF went on to specify the Location Enabling Server (LES), a "[[middleware]]", which simplifies the integration of multiple LBS with an operators infrastructure. In 2004 LIF was merged with the [[Open Mobile Association]] (OMA). An LBS work group was formed within the OMA.

In 2002, Marex.com in Miami Florida designed the world first marine asset telemetry device for commercial sale. The device, designed by Marex and engineered by its partner firms in telecom and hardware, was capable of transmitting location data and retrieving location based service data via both cellular and satellite based communications channels. Utilizing the Orbcomm satellite network, the device had multi level SOS features for both MAYDAY and marine assistance, vessel system condition and performance monitoring with remote notification, plus a dedicated hardware device similar to modern GPS units. Based upon the device location, it was capable of providing detailed bearing, distance and communication information to the vessel operator in real time, in addition to the marine assistance/MAYDAY features. The concept and functionality was coined Location Based Services by the principal architect and product manager for Marex, Jason Manowitz, SVP, Product and Strategy, Marex.com, the device was branded as IMAMS or Integrated Marine Asset Management System and the proof of concept beta device was demonstrated to various US government agencies for vessel identification, tracking, and enforcement operations in addition to the commercial product line. The device was capable of tracking assets including ships, planes, shipping containers, or any other mobile asset with a proper power source and antenna placement. Marex's financial challenges were unable to support product introduction and the beta device disappeared.

The first consumer LBS-capable mobile web device was the [[Palm VII]], released in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1999/05/30/the-world-in-your-hand.html The World in Your Hand]. Newsweek. 30 May 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the in-the-box applications made use of the [[ZIP code]]-level positioning information and share the title for first consumer LBS application: the Weather.com app from The Weather Channel, and the&lt;ref name="tarif4you.de"&gt;[http://www.tarif4you.de/news/n10079.html Vodafone Friendzone: Mobile Community auf SMS-Basis Freunde mit Ortungs-Serviceim D2-Netz finden]. tarif4you.de. 8 April 2003 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; TrafficTouch app from Sony-[[Etak]] / Metro Traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://examples.oreilly.com/9781565926004/Sample_Palm_VII_Apps/DevPQA/devpqa3.htm PQA development examples]. O'reilly Palm VII Development&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregbryant.com/lbs/index.html The First Location Based Service] [[Greg Bryant (computer scientist)]]'s Palm VII programming memoir, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first LBS services were launched during 2001 by TeliaSonera in Sweden (FriendFinder, yellow pages, houseposition, emergency call location etc.) and by EMT in Estonia (emergency call location, friend finder, TV game). TeliaSonera and EMT based their services on the Ericsson Mobile Positioning System (MPS).

Other early LBS include friendzone, launched by swisscom in [[Switzerland]] in May 2001, using the technology of valis ltd. The service included friend finder, LBS dating and LBS games. The same service was launched later by [[Vodafone]] Germany, Orange Portugal and Pelephone in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="tarif4you.de"/&gt; Microsoft's Wi-Fi-based indoor location system RADAR (2000), MIT's Cricket project using ultrasound location (2000) and Intel's Place Lab with wide-area location (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anind Dey |author2=Jeffrey Hightower |author3=Eyal de Lara |author4=Nigel Davies |year=2010|title= Location-Based Services|journal=Pervasive Computing|pages= 11–12|doi=10.1109/MPRV.2010.10|volume=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, go2 and [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] launched the first (US) mobile LBS local search application that used Automatic Location Identification (ALI) technologies mandated by the FCC. go2 users were able to use AT&amp;T's ALI to determine their location and search near that location to obtain a list of requested locations (stores, restaurants, etc.) ranked by proximity to the ALI provide by the AT&amp;T wireless network. The ALI determined location was also used as a starting point for [[Turn-by-turn navigation|turn-by-turn]] directions.

The main advantage is that mobile users do not have to manually specify ZIP codes or other location identifiers to use LBS, when they roam into a different location. [[GPS tracking]] is a major enabling ingredient, utilizing access to mobile web.

==Locating methods==
There are a number of ways in which the location of an object, such as a mobile phone or device, can be determined.

===Control plane locating===
With [[control plane]] locating, sometimes referred to as positioning, the mobile phone service provider gets the location based on the radio signal delay of the closest cell-phone towers (for phones without GPS features) which can be quite slow as it uses the 'voice control' channel.&lt;ref name="shuwang" /&gt; In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], networks do not use trilateration; LBS services use a single base station, with a "radius" of inaccuracy, to determine a phone's location. This technique was the basis of the E-911 mandate and is still used to locate cellphones as a safety measure. Newer phones and [[PDA]]s typically have an integrated [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] chip.

In order to provide a successful LBS technology the following factors must be met:
* coordinates accuracy requirements that are determined by the relevant service,
* lowest possible cost,
* minimal impact on network and equipment.

Several categories of methods can be used to find the location of the subscriber.&lt;ref name = "sst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navigationevent.com/pdf/tyntec_kunz.pdf LBS Positioning Methods]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904005038/http://www.navigationevent.com/pdf/tyntec_kunz.pdf |date=September 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple and standard solution is LBS based on [[GPS]] or an alternative [[Satellite navigation|satellite navigation]] system. [[Sony Ericsson]]'s "NearMe" is one such example. It is used to maintain knowledge of the exact location, however can be expensive for the end-user, as they would have to invest in a GPS-equipped handset. GPS is based on the concept of [[trilateration]], a basic geometric principle that allows finding one location if one knows its distance from other, already known locations.

=== Self-reported positioning ===
&lt;!-- Check-in#Social_network links here. --&gt;
A low cost alternative to using location technology to track the player, is to not track at all. This has been referred to as "self-reported positioning". It was used in the [[mixed reality game]] called [[Uncle Roy All Around You]] in 2003 and considered for use in the [[Augmented reality]] games in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Broll | first1 = W. | last2 = Ohlenburg | first2 = J. | last3 = Lindt | first3 = I. | last4 = Herbst | first4 = I. | last5 = Braun | first5 = A.

===Other===

Near LBS (NLBS) involves local-range technologies such as [[Bluetooth low energy]], WLAN, infrared and/or [[RFID]]/[[Near field communication]] technologies, which are used to match devices to nearby services. This application allows a person to access information based on their surroundings; especially suitable for using inside closed premises, restricted or regional area.
Another alternative is an operator- and GPS-independent location service based on access into the deep level telecoms network ([[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]]). This solution enables accurate and quick determination of geographical coordinates of mobile phone numbers by providing operator-independent location data and works also for handsets that are not GPS-enabled.

Many other [[local positioning systems]] and [[indoor positioning system]]s are available, especially for indoor use. GPS and GSM do not work very well indoors, so other techniques are used, including co-pilot beacon for CDMA networks, Bluetooth, UWB, [[RFID]] and Wi-Fi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/speech/preciseindoor10.pdf "Precise Indoor Localization Using Smart Phones"] E. Martin, O. Vinyals, G. Friedland, R. Bajcsy, ''ACM Multimedia 2010'', 787–790&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Location-based services may be employed in a number of applications, including:&lt;ref name = "sst"/&gt; 
* recommending social events in a city&lt;ref name = "qr10"/&gt;
* requesting the nearest business or service, such as an ATM, restaurant or a retail store
* [[turn-by-turn navigation]] to any address
* assistive healthcare systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* locating people on a map displayed on the mobile phone
* receiving alerts, such as notification of a sale on gas or warning of a traffic jam
* location-based mobile advertising
* asset recovery combined with active RF to find, for example, stolen assets in containers where GPS would not  work
* contextualizing learning and research
* games where your location is part of the game play, for example your movements during your day make your avatar move in the game or your position unlocks content.
* real-time Q&amp;A revolving around restaurants, services, and other venues.
* tracking a [[NASA]] lunar lander.&lt;ref name = nasa&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/crowdoptic-enhance-launch-and-tracking-lunar-lander/ | publisher = NASA | title = CrowdOptic Enhances Launch and Tracking of Lunar Lander | accessdate = 26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* sending a mobile caller's location during an emergency call using [[Advanced Mobile Location]]

For the carrier, location-based services provide added value by enabling services such as: 
*''Resource tracking with dynamic distribution''. Taxis, service people, rental equipment, doctors, fleet scheduling.
*''Resource tracking''. Objects without privacy controls, using passive sensors or RF tags, such as packages and train boxcars.
*''Finding someone or something''. Person by skill (doctor), business directory, navigation, weather, traffic, room schedules, stolen phone, emergency calls.
*''Proximity-based notification (push or pull)''. Targeted advertising, buddy list, common profile matching (dating).
*''Proximity-based actuation (push or pull)''. Payment based upon proximity (EZ pass, toll watch), automatic airport check-in.

In the [[United States|U.S.]] the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] requires that all carriers meet certain criteria for supporting location-based services (FCC 94–102). The mandate requires 95% of handsets to resolve within 300 meters for network-based tracking (e.g. triangulation) and 150 meters for handset-based tracking (e.g. GPS). This can be especially useful when dialing an [[emergency telephone number]] – such as [[E911|enhanced 9-1-1]] in [[NANP|North America]], or [[1-1-2|112]] in [[Europe]] – so that the operator can dispatch emergency services such as [[emergency medical services]], [[police]] or [[firefighters]] to the correct location. CDMA and iDEN operators have chosen to use GPS location technology for locating emergency callers. This led to rapidly increasing penetration of GPS in iDEN and CDMA handsets in North America and other parts of the world where CDMA is widely deployed. Even though no such rules are yet in place in Japan or in Europe the number of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handset models is growing fast. According to the independent wireless analyst firm [[Berg Insight]] the attach rate for GPS is growing rapidly in GSM/WCDMA handsets, from less than 8% in 2008 to 15% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berginsight.com/ReportPDF/ProductSheet/bi-gps4-ps.pdf Berg Insight – GPS and Mobile Handsets]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for economic impact, location based services are estimated to have a $1.6 Trillion impact on the US economy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcg.com/documents/file109372.pdf The Boston Consulting Group – Geospatial Services: A $1.6 Trillion Growth Engine for the U.S. Economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

European operators are mainly using [[Cell ID]] for locating subscribers. This is also a method used in Europe by companies that are using cell based LBS as part of systems to recover stolen assets. In the US companies such as [[Rave Wireless]] in New York are using GPS and triangulation to enable college students to notify campus police when they are in trouble. Rave Wireless and other companies with location based offerings are powered by a variety of companies, including [[Skyhook Wireless]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyhookwireless.com/apps-enterprise/ Skyhook Wireless: Apps, Enterprise &amp; Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123094504/http://www.skyhookwireless.com/apps-enterprise/ |date=2013-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AlterGeo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://platform.altergeo.ru/index.php?mode=products AlterGeo - global location technology provider: Products]&lt;/ref&gt; and Xtify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtify.com/platform.html#tab=tab-nativepush Xtify: Xtify Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of location tracking apps for mobile devices===
Currently there are roughly three different models for location-based apps on mobile devices.  All share that they allow one's location to be tracked by others. Each functions in the same way at a high level, but with differing functions and features.  Below is a comparison of an example application from each of the three models.

==Mobile messaging==
Mobile messaging plays an essential role in LBS. Messaging, especially SMS, has been used in combination with various LBS applications, such as location-based mobile advertising.
[[SMS]] is still the main technology carrying mobile advertising / marketing campaigns to mobile phones. A classic example of LBS applications using SMS is the delivery of mobile coupons or discounts to mobile subscribers who are near to advertising restaurants, cafes, movie theatres.  The Singaporean mobile operator [[MobileOne]] carried out such an initiative in 2007 that involved many local marketers, what was reported to be a huge success in terms of subscriber acceptance.

Companies offering location-based messaging (sometimes referred to as "geo-messaging") include The Coupons App&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecouponsapp.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (US), Central&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.centrl.com | title=Murat Aktihanoglu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (International), Zhiing (international), BluePont (US),&lt;ref name="SNEWSNET"&gt;[http://www.snewsnet.com/cgi-bin/snews/13748.html/ Mobile Technology provided by BluePont allows you to find last minute workout buddy] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160520051418/http://www.snewsnet.com/cgi-bin/snews/13748.html/ |date=2016-05-20 }} SNEWSNET reviews BluePont – a Location based service in US&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loopt]] (US), [[Dodgeball (service)|Dodgeball (US)]], Skyhook &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://blog.skyhookwireless.com/devices/mobile/5-ways-mobile-developers-can-improve-ux | title=5 Ways Mobile Developers Can Improve UX}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Beamster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beamster.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055325/http://www.beamster.com/|date=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Austria).

==Privacy issues==
The Location Privacy Protection Act of 2012 (S.1223)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Location Privacy Protection Act of 2012|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.1223.RS:|date=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced by Senator [[Al Franken]] (D-MN) in order to regulate the transmission and sharing of user location data in the United States. It is based on the individual's one time consent to participate in these services (Opt In). The bill specifies the collecting entities, the collectable data and its usage. The bill does not specify, however, the period of time that the data collecting entity can hold on to the user data (a limit of 24 hours seems appropriate since most of the services use the data for immediate searches, communications, etc.), and the bill does not include location data stored locally on the device (the user should be able to delete the contents of the location data document periodically just as he would delete a log document). The bill which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would also require mobile services to disclose the names of the advertising networks or other third parties with which they share consumers' locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Their Apps Track You.

With the passing of the [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003|CAN-SPAM Act]] in 2003, it became illegal in the United States to send any message to the end user without the end user specifically opting-in. This put an additional challenge on LBS applications as far as "carrier-centric" services were concerned. As a result, there has been a focus on user-centric location-based services and applications which give the user control of the experience, typically by opting in first via a website or mobile interface (such as [[Text messaging|SMS]], mobile Web, and [[Java (Sun)|Java]]/[[Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless|BREW]] applications).

The [[European Union]] also provides a legal framework for data protection that may be applied for location-based services, and more particularly several European directives such as: (1) Personal data: Directive 95/46/EC; (2) Personal data in electronic communications: Directive 2002/58/EC; (3) Data Retention: [[Data Retention Directive|Directive 2006/24/EC]]. However the applicability of legal provisions to varying forms of LBS and of processing location data is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Mount Hor''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Script/Hebrew|הֹר הָהָר}}, ''Hor Ha-Har'') is the name given in the [[Old Testament]] to two distinct mountains. One borders the land of [[Edom]] in the area south of the [[Dead Sea]], and the other is by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] at the Northern border of the [[Land of Israel]]. The first Mount Hor is especially significant to the Israelites as [[Aaron]] the high priest, brother of [[Moses]], died there.

==Mount Hor in Edom (Mount Harun)==
[[File:Mthor.jpeg|right|thumb|Mt. Hor]]

This Mount Hor is situated "in the edge of the land of [[Edom]]" ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 20:23 and 33:37) and was the scene of [[Aaron]]'s [[wikt:divestiture|divestiture]], death and burial.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 20:22-28&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of Mount Hor has been the subject of debate, but based on the writing of [[Josephus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Antiq. 4:4:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has customarily been identified with the ''Jebel Nebi Harun'' ("Mountain of the Prophet Aaron" in Arabic), a twin-peaked mountain 4780 feet above sea-level (6072 feet above the [[Dead Sea]]) in the Edomite Mountains on the east side of the [[Jordan]]-[[Arabah]] valley. On the summit is a shrine, the [[Tomb of Aaron]], said to cover the grave of Aaron.

Some investigators at the turn of the 20th century dissented from this identification: for example, [[Henry Clay Trumbull]] preferred the ''Jebel Madara'', a peak about 15 miles northwest of 'Ain Kadis ([[Kadesh Barnea]]), near the modern border between Israel and Egypt.

==Northern Mount Hor==
Another Mount Hor is mentioned in the [[Book of Numbers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Num.|34:7-8|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defining the northern boundary of the [[Land of Israel]]. It is traditionally identified as the [[Nur Mountains|Nur]] or Amanus Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Hertz ed., ''The Pentateuch and Haftorahs: Hebrew Text English Translation and Commentary Edition: 2'', Soncino Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; When in the Second Temple period, Jewish authors seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the [[Promised Land]], began to construe Mount Hor as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bechard|first=Dean Philip|title=Paul Outside the Walls: A Study of Luke's Socio-geographical Universalism in Acts 14:8-20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwoLOauyDcUC&amp;pg=PA203|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=978-88-7653-143-9|pages=203–205|quote=In the Second Temple period, when Jewish authors were seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the Land, it became customary to construe “Mount Hor” of Num 34:7 as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain (Bechard 2000, p. 205, note 98.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbinic writings]] &lt;ref&gt;See Mishna Sheviis 6:1.&lt;/ref&gt;also declare Amanah a [[Greater Israel|boundary of the land of Israel]], saying "from the mountains of Amanah, to the river of Egypt; whatever is within that line belongs to the land of Israel: but, whatever is without that line, is without the land."{{sfn|Wells|Calmet|1817|loc=Canaan|p=316;}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{harvnb|Bloch|Bloch|1995|p=13}} - {{cite book | last=Bloch | first=A. | last2=Bloch | first2=C. | title=The Song of Songs: A New Translation with an Introduction and Commentary | publisher=University of California Press | series=New Translation | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-520-22675-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPqCQK12QgYC&amp;pg=PP13 | ref=harv | access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Yamantau''' ({{lang-ba|Ямантау}}, {{lang-ru|гора Ямантау}}) is a mountain in the [[Ural Mountains]], located in [[Beloretsky District]], [[Bashkortostan]], [[Russia]]. Standing at 1,640 metres (5,381&amp;nbsp;ft) it is the highest mountain in the [[Southern Ural]] section, and is featured within the [[South Ural Nature Reserve]]. 

Mount Yamantau is notable as the subject of claims by the [[United States]] that a secret extensive [[bunker]] complex of the [[Russian government]] or [[Russian Armed Forces]] is contained within the mountain, equivalent to the [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]].

==Name==
The name of the mountain is derived from "Yaman Tau" (Яман тау), which translates to "evil mountain", "bad mountain", or "wicked mountain" in the local [[Bashkir language]]. 

==Bunker complex claims==
Mount Yamantau, along with [[Kosvinsky Mountain]] (600&amp;nbsp;km to the north), are suspected by the [[United States]] of being home to a large secret [[nuclear facility]] or [[bunker]], or both.&lt;ref name= "Blair"&gt;{{cite news |first= Bruce G |last= Blair | authorlink= | coauthors= | title = We Keep Building Nukes For All the Wrong Reasons |url= http://www.globalzero.org/files/bb_we_keep_building_nukes_for_all_the_wrong_reasons_05.25.2003.pdf |work= The Washington Post | publisher= |date=May 25, 2003 |accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large [[Digging|excavation]] projects have been observed by U.S. [[satellite]] imagery after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], as recently as the late 1990s during the government of [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt; During the Soviet era two military [[garrison]]s, Beloretsk-15 and Beloretsk-16, and possibly a third, Alkino-2, were built on the site. These garrisons were unified into the [[closed town]] of [[Mezhgorye, Republic of Bashkortostan|Mezhgorye]] ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Межгорье (Башкортостан)|Межгорье]]}}) in 1995, and the garrisons are said to house 30,000 workers each, served by large rail lines.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; 

Repeated U.S. questions have yielded several different responses from the Russian government regarding Mount Yamantau, including it is a [[mining]] site, a repository for Russian treasures, a food storage area, and a bunker for leaders in case of [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/yamantau.htm | title = Weapons of Mass Destruction | contribution = Yamantau, Beloretsk-15, Beloretsk-16, Alkino-2 | publisher = Global Security}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael R. |last=Gordon |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Despite Cold War's End, Russia Keeps Building a Secret Complex |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4DF1E39F935A25757C0A960958260 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=April 16, 1996 | accessdate =28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to questions regarding Yamantau in 1996, Russia's [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Defense Ministry]] stated: "The practice does not exist in the Defense Ministry of Russia of informing foreign mass media about facilities, whatever they are, that are under construction in the interests of strengthening the security of Russia."&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; In 1997, a [[United States Congress|United States Congressional]] finding, related to the country's [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for 1998, stated that the Russian Federation kept up a "deception and denial policy" about the mountain complex after U.S. officials had given [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]] tours to Russian diplomats, which the finding stated "... does not appear to be consistent with the lowering of strategic threats, openness, and cooperation that is the basis of the post-[[Cold War]] strategic partnership between the United States and Russia."&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1997/h970619_a.htm  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1119, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998 (House of Representatives - June 19, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Point Pleasant''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Tinicum Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum]] and [[Plumstead Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Plumstead]] Townships of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.  It lies on both sides of [[Tohickon Creek]] by the creek's confluence with the [[Delaware River]]; the creek is the dividing line between the townships.&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;DeLorme. ''Pennsylvania Atlas &amp; Gazetteer''.  8th ed.  [[Yarmouth, Maine|Yarmouth]]: [[DeLorme]], 2003, p. 82.  {{ISBN|0-89933-280-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[ZIP code]] for the post office in Point Pleasant is 18950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zipinfo.com/cgi-local/zipsrch.exe?cnty=cnty&amp;zip=18950 Zip Code Lookup]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2009}}
The area was originally settled by the [[Lenape]] Indians who fished in the [[Delaware River]]. Its proximity to the river led to the development of [[Gristmill|grist mills]]. Grain for the soldiers during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was ground here.  In later years, Point Pleasant was a resting spot for [[Mariner|canalmen]] along the [[Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division)|Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal]], and a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] for the Doylestown-Frenchtown-NewYork stage.

The [[Bridge in Tinicum Township]], [[Cabin Run Covered Bridge]], [[Frankenfield Covered Bridge]], and [[Point Pleasant Historic District (Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania)|Point Pleasant Historic District]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water Pump==
Point Pleasant is the location of a major water pump installation on the Delaware River, since 1989. This water supplies the Bradshaw Reservoir and [[Lake Galena (Pennsylvania)|Lake Galena Reservoir]] for [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] and Bucks County drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.williams.edu/wp-etc/ces/point-pleasant-pump.pdf|title=Dump the Pump: An Analysis of Point Pleasant Water Diversion Project, Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania| author= Tracy King| date= May 1, 1984| accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is pumped into the [[North Branch Neshaminy Creek]].&lt;ref name=npwa/&gt;
Major consumers of water include [[PECO Energy Company]], the [[North Wales Water Authority]], and the [[North Penn Water Authority]].&lt;ref name=npwa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northpennwater.org/uploads/forest-park-brochure.pdf| title= Forest Park Water "Clearly the Finest"|accessdate=January 28, 2015|publisher=North Penn Water Authority and North Wales Water Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Aside from being located along the Delaware River, Point Pleasant lies along [[Pennsylvania Route 32]], which connects it to [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]] to the south.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt;

[[Image:PLGR tan green.jpg|right|thumb|Two PLGRs, showing different color schemes]]
The '''AN/PSN-11 Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver''' ('''PLGR''', colloquially "'''plugger'''") is a [[rugged computer|ruggedized]], hand-held, single-frequency [[GPS]] receiver fielded by the [[US military]]. It incorporates the Precise Positioning Service - Security Module (PPS-SM) to access the encrypted P(Y)-code [[GPS signals|GPS signal]].

Introduced in January 1990, and extensively fielded until 2004 when it was replaced by its successor, the [[Defense Advanced GPS Receiver]] (DAGR). In that time period more than 165,000 PLGRs were procured worldwide, and despite being superseded by the DAGR, large numbers remain in unit inventories and it continues to be the most widely used GPS receiver in the US military. 

The PLGR measures 9.5 by 4.1 by 2.6 inches {{nowrap|(24 cm × 10 cm × 7 cm)}} and weighs {{convert|2.75|lb}} with batteries. It was originally delivered to the US military with a six-year warranty, however this was extended to 10 years in June 2000.

==Versions==
*''AN/PSN-11'' - NSN 5825-01-374-6643 - early version (tan case)
*''AN/PSN-11(V)1'' "Enhanced PLGR" - NSN 5825-01-395-3513 - upgraded version (green case)

[[File:ribbon lake2.png|350px|right|thumb|Formation of a ribbon lake]]
[[File:Lake windermere in 2005.jpg|350px|right|thumb|[[Windermere]] in the [[Lake District]]]]
A '''ribbon lake''' is a long and narrow, finger-shaped [[lake]], usually found in a [[glacial trough]]. Its formation begins when a [[glacier]] moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft [[bedrock]]. The sharp-edged [[boulder]]s that are picked up by the glacier and carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the [[ice age]], filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake.

A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional [[moraine]], both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. 

A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake. 

A ribbon lake is one of a number of glacial landscapes. These include [[arête]]s, [[cirque|corries]], rock lips, rock basins and terminal moraines.

Examples of ribbon lakes are: [[Windermere]] in the Lake District , [[Panguipulli Lake|Panguipulli]], [[Coniston Water]], [[Lake Washington]], [[Wastwater]], and [[Llyn Ogwen]].

The '''San Rafael Swell''' is a large [[geology|geologic]] feature located in south-central [[Utah]] about {{convert|30|mi|km}} west of [[Green River, Utah]]. The San Rafael Swell, measuring approximately {{convert|75|by|40|mi|km}}, consists of a giant dome-shaped [[anticline]] of sandstone, shale, and limestone that was pushed up during the Paleocene [[Laramide Orogeny]] 60-40 million years ago. Since that time, infrequent but powerful [[flash floods]] have eroded the [[sedimentary rock]]s into numerous [[valley]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[gorge]]s, [[mesa]]s, and [[butte]]s. The [[swell (geology)|swell]] is part of the [[Colorado Plateau]] [[United States physiographic region|physiographic region]].

==Geography==
[[Interstate 70]] divides the Swell into northern and southern sections, and provides the only interstate access to the region. The swell lies entirely within [[Emery County, Utah|Emery County]].

The northern Swell is drained mainly by the [[San Rafael River (Utah)|San Rafael River]], while the southern Swell is drained mainly by [[Muddy Creek (Utah)|Muddy Creek]], which eventually joins the [[Fremont River]] to become [[Dirty Devil River]] northeast of [[Hanksville, Utah]]. The Dirty Devil River flows southward into the [[Colorado River]], while the San Rafael River joins the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] before it also flows into the Colorado.  [[Muddy Creek (Utah)|Muddy Creek]] cuts into the western edge of the Swell, exits at Muddy Creek Gorge, and then flows across the Blue Hills [[Badlands]] near Caineville to its confluence with the [[Fremont River (Utah)|Fremont River]].

[[Image:SanRafaelReefUT.jpg|left|thumb|East slope of the San Rafael Reef]]

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of the Capitol Reef area}}

The San Rafael Swell was formed when deeply buried [[Precambrian]] [[dike swarm]] rocks [[Geologic fault|faulted]], or broke, during the [[Laramide orogeny]], about 60 million years ago. These "basement" rocks below the present-day Swell moved upwards relative to the surrounding areas and caused the overlying sedimentary rocks to [[Fold (geology)|fold]] into a dome-like shape called an [[anticline]]. The resulting structure is analogous to a series of blankets draped over a box.

Since that time, the relentless force of running water has eroded the geologic [[stratum|layers]], resulting in older rocks becoming exposed in the middle of the Swell, and younger rocks exposed around the edges. Many of the most impressive landforms are composed of more resistant rocks, including the [[Jurassic]] [[Navajo Sandstone]], [[Jurassic]] [[Wingate Sandstone]], and [[Permian]] [[Coconino Sandstone]]. The folding is much steeper on the eastern edge of the Swell than in the west, and this eastern edge is referred to as the [[San Rafael Reef]].

Both the San Rafael River and Muddy Creek drain out of the high [[Wasatch Plateau]] and the cut directly across the uplift of the Reef, which marks them as [[Antecedent drainage stream|superimposed streams]], pre-dating the time of the uplift.

Part of the Swell has geographic features that resemble [[Mars]]. The [[Mars Society]] decided to set up the [[Mars Desert Research Station]] in the area as a Mars analog for such reasons.

[[Image:Little Grand Canyon.JPG|thumb|right|The Little Grand Canyon on the [[San Rafael River]]]]

==Ecology==
The San Rafael Swell is an area of high plant [[endemism]], with many native plants occurring nowhere else in the world. An example is the endangered [[Pediocactus despainii|San Rafael cactus]] (''Pediocactus despainii'').&lt;ref name=cpc&gt;[http://www.centerforplantconservation.org/collection/CPC_ViewProfile.asp?CPCNum=3129 ''Pediocactus despainii''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829180440/http://www.centerforplantconservation.org/Collection/CPC_ViewProfile.asp?CPCNum=3129 |date=August 29, 2011 }} Center for Plant Conservation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Evidence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, including the [[Fremont people|Fremont]], [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]], and [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], is common throughout the San Rafael Swell in the form of [[pictograph]] and [[petroglyph]] panels. An example is the [[Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel]], with rock art left by the Barrier Canyon Culture and the Fremont Culture. From about 1776 to the mid-1850s the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] trade route passed through (or just north of) the Swell. In the past 150 years, areas of the Swell have been used for the [[grazing]] of [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[cattle]], as well as for [[uranium]] [[mining]]. Many of the gravel roads in the interior of the swell were originally used to service the uranium mining activities. Although surrounded by the communities of [[Price, Utah|Price]], [[Green River, Utah|Green River]], [[Hanksville, Utah|Hanksville]], [[Ferron, Utah|Ferron]], [[Castle Dale, Utah|Castle Dale]], and [[Huntington, Utah|Huntington]], the Swell itself does not support permanent residents.

The Swell has been used by Hollywood filmmakers as a location setting for alien planets, including the Planet Vulcan in the 2009 film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and the alien world in ''[[Galaxy Quest]]''.

[[Image:MuddyCreekGorgeUT.jpg|left|thumb|Entrance to the [[Muddy Creek (Utah)|Muddy Creek]] Gorge]]

==Administration==
The area is managed by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Although the Swell as a whole does not currently enjoy special protection, parts of it are protected as [[wilderness study area]]s. Cattle grazing is only allowed in parts of the Swell that are not designated as such. The San Rafael Swell is also dotted with sections of land managed by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, as is much of the state of Utah.  [[Goblin Valley State Park]] is on the southeastern edge of the San Rafael Swell.

In 2002, then-governor [[Mike Leavitt]] of Utah [[List_of_proposed_National_Monuments_of_the_United_States#SanRafaelSwell|proposed]] the creation of a San Rafael Swell [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Egan | first = Timothy | publication-date = January 29, 2002 | title = Governor of Utah, in Reversal, Seeks Scenic Area Designation | periodical = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/29/us/governor-of-utah-in-reversal-seeks-scenic-area-designation.html | accessdate = February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], who had authority to create such a monument under the [[Antiquities Act]], never acted on Leavitt's proposal.

The idea of federal designation of the San Rafael Swell as a National Monument resurfaced in 2010 in a [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] [[List_of_proposed_National_Monuments_of_the_United_States#Interior_Department_memorandum|document]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = February 23, 2010 | title = Utah Wary Over National Monument Candidate List | periodical = New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/02/23/us/AP-US-Monument-Opposition.html | accessdate = February 25, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, US Representative [[John Curtis (American politician)|John Curtis]] put forward a bill to make the area a National Monument, to be called "Jurassic National Monument." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900018171/curtis-land-bill-would-create-jurassic-national-monument-in-emery-county.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Rafael Swell attracts [[hiking|hikers]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]], [[horses|horseback]] riders, and [[all-terrain vehicle]] (ATV) enthusiasts. Many steep, narrow slot canyons popular with technical [[Canyoneering|canyoneers]] are found in the San Rafael Reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climb-utah.com/SRS/index.htm|title=Canyoneering the San Rafael Swell - Route Guide|publisher=Climb-Utah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of ATVs in the Swell is controversial, as [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] claim that off-road vehicles damage the fragile desert [[cryptobiotic soil]]s. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The '''Seal Islands''' (also known as '''Îles des Phoques''', '''Islas Foca''', '''Islotes Foca''' and '''Seal Rocks''') are a group of small islands and rocky islets lying about 7&amp;nbsp;km north and north-west of [[Elephant Island]], in the [[South Shetland Islands]] of [[Antarctica]].  They extend east–west for about 5&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name=bli/&gt; and are separated from Elephant Island by [[Sealers Passage]].  The group takes its name from the largest island, which [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[William Smith (mariner)|William Smith]] named Seal Island in 1820 because of the number of seals killed there.

==Description==
Seal Island, the largest in the group, has a coastline of precipitous cliffs, with a sandy beach on the western shore and some small coves. It rises to 125&amp;nbsp;m in height.  It is constituted of poorly consolidated [[sedimentary rock]]s which are susceptible to wave and runoff erosion. Other islands in the group are similarly rocky with steep cliffs and few beaches.  Ice-cover is seasonal.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

==Important Bird Area==
The islands, with the intervening marine zone, have been identified as a 514&amp;nbsp;ha [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because they support several [[bird colony|breeding colonies]], totalling some 20,000 pairs, of [[chinstrap penguin]]s. Other birds nesting in the group in smaller numbers include [[macaroni penguin]]s (350 pairs), [[southern giant petrel]]s, [[imperial shag]]s, [[Cape petrel]]s, [[Wilson's storm petrel]]s, [[snowy sheathbill]]s and [[kelp gull]]s.  [[Antarctic fur seal]]s breed on the islands, with around 600 seal pups born each year.  [[Southern elephant seal|Southern elephant]], [[Weddell seal|Weddell]], [[Leopard seal|leopard]] and [[crabeater seal]]s [[hauling-out|haul out]] there.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Seal Islands|accessdate=2013-01-17 |work= BirdLife data zone: Important Bird Areas |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shrub-steppe''' is a type of low rainfall natural [[grassland]]. While arid, shrub-steppes have sufficient moisture to support a cover of perennial grasses and/or shrubs, a feature which distinguishes them from deserts.

[[File:2013-07-04 15 37 14 Sagebrush-steppe along U.S. Route 93 in central Elko County in Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|Sagebrush steppe in northeastern Nevada along [[U.S. Route 93 in Nevada|US 93]]]]
[[File:Fire near Hammett Idaho 2005.jpg|thumb|Shrubsteppe, one of America's most endangered ecosystems on fire. Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis is not adapted to fire unlike Ponderosa pine and is in most cases completely destroyed.]]
==North America==
The shrub steppes of North America occur in the western United States and western Canada, in the [[rainshadow]] zone between the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] on the west, and the [[Rocky Mountains]] on the east. They extend from south-central British Columbia down into southeastern Washington state, eastern Oregon, and eastern California, and across through Idaho, Nevada, and Utah into western Wyoming and Colorado, and down into northern and central New Mexico and northern Arizona. Growth is dominated by primarily low-lying shrubs, such as big [[sagebrush]]- [[Artemisia tridentata]], and [[Purshia tridentata]] with too low of rainfall to support the growth of trees, though trees do occur. Other important plants are [[Bunchgrass]]- [[Pseudoroegneria spicata]] which have historically provided forage for livestock as well as wildlife, but are quickly being replaced by non-native annual species like [[Cheatgrass]]- [[Bromus tectorum]], tumble mustard- [[Sisymbrium altissimum]], and Russian thistle- [[Salsola kali]]. There is also a suite of animals that call the shrubsteppe home including [[Sage Grouse]], [[Pygmy rabbit]], [[Western rattlesnake]], [[Pronghorn]]. 

Historically much of the shrubsteppe in Washington State was referred to as "scabland" because of the deep channels cut into pure basalt rock by cataclysmic floods more than 10,000 years ago [[Channeled Scablands]]. Major threats to the ecosystem include overgrazing, fires, invasion by non-native species, development since much of it is at lower elevations and conversion to cropland, as well as energy development. Less than 50% of Washington State's historic shrubsteppe remains &lt;ref&gt;[http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/research/projects/shrubsteppe/ Shrubsteppe Ecology from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to some estimates it is only 12 to 15% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnps.org/ecosystems/shrubsteppe_eco/threats.htm Threats to the Shrub-Steppe from WNPS]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Shrub-steppe ecoregions of North America include:
* [[Great Basin shrub steppe]]: sagebrush steppe in eastern California, central Nevada, western Utah, and southeastern Idaho.
* [[Mojave Desert]] sky island [[sagebrush steppe]]: the Mojave [[sky island]]s (with [[pinyon-juniper woodland]]) in southeastern California; and small portions of southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and northwestern Arizona.
* [[Colorado Plateau]] [[shrubland]]s: western Colorado, northern and central New Mexico, northern Arizona, and eastern Utah
* Eastern Cascades shrub steppe (including the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]]): in south-central Washington state, eastern Oregon, northeastern California, northern Nevada, and Idaho.
* [[Wyoming Basin shrub steppe]]: in central Wyoming, reaching into south-central Montana, northeastern Utah, southwestern Idaho, and northwestern Colorado.
* Okanagan shrub steppe: in the [[Okanagan|Okanagan Valley]] in south-central British Columbia, and the southern [[Similkameen Country|Similkameen Valley]] in south-central British Columbia and north-central Washington state.

Part of the series usually referred to as ''Pirati delle Antille'', it is the story of Enrico di Ventimiglia, the Son of the Red Corsair, as he travels through the Spanish conquests of Central America in search of the stepsister he has never met. In his adventure, the Count is helped by the faithful Mendoza, the incomparable Don Barrejo, Buttafuoco, a nobleman-turned-buccaneer, and bands of pirates of the Caribbean.

==Film adaptation==
''[[Son of the Red Corsair (film)|Son of the Red Corsair]]'' (1959) was directed by [[Primo Zeglio]] and starred [[Lex Barker]] as Enrico and [[Sylvia Lopez]] as Carmen. The English-language version of the film, was released in the UK in 1962, in the US (where it was also known as ''The Son of the Red Pirate'') in 1963.

[[File:Steilhang1.JPG|thumb|A ''steilhang'']]
A '''''Steilhang''''' (pl: ''Steilhänge'') is a [[geoscientific]] term for a steep mountainside or hillside (or a part thereof), the average slope of which is greater than 1:2 or 30°. Leser defines a ''steilhang'' as a mountainside with an incline of between 16° and 60°, slopes of between 30° and 60° being described as "very steep" (''übersteil'') and anything over 60° being a rock face (''wand'').&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt;

The term is German for "steep slope/mountainside/hillside", "escarpment"&lt;ref name=Leser&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). ''Wörterbuch Allgemeine Geographie'', 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 893. {{ISBN|978-3-423-03422-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "steep face".&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt; The word ''hang'' in this compound is derived from ''hängen'', "to hang". Also compare the British English word ''[[wikt:hanger|hanger]]'' (from Old English ''hangra'') for a steep, wooded slope (compare [[Hanger Lane]]), or used to mean woods on steep hillsides, e.g. for the [[East Hampshire Hangers]].

== Geology ==
The formation of slopes of different gradients depends on the one hand on the type of underlying [[rock (geology)|rock]] of the mountain or hill - and this may result in slopes varying from those on the other side of a mountain, hill or valley – and on the other hand on its local hardness, and circumstances of its deposition ([[sedimentation]], stratigraphy, [[bed (geology)|bedding]] or [[joint (geology)|jointing]]), on its resistance to [[erosion (geology)|erosion]] and not least on the water flow and local [[microclimate|climatic conditions]].

From a [[geomorphological]] standpoint, there is a distinction made between ''steilhänge'' not simply on the basis of their gradient and [[rock type]], but especially on their  [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] (i.e. their orientation), their rotundity or roughness (small shapes, flexion, steps, [[terrace (geology)|terraces]], drainage etc.), the vegetation on the mountainsides or hillsides and the [[soil science|soil formation]].

For example, the soil type known as ''[[rankers|ranker]]'' gets its name from the word ''Ranker'' which is commonly used in Western [[Austria]] to mean ''steilhang''.

== Natural dangers ==
''Steilhänge'' present various natural dangers if they are not forested or interrupted by gentler slopes:
* [[Landslide]]s&amp;nbsp;– especially if the [[soil]] is saturated after long periods of rain or during [[snowmelt]]
* [[Sturzstrom|Collapse]]&amp;nbsp;– if there is a [[rock face]] or heavily eroded crags above, or
* [[Rockfall]], a less severe occurrence
* Destruction caused by [[mudflow]]s during bad weather or [[avalanche]]s 
* episodic or sudden rock creep, that may threaten to impound water.

== Farming ==
''Steilhänge'' of up to about 40° can in principle be used for farming&amp;nbsp;– for example to make [[hay]] or in [[forestry]] to obtain [[wood]]. Under favourable climatic conditions they can even be used for [[viticulture]]. But they are only rarely economic when compared with more level landscapes with which they are in competition. As a result, hill farmers (their definition varies according to the location of the uplands and their hillsides) are usually supported from the public purse.

This support of the [[Altitudinal zonation|alpine]] forestry and agriculture is sometimes not only justified, but also essential.  Traditionally the higher level authorities are responsible (especially the German states for example), because the individual municipalities are economically unable to. [[Geotechnics|Geotechnological]] institutions from the fields of mining, avalanche protection and tourism, as well as the [[EU]] are active in supporting the affected [[highland]]s in Europe

Through sensible support, hill farmers are encouraged or enabled to continue to work their farms or [[alm (alpine)|alms]]. Where this does not happen, the damage caused by the aforementioned natural dangers is generally more costly over time than the costs of subsidising hill farming. The advantages of protective and support measures are:

* Preservation of [[protected forest]]s (especially against mudflows and avalanches)
* General conservation ("hill farmers as landscape gardeners")
* [[Environmental protection]] (e.g. preservation of [[soil fertility|soil quality]], biodiversity, etc...)
* [[Tourism]] (desire for "intact [[landscape]]s", native customs, etc.)
* Control of [[mountain stream]]s and [[avalanche]]s
* Protection of [[road]]s and stabilization of [[forest track]]s
* Increased self-sufficiency in terms of the local supply of food and raw materials
* Regional aspects of [[planning]].

'''Traditional knowledge geographic information systems''' ('''GIS''') are the data, techniques, and technologies designed to document and utilize local knowledges in communities around the world.  [[Traditional knowledge]] is information that encompasses the experiences of a particular culture or society.  Traditional knowledge GIS are more valuable than ordinary [[cognitive map]]s in that they express environmental and spiritual relationships among real and conceptual entities.&lt;ref&gt;Peat, F. David.  "I Have a Map in my Head."  ''ReVision''  18.3 (1996) :  11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise a formidable toolset for use in cultural preservation, land rights disputes, natural resource management, and economic development.

==Technical aspects==

Traditional knowledge GIS employs [[Cartography|cartographic]] and [[database management]] techniques such as [[Public participation geographic information system|participatory GIS]], map biographies, and [[Historical geographic information system|historical mapping]]. Participatory GIS aspires to a mutually beneficial relationship between the governing and the governed by fostering public involvement in all aspects of a GIS.  It is widely accepted that this technique is necessary to sound environmental and economic planning in developing areas.&lt;ref name="Trip"&gt; Tripathi, Nitesh and Bhattarya, Shefali.  "Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and GIS for Participatory Natural Resource Management:  State-of-the-Practice."  ''Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries''  17.3 (2004) :  1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method generates a sense of place in scientific analysis that incorporates sacred sites and traditional land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;McCall, Michael K., and Peter A. Minang.  "Assessing Participatory GIS for Community-Based Natural Resource Management:  Claiming Community Forests in Cameroon."  ''Geographical Journal''  171.4 (2005) :  340-358.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participatory GIS can be effective for local resource management and planning, but researchers doubt its efficacy as a tool in attaining land tenure or fighting legal battles because of lack of expertise among local individuals and lack of access to technology.&lt;ref name="Chapin"&gt;Chapin, Mac, Zachary Lamb, and Bill Threlkeld.  "Mapping Indigenous Lands."  ''Annual Review of Anthropology''  34 (2005) :  619-639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Map biographies track the practices of local communities either for the sake of preservation or to argue for resource protection or land grants.&lt;ref name="Chapin"/&gt;  GIS technologies are powerful in their ability to accommodate multimedia and multidimensional data sets, which allows for the recording and playing of oral histories and representations of abstract ecological knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Chambers"&gt;Chambers, Kimberlee J., Jonathan Corbett, C. Peter Keller, and Colin J.B. Wood.  "Indigenous Knowledge, Mapping, and GIS:  A Diffusion of Innovation Perspective."  ''Cartographica'' 59.3 (2004) :  19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical mapping documents and analyzes events that are meaningful to a particular tradition or locale.  Cultural and humanitarian benefits derive from including maps in the historical record of an area.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Michael K., Carrie Height, Rosemary Mosher, and Matthew Bampton.  "Mapping Massacres: GIS and State Terror in Guatemala." ''Geoforum'' 37 (2006) :  62-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural preservation==

Cultural preservation is perhaps the principal application of a traditional knowledge GIS.  As adherents to traditional lifestyles decline in population, there has developed a degree of urgency surrounding the collection of data and wisdom from aging local elders.&lt;ref&gt;Harmsworth, Garth.  "Indigenous Values and GIS:  A Method and a Framework."  ''Indigenous Knowledge and Development Monitor''  6.3 (1998) :  1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  A central feature of cultural preservation is language revitalization.  Bilingual visual and audible maps depict oral traditions and historical information in places of cultural significance at various scales and levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;Cazden, Courtney B.  "Sustaining Indigenous Languages in Cyberspace."  Paper presented at ''Annual Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium''  June 9-11 (2002) :  1-7.  Available at http://jan.ucc.nau.edu\~jar\NNL\&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers encounter significant obstacles to data acquisition due to the sensitive natures of much of the data sought for a traditional knowledge GIS, and locals may distrust the motives of outside consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Richard Smith, Margarita Benavides, Mario Pariona, and Ermeto Tuesta.  "Mapping the Past and the Future:  Geomatics and Indigenous Territories in the Peruvian Amazon."  ''Human Organization''  62.4 (2003) :  357-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land rights and natural resource management==

Traditional knowledge GIS have the power to frame debates over land rights and resource management in ecologically sensitive areas.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Cynthia S. "The Local Articulation of Policy Conflict:  Land Use, Environment, and Amerindian Rights in Eastern Amazonia."  ''Professional Geographer''  54.2 (2001) :  241-258.&lt;/ref&gt;  Interests of local residents in these regions often conflict with those of migrant workers, state conservation units, and domestic and foreign mining or logging enterprises.  GIS hardware and software are used to identify spatial trends in interpreting these conflicts.

==Economic development==

Economic development through traditional knowledge GIS is requisite to local ownership over the systems and full access to relevant data and training.&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Barbara.  "Subverting the Western Gaze:  Mapping Alternative Worlds."  ''Archaeology and Anthropology Landscape''  (1994) :  31-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  This situation is rare outside of [[Developed country|industrialized nations]], so little progress has been made in this field of research.&lt;ref name="Chapin"/&gt;

==Current issues and effectiveness==

There is a disparate nature to implementations of traditional knowledge GIS across geographies.  Though [[Developing country|developing nations]] utilize some forms of participatory GIS, communities there are less likely to gain access to expensive databases and cartographic methods than those in developed nations.&lt;ref name="Bhat"&gt;Bhattarya, Shefali and Nitesh Tripathi.

The overall effectiveness of traditional knowledge GIS has not been determined conclusively.  Advocates for traditional mapping point to successes in acquiring land titles, managing local databases, and creating new skill sets for local communities worldwide.  Detractors cite cost, the need for specialized training, and cultural differences as reasons GIS may be inappropriate for these applications.&lt;ref name="Chambers"/&gt;  Traditional knowledge GIS analyze the nature of political and social struggles that lead to competing resource claims.

The '''USS ''Cyclops'' (AC-4)''' was the second of four [[USS Proteus (AC-9)|''Proteus''-class]] [[Collier (ship)|collier]]s built for the [[United States Navy]] several years before [[World War I]]. Named for the [[Cyclops]], a primordial race of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] from [[Greek mythology]], she was the second U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. The loss of the ship and 306 crew and passengers without a trace within the area known as the [[Bermuda Triangle]]&lt;ref name="Bermuda Triangle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle|work=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some time after 4 March 1918 remains the single largest loss of life in [[History of the United States Navy|U.S. Naval history]] not directly involving combat. As it was [[World War I|wartime]],  she was thought to have been captured or sunk by a German raider or submarine, because she was carrying {{convert|10800|LT|t|abbr=on}} of [[manganese]] ore used to produce munitions, but German authorities at the time, and subsequently, denied any knowledge of the vessel.&lt;ref name="Strange"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reck|first=Alfred P.|date=June 1929|title=Strangest American Sea Mystery is Solved at Last|journal=Popular Science|pages=15–17|url={{Google books|XSgDAAAAMBAJ|Strangest American Sea Mystery is Solved at Last|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=8 July 2009}} In this article, ''Amolco'' was erroneously called ''Amalco''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] has stated she "probably sank in an unexpected storm",&lt;ref name="Bermuda Triangle" /&gt; but the ultimate cause of the ship's loss is not known.

==History==
''Cyclops'' was launched on 7 May 1910, by [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]] of [[Philadelphia]] and placed in service on 7 November 1910, with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[George Worley]], Master, Naval Auxiliary Service, in command. Operating with the Naval Auxiliary Service, [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], she voyaged in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] from May–July 1911 to supply Second Division ships. Returning to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], she operated on the east coast from [[Newport, Rhode Island]], to the [[Caribbean]], servicing the fleet. During the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] in 1914–1915, she coaled ships on patrol there and received the thanks of the [[U.S. State Department]] for cooperation in evacuating refugees.

With [[American entry into World War I]], ''Cyclops'' was commissioned on 1 May 1917, with Lieutenant Commander George W. Worley in command. She joined a convoy for [[Saint-Nazaire]], France, in June 1917, returning to the U.S. in July. Except for a voyage to [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], she served along the East Coast until 9 January 1918, when she was assigned to the [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service]]. She then sailed to [[Brazil]]ian waters to fuel British ships in the South Atlantic, receiving the thanks of the U.S. State Department and Commander-in-Chief, Pacific.&lt;ref name="cyclops-1.htm"&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c/cyclops-1.htm USS ''Cyclops'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.military.rootsweb.com/%7Ecacunithistories/hr_mallory.htm USS Henry R. Mallory]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
The ship put to sea from [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 16 February 1918, and entered [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] on 20 February. Two days later, she departed for [[Baltimore]], Maryland, with no stops scheduled, carrying the manganese ore. The ship was thought to be overloaded when she left Brazil, as her maximum capacity was {{convert|8000|LT|t|abbr=on}}. Before leaving port, Commander Worley had submitted a report that the starboard engine had a cracked cylinder and was not operative. This report was confirmed by a survey board, which recommended, however, that the ship be returned to the United States. She made an unscheduled stop in [[Barbados]] because the water level was over the [[Waterline|Plimsoll line]], indicating that it was overloaded,&lt;ref name="Strange" /&gt; but investigations in Rio proved the ship had been loaded and secured properly.&lt;ref name="bermuda-triangle.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/cyclops_pg3.html|title=USS ''Cyclops'' (page 3)|first=Gian J.|last=Quasar|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cyclops'' then set out for Baltimore on 4 March, and was rumored to have been sighted on 9 March by the [[molasses]] tanker ''Amolco'' near Virginia,&lt;ref name="Strange" /&gt; but this was denied by ''Amolco''{{'}}s captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/q_a.html|first=Gian J.|last=Quasar|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1918-04-19/ed-1/seq-11/;words=Amolco?date1=1918&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=&amp;date2=1918&amp;proxtext=Amolco+&amp;y=12&amp;x=14&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=0 However, see ''The Washington Times'' 19 April 1918, page 11, column 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because ''Cyclops'' was not due in Baltimore until 13 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/cyclops_pg2.html|title=USS ''Cyclops'' (page 2)|first=Gian J.|last=Quasar|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ship was highly unlikely to have been near Virginia on 9 March, as that location would have placed her only about a day from Baltimore. In any event, ''Cyclops'' never made it to Baltimore, and no wreckage of her has ever been found.&lt;ref name="usnsh-c/cyclops.htm"&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-c/cyclops.htm USN Ships-USS CYCLOPS (1910–1918)]&lt;/ref&gt; Reports indicate that on 10 March, the day after the ship was rumored to have been sighted by ''Amolco,'' a violent storm swept through the [[Virginia Capes]] area. While some suggest that the combination of the overloaded condition, engine trouble, and bad weather may have conspired to sink ''Cyclops,''&lt;ref name="Strange" /&gt; an extensive naval investigation concluded: "Many theories have been advanced, but none that satisfactorily accounts for her disappearance."&lt;ref name="bermuda-triangle.org" /&gt; This summation was written, however, before two of ''Cyclops''{{'}}s [[sister ship]]s, the {{USS|Proteus|AC-9|2}} and {{USS|Nereus|AC-10|2}}, vanished at sea during World War II. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on ''Cyclops'' during her fatal voyage. In both cases,  their loss was theorized to have been the result of catastrophic structural failure,&lt;ref&gt;[http://familyheritage.ca/Articles/merchant1.html Canadian Merchant Ship Losses of the Second World War, 1939–1945]&lt;/ref&gt; but a more outlandish theory attributes all three vessels' disappearances to the [[Bermuda Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions.'' A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rear Admiral George van Deurs suggested that the loss of ''Cyclops'' could be owing to structural failure, as her sister ships suffered from issues where the [[I-beam]]s that ran the length of the ship had eroded due to the corrosive nature of some of the cargo carried. This was observed definitively on the [[USS Jason (AC-12)|USS ''Jason'']], and is believed to have contributed to the sinking of another similar freighter, ''Chuky,'' which snapped in two in calm seas. Moreover, ''Cyclops'' may have hit a storm with {{convert|30|-|40|kn|lk=on|abbr=on}} winds. These would have resulted in waves just far enough apart to leave the bow and stern supported on the peaks of successive waves, but with the middle unsupported, resulting in extra strain on the already weakened central area.&lt;ref name="Without Trace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=John|title=Without Trace|year=1981|publisher=Richard Clay ltd|location=Bungay, Suffolk|pages=179–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 1918, Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared ''Cyclops'' to be officially lost, and all hands deceased.&lt;ref name="Cutler2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Thomas J.|title=A sailor's history of the U.S. Navy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4SDNJtV85RIC&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=4 March 2012|year=2005|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn= 978-1-59114-151-8|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the seamen lost aboard ''Cyclops'' was African-American mess attendant Lewis H. Hardwick, the father of [[Herbert Lewis Hardwick]], "The Cocoa Kid", an [[List of Puerto Ricans of African descent|Afro-Puerto Rican]] welterweight boxer who was a top contender in the 1930s and 1940s, who won the [[World Colored Welterweight Championship|world colored welterweight]] and [[World Colored Middleweight Championship|world colored middleweight]] championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toledo|first=Springs|title=JUST WATCH MAH SMOKE Part 1: Lost at Sea|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles/12170-just-watch-mah-smoke-part-i-lost-at-sea|publisher=The Sweet Science|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, a short summary of the loss of ''Cyclops'' was listed in the U.S. Navy Annual Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Navy Dept|title=Annual Reports of the Navy Department: Report of the Secretary of the Navy. Miscellaneous reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGSM61lS23QC|year=1918|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a BBC Radio 4 documentary, [[Tom Mangold]] had an expert from Lloyds investigate the loss of ''Cyclops.'' The expert noted that manganese ore, being much denser than coal, had room to move within the holds even when fully laden, the hatch covers were canvas, and that when wet, the ore can become a slurry. As such, the load could shift and cause the ship to list. Combined with a possible loss of power from its one engine, it could founder in bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;Mangold, Tom ''Inside the Bermuda Triangle: the Mysteries Solved'' BBC Radio 4 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The captain==
[[File:George W Worley.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant Commander George W. Worley, United States Naval Reserve]]

Investigations by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] revealed that Captain Worley was born Johan Frederick Wichmann in [[Sandstedt]], [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], Germany in 1862 (the official Navy Register lists his date of birth as 11 December 1865), and that he had entered America by jumping ship in San Francisco in 1878. By 1898, he had changed his name to Worley (after a seaman friend), and owned and operated a saloon in San Francisco's [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]]. He also got help from brothers, whom he had convinced to emigrate. During this time, he had qualified for the position of ship's master, and had commanded several civilian merchant ships, picking up and delivering cargo (both legal and illegal; some accounts say [[opium]]) from the Far East to San Francisco. Unfortunately, the crews of these ships reported that Worley suffered from a personality allegedly akin to that sometimes ascribed to {{HMS|Bounty||6}}'s captain [[William Bligh]], with the crew  often being brutalized by Worley for trivial things.  Worley was commissioned as a lieutenant commander in the Naval Auxiliary Reserve on 21 February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;US Navy Register of Commissioned Officers. 1918. pg. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval investigators discovered information from former crew members about Worley's habits. He would berate and curse officers and men for minor offenses, sometimes getting violent; at one point, he had allegedly chased an ensign about the ship with a pistol. Saner times found him making his rounds about the ship dressed in long underwear and a derby hat.&lt;ref name="Sealift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-3.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard L.|date=June 1974|work= Sealift|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|pages=11–15|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worley sometimes would have an inexperienced officer in charge of loading cargo on the ship while the more experienced man was [[house arrest|confined to quarters]]. In Rio de Janeiro, one such man was assigned to oversee the loading of [[manganese]] [[ore]], something a collier was not used to carrying, and in this instance the ship was overloaded, which may have contributed to her sinking. The most serious accusation against Worley was that he was pro-German in wartime and may have colluded with the enemy; indeed, his closest friends and associates were either German or Americans of German descent. "Many Germanic names appear," Livingston stated, speculating that the ship had many German sympathizers on board. One of the passengers on the final voyage was Alfred Louis Moreau Gottschalk, the consul-general in Rio de Janeiro, who was as roundly hated for his pro-German sympathies, as was Worley. Livingston stated he believed Gottschalk may have been directly involved in collaborating with Worley on handing the ship over to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/letter_on_gottschalk.html Letter on Gottschalk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629024238/http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/letter_on_gottschalk.html |date=29 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, German records were checked to ascertain the fate of ''Cyclops'', whether by Worley's hand or by submarine attack. Nothing was found.

Near the time the search for ''Cyclops'' was called off, a telegram was received by the State Department from Charles Ludlow Livingston, the U.S. consul on Barbados:
:''Secretary of State''
:''Washington, D.C.''
:'' 17,, 2 April p.m.''
:''Department's 15th. Confidential. Master CYCLOPS stated that required six hundred tons coal having sufficient on board to reach Bermuda. Engines very poor condition. Not sufficient funds and therefore requested payment by me. Unusually reticent. I have ascertained he took here ton fresh meat, ton flour, thousand pounds vegetables, paying therefore 775 dollars. From different sources gather the following: he had plenty of coal, alleged inferior, took coal to mix, probably had more than fifteen hundred tons. Master alluded to by others as damned Dutchman, apparently disliked by other officers. Rumored disturbances en route hither, men confined and one executed; also had some prisoners from the fleet in Brazilian waters, one life sentence. United States Consul-General Gottschalk passenger, 231 crew exclusive of officers and passengers. Have names of crew but not of all the officers and passengers. Many Germanic names appear. Number telegraphic or wireless messages addressed to master or in care of ship were delivered at this port. All telegrams for Barbados on file head office St. Thomas. I have to suggest scrutiny there. While not having any definite grounds I fear fate worse than sinking though possibly based on instinctive dislike felt towards master.''

:''LIVINGSTON, CONSUL''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/telegram.html Telegram] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629023909/http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/telegram.html |date=29 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports attribute the telegram to Brockholst Livingston, but he was actually the 13-year-old son of the consul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heritagebooks.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=HBI&amp;Product_Code=101-B5186&amp;Category_Code=mil Barrash, Marvin.

==Sister ships==
''Cyclops'' had three sister ships, all commissioned in 1913, which were all ill-fated.

*[[USS Jupiter (AC-3)|USS ''Jupiter'' (AC-3)]]  was converted to an aircraft carrier between 1920 and 1922 and was recommissioned as [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS ''Langley'' (CV-1)]].  ''Langley'' was the first American aircraft carrier and was vital in developing United States naval aviation capabilities.  She was converted again between 1936 and 1937 as a seaplane tender and redesignated as AV-3.  She was stationed in the Philippines in December 1941 and departed for Australia following the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines.  On February 27, 1942, while ferrying fighter planes to Southeast Asia, she was attacked by Japanese aircraft and was hit by five bombs, causing critical damage.  After her surviving crew members were rescued, ''Langley'' was scuttled by torpedoes fired by her escorting destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/l/langley-i.html|title=USS Langley (CV-1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[USS Proteus (AC-9)|USS ''Proteus'' (AC-9)]] was sold on March 8, 1941, became part of the [[Canadian Merchant Navy]], and was lost at sea without a trace, probably in or near the [[Caribbean Sea]], sometime after November 25, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/p12/proteus-ii.htm|title=USS Proteus (AC-9)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[USS Nereus (AC-10)|USS ''Nereus'' (AC-10)]] was sold to the Aluminium Company of Canada on 27 February 1941.  She was lost without a trace after departing [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]], on December 10, 1941, with a load of bauxite ore (for making aluminum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=USS Nereus (AC-10)|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/n3/nereus-ii.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vron Ware''' is a British academic and professor at [[Kingston University]]. She was editor of ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' magazine from 1981 to 1983, and worked as a freelance journalist until 1987 when she cofounded the [[Women's Design Service]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Forgotten Feminist Architects Who Changed the Face of London {{!}} Broadly|url = https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/the-forgotten-feminist-architects-who-changed-the-face-of-london|website = Broadly|accessdate =13 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught cultural geography at the [[University of Greenwich]] from 1992 to 1999, sociology and gender studies at [[Yale University]] from 1999 to 2005, and was senior research fellow at the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at the [[Open University]] from 2008 to 2014. She is married to the British academic [[Paul Gilroy]].

==Career==
Over the past 25 years Ware has been one of a small number of scholar-activists pioneering the study of race and culture in contemporary Britain, beginning with the publication of a pamphlet on women and the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] in 1978. In 1987, Ware co -founded the Women’s Design Service with Sue Cavannagh and Wendy Davis. The organization believed that cities needed to be radically altered to suit women’s needs. The group put out a publication to create women’s bathroom facilities to better suit women’s needs like diaper changing areas and improved sanitary waste facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = If women built cities, what would our urban landscape look like?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/05/if-women-built-cities-what-would-our-urban-landscape-look-like|website =[[The Guardian]]|date=5 December 2014|accessdate =13 November 2015|first = Susanna|last = Rustin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She established an international reputation for research on [[anti-racism]] and [[feminism]] in 1992 when her first academic book, ''Beyond the Pale'', was published. Her intervention in feminist theory and practice, in particular her focus on the discursive production of whiteness through a gendered reading of colonial history, was instrumental in shaping a new international field of study that has since become known as [[Critical Whiteness studies]]. ''Who Cares About Britishness? A global view of the national identity debate'' (2007) was commissioned by the [[British Council]] as a contribution to domestic debates about citizenship, belonging and national identity in the UK. The work explores the practice of intercultural dialogue by engaging with young people living in a variety of postcolonial contexts, from [[Dublin]] to [[Dhaka]].

==Current research==
Ware was a Research Fellow in the Centre for Socio-Cultural Change (CReSC), and the Centre for Citizenship, Identities and Governance (CCIG) at the [[Open University]] until 2014 when she became professor of sociology at [[Kingston University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://militarymigrants.org/vron-ware/ "About the author"], ''Military Migrants'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, she began a new project looking at Britishness and militarization in the UK, using the recruitment and employment of Commonwealth soldiers as an entry point. Examining how the figure of the British soldier has acquired a prominence in mainstream culture not seen for many decades, her research focuses on questions of racism and citizenship, militarism and cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cresc.ac.uk/people/vron-ware Vron Ware biography], Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Military Migrants'' (2012) argues that the degree to which the armed forces are seen to have become modernised is central to the management of modern warfare on the domestic front. Maintaining a multi-faith and culturally diverse army has been recognised as a valuable military tool in [[Afghanistan]] too.

In [[statistics]], '''Wombling''' is any of a number of techniques used for identifying zones of [[Rate of change (mathematics)|rapid change]], typically in some quantity as it varies across some geographical or [[Euclidean space]].   It is named for statistician [[William H. Womble]].

The technique may be applied to [[gene frequency]] in a population of organisms, and to [[evolutionary linguistics|evolution of language]].

'''Wrocław’s dwarfs''' ({{lang-pl|krasnale, [[Krasnoludek|krasnoludki]]}}) are small figurines (20-30 [[Centimetre|cm]]) that first appeared in the streets of [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]], in 2005. Since then, their numbers have been continually growing, and today they are considered a tourist attraction: those who would like to combine sight-seeing in Wrocław with "Hunting for dwarfs" are offered special brochures with a map&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.pl/wroclaw-miasto/news.php?id=12184&amp;PHPSESSID=f79424ce89917b962940339324c2ce |title=Wycieczka szlakiem krasnali |publisher=Wrocław24 |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mobile application software]] for [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pawelm.krasnalewewroclawiu&amp;hl=pl |title=Wrocław - Krasnalove - Aplikacje Android w Google Play |author=Paweł Marek |work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, there are over 350 dwarfs spread all over the city. Six of them are located outside the city at the [[LG]] plant in [[Biskupice Podgórne]].

== History ==
In 2001, to commemorate the [[Orange Alternative]] (Polish [[anti-communist]] movement), a monument of a dwarf (the movement’s symbol) was officially placed on [[Świdnicka Street, Wrocław|Świdnicka Street]], where the group’s happenings used to take place. It is probably one of the few cases in the world where such a subversive group has been honoured by the city authorities, who commissioned the placing of a statue of a dwarf in the city centre. In 2003, the Mayor of Wrocław, in an attempt to continue the new tradition, unveiled a small plaque on the door of The Dwarfs’ Museum. It can be found at the height of human knees on the wall of a historic tenement called Jaś, which is situated between the [[Market Square, Wrocław|Market Square]] and [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Wrocław)|St. Elizabeth’s Church]].

The figures of the dwarfs, which are smaller than the Orange Alternative monument on Świdnicka Street, were placed in different parts of the city. The first five, designed by Tomasz Moczek, a graduate of The Academy of Art and Design in Wrocław, were placed in August 2005. These were the Fencer near the University of Wrocław, the Butcher in Stare Jatki arcade, two Sisyphuses on Świdnicka Street and the Odra-Washer-Dwarf, near Piaskowy Bridge. The name of the last dwarf is related to Pracze Odrzańskie, an estate on the outskirts of the city. Since that time, the number of figures has continued growing.

A ceremony unveiling two other dwarfs took place on the day of June 18, 2008. They were situated on Świdnicka Street, next to W-skers: a dwarf in a wheel chair. The figures represent two disabled dwarfs: the Deaf-mute and the Blind. They are part of the Wrocław Without Barriers campaign, which aims at drawing attention to handicapped people living in Wroclaw. Five days later, at the Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Clinic in Wrocław, another dwarf was erected. It was to be the third female dwarf, Marzenka, whose design was based on the logo of the ''Mam marzenie'' charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mammarzenie.org/wroclaw/2008/news/5lecie.php |title=Information for Service Foundation's Mam Marzenie |accessdate=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dwarfs Festival takes place in Wrocław every year in September.
