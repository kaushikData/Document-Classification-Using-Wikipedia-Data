'''Association of Atheists and Freethinkers''' ({{lang-pl|Stowarzyszenie Ateistów i Wolnomyślicieli}} [SAIWA]) is a [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1957 that aims to actively participate in the process of secularization of [[Polish society]]. The group is active in popularizing scientific knowledge about [[religion]], creating a Polish secular culture and secular ethics as well as in promoting the [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[philosophical materialism|materialistic]] view of the world, and working to limit the place of clericalism.&lt;ref&gt;Praca zbiorowa, ''Polska Ludowa. Słownik encyklopedyczny'', Wiedza Powszechna Warszawa 1965; pg. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization continued in the tradition of pre-war [[Polish Association of Freethinkers]], a group which was dominated by [[Communist Party of Poland|Communist Party]] activists, academics, and journalists.

Founded in 1920, '''Banque de Luxembourg''' is one of the most important financial institutions in [[Luxembourg]]. With decisions made locally, it offers its independent wealth management expertise to clients based in Luxembourg and the rest of Europe.

== History ==
Founded in 1920, the history of Banque de Luxembourg is closely tied in with the rise of the financial centre of Luxembourg.
* 1920 : Banque d'Alsace et de Lorraine, later Crédit Industriel d'Alsace et de Lorraine (CIAL), opens its first branch in Luxembourg.
* 1937 : Banque Mathieu Frères, the forerunner of '''Banque de Luxembourg''', is founded.
* 1969 : CIAL becomes a major shareholder in Banque Mathieu Frères.
* 1977 : Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. becomes a shareholder in Banque Mathieu Frères, which changes its name to '''Banque de Luxembourg'''.
* 1991 : '''Banque de Luxembourg''' takes over the Luxembourg activities of CIAL.
* 1994 : The bank opens its new head office at 14 [[Boulevard Royal]], Luxembourg.
* 1999 : '''Banque de Luxembourg''' launches Fund-Market S.A., the independent fund adviser. Fund-Market's products and services were integrated into the Bank's offer in 2010.
* 2002 : Following restructuring, Deutsche Bank sells its 28.95% holding in '''Banque de Luxembourg''' to [[Crédit Industriel et Commercial|CIC Group]], which becomes a shareholder via the Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel (CIC Group holding company).
* 2005 : Banque de Luxembourg Fund Research &amp; Asset Management (BL FR&amp;AM) brings together the bank's investment analytical and management expertise.
* 2010 : Banque de Luxembourg opens a branch in Belgium to meet the needs of clients from the Belgian province of Luxembourg.

== Shareholder structure ==
Banque de Luxembourg is a wholly owned subsidiary of Crédit Mutuel-CIC via the Crédit Industriel et Commercial (CIC). CIC serves around 4.97 million private, professional and corporate clients. CIC is 93%-owned by Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel (BFCM), the holding company of the bancassurance group Crédit Mutuel Centre Est Europe-CIC. A non-listed company, the Crédit Mutuel Centre Est Europe-CIC group combines the strengths of 11 regional federations of Crédit Mutuel with those of CIC. Owned by around 4.97 million sociétaires (shareholding members), and with 69,500 employees serving 23.8 million customers, it is a major player in the French retail banking sector. The Crédit Mutuel Centre Est Europe-CIC group's excellent financial strength is reflected in equity capital of EUR 39.6 billion and its tier one solvency ratio of 15%. The rating agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's assign a rating of Aa3 and A+ respectively to the BFCM group, making it one of the highest-rated banks in the eurozone.

== Branches ==

=== Luxembourg ===
Designed by Bernardo Fort-Brescia, from the architectural practice Arquitectonica in Miami, the Bank's head office and recently inaugurated extension houses the Bank's Luxembourg-based sales teams. The support and back office teams are located at the administrative headquarters in Howald.

=== Belgium ===
The Bank's two private banking centres in Brussels and in Gand offer the best of Luxembourg private banking to a Belgian clientele.

The '''Chevau-légers''' (from [[French language|French]] ''cheval''—horse—and ''léger''—light) was a generic French name for several units of light and medium cavalry.
[[Image:Szwolezer.JPG|thumb|Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard charging]]
Their history began in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, when the heavy [[cavalry]] forces of the French ''Compagnies d'Ordonnance'' were undergoing a massive structural reorganization. Initially, the companies combined the ''gendarmes'' (fully armoured men-at-arms) along with lighter ''coutiliers'' and "archers" in the same mounted formation, with the better armoured men forming the foremost ranks. However, as time passed the lighter horsemen were increasingly separated into independent formations of "medium" cavalry, bearing lighter armour and much shorter lances than the ''gendarmes''. These lighter formations eventually gained the name of ''chevau légers''. A similar development also happened in the organization of the Austrian and Spanish cavalry with the growth of ''caballería ligera'' formations.

Their original similarities to [[lancers|lancer]] units meant that in the armies of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the title came to be applied for both sword armed medium cavalry and lancer cavalry units interchangeably, depending on the regional custom. Examples of this include the famous [[Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard|Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment]] of the French [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Guards]] and the [[2e régiment de chevau-légers lanciers de la Garde Impériale]], both subtitled ''Chevau-légers'' despite being light lancer cavalry. While the Austrian and many other German states retained ''Chevau-légers'' that were actually sword armed medium cavalry.

The Directive 2001/19/EC amends Council Directives 89/48/EC and 92/51/EC on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications and Council Directives 77/452/EC, 77/453/EC, 78/686/EC, 78/697/EC, 78/1026/EC, 80/154/EC, 80/155/EC, 85/384/EC, 85/432, 85/433/EC and 93/16/EC concerning the above mentioned professions.

The general system Directives permit the host Member State to require, subject to certain conditions, to take compensation steps, notably where substantial differences exist between the theoretical and/or practical education and training undergone and that covered by the qualification required in the host Member State.

The site is dated to the [[Bilozerska culture]], around 1250–925 BC.&lt;ref name="Gorbenko"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Grebennikov|first2=Yuriy|date=2009|title=The 'Dykyi Sad' fortified settlement as a uniting link in the context of economic, political and cultural relation of 1200-1000 BC (the Baltic Shore, the Pontic region and the Mediterranean)|url=https://repozytorium.amu.edu.pl/bitstream/10593/13272/1/BPS-14-18_K_V_Gorbenko%20Y_S_Grebennikov%20THE%20%E2%80%98DYKYI%20SAD%E2%80%99%20FORTIFIED%20SETTLEMENT%20AS%20A%20UNITING%20LINK%20IN%20THE%20CONTEXT%20OF%20ECONOMIC%2c%20POLITICAL%20AND%20CULTURAL%20RELATION%20OF%201200-1000%20BC%20PP_375-390.pdf|journal=Baltic-Pontic Studies|volume=14|pages=375–390|issn=1231-0344|last1=Gorbenko|first1=Kirill|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Горбенко|first=К.В.|date=2014|title=Городище "Дикий Сад" в контексте социально-экономических и культурных связей балтийского и черноморского регионов XІII–XI вв. до н.э.|url=http://repo.gsu.by/xmlui/handle/123456789/1626|journal=Известия Гомельского государственного университета имени Ф.

Electronic commerce or ''e-commerce in Southeast Asia'' is the buying and selling of products and services over the internet in [[Southeast Asia|the countries of Southeast Asia]]. These practices reached Southeast Asia during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com mania]] in the 1990s. After the dot-com bust, native e-companies have seen promising and fast growth in their sector.

==History==

===Before the Bubble===
During the 1990s, due to the [[Internet]] and the beginning of e-commerce, it was possible for Southeast Asian consumers to purchase items from American and European companies that would be delivered in their countries. The dot-com companies’ stock prices skyrocketed, and native companies felt they needed to catch up to the other high selling e-commerce countries, choosing to underestimate the risks of launching many e-companies and letting the market decide which ones would succeed.

Asia had begun to attract nearly half of the total capital inflow from developing countries, appealed by the high [[interest rates]]. The economies of [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Four Trends driving Thailand’s e-Commerce Market|url=https://www.dezshira.com/library/article/four-trends-driving-thailand-s-e-commerce-market-7824.html?1538646654 |website=Asiapedia |publisher=Dezan Shira and Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indonesia's E-Commerce Sector - Opportunities for Investors |url=https://www.dezshira.com/library/infographic/indonesia-s-e-commerce-sector-opportunities-for-investors-7773.html?1538740076 |website=Asiapedia |publisher=Dezan Shira and Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw a high [[GDP growth|GDP growth rates]] up to 12 percent, due to the stable Asian economies, the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]] for the benefit of the Asian local companies.&lt;ref name = "Orbeta"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Or beta|first=Acetonic C. Jr.|title=E-Commerce in Southeast Asia: A Review of Developments, Challenges and Issues|journal=Philippines institute for Development Studies|date=October 2000|url=http://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/dps/pidsdps0038.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Purchasing power]]{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} was growing as well as the number of [http://ecommerceiq.asia/thailand-ecommerce-landscape-ecommerceiq/ e-commerce companies] in each market, which promised a bright future for e-commerce.

===After the Bubble===
After 2000, the e-commerce market was mainly dominated by [[business-to-business]] (B2B) transactions due to consumer mistrust after going through the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|1997’s financial crisis]] in Southeast Asia and the [[Dotcom bubble|bubble burst]]. The only way e-commerce companies could re-enter the [[business-to-consumer]] (B2C) market was to earn back consumer trust. Companies like [[Amazon.com]], for example, spent almost a decade, in coordination with the Southeast Asian governments that contributed by becoming “Internet-friendly”, to rebuild that trust.&lt;ref name = "Orbeta"/&gt;

====Challenges and Issues====

In addition to consumer mistrust, e-companies had to face low Internet usage. According to [[Nielsen Online|Nielsen]], the average Southeast Asian Internet penetration today is around 38 percent among the 15 and over population,&lt;ref name = "Newsdesk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Newsdesk|title=Malaysia is Southeast Asia’s Rising E-Commerce Nation|url=http://www.thechoice.my/featured-articles/63537-malaysia-is-southeast-asias-rising-e-commerce-nation|work=Thechoice.my|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of Singapore where the use of Internet is widespread (at around 67 percent).&lt;ref name="worldstat"&gt;{{cite web|last=Internet world stats|title=The top 20 countries by users in 2012|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm|work=www.internetworldstats.com|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is comparatively low to the rest of the world with [[Australia]] (at 78.9 percent), [[United States]] (at 78.1 percent), [[Germany]] (at 83.0 percent) and [[Japan]] (at 79.5 percent).&lt;ref name="worldstat"/&gt;

Others hurdles to overcome are cultural. For example, the number of credit card owners in Asia, and those who may are used to payment other than in cash, is small. Trust of the bank system and the electronic payments is traditionally low but government initiatives such as Thailand's [http://ecommerceiq.asia/fintech-association-of-thailand/ PromptPay] is trying to push for a "cashless society".  The payments by credit or debit card are, however, on the rise, allowing the development of Internet services and retail. The number of fraud and the high rate of corruption in some countries also discourages people from paying over the Internet.

Lack of information in the industry is also a major concern as reliable market data is scarce and employees lack the digital experience needed to grow quickly. Market research brands such as [https://www.zipeventapp.com/e/google-and-acommerce-present-e-commerce-iq ecommerceIQ] are trying to fix this problem by published and sharing research and insights regarding ecommerce in Southeast Asia. The market research brand launched officially in February 2016 with Google Thailand.  

In response to these challenges emerging e-commerce service providers such as WeLoveShopping, iTrueMart and aCommerce provide COD (cash on delivery) in order to penetrate second and third tier cities in Southeast Asia, as demonstrated by the 42% sales rate outside of the Thai capital, Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acommerce.asia/mobile-commerce-explosive-sales-channel-thailand/|title=Mobile Commerce: Explosive Sales Channel in Thailand|work=aCommerce|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When participating in mobile commerce campaigns in the region, brands also noticed a higher uptake in high-priced items. "What was most surprising to us was how well high price point items sold.  We believe this is driven by the fact that customers have the option to pay via cash on delivery (COD) which reduces the perceived risk for the customer and also enables brands to target customers in regions with lower credit card penetration," said aCommerce Regional Chief Marketing Officer, Sheji Ho. &lt;ref name = "Orbeta"/&gt;

====Growth of Domestic e-commerce====
With [[bankruptcies]] of many dominant international companies in the beginning of 2000{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Southeast Asian companies were able to take over the Internet: [[Blogs]], [[reviews]], [[social networks]] and others started flourishing. It was not until the end of 2011, however, that the e-commerce really re-established itself in Southeast Asia. Foreign companies no longer just ship there but actually offer products and services focusing and responsive to regional needs, from local offices and warehouses.

[[Rocket Internet]] was the first company entering the online shopping market at a large scale in the region, through [[Singapore]], with its fashion venture Zalora. Following that success, Rocket Internet launched [https://nowcheapcheap.com Lazada Malaysia], an [[Amazon.com]] equivalent&lt;ref name = "Newsdesk"/&gt; offering a range of products from electronics, recreation, home appliances, books, video games, health and beauty products, toys, baby products, and fashion items such as bags. The idea was to exploit the Southeast Asian market by offering the opportunity to get the same products that they used to purchase through foreign companies along with local products from an online company just around the corner. Either way, it takes only a few days for delivery whereas it took up to a month before. Zalora and Lazada Malaysia rapidly spread out to neighbor countries and figure now among the more visited and efficient websites in South-East Asia. That is why international and important investors such as [[JP Morgan]], [[Kinnevik]] and [[Summit Partners]] invested millions of dollars in Lazada seeing the huge potential in the Southeast Asian market.&lt;ref name="Lazada"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazada|title=About us|url=http://www.lazada.com.my/about/|work=Rocket Internet|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, WeLoveShopping was established in 2004 as a C2C online marketplace by Ascend Group, a spin-off of [[True Corporation]] and subsidiary of [[C.P. Group]]. The site has recently changed its business model from earning revenue from rentals of online stores to earning commissions from transaction fees ranging from 2.9 to 13%.&lt;ref&gt;Pornwasin, Asina. [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/technology/Scope-of-e-commerce-expanding-rapidly-30264882.html “Scope of e-commerce expanding rapidly”], ''[[The Nation]]'', Bangkok, 21 July 2015. Retrieved on 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Payments for products will be placed in Escrow with cooperation with [[TrueMoney]], and only when the product is delivered to the buyer satisfactorily will the seller get paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.co.th/it/322750 ”Rebranding of WeLoveShopping: no rental fees”], ''[[Daily News (Thailand)|Daily News]]'', Bangkok, 22 May 2015. Retrieved on 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Ascend Group also went on to set up iTrueMart in 2013 as a B2C e-commerce platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1367311714 ”TrueLife launches iTrueMart: retail department store featuring licensed Asian brands”], ‘’[[Prachart Online]]’’, Bangkok, 30 April 2015. Retrieved on 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, iTrueMart turned to [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) to run its e-commerce website and launched in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/itruemart/ ”AWS Case Study: iTrueMart”]. Retrieved on 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the mistrust of the consumers, e-companies adapted themselves to the market and its difficulties. In the case of [[Rocket Internet]] and [http://www.aCommerce.asia aCommerce], they decided to offer the payment methods such as credit card payment and [[cash on delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinasia.com/wearyouwant-cash-delivery-secret-success-ecommerce-startups/|title=Cash on delivery is a secret to the success for e-commerce|work=Tech in Asia|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they updated methods compared to the [[brick-and-mortar]] businesses to meet market expectations: They launched the “14 day return” policy and free and fast [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] in all countries to attract consumers back.&lt;ref name="Lazada" /&gt;

Soon after the appearance of [[Lazada Group|Lazada]] and Zalora.com, [[Rakuten]], Japan's largest B2B2C online retailer, also decided to reach into the same market by launching [[Rakuten]] in [[Malaysia]]. Even though they were already working with local and small e-commerce companies in a low [[catchment area (human geography)|customer catchment area]], in [[Thailand]] in 2009 and [[Indonesia]] in 2011, their Malaysian venture is their biggest achievement in the region. They also had to match consumers’ expectations by offering attractive payment methods and appealing customer service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yung-Hui|first=Lim|title=Asia's Rising E-Commerce Nation: A Q&amp;A With Rakuten Malaysia CEO Masaya Ueno|journal=Forbes|date=28 December 2012|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/limyunghui/2012/12/28/asias-rising-e-commerce-nation-a-qa-with-rakuten-malaysia-ceo-masaya-ueno/|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the significant growth in the number of online retailers, [[price-comparison website]]s became another e-commerce business on the rise. They compile product database from online retailers, traffic users to their websites, before redirecting to the designated merchants. Examples of these websites are [[Priceza]],  [[iprice]], [[PricePanda]], and NowCheapcheap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowcheapcheap.com/|title=Lazada Coupon Redemption|last=|first=|date=7 October 2017|website=Now Cheap Cheap|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of trust in e-commerce and several cultural issues coming from the recent financial crisis, the market for e-businesses has been growing at a double digit rate and seems poised to become one of the most profitable sectors.

The '''Economic Liberation Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement de libération économique}}, abbreviated '''MLE''') was a [[political party]] in [[République du Moyen-Congo|Moyen-Congo]], formed by European settlers who had arrived in the colony after the [[Second World War]]. The party contested the [[Moyen-Congo Representative Council election, 1952|1952 Moyen-Congo Representative Council election]] from the [[Brazzaville]] constituency. It thus pitted itself against the [[Gaullist]] [[Rassemblement du Peuple Français|RPF]] in contesting for the votes of the Brazzaville Europeans.&lt;ref name="bern"&gt;Bernault, Florence. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mPKpk3bhb3cC Démocraties ambiguës en Afrique centrale: Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon, 1940-1965]''. Paris: Karthala, 1996. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

MLE was led by [[Christian Jayle]]. The party was made up by Jayle's associates; small merchants and journalists. The party called for complete [[free trade]] within the colony, and the promotion of small and medium-sized companies and removal of bureaucratic [[red tape]] and 'fiscal tyranny'.&lt;ref name="bern"/&gt;

In the [[French legislative election, 1956|1956 French National Assembly election]], Jayle contested from an African constituency with a new party (the "Party of the Frano-African Community"), receiving merely 757 votes out of 148 000.&lt;ref name="bern"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''El vito''' is a traditional folk song and dance music of [[Andalusia]] whose origins can be traced back to the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Flutetunes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.flutetunes.com/tunes.php?id=858 | title=Sheet Music: El vito | publisher=Flutetunes.com | accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name refers to the "disease" known as [[St. Vitus]]'s dance,&lt;ref name="Pitt-Rivers"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3g_tPZoc4gC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22El+Vito%22+andalusia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22El%20Vito%22%20andalusia&amp;f=false | title=The People of the Sierra | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Pitt-Rivers, Julian | year=1971 | pages=170 | isbn=0226670104}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its lively and vivid character.&lt;ref name="Lema"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=vito | title=Diccionario de la lengua española | publisher=Real Academia Española | accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in the nineteenth century as a dancing song typical of the [[bolero]]. Includes steps of the art of [[bullfighting]]&lt;ref name="La Meri"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFHpsnOH4cQC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22El+Vito%22+bullfight#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Spanish Dancing | publisher=Interlink Book | author=Meri, La | year=1948 | pages=84 | isbn=1566568897}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually played by women. The typical costume includes jacket and brimmed hat.&lt;ref name="Kedzie Wood"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xj0LAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22El+Vito%22+jacket+and+brimmed+hat&amp;dq=%22El+Vito%22+jacket+and+brimmed+hat | title=The Tourist's Spain and Portugal | publisher=Dodd, Mead  and Co. | author=Kedzie Wood, Ruth | year=1913 | pages=61 |OCLC=370539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melody of El vito is played in fast 3/8 timeplayed on a 3/8 tempo,&lt;ref name="Lema"/&gt; and it uses the harmonic [[minor scale]] for the ascending motives, and the [[phrygian mode]], which is the most characteristic of Andalusian music, for the descending mode, which generates an harmonic accompaniment based on the Andalusian cadence. It is also sung with different lyrics,&lt;ref name="Lema"/&gt; humorous or serious.&lt;ref name="Pitt-Rivers"/&gt;

Folk duo [[Esther &amp; Abi Ofarim]] recorded a version of "El Vito" for their 1967 album "2 in 3".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esther-ofarim.de/Disco.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Directorate of Civil Emergencies''' ({{sq|Drejtoria e Përgjithshme e Emergjencave Civile}}) is a department within the [[Ministry of Defence (Albania)|Ministry of Defence]] of [[Albania]] that is responsible for preparing for and responding to natural or man-made disasters.&lt;ref&gt;http://moi.gov.al/?page_id=854&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The current head of the service is Shemsi Prençi.

==History==

Under communist rule, Albania’s military was responsible for emergency management, focusing mostly on response rather than mitigation or prevention activities. Since the end of the communist regime, Albania has made significant steps towards developing an [[emergency management system]]. In 1999, to coordinate assistance during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo refugee crisis]], an Emergency Management Group (EMG)&lt;ref&gt;Kondaj, R (2002). 'Management of refugee crisis in Albania during 1999 Kosovo conflict' CMJ 43(2):190-194,2002
available at http://neuron.mefst.hr/docs/CMJ/issues/2002/43/2/11885046.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was established under the Office of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|Prime Minister]]. After the refugee crisis, the Government dissolved the EMG and passed a series of laws and decrees to establish a new emergency management system.

In 2001, the Government of Albania passed Law No. 8756, "Civil Emergency Services,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preventionweb.net/files/32375_albaniareporthfa20112013unisdr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which defines Government-wide emergency management roles and responsibilities. According to this law planning and implementation of civil emergency plans is the responsibility of the General Directorate for Civil Emergencies (GDCE), currently under the Ministry of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbrojtjacivile.al/?page_id=453&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small organized [[Jews|Jewish]] community in [[Montenegro]]. The 2007 Montenegrin Statistical Yearbook lists 12 Jews in the country, spread across nine towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstat.org/EngPublikacije.htm 2007 Statistical Yearbook of Montenegro, p238]&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence of a significant historic Jewish presence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/12sekelx.html "Antisemitism and Jewish Identity in Serbia after the 1991 Collapse of the Yugoslav State", Laslo Sekelj]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of homeless people in [[Geneva]] are Swiss or French, with a minority from other countries.&lt;ref name=fallout&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/22/new-cold-war-geneva-switzerland-fallout-bunkers-homeless-shelters|title=New cold war: the Geneva fallout bunkers doubling as homeless shelters|first=Kate|last=Bond|date=22 October 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Swiss study found that 1.6 percent of all patients admitted to psych wards were homeless. The study reported that social factors and psychopathology are independently contributing to the risk of homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homelessness among people with severe mental illness in Switzerland|first1=Christoph|last1=Lauber|first2=Barbara|last2=Lay|first3=Wulf|last3=Rössler|date=22 January 2005|publisher=|journal=Swiss Med Wkly|volume=135|issue=3-4|pages=50–56|via=|pmid=15729607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Swiss authorities reportedly began allowing homeless people to sleep in [[fallout shelter]]s built during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=fallout/&gt;

There are a number of centers for providing food for the homeless, including the Suneboge community centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/poverty-in-switzerland_broke-and-homeless-on-the-streets-of-zurich/41058006|title=Broke and homeless on the streets of Zurich - SWI swissinfo.ch|first=Luigi Jorio,|last=swissinfo.ch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5952">The '''Integrated Conflict Early Warning System''' ('''ICEWS''') combines a database of political events and a system using these to provide [[conflict early warning]]s. It is supported by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] in the [[United States]]. The database as well as the model used by [[Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories]] are currently undergoing operational test and evaluation by the [[United States Southern Command]] and [[United States Pacific Command]].&lt;ref name=lockheedmartin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/W-ICEWS.html|title = World-Wide Integrated Crisis Early Warning System|publisher = [[Lockheed Martin]]|accessdate = June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

ICEWS was a DARPA program conceived and led by Dr. Sean P. O'Brien that launched in 2008. In March 2010, O'Brien authored an article that compared ICEWS with past efforts in the realm, including systems designed by [[Bruce Bueno de Mesquita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Crisis Early Warning and Decision Support: Contemporary Approaches and Thoughts on Future Research|last = O'Brien|first = Sean P.|date = March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meier-on-obrien&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlywarning.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/early-warning-decision-support/|title = DARPA’s Crisis Early Warning and Decision Support System|date = March 20, 2010|accessdate = June 21, 2014|last = Meier|first = Patrick|publisher = Conflict Early Warning and Early Response}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the paper, the first of three phases of the ICEWS involved a competition between different groups to successfully predict events of interest based on historical data. The winning team, [[Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories]], combined six different conflict modeling systems, including [[agent-based model]]s such as Barry Silverman's Factionalism and [[Ian Lustick]]'s [[Political Science-Identity]] (PSI) computational modeling platforms, [[logistic regression]] models such as those developed by [[Philip A. Schrodt]] and the Bayesian statistics model used by [[Steve Shellman]], and geo-spatial network models built by [[Michael D. Ward]].&lt;ref name=meier-on-obrien/&gt;

The ICEWS data and model are currently maintained by [[Lockheed Martin]] and are currently undergoing operational test and evaluation by the [[United States Southern Command]] and [[United States Pacific Command]].&lt;ref name=lockheedmartin/&gt;

The '''Juba Conference''' was a June 1947 meeting attended by [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Sudan]]ese delegates in the city of [[Juba, South Sudan|Juba]], then regional capital of [[Equatoria Province]] in [[South Sudan]] (and today the national capital of South Sudan).

Britain organised the conference to combine northern and southern Sudan into one political entity. Until then, the two sectors were essentially treated by the British as two separate colonies because of ethnic, religious and cultural differences. Northern Sudan was heavily [[Arabization|Arabized]] and had a fairly well-structured political and economic infrastructure. Northerners practiced [[Islam]] and were relatively well-educated. Southern Sudan was mainly composed of various [[Nilotic]] tribes who practiced a mixture of [[Christian]] and traditional beliefs. Economically, it did not possess the organization of northern Sudan.

The Juba Conference agreed that northern and southern Sudan would constitute one state and that a Legislative Assembly would represent the entire colony. However, southern Sudanese representatives had several reservations about the resolutions, largely because they were in an inferior position in regards to their region's lack of educational and political experience.

Their apprehension was realised when 800 administrative posts were vacated by the British in preparation for Sudanese "self-rule"; only four of the government posts went to Southerners. In discussions to determine the future of the modern state of Sudan, the southern provinces were largely excluded from the political process.

This disparity lead to the [[First Sudanese Civil War|First]] and [[Second Sudanese Civil War]]s, eventually resulting, in 2011, in the Southern provinces becoming an independent state, the [[Republic of South Sudan]].

'''Kaliningrad Time''' is the [[time zone]] two hours ahead of [[UTC]] ([[UTC+02:00]]) and 1 hour behind [[Moscow Time]] (MSK−1).  It is used in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].

Until 2011, Kaliningrad Time was identical to [[Eastern European Time]] ([[UTC+02:00]]; [[UTC+03:00]] with [[daylight saving time]]). On 27 March 2011, Russia moved to permanent DST, so that clocks would remain on what had been the summer time all year round, making Kaliningrad time permanently set to [[UTC+3]].  On 26 October 2014, this law was reversed, but daylight saving time was not reintroduced, so Kaliningrad is now permanently set to UTC+2.&lt;ref name="dstperm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia: Putin abolishes 'daylight savings' time change|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28423647|website=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2017|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kharkiv Ukrainian Drama Theatre''' also known as the '''Taras Shevchenko Kharkiv Academic Ukrainian Drama Theatre''' is a [[List of national theatres|national theater]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; founded in 1935 out of remnants of the suppressed Berezil Theater, which was founded by [[Les Kurbas]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CH%5CKharkivUkrainianDramaTheater.htm|title=Kharkiv Ukrainian Drama Theater|website=www.encyclopediaofukraine.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kharkiv Ukrainian Drama Theatre has two stages: Main Stage (900 seats) and Small Stage "Berezil" (115 seats).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatre-shevchenko.com.ua/about/shema.php|title=Харківський Державний Академічний Драматичний Театр ім.

The theater's repertoire was formed by directors trained in [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavsky]]'s school, and since 1990s by directors trained by [[Anatoly Vasiliev]]. Over the years the theater's ensemble included many renowned artists such as [[Vadym Meller]] (stage designer), [[Leonid Bykov]] (actor), [[Amvrosy Buchma]] (actor, star of film ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]),'' [[Andriy Zholdak]] (theatre director), [[Andrzej Szczytko]] (theatre director).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eepap.culture.pl/event/antigone-new-york-ivan-franko-national-theatre-kiev|title="Antigone in New York" in Ivan Franko National Theatre, Kiev|newspaper=eepap.culture.pl|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eepap.culture.pl/person/andrzej-szczytko|title=Andrzej Szczytko|newspaper=eepap.culture.pl|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 to 2005,  [[Andriy Zholdak]] was the [[artistic director]] of the theater, where he produced five plays, which, apart from Ukraine, were also presented in many European countries including Germany, France, Finland, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Romania and Russia, at well known festivals. In 2005, after Kharkiv authorities prohibited his staging of ''[[Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet. A Fragment]]'' Zholdak was forced to leave the theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://svobodazholdaktheatre.com/en/director|title=DIRECTOR / Svoboda Zholdak Theatre|website=svobodazholdaktheatre.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the theater's [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] was named by [[UNESCO]] critics as one of the best ensembles in Europe.

'''Middle East Television ''' (also known as '''"METV"''') is a [[Christian]]-based [[satellite]] television broadcasting network located in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]]. Programming on METV includes a mixture of Christian programming, plus non-religious entertainment programs like ''[[The Red Green Show]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and [[National Football League|NFL]] Football.

On April 10, 1982, a Christian-based television station in [[South Governorate|South Lebanon]], Hope TV, was donated to the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], and became METV.

On June 5, 1997 METV launched its 24-hour programming broadcast on the [[Israel Aerospace Industries|Israeli satellite]] [[Amos-2|Amos 2]]. This increased the potential audience from 11 million to 70 million viewers with a signal that is now reaching the entire [[Middle East]].

In anticipation of the Israeli decision to pull out of Southern Lebanon, Middle East Television began searching for a new broadcast facility in May 1999. 

On May 2, 2000 Middle East Television completed construction of its new station and began its digital broadcast from [[Cyprus]]. 

METV was sold to a like-minded ministry, [[LeSEA Broadcasting]], in July 2001.

In September 2016, LeSEA sold the station to Sid Roth's Messianic Vision, Inc. &lt;ref&gt;https://sidroth.org/metv-press-release/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* The logo of METV, prior to the [[Lester Sumrall|LeSEA Broadcasting]] purchase, used to be three [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] trees (made in honor of the [[Flag of Lebanon]]).

In [[North America]], an '''out-of-market sports package''' is a form of [[pay television|subscription television]] that broadcasts [[sports|sporting events]] to areas where the events are unable to be seen by viewers on other [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[cable television]] networks due to the games not being broadcast in their local [[media market|market]].

Many [[Sports league|leagues]] with major television contracts establish elaborate rules regarding which games are broadcast in different regions (with local teams usually getting preference). For viewers who prefer to see a game other than the one being locally broadcast in their designated market area, the out-of market package provides additional options.

==Rationales==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}
While such a thing may not appear necessary to the average sports fan who lives in the market of their team, many circumstances may be in place that generate the desire to view teams out of market. Some include:
* '''Fans moving from the market of their favorite team''' – while that team could be viewed nationally on broadcast or cable television, or when the team plays the local sports franchise, those opportunities are few and far between;
* '''Simply being a fan of an out of market team''';&lt;ref name="fan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricestandard.org/out-of-market-trouble/|title=The Trouble with Being An Out of Market Sports Fan|date=2009-01-10|last=Dewitt|first=Burton|accessdate=2011-02-14|work=Rice Standard|publisher=[[Rice University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Better competition''' – such as in the case of [[college football]] and [[college basketball|basketball]]. For example, the option to watch a few of the most competitive or most interesting national games each week, in addition to one's home team's games. Except for the [[Southeastern Conference]], for example, no conference is assured of a national game of the week at the same time slot every week;
* '''Additional opportunities to watch one sport''' – such as when a home team may not have a game to play, or creating one's own [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]]; watching an early game, then a late game;
* '''Rivalries''' – having the desire to watch a rival team's games, or games of teams in the same athletic conference or division as one's favorite teams, which may not be regularly available in one's market;
* '''Living in an area without an in-market team at the highest level in a sport''' – this usually means availability only of nationally televised games. Though these will often show a regional game, it may be the "most interesting" regional game, resulting in many missed games even when following the geographically closest team.  Leagues will often designate "secondary markets" to prevent this from happening;
* '''Involvement in a [[fantasy sports]] league''' – a sports fan who is "managing" a fantasy team may have the desire to watch the performance of players in several games that are being played simultaneously and thus has the ability to switch back and forth between games.
* '''Blackouts''' – most major sports leagues have a [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] policy that prevents viewers of a particular television channel (usually a [[regional sports network]]) from seeing games on that channel outside of a certain geographic area (specifically to direct out of town viewers to the package).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-10-24/pdf/2014-24612.pdf|title=Sports Blackout Rules [PDF 183 KB] - US Government Publishing Office|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Packages==
===Cable and satellite===
* [[MLB Extra Innings]] - Available to [[DirecTV]] and most [[digital cable]] providers.
* [[MLS Direct Kick]] - Available to DirecTV, [[Dish Network]] and most digital cable providers.
* [[NBA League Pass]] - Available to DirecTV, Dish Network and most digital cable providers.
* [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] - Exclusive to DirecTV*
* [[NHL Center Ice]] - Available to DirecTV, Dish Network and most digital cable providers.
* [[ESPN College Extra]] - Available to DirecTV and most digital cable providers.

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;NFL Sunday Ticket is exclusive to DirecTV in the United States, but in other countries (most notably [[Canada]]) it is available more broadly, on several cable providers. &lt;/small&gt;

===Internet===
With the exception of ESPN3, Internet sports packages are primarily marketed directly to consumers and not through cable or satellite providers. Current Internet television and radio subscription or [[pay-per-view]] services include:
* MLB.tv
* MLB.com Gameday Audio
* [[Minor league baseball|MiLB]].tv
* MLS Live
* [[NFL Audio Pass]] (NFL, radio)
* [[National Hockey League|NHL]].tv (United States), Rogers NHL GameCentre LIVE (Canada, marketed and distributed by Rogers Communications through the 2025-26 NHL season)
* [[NBA League Pass]] Broadband
* [[UFC Fight Pass]]
* [[WWE Network]]
* [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] Broadband (TV)
* [[WatchESPN]] (a [[TV Everywhere]] service offering streaming of [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]], and the web-exclusive service [[ESPN3]])

[[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Football League]] are the only professional sports leagues to black out local affiliates' internet radio feeds. Ironically, while the NFL charges money for radio feeds, it sells the Internet television rights to other networks that make those games available online for free, the opposite model of the other [[U.S. cities with teams from four major league sports|U.S cities major sports leagues]].

The '''paisa''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]/{{lang-hi|पैसा}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پیسہ}}}}), '''poisha''' ({{lang-bn|পয়সা}}) or '''baisa''' ([[Omani Arabic|Omani]]: بيسة) is a monetary unit in several countries. In [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]], the ''paisa'' currently equals {{frac|1|100}} of a [[rupee]]. In [[Bangladesh]], the ''poisha'' equals {{frac|1|100}} of a [[Bangladeshi taka]]. In Oman, the ''baisa'' equals {{frac|1|1000}} of an [[Omani rial]].

==Etymology==

The word ''paisa'' is from the [[Sanskrit]] term ''padāṁśa'', meaning 'quarter part', from ''pada'' "foot or quarter" and ''aṁśa'' "part".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paisa |title=paisa |encyclopedia=Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=pada&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU |title=pada |publisher=spokensanskrit.de (version 4.2) |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that the word derives from Portuguese ´pesa´ from which [[peso]] and diminutive [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] are derived. The pesa was also in use in colonial [[Kenya]]. The colloquial term for money in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], ''paiksan'' ({{my|ပိုက်ဆံ}}), derives from the Hindi term ''paisa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Myanmar-English Dictionary|publisher=Myanmar Language Commission|isbn=1-881265-47-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Until the 1950s in India and Pakistan (and before 1947 in [[British India]]), the paisa was equivalent to 3 [[Pie (Indian coin)|pies]], {{frac|1|4}} of an [[Indian_anna|anna]], or {{frac|1|64}} of a rupee. After the transition from a [[non-decimal currency]] to a [[decimal currency]], the paisa equaled {{frac|1|100}} of a rupee and was known as a ''naya paisa'' ("new paisa") for a few years to distinguish it from the old paisa that was {{frac|1|64}} of a rupee.

==Notation==
{{INR}}1/15/3/2 = {{INR}}1.9947&lt;br /&gt;
{{INR}}1/8/3 = {{INR}}1.546&lt;br /&gt;
{{INR}}1/4 = {{INR}}1.25

==Terminology==

In [[Hindi]], [[Afghan Persian]], and other languages, the word paisa often means money or cash. Medieval trade routes that spanned the [[Arabian Sea]] between India, the Arab regions and East Africa spread the usage of [[Indian subcontinent]] and Arabic currency terms across these areas.&lt;ref name="gsr1953"&gt;{{Cite journal | journal=NADA: The Southern Rhodesia Native Affairs Department Annual |title=Cowry: Ndoro |issue=30 | first=M.

The '''Pan American Health Organization''' ('''PAHO''') is an international [[public health]] agency working to improve health and living standards of the people of the [[Americas]]. It is part of the [[United Nations]] system, serving as the Regional Office for the Americas of the [[World Health Organization]] and as the health organization of the [[Organization of American States|Inter-American System]]. It is known in [[Latin America]] as the '''OPS''' or '''OPAS''' ({{lang-es|Organización Panamericana de la Salud}}; {{lang-pt|Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde}}).

== Description ==

PAHO has scientific and technical expertise at its headquarters, in its 27 country offices, and its three Pan American centers, all working with the countries of the Americas in dealing with priority health issues. The health authorities of PAHO's Member States set PAHO's technical and administrative policies through its Governing Bodies. PAHO Member States include all 35 countries in the Americas; [[Puerto Rico]] is an Associate Member. [[France]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] are Participating States, and [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] are Observer States.

The Organization's essential mission is to strengthen national and local health systems and improve the health of the peoples of the Americas, in collaboration with Ministries of Health, other government and international agencies, [[nongovernmental organizations]], universities, social security agencies, community groups, and many others.

PAHO promotes universal health coverage and universal access to health and [[Health systems strengthening|strengthening of health systems]] based on primary health care strategies. It assists countries in fighting infectious diseases such as [[malaria]], [[cholera]], [[dengue]], [[HIV]] and [[tuberculosis]] as well as the region's growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. PAHO engages in [[technical cooperation]] with ministries of health and facilitates coordination with other sectors to promote health in all policies. PAHO also promotes the use of research evidence to inform health care decisions and policymaking through the implementation of knowledge translation strategies such as the Evidence Informed Policy Network - EVIPNet [[Evipnet]]. 
 
In its efforts to improve health, PAHO targets the most vulnerable groups including mothers and children, workers, the poor, the elderly, and refugees and displaced persons. It focuses on issues related to equity for those who lack access to health, and on a Pan American approach, encouraging countries to work together on common issues and build lasting capacities.

Specific initiatives spearheaded by PAHO include the Expanded Program on Immunization, which played a major role in the elimination of smallpox and polio from the Americas; the Tobacco-free Americas initiative; the Regional Coalition for Water and Sanitation to Eliminate Cholera in Hispaniola; the Salt Smart Consortium; the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization; and a blood safety initiative that seeks to improve blood safety and efficiency by helping countries reach 100% blood supplies from unpaid voluntary donors.

A major priority for the [[Americas]] is cutting [[infant mortality]], and PAHO is mobilizing new political, institutional and financial resources to prevent an additional 25,000 infant deaths every year through application of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy, a simple and practical approach in which [[primary health care]] workers are taught a complete process to evaluate the health status of children brought to a health post or clinic. They learn to recognize signs of disease and evaluate and treat them. They learn to give parents information on how to prevent disease in the home. If they see danger signs indicating the infant could die, they are taught to treat the child immediately or take him or her to a hospital.

Improvement of drinking water supplies, adequate sanitation, and increased access to [[health care]] for the poor are still top priorities for PAHO, with a focus on equity. The Organization is intensifying its efforts to have countries know the true state of health of their populations and where the inequalities lie. Program efforts focus on correcting inequality, taking into account decentralization and change of state functions, on showing that health has a role to play in the success of other sectors, and on how attention to health affects positively other aspects of human development. Advocacy in this area is also directed to reducing pernicious gender inequity, which reflects in some health problems of women.

The Pan American approach is a part of PAHO history and the spirit of Panamericanism continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], the [[Andes|Andean Region]], and the [[Southern Cone]]. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after [[hurricane Mitch]], and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called "Health Technology Linking the Americas."

The countries of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] joined together over 20 years ago to buy vaccines through a revolving fund, bringing them tangible benefits and helping advance PAHO's efforts to eliminate or control vaccine-preventable diseases. These are among the Organization's most notable successes, starting with the eradication of smallpox from the Americas in 1973; a triumph followed five years later by global eradication of the dreaded disease.

A major effort committing the Americas to embark on [[polio eradication]] in 1985 succeeded in September 1994, when a distinguished International Commission declared the Americas officially polio-free. The last case of polio in the [[Americas]] was identified August 23, 1991 in a young boy named Luis Fermín Tenorio Cortez, in [[Junín, Peru|Junín]], [[Peru]]. Since then, despite intensive surveillance, no cases of [[polio]] have been detected anywhere in the [[Americas]], and the [[World Health Organization]] is now working toward the goal of eradicating polio globally. PAHO assists the countries in mobilizing the necessary resources to provide immunization and treatment services for all [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. PAHO is close to accomplishing the goal of eliminating [[measles]] from this hemisphere and is pressing on with the introduction of new vaccines that are currently available, such as [[Haemophilus influenzae]] B. to reduce [[meningitis]] and respiratory infections. PAHO works to reduce the toll of death and illness from [[diarrheal diseases]], including [[cholera]], through case management and [[oral rehydration therapy]] to prevent deaths from dehydration, and to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year.

PAHO disseminates scientific and technical information through its publications program, its Internet site [http://www.paho.org], and a network of academic libraries, documentation centers, and local health care libraries.

The Organization provides technical collaboration in a variety of specialized public health fields, and organizes emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination. It supports efforts to strengthen national health systems, develop national health research systems, control [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease|Chagas]]' disease, urban [[rabies]], [[leprosy]], and other diseases that affect the people of the Americas. PAHO collaborates with governments, other agencies, and private groups to address major nutritional problems including [[protein-energy malnutrition]], and is now working to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies.

It engages in and facilitates health promotion to help countries deal with health problems typical of development and urbanization, especially non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[cancer]], [[accidents]], [[smoking]], [[addiction to drugs]] and [[alcohol]], and injuries among others. Beyond health promotion, PAHO also addresses health systems and quality of care issues in support of national efforts to respond to the NCD pandemic.

The Organization also executes projects for other [[United Nations]] agencies, for [[international organizations]] such as the [[World Bank]] and [[Inter-American Development Bank]], for official development cooperation agencies of various governments, and for [[philanthropic foundations]].

PAHO strengthens the health sector capacity in the countries to advance their priority programs through intersectoral action, promoting an integral approach to health problems. It also works to improve women's health, promoting the greater integration of women in society, as well as awareness of their importance as both recipients and providers of health services.

PAHO trains health workers at all levels, through fellowships, courses and seminars, and the strengthening of national training institutions. It leads in the use of advanced communications technologies for information, health promotion, and education, working with journalists in many countries.

The Organization recognizes the role of the private sector in the delivery of services, and fosters dialogue and partnerships with the Ministries of Health. In addition to its core budget financed by quota contributions from its Member Governments, PAHO also seeks outside funding to help implement special programs and initiatives in response to vital health needs. Voluntary tax-deductible contributions for PAHO health and education projects in the [[Americas]] may be made to the [[PAHO Foundation]].

Dr. [[Carissa F. Etienne]] of the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] was elected as the new director of PAHO on January 31, 2013.  PAHO's Deputy Director is Dr. Isabella Danel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PAHO|title=Isabella Danel, former CDC official, sworn in as PAHO/WHO Deputy Director |url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10364&amp;Itemid=1926&amp;lang=en|accessdate= 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States, and the Assistant Director is Jarbas Barbosa&lt;ref&gt;https://www.paho.org/hq3/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14529:brazilian-doctor-appointed-assistant-director-of-paho&amp;Itemid=135&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;, from Brazil.

==History==

The organization was founded in December 1902. It was originally called the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}} In 1949, PAHO and WHO signed an agreement making PAHO the American Regional Office (AMRO) of WHO. Today the usual phrasing is "Regional Office for the Americas".

The '''Principles for Digital Development''' are a set of nine
guidelines that were established to promote effective practices
in technology-enabled programmes for international development
and cooperation.&lt;ref name="digitalprinciples"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalprinciples.org/|website=digitalprinciples.org|title=Principles for Digital Development|accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A
[[community of practice]] around the principles provides a focal
point for development practitioners, supporting the sharing
knowledge and peer learning.

It is his first novel followed by ''[[The Twenty-Second Day]]'' in 2007. Aladdin that he wrote the novel in two days, separated by 6 months, and that he did not change a word of it. it made Aladdin name in the Arabic literary scene, described it as a "[[wikt:tour de force|tour de force]]". Because of it, and his entire body of work to date, Aladdin is often described as "an innovator in the Arabic literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersunlimited.nl/en/participant/muhammad-aladdin/|title=Muhammad Aladdin|date=|work=[[writers unlimited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
A young man walks a scorching Cairo street. At the entrance to the city’s pivotal main square, he notices a succulent girl. Ineluctably drawn into her magnetic field, and the swirling, palpitating square ahead, he starts to fantasize about how he would talk to her, seduce her, rape her, love her, abandon her, cherish her were he, for example, a Brazen Rake, a Brutal Bohemian, a Sensitive Painter, or a Bald Mechanic, jumping from persona to persona as his imaginings become more and more feverish, while in his mind the girl goes through a similar series of transformations. These characters—a circus parade of Egypt’s contemporary human menagerie—are not, however, mere dress-up costumes to be donned and discarded at their author’s whim. They, and others who emerge from the side alleys of his mind, strut their stuff, accost one another, argue, and shout until eventually they leave him, on a scorching Cairo street, peering after an infinite succession of receding, parallel clamorous worlds, from whose possibilities he must draw his own conclusions.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
[[Muhammad Aladdin]] (b. 1979) has published short comic books for teenagers and a collection of short stories (''The Other Bank'' 2003). While excerpts from his first, unpublished novel ''The Twenty-Second Day'' appeared in Akhbar al-Adab in 2004, his first unpublished—as well—novel ''Al Dawa'er'' winning the Cultural Palaces prize 2004. ''The Gospel according to Adam'' breaks the conventional format of the novel, consisting as it does of a single 60-page-long paragraph that, like all good streams of consciousness, sweeps writer and reader on to no pre-ordained or predictable destination. As a reviewer for [[Al-Ahram]]'s literary page ( May 10, 2006) puts it, The Gospel according to Adam reflects "a social reality that has lost all certainties." In keeping with other novels (such as Ahmed Alaidy's ''Being Abbas el Abd'') of an emerging new school of writing in [[Cairo]], the work is the funny and taboo-breaking product of a young writer without preconceptions of what makes a novel or how one should be written and who has been hailed by writers such as Baha Tahir and [[Sonallah Ibrahim]] as among the best of a promising new crop.

In his book, "The Arab Novel and the Quest for Renovation" published by [[Dubi Althaqafia]] Magazine in May 2011, the famous Moroccan writer and critic [[Mohammed Berrada]] sites it as one of 5 novels has renovated the Arab novel.

The Egyptian writer [[Ibraim Farghali]] wrote about it in the famous Lebanese newspaper [[An-Nahar]] that The Gospel According to Adam is "An experimental and substantial jump in narration style in the modern Egyptian novels".
