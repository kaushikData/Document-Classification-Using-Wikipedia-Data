The '''1972 Olympics Black Power Salute''' was a political protest by two US Olympic runners [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] and [[Wayne Collett]] during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] at the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]].  This event is sometimes referred to as "The Forgotten Protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2011/02/01/vince-matthews-and-wayne-collette-1972-the-forgotten-protest/|title=Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett 1972 – The Forgotten Protest?|author=Jimson Lee|work=SpeedEndurance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event came four years after the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/24/sport/olympics-norman-black-power/|title=The third man: The forgotten Black Power hero|author=James Montague, CNN|date=24 April 2012|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the games==
Matthews was a 1968 Olympian who had retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/vince-matthews-1.html|title=Vince Matthews|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was frustrated by problems that included having to pay his own travel to the US Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartmann | first=D. | title=Race, Culture, and the Revolt of the Black Athlete: The 1968 Olympic Protests and Their Aftermath | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-226-31855-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNvIe2JE0vIC&amp;pg=PA241 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protest==
Both runners refused to stand for the US National Anthem.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schiller | first=K. | last2=Young | first2=C. | title=The 1972 Munich Olympics and the Making of Modern Germany | publisher=University of California Press | series=Weimar and now | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxEQEqnXdRAC&amp;pg=PT134 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently stroked their beards, and twirled their medals as they left the stadium.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; The crowd booed both runners for their display.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/17/local/la-me-wayne-collett18-2010mar18|title=Wayne Collett dies at 60; UCLA sprinter won silver medal at '72 Olympics|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reaction==
The [[Associated Press]] noted that the casual behavior of Matthews and Collett during the playing of the anthem as "disrespectful," and described the conduct as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Collett, bare-footed, leaped from the No. 2 tier to the No. 1 stand beside his teammate.  They stood sideways to the flag, twirling their medals, with Matthews stroking his chin. Their shoulders slumped, neither stood erect nor looked at the flag. ... As whistles and catcalls continued, Collett raised a clenched fist to the crowd before entering the portal of the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milburn, Matthews Win Gold, But U.S. Trails|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gpwcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mWYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5359,2754393&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Markus reported in the Chicago Tribune on September 9, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/229/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Matthews] was angry at Coach Bill Bowerman-as most of the U.S. trackmen seem to be-because Bowerman had hinted he would like to remove him from the place he had earned in the 400-meter field. He was angry that he had been forced to train on his own in unsuitable facilities, had to travel 4 or 5 times from N.Y. to the west coast in order to get any kind of competition, and had been put down by some of the press as a drag on America's hopes for a 400-meter sweep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chicago Tribune further reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/227/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Matthews said his and Collett's actions were directed at the U.S. coaching staff, not the flag or the National Anthem. "We were just mad about a lot of things. We didn't think it would blow up like this. We were asked to apologize. I'm not really sorry for what I did. I'm sorry for the way people took it [hoots and whistles from the stands when the anthem finished]. What I tried to get across to the Olympic Committee was if it was pre-meditated I could have done something better than that. It was just something that happened. We didn't realize the implications to the people in the stands."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview after the medal ceremony with the [[American Broadcasting Company]], Collett said the [[national anthem]] meant nothing to him.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;{{cite news|author=Chuck Johnson|title=Matthews, Collett Barred for Conduct on Victory Stand|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cMAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7196,4127118&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He explained that he had felt unable to honor the anthem, because of the struggle faced by [[African American]]s at the time: "I couldn't stand there and sing the words because I don't believe they're true. I wish they were. I believe we have the potential to have a beautiful country, but I don't think we do." The pair were banned from future Olympic competition by the IOC; since [[John Smith (sprinter)|John Smith]] had pulled a hamstring 80 meters into the final while leading and had been ruled unfit to run, the USA were now unable to field a team in the [[4 × 400 metres relay|4 × 400 m relay]] and were forced to scratch from the event.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

===Athlete statements===
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't acting any differently than I usually do, but we were like goldfish in a fishbowl, in front of all those people. If they wanted me to stand at attention, I could've probably done that, but it wouldn't be me, and I was led to believe that the Olympics was for the athlete. We consider ourselves athletes, not politicians, or marching bands. Our athletic competition was over, and we were both happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/merron/030205.html|title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Violating the Olympic spirit|work=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After the games==
Matthews was banned from all future Olympic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+banned&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=njf4IVrOwi&amp;sig=JH18ql10zlU9ayOguLiIDL6LvMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xF8uVY3-KsuKyATe4YGACA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20banned&amp;f=false%7ctitle=Jet%7cwork=google.com|title=Jet|work=google.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both runners in fact received a lifelong ban from the IOC and the USOC.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; This banning likely cost the US medals in the 4x400.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; Both runners were eventually elected to the Black Olympian Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KdbR4eqgfEC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+Wayne+Collett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiCNVyOHE4&amp;sig=X8bd-DGcrE-KxhtW7acoiCA9AME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmIuVYuuEouoyQSArYHIAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20Wayne%20Collett&amp;f=false|title=Black Enterprise|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] stated the actions of Matthews and Collett made for  a "disgusting display."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/wayne-collett-athlete-who-staged-a-black-power-protest-at-the-1972-olympic-games-1956018.html|title=Wayne Collett: Athlete who staged a Black Power protest at the 1972 Olympic Games|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This display by the athletes would be overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Collett went on to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 2011, Matthews was elected to the USATF Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/halloffame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=249|title=USATF - Hall of Fame|work=usatf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''G. Aldo Antonelli''' (1962 - October 11, 2015) was an Italian-born philosopher and academic. He taught at the [[University of California, Irvine]] before joining the philosophy department at the [[University of California, Davis]] in 2008. Professor Antonelli was known largely for his work in [[logic]].

==Biography==
He grew up in [[Torino, Italy]], where he received an undergraduate degree in philosophy. After some time, he attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for a post-graduate degree, obtaining his PhD. Prior to taking up his position at UC Davis, he also taught for many years at UC Irvine, and held appointments at Pittsburgh, [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], and elsewhere. He passed away on October 11, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2015/10/13/aldo-antonelli-1962-2015/|title=Aldo Antonelli (1962 - 2015) (several updates)|last=W|first=Justin|date=2015-10-13|website=Daily Nous|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
An expert in pure and applied logic, his research largely focused on issues in [[defeasible reasoning]] and [[non-monotonic logic]]. His more recent work in philosophy of logic was concerned with applications of [[generalized quantifier]] theory and abstraction principles to the foundations of arithmetic in the more general context of [[Fregean]] foundations, as well as making contributions to Frege scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/aldant|title=G.

'''Black pride''' is a movement in response to dominant white cultures and ideologies that encourages [[black people]] to celebrate black culture and embrace their African heritage.&lt;ref name="Tyson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lois Tyson|title=Learning for a Diverse World: Using Critical Theory to Read and Write about Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNe_wvUh3ewC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8153-3774-4|pages=208–209|quote=Because the dominant white culture in America treated African Americans as subalterns rather than full American citizens and full human beings, the Black Pride movement encouraged black Americans to look to Africa for their cultural origins.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it was a direct response to white [[Racism in the United States|racism]] especially during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name="Glasker2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne C.

==Beauty and fashion==
Beauty standards are a major theme of black pride. Black pride was represented in slogans such as "[[black is beautiful]]"&lt;ref name="Jha2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meeta Jha|title=The Global Beauty Industry: Colorism, Racism, and the National Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fWPCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46|date=16 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-55795-1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurst2015"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=José Blanco F.|editor3=Patricia Kay Hunt-Hurst|editor4=Heather Vaughan Lee|editor2=Mary Doering|title=Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA52|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-310-3|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; which challenged white beauty standards.&lt;ref name="Rooks1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Noliwe M.

In the 1960s to 1970s, [[kente cloth]] and the Black Panthers uniform were worn in the U.S. as expressions of black pride.&lt;ref name="Hurst2015" /&gt; Headscarves were sometimes worn by [[Nation of Islam]] and other Black Muslim Movement members as an expression of black pride and a symbol of faith.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; Other women used scarves with African prints to cover their hair.&lt;ref name="Hurst2015" /&gt;

[[Maxine Leeds Craig]] argues that all-black beauty pageants such as [[Miss Black America]] were institutionalized forms of black pride created in response to exclusion from white beauty pageants.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt;

===Brazil===
The black pride movement is very prevalent in [[Brazil]], especially throughout the poorer population, and it is found in the Brazilian [[funk]] music genre that began arose in the late 1960s, as also in [[funk carioca]], that emerged in the late 1980s. Both the origin of Brazilian funk and funk carioca reflects Brazilian black resistance. Ethnomusicologist George Yúdice states that youths were engaging black culture mediated by a U.S. culture industry met with many arguments against their susceptibility to cultural colonization. Although it borrows some ingredients from [[hip hop]], its style still remains unique to Brazil (mainly Rio de Janeiro and also São Paulo).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yúdice|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===
Black pride has been a central theme of the originally [[Jamaica]]n [[Rastafari movement]] since the second half of the 20th century. It has been described as "a rock in the face of expressions of white superiority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/slavery.shtml Rastafari and slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The slogan has been used in the [[United States]] by [[African Americans]] to celebrate heritage&lt;ref name="Tyson2001" /&gt; and personal pride. The black pride movement is closely linked with the developments of the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Black Power movement]]&lt;ref name="Glasker2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vahistorical.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/civil-rights-movement-virginia/rising-black |title=Rising Black Consciousness |publisher=[[Virginia Historical Society]] |quote=As the civil rights movement gained ground, removing the stigma of inferiority not only in schools but throughout society, black pride increased. |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opposed the conditions of the United States' segregated society, and lobbied for better treatment for people of all races.

'''Claudio E.A. Pizzi''' (born 20 September 1944, [[Milan]]) is an Italian [[logician]] and [[epistemologist]].

== Biography ==
Pizzi completed his Master's degree in philosophy from the [[State University of Milan]] in 1969. From 1976, he taught [[Philosophy of logic|logic]] for three years at the [[University of Calabria]]. He then worked as a professor of logic and of [[philosophy of science]] at the [[University of Siena]] from 1979 to 2014, in which he became a [[full professor]] in 1997. Beginning from 1992, he worked for several Brazilian universities and especially for Centro de Logica, Epistemologia e Historia da Ciencia (CLE) of the [[University of Campinas]]. From 2008-2012, he taught logic of proof at the Faculty of Law of the second State University of Milan.&lt;ref name="MagnaniCarnielli2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magnani|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Carnielli|first2=Walter|editor1= Lorenzo Magnani|editor2=Walter Carnielli|editor3=Claudio Pizzi|title=Model-Based Reasoning in Science and Technology: Abduction, Logic, and Computational Discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8JgZUoEWC8C&amp;pg=PRXI|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-15222-1|pages=xi–xvi|chapter=Years of Reasoning: In Honor of the 65th Birthday of Claudio Pizzi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities ==
After completing his studies, Pizzi edited the Italian translation of G.E. Hughes and M.J. Cresswell's ''An Introduction to [[Modal logic|Modal Logic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G.E. |last1=Hughes|first2=M.J.|last2=Cresswell|title=Introduzione alla logica modale|publisher=Il Saggiatore|location=milano|year=1968|translator-first=Claudio E.A.|translator-last=Pizzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published two anthologies in 1974 and 1979 aimed to spread the knowledge of two areas of intensional logic unknown in Italy: [[tense logic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La logica del tempo|editor-first=Claudio E.A.|editor-last=Pizzi|publisher=Boringhieri|location=Torino|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[conditional logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leggi di natura, modalità, ipotesi|editor-first=Claudio E.A.|editor-last=Pizzi|publisher=Feltrinelli|location=Milano|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of academic papers, he developed a variant of so-called [[connexive logic]] named "logic of consequential implication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id =logic-connexive|title=Connexive Logic|first=Heinrich|last=Wansing|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which turns out to be translatable in the main system of propositional modal logic and so decidable via the ''[[TABLEAUX|tableaux]]'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=M. D’Agostino|title=Handbook of Tableau Methods|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pizzi is also known for his contributions to modal logic concerning the problem of defining [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessity]] in terms of contingency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Claudio E.A.|last=Pizzi|title=Necessity and Relative Contingency|journal=Studia Logica|year=2007|volume=85|pages=305-410}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of Aristotelian squares and cubes in visualizing the relations between modal notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Claudio E.A.|last=Pizzi|title=Generalization and Composition of Modal Squares of Opposition|journal=Logica Universalis|year=2016|volume=26|pages=1-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Brazilian logicians, Pizzi has explored the subject of multimodal logics (i.e. of logics whose language has more than one modal primitive), to which he produced a monograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Claudio E.A.|last=Pizzi|first2=W.|last2=Carnielli|title=Modalities and Multimodalities|publisher=Springer|location=New York|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last book (2017) contains a methodological  analysis of the investigations about a plane crash which took place in 1980, known as the "Ustica massacre".

'''David Doig''' [[FRSE]] LLD (1719–1800) was a Scottish educator, philologist and writer known for historical and philosophical works. He was Rector of Stirling High School from 1760 to 1800. Doig is also believed to have been the inventor of the tartan pattern now associated with [[Burberry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=440|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|website=www.tartanregister.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Doig Silhouette.jpg|thumb|David Doig, silhouette]]
[[File:Memorial to David Doig, Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling.jpg|thumb|Memorial to David Doig, [[Church of the Holy Rude]], Stirling]]

==Life==
David was born 14 Feb 1719 at Mill of Melgund, [[Aberlemno]], Angus, son of David Doig and Ann Sturrock. His father, who was a small farmer, died while he was an infant, and his mother married again. He was successful in a Latin competition for a bursary at the [[University of St. Andrews]]. Having finished the classical and philosophical course and proceeded B.A., he began the study of divinity, but scruples regarding the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] prevented him from entering the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]].

Doig taught from 1749 in the parochial schools of Monifieth, [[Kennoway]] and [[Falkland, Fifeshire]]. His reputation then gained for him the rectorship of the grammar school of [[Stirling]], a post he filled for over 40 years. In addition to Greek and Latin Doig had mastered Hebrew and Arabic. The [[University of Glasgow]] conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D., and on the same day he received from St. Andrews his diploma as M.A. He was also elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]].

Robert Burns visited Stirling on 27 Aug 1787 when he had dinner at the Golden Lion Hotel with Lieutenant Forrester of the Castle garrison, Dr David Doig of the Grammar School and Christopher Bell, a singing teacher. He later described Dr. David Doig as "a queerish figure, and something of a pedant." [Note: Robert Burns' school teacher in Maybole, Ayr was also a David Doig (1679/80-1784).]

Doig was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1798. His proposers were [[James Gregory (physician)|Dr James Gregory]], [[Andrew Dalzell]], and [[John Playfair]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doig died in [[Stirling]] on 16 March 1800, aged 81. He is buried in the Holy Rude Cemetery next to [[Stirling Castle]].

A mural tablet, with an inscription in commemoration of his virtues and learning, was raised by his friend [[John Ramsay of Ochtertyre]]. The town of Stirling also erected a marble monument to his memory, with a Latin epitaph written by himself.

==Family==

Doig was married to Isabella Janet Bower (1727-1762) in [[Monifieth]] on 17 November 1749.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

They had children: Isabella, Ann, Jean, David, George, and Patrick. Their daughter Isabella (1751-1819) married Dr. John Aird (c.1740-1790) with sons William, David, and John. The next four children died young. Patrick Doig (1762-1833) married Jane Austin (1781-1849)with a son David (1812-1819); Patrick later became a medical doctor in Antigua.

==Works==
Doig's first known appearance in print was some twenty pages of annotation on the ''[[Gaberlunzie-man]]'', in an edition of that and another old Scottish poem, ''[[Christis Kirk on the Green|Christ's Kirk on the Green]]'', published in 1782 by his friend and neighbour [[John Callander]] of Craigforth. ''Two Letters on the Savage State, addressed to the late Lord Kaims'' (London, 1792) attacked the views of [[Lord Kames]] in ''[[Sketches of the History of Man]]'' (1774). The first of the letters, from 1775, had been sent to Kames, who was passing the Christmas vacation a few miles from Stirling, and who invited Doig to dinner next day.

Doig's next publication was ''Extracts from a Poem on the Prospect from Stirling Castle'' (Stirling, 1796). He contributed to vol. iii. of the ''Transactions'' of the Royal Society of Edinburgh a dissertation "On the Ancient Hellenes". He also wrote in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' third edition]] the articles on "Mythology", "Mysteries", and "Philology". They brought Doig correspondence with [[William Vincent (priest)|William Vincent]] and [[Jacob Bryant]].

Besides Latin and English poems Doig left some treatises in manuscript. A partial list  was in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 8th edit. viii. 92.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2553">{{Neologism|date=May 2011}}
The term  '''epistemocracy''' has many conflicting uses, generally designating someone of rank having some [[epistemic]] property or other. [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] used it in 2007 to designate a [[utopia]]n type of society where the leadership possesses epistemic humility. He claims the French writer [[Michel de Montaigne]] was a modern epistemocrat. He points out, however, that it is difficult to assert authority on the basis of one's uncertainty; leaders who are assertive, even if they are incorrect, still gather people together.&lt;ref name=The_Black_Swan&gt;{{Cite book |last= Taleb |first= Nassim Nicholas |authorlink= Nassim Nicholas Taleb |title= [[The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]] |chapter= Epistemocracy, a Dream |publisher= [[Random House]] |isbn= 978-1-4000-6351-2 |pages= 190–192 |year= 2007 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However the term had already been used long before this, and {{as of|2010|lc=y}} Taleb's usage has not caught on. Most uses of the word are unrelated or even opposite to this. For instance in reference to [[communism]]: "Maoism, like the Marxist- Leninist system upon which it modeled itself, was an `epistemocracy,' rule by those possessed of that infallible wisdom embodied in the `universal truth of Marxism'"&lt;ref&gt;Marxism, China, and Development: Reflections on Theory and Reality by A. Gregor, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Or [[theocracy]]: "The model for this concentration of knowledge in the hands of a single group is the epistemocracy of the Old Testament priests..." &lt;ref&gt;J. R. Simpson. Animal body, literary corpus: the old French "Roman de Renart". Editions Rodopi B.V., Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use seems to be in relation to modern science or [[western world|western]] [[technocracy]]: "...the social promotion and political em-powerment of a new class of experimental scientists ... what sociologists of science like Blumenberg call an epistemocracy."&lt;ref&gt;José María Rodrígez García. "Scientia Potestas Est – Knowledge is Power: Francis Bacon to Michel Foucault"[http://www.akademiai.com/content/u495611628627323/] Neohelicon Volume 28, Number 1 / January, 2001. Akadémiai Kiadó.&lt;/ref&gt; Again this is more or less opposite to Taleb's use. However it would be unfair to say that any of these have exactly caught on either. It remains a word used in an ad hoc manner.

'''Fabrice Hadjadj''' (born 1971) is a [[France|French writer]] and philosopher.

Hadjadj was born in [[Nanterre]] to [[Jews|Jewish]] parents of [[Tunisia]]n heritage. In his teens he was an [[atheist]] and [[anarchist]], and he maintained a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude for most of his twenties until, in 1998, he converted to [[Catholicism]]. His book ''Réussir sa mort: Anti-méthode pour vivre'', won the [[Grand prix catholique de littérature]] in 2006. Currently Hadjadj teaches philosophy and literature in [[Toulon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4341">'''Feed The Deed''', also known as '''#FeedtheDeed''', is a social media [[Pay it forward|pay-it-forward]] initiative that started in February 2014. Participants film themselves performing a creative [[random act of kindness]], then nominate friends and family to continue on the chain. The participant usually uploads a video or pictures of the kind act to [[Facebook]], then will tag four or five friends in the post. The nominated person is generally told to complete the task within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/06/online-drinking-game-sparks-kindness-challenge |title=Online drinking game sparks kindness challenge &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this initiative was started, over 10,000 #FeedtheDeed posts have been uploaded to various forms of social media.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Megan Griffo |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/05/feed-the-deed_n_4898943.html |title=5 Priceless Ways These People Made Someone Else's Day Just A Little Bit Brighter |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is most popular in Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Mexico, but has since spread to over 30 countries.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; The act of kindness can be anything – from donating food and clothes to the homeless, to giving blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Feed+Deed+fuels+positivity+Canadian+university+campuses/9527086/story.html |title=Feed the Deed fuels positivity on Canadian university campuses |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Feed The Deed originated as a response to the [[Neknominate]] drinking game, in which participants film themselves drinking alcohol then nominate friends to do the same.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt;

Josh Stern, a medical student at the [[University of Ottawa]], posted his original #FeedtheDeed video to his Facebook page. He was then contacted by his friend Russell Citron, who is president and founder of the non-profit organization [[Kindness Counts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/heebonics/spread-kindness-not-drunken-recklessness |title=Spread kindness, not drunken recklessness &amp;#124; The Canadian Jewish News |publisher=Cjnews.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two decided to collaborate on the project by taking Stern's #FeedtheDeed moniker and running it through Citron's organization Kindness Counts.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt;

Stern says that the inspiration for #FeedtheDeed came from a [[YouTube]] video in which Brent Lindeque decided to use his neknomination to give food to a homeless man instead of drinking alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritanmag.com/features/alcohol-fuelled-neknominations-replaced-feed-deed-kindness |title=Alcohol-Fuelled Neknominations Replaced by Feed The Deed Kindness &amp;#124; Samaritanmag.com - The Anti-Tabloid |publisher=Samaritanmag.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindeque is currently running a similar campaign in [[South Africa]] called #ChangeOneThing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsu.ca/interrobang_article.php?storyID=10413&amp;sectionID=1&amp;issueID=251 |title=Fanshawe Student Union &gt; Interrobang |publisher=Fsu.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Conflict of laws}}
'''''Forum non conveniens''''' ([[Latin]] for "forum not agreeing") ('''FNC''') is a (mostly) [[common law]] [[legal doctrine]] whereby courts may refuse to take jurisdiction over matters where there is a more appropriate forum available to the parties. As a doctrine of the [[conflict of laws]], ''forum non conveniens'' applies between courts in different countries and between courts in different [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s in the same country. ''Forum non conveniens'' is not applicable between counties or federal districts within a state.

A concern often raised in applications of the doctrine is [[forum shopping]], or picking a court merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. This concern is balanced against the public policy of deferring to a plaintiff's choice of venue in claims where there may be more than one appropriate jurisdiction. The underlying principles, such as basing respect given to foreign courts on reciprocal respect or [[comity]], also apply in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems in the form of the legal doctrine of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]''.

''Forum non conveniens'' is not exclusive to common law nations: the maritime courts of the [[Republic of Panama]], although not a common law jurisdiction, also have such power under more restrained conditions.&lt;ref&gt;ARRUE MONTENEGRO, Carlos Alberto. ''Le forum non conveniens à l'assaut des compétences exorbitantes : l'expérience panaméenne'', [[Panthéon-Assas University]],  2006, p. 85. (http://catalogue.ppl.nl/DB=1/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
A [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]] enacts laws which are interpreted and applied through a system of courts. The laws applied by a particular system of courts or legal system are termed the ''[[lex fori]]'', or law of the forum. As a matter of [[civil procedure]], courts must decide whether and in what circumstances they will accept [[jurisdiction]] over [[party (law)|parties]] and subject matter when a [[lawsuit]] begins. This decision will be routine, or not raised at all, if the relevant elements of the case are within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. If one or more of the parties resides outside the territorial [[jurisdiction]] or there are other factors which might make another forum more appropriate, the question of jurisdiction must be settled.

===Historical origin===
Scholars and jurists seem to find a Scottish origin prior to the first American use of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mssc.state.ms.us/decisions/Publishedopinions/96-01284.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicium.it/news/pistis01.html#_edn1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://works.bepress.com/context/graydon_staring/article/1008/type/native/viewcontent/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/us/454/235/case.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some writers see the doctrine of FNC as having developed from an earlier doctrine of ''forum non competens'' ("non-competent forum"). Many early cases in the U.S. and Scotland involving FNC were cases under [[admiralty law]]. FNC thus may ultimately have a [[civilian law|civil law]] origin, as has been asserted by several writers, since admiralty law is based in civil law concepts.

The doctrine of FNC originated in the [[United States]] in ''Willendson v. Forsoket'' [29 Fed Cas 1283 (DC Pa 1801)] (No 17,682) where a federal district court in [[Pennsylvania]] declined to exercise jurisdiction over a [[Denmark|Danish]] sea captain who was being sued for back wages by a Danish seaman, stating that "[i]f any differences should hereafter arise, it must be settled by a Danish tribunal." In [[Scotland]], the concept is first recorded in ''MacMaster v. MacMaster'' (Judgment of 7 June 1833, Sess, Scot 11 Sess Cas, First Series 685.)

===United Kingdom===
The doctrine has limited application in most civil law jurisdictions which prefer ''[[lis alibi pendens]]'', although the principle behind FNC is acknowledged. As a member of the [[European Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] signed the [[Brussels Convention]]. The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1982) as amended by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1991) states:
{{quote|Nothing in this Act shall prevent any court in the UK from staying, sisting [staying or stopping a process, or summoning a party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/library/publications/docs/glossary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209114651/http://scotcourts.gov.uk/library/publications/docs/glossary.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;], striking out or dismissing any proceedings before it on the ground of ''forum non conveniens'' or otherwise, where to do so is not inconsistent with the 1968 [Brussels] Convention or, as the case may be, the Lugano Convention.}}

The case of ''Owusu v Jackson and Others''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/2005/C28102.html&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[European Court of Justice]], was concerned with the relationship between Article 2 of the Brussels Convention and the scope of FNC within the [[European Community]]. In ''Owusu'', the English [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] asked the ECJ whether it could stay a matter brought to it under Article 2 Brussels Convention pursuant to the English FNC rules. The Court held that the Brussels Convention was a mandatory set of rules designed to harmonise and so produce a predictable system throughout the EU. If states were able to derogate from the Convention using their domestic rules of civil procedure, this would deny a uniform result to proceedings based on forum selection. Hence, at 46. the ECJ held:
{{quote|the Brussels Convention precludes a court of a Contracting State from declining the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 2 of that convention on the ground that a court of a non-Contracting State would be a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action even if the jurisdiction of no other Contracting State is in issue or the proceedings have no connecting factors to any other Contracting State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waltonsandmorse.com/Decisions2.jsp?decisionsID=9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, some UK commentators argue that the FNC rules may still apply to cases where the other proceedings are not in a Member state but this remains uncertain. What is certain is that a Scottish Court may sist its proceedings in favour of the Courts of England or Northern Ireland on the ground of FNC, since this is settling intra-UK jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Cumming v Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd, The Times June 8, 1995; Collins: 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In the jurisdictions where the FNC rule survives, a court will usually dismiss a case when the judge determines that the dispute would be better adjudicated in a different forum. Courts have been split in their applications of the rule. In ''Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co v Fay'' (1988) 165 CLR 197 and ''Voth v Manildra Flour Mills'' (1990) 171 CLR 538 the [[High Court of Australia]] refused to adopt the "most suitable forum" approach and instead devised its own "clearly inappropriate forum" test. Nevertheless, the Australian courts balanced the foreign and local factors, and a dismissal would only be granted if the defendant could show that he was "oppressed" or "harassed" by the plaintiff's choice of Australia for legal action. This retained the rationale of the traditional doctrine, making it impossible for Australian defendants to obtain a dismissal from their own courts on FNC grounds. In ''Regie National des Usines Renault SA v Zhang'' (2002) 210 CLR 491, the High Court affirmed the "clearly inappropriate forum" test as Australian law, while stating that even where the law of a foreign country had to be applied to decide a case, Australia would not be a "clearly inappropriate" forum for hearing the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lindell: 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
However, with the advent of the Civil Procedure Act (2005), this common law position in Australia has changed.

===Canada===
The doctrine of FNC in Canada was considered in ''Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia Worker's Compensation Board'', [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897. The Court held that the test for striking out a claim for FNC is where "there is another forum that is clearly more appropriate than the domestic forum." If the forums are both found to be equally convenient, the domestic forum will always win out.

Convenience is weighed, using a multi-factored test that includes elements such as: the connection between the plaintiff's claim and the forum, the connection between the defendant and the forum, unfairness to the defendant by choosing the forum, unfairness to the plaintiff in not choosing the forum, involvement of other parties to the suit (i.e. location of witnesses), and issues of [[comity]] such as reciprocity and standard of adjudication.

The Supreme Court has underlined that FNC inquiries are similar to but distinct from the [[Real and substantial connection|Real and Substantial connection"]] test used in challenges to jurisdiction. The most important difference is that applying FNC is a discretionary choice between two forums, each of which could legally hear the issue.

The law of the province of Quebec, Canada is slightly different. The Quebec Civil Code 1994, at art. 3135 c.c.q., provides:
{{quote|Even though a Quebec authority has jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may exceptionally and on an application by a party, decline jurisdiction if it considers that the authorities of another country are in a better position to decide.}}

The practical effects are identical to any other jurisdiction but the wording used by the code is different. For decisions applying art. 3135 c.c.q., see ''H.L. Boulton &amp; Co. S.C.C.A. v. Banque Royale du Canada'' (1995) R.J.Q. 213 (Quebec. Supr. Ct.); ''Lamborghini (Canada) Inc. v. Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A.'' (1997) R.J.Q. 58 (Quebec. C.A.); ''Spar Aerospace v. American Mobile Satellite'' (2002) 4 S.C.R. 205, and ''Grecon Dimter Inc. v. J.R. Normand Inc.'' (2004) R.J.Q. 88 (Quebec. C.A.)

===United States===
The defendant may move to dismiss an action on the ground of FNC. Invoking this doctrine usually means that the plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court, but it is inconvenient for the court and the defendant to have a trial in the original jurisdiction. The court must balance convenience against the plaintiff’s choice of forum. In other words, if the plaintiff’s choice of forum was reasonable, the defendant must show a compelling reason to change jurisdiction. If a transfer would simply shift the inconvenience from one party to the other, the plaintiff’s choice of forum should not be disturbed.

Generally, a corporation sued in the jurisdiction of its headquarters is not entitled to seek an FNC dismissal. Thus if an [[United States|American]] corporation is sued in an area where it only transacts business but not where it has its headquarters, and the court dismisses based upon FNC, the plaintiff may refile the action in the jurisdiction of the corporation’s headquarters.

In deciding whether to grant the motion, the court considers:
* The location of potential [[witnesses]]. The defendant must make a full and candid showing, naming the potential witnesses for the defense, specifying their location, specifying what their testimony may be and how crucial it is for the defense, and setting forth how exactly they may be inconvenienced by having to testify in the court chosen by plaintiff.
* The location of [[relevance (law)|relevant]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and records. The defendant must identify the records; explain who is in charge of the records; address necessity, language, and translation problems; address the volume of such records; address the law governing these records; and rule out the existence of duplicate records in the jurisdiction chosen by the plaintiff. The mere fact that records need to be translated is not sufficient grounds to invoke FNC.
* Possible [[undue hardship]] for the [[defendant]]. The defendant must explain what the hardship is and how material the costs are. If there are costs involved, they need to be spelled out. If there is a difficulty in getting witnesses out of a foreign court and into the original court, this needs to be revealed to the court. The defendant must explain why the use of [[letters rogatory]] or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case. The standard that the defendant must meet is “overwhelming hardship” if they are required to litigate in the forum’s State.
* Availability of adequate alternative forums for the plaintiff. Merely pointing out that the plaintiff could have sued somewhere else is not sufficient to succeed on an FNC motion.
* The expeditious use of [[judicial]] resources. In practice, this is just boilerplate language that comes along with the application. However, sometimes the court chosen by the plaintiff may be logistically or administratively unfit or ill‐equipped for the case; for example, a case may involve a large number of torts.
* The [[choice of law]] applicable to the dispute. If all other factors weigh in favor of keeping the case in the jurisdiction where it was filed, then the court may choose between application of local law (''lex fori'') or relevant foreign law. Thus, the mere fact that foreign law may apply to the event, circumstances, accident, or occurrence is not a strong reason to dismiss the case on FNC grounds.
* Questions of [[public policy (law)|public policy]]. In analyzing the factors, the subject matter of the complaint may touch on a sensitive issue that is important to the laws of either the original jurisdiction or the alternative forum. Those public policy issues must be pinpointed, analyzed and briefed in a way that makes it clear why this issue overrides the other factors. For example, an employee suing a foreign corporation in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers. See the [[Federal Employers Liability Act]] (FELA) for further reference.

Additional factors include:
* The location where the cause of action arose. In most states, defendant must usually show that the cause of action arose outside of the jurisdiction.
* The identities of the parties. Who is suing whom? Is the plaintiff suing an individual defendant or a small company without financial means as a method to oppress the defendant with financial and legal costs by litigating in a remote court? Is the defendant a conglomerate making the FNC application simply to force the plaintiff to bear expensive costs of travel and retainer of foreign lawyers? A plaintiff who is a resident in the state where action was filed is normally entitled to have his case heard in his home state.
* Vexatious motive. Where there is no evidence that the plaintiff had improper intent in bringing the case specifically in a particular forum, courts usually deny the FNC motion.
* Jurisprudential development and political conditions at the foreign forum. Is the court going to send the plaintiff to a land where the law is underdeveloped, uncivilized, or where there is no ''[[equal protection]]'' or ''[[due process]]''?  Is the court going to send the plaintiff to another court in a country where violence is rampant or in the middle of a war? A suit will not be dismissed if the foreign court does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the complaint, no live testimony of the plaintiff is required by appearance, or if the foreign law is otherwise deficient in its protocols or procedures.

The determination of the court may not be arbitrary or abusive as this is a drastic remedy to be applied with caution and restraint.

As for the transfer of a trial to a jurisdiction outside of the U.S., courts will only grant the transfer if a foreign court is “more appropriate”, and there may be a real opportunity to obtain justice there.

&lt;!-- The following section needs a rewrite for readability. I can’t even tell how some of the sentences are relevant or what cases that they apply to. --&gt;
In New York, for example, there is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff’s choice of forum. See Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947); R. Maganlal &amp; Co., 942 F.2d 164, 167 (2nd Cir. 1991); Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F.3d 88, 101 (2d Cir. 2000); and Maran Coal Corp. V. Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., No. 92 CIV 8728, 1993 US.Dist. LEXIS 12160 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. September 2, 1993). A defendant must show compelling evidence in order to disturb the choice of forum. The burden of proof is on the defendant: Strategic Value Master Fund, Ltd. v. Cargill Fin. Serv. Corp., 421 F.2d 741, 754 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). The court must also consider the defendant’s vast resources compared with the plaintiff’s limited resources as an aggrieved individual: See Wiwa at 107: “defendants have not demonstrated that these costs [of shipping documents and witnesses] are excessively burdensome, especially in view of defendant’s vast resources”. Also, Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) at 341: “A countervailing factor is the relative means of the parties”.
&lt;!-- This is the end of the section previously commented upon. --&gt;

In 2006, the 2nd Circuit Federal Court in New York issued a decision in the famous Coca-Cola case. Coca-Cola took over assets of Jews expelled from Egypt in the 1950s and was sued in New York. Bigio v. Coca-Cola Company, 448 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2006), ''certiorari'' to Sup. Ct. denied. In that case, the plaintiffs were Canadians and non‐residents of New York. The court denied Coca-Cola’s FNC motion and the U.S. Supreme Court denied ''certiorari''. The 2nd Circuit stated that the fact that the New York court would need to apply “modest application” of Egyptian law was not a problem because “courts of this Circuit are regularly called upon to interpret foreign law without thereby offending the principles of international comity”. Also, the fact that there were witnesses abroad was not a problem either. They could be flown into the U.S. or Letters Rogatory could be issued to the Egyptian courts to collect their testimony. Further, it was held that in an FNC scenario, a court applies the balance of conveniences, but preference (and weight) must be given to the fact that plaintiffs chose this particular forum for “legitimate reasons”. The fact that plaintiffs could sue in Canada was not relevant because Coca-Cola was a U.S. company and it was “perfectly reasonable to sue in the US”.

==Europe==
The doctrine of FNC gained little footing in the civil law world, which prefers the approach of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]'' (see Articles 21-23 Brussels Convention). The civil law jurisdictions generally base jurisdiction on the residence of the defendant and on [[choice of law]] rules favouring the [[habitual residence]] of the parties, the ''[[lex situs]]'', and the ''[[lex loci solutionis]]'' (applying ''actor sequitur forum rei''). This reflects an expectation that a defendant should be sued at his "own" courts, modified to reflect different priorities in certain types of case. As an example of this expectation, Article 2 [[Brussels I Regulation]] (as well as the corresponding Lugano conventions) provides:

Subject to the provisions of this Convention, persons domiciled in a Contracting State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that State.

Persons who are not nationals of the State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the rules of jurisdiction applicable to nationals of that State.
}}

But this is subject to the substantial exceptions contained in Articles 3–6, the limitations on insurance actions in Articles 7–12, and consumer contracts in Articles 13–15. Article 16 also grants [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to specified jurisdictions as the ''lex situs'' of immovable property and a ''res'', and for the status of companies, the validity of public registers with particular reference to the registration and validity of patents, and the enforcement of judgments. Subsequent articles allow [[forum selection clause]]s and other forms of agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a given forum. The Brussels Regime therefore represents a harmonised set of rules for the determination of all questions of jurisdiction throughout the EU and [[EFTA]] (but not Liechtenstein) excluding FNC.

==Shipping==
The issue of FNC arises in shipping cases since different parties may be involved as charterers or [[consignee]]s and because of the international nature of the [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[Maritime law|maritime]] trade. Despite several different [[Treaty|convention]]s dealing with aspects of international trade, jurisdictional disputes are common. Moreover, in some instances, a case in the [[United States]] may be initiated under U.S. state law when [[Admiralty law#United States|Admiralty law]] (which is a Federal jurisdiction) would be the more appropriate forum. If this occurs, the case may be removed to the Federal Courts or to the courts of another state on FNC grounds.

For example, suppose that a container ship comes into port in [[Miami, Florida]], United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in [[Denmark]]. Made aware of the ship's presence, a local [[lawyer]] moves to impose a [[lien]] which involves a form of arrest by means of ''[[trial de novo|de novo]]'' proceedings ''in rem''. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an [[agent (law)|agent]] to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are [[England|English]]). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court is not in a good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in [[demurrage]] to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of [[enforcement of foreign judgments|enforcement]], the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the ''forum conveniens'' because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">'''Gavrilo "Gajo" Petrović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Гаврило Гајо Петровић}}; [[Karlovac]], 12 March 1927 – [[Zagreb]], 13 June 1993) was one of the main theorists in the [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]] [[Praxis School]] in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. He was the only one among the editors of the ''Praxis'' journal to stay in this position throughout the journal's publication. He is credited by [[Milan Kangrga]] to be the mastermind behind the [[Praxis School#Korčula Summer School|Korčula Summer School]], which was a meeting place for Marxists and other philosophers from the East and the West in the 1960s and 1970s.  

==Biography==
Petrović was born in [[Karlovac]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. He has started learning philosophy at the Zagreb University. From 1946 to 1948 he was in the [[Soviet Union]] as an exchange student, where he recognized the repression of philosophical thought under [[Joseph Stalin]]. After that, he came back to Yugoslavia, completing his studies and earned his PhD at the [[Zagreb]] University in 1956 with a dissertation concerning the philosophical views of [[Georgi Plekhanov]]. Upon graduating, from 1950 he taught [[logic]] and theory of philosophy at this university until his retirement. He presided over the Croat Philosophical Society from 1963 to 1964. In 1964 he was elected for president of the Yugoslav Philosophical Society.

Petrović was one of the leaders of the Yugoslav criticism of the [[Stalinist]] philosophical theses since the early 1950s. In the early 1960s, his philosophical views evolved towards an interpretation of [[Marxism]] based on the philosophical works of the young [[Karl Marx]]. This was in line with the creative line of thought of a [[Workers' self-management|self-management socialism]] which dominated the Yugoslav political landscape at the time. However, his continuous radical criticism of the dogmatic ideology of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] led to an open conflict. In 1968 Petrović openly supported the student protests, which was a pretext for his expulsion from the Party at June 8 meeting of the Zagreb University Party Committee.

Petrović's ''Selected Works'' in four volumes were published in 1986. In 2001, a collection of articles in his honour were published in Zagreb, entitled ''The Reality and the Criticism''.

==Philosophical views==

Petrović has opposed the interpretation of the Marx’s philosophical views as [[dialectical materialism]] and has insisted that the Marx’s philosophy was thought of the revolution which is contemplating the possibility of revolutionary change of the existing inhuman world.

Born in [[Aix-les-Bains]], [[Savoie]], in 1952, he was elected by the general assembly of the [[Central Consistory]] chief rabbi of France on 22 June 2008, for a seven-year mandate starting from 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=20085 France gets new chief rabbi], ''[[Yeshiva World News]]'', June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, he had been rabbi of [[Grand Synagogue of Paris|synagogue de la Victoire]], the main synagogue in [[Paris]], since 1 May 1997. The Chief Rabbi of France was respected as a scholar not only in the Jewish community but in the wider academic world.&lt;ref name="TheTimes-3915707"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article3735205.ece |title=Chief Rabbi Gilles Bernheim ‘set to quit’ over plagiarism |work=[[The Times]] |date=April 10, 2013 |publisher=[[News Intl]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0140-0460 |accessdate= 3 February 2014 |subscription=yes |first=Adam |last=Sage |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140203131106/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article3735205.ece |archivedate=February 3, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resigned as chief rabbi in April 2013 before his term had ended, amid revelations of plagiarism and deception about his academic credentials.

He succeeded chief rabbi [[Joseph Sitruk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/995759.html |title=Gilles Bernheim, 56, elected France's new grand rabbi |author=Anshel Pfeffer |accessdate=November 16, 2008 |editor=Haaretz |date=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724165811/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/995759.html |archivedate=July 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was very critical of the lifting of the excommunication of bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/01/31/les-propos-de-mgr-williamson-sont-abjects_1149025_3224.html Le Monde article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Government appointed him Knight [Chevalier] in the [[Légion d'honneur]], on 10 April 2009.

==Career as chief rabbi==
In October 2012, he took a clear position against gay marriage in a plagiarized essay entitled "''Mariage homosexuel, homoparentalité et adoption : ce que l’on oublie souvent de dire''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandrabbindefrance.com/mariage-homosexuel-homoparentalit%C3%A9-et-adoption-ce-que-l%E2%80%99-oublie-souvent-de-dire-essai-de-gilles-bern |title=Mariage homosexuel, homoparentalité et adoption : ce que l’on oublie souvent de dire. Essai de Gilles Bernheim, Grand Rabbin de France |author=Gilles Bernheim |accessdate=22 October 2012 |work=le site du grand-rabbin de France |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021034657/http://www.grandrabbindefrance.com/mariage-homosexuel-homoparentalit%C3%A9-et-adoption-ce-que-l%E2%80%99-oublie-souvent-de-dire-essai-de-gilles-bern |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately equivalent to ''"Gay marriage, gay parenting and adoption: What we frequently forget to mention"'' in English) &lt;blockquote&gt;
 « The problem in the proposed legislation, the harm it would cause to our entire society for the sole benefit of a tiny minority, once they have irreversibly blurred three things:
* the genealogical substituents of parenthood in paternity and maternity,
* the status of the child, shifts to being subject to that of an object to which anyone is entitled,
* identities where naturally given sexual differentiation would be forced to give way to the orientation expressed by each in the name of countering inequality, twisted into the eradication of differences. »  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This essay found a strong echo in [[Roman Catholic]] circles, culminating in [[Pope Benedict XVI]] quoting him at length in his annual address&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2012/12/21/97001-20121221FILWWW00363-benoit-xvi-dans-la-lutte-pour-la-famille-l-homme-est-en-jeu.php|title=Benoît XVI: "Dans la lutte pour la famille, l'Homme est en jeu"|work=Le Figaro|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20121221_auguri-curia_en.html|title= ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI ON THE OCCASION OF CHRISTMAS GREETINGS TO THE ROMAN CURIA|work=Clementine Hall, Vatican City|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
to the [[Roman Curia]], 21 December 2012 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"The Chief Rabbi of France, Gilles Bernheim, has shown in a very detailed and profoundly moving study that the attack we are currently experiencing on the true structure of the family, made up of father, mother, and child, goes much deeper."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

==Personal==
Bernheim's father was a wood seller and died when Bernheim was 14. His mother, Berthe (Blime), née Klein, is a former pupil of [[Antoinette Feuerwerker]] and was a teacher of mathematics. His wife is a [[psychoanalyst]], and he is the father of four children.

Gilles Bernheim was a student of {{Interlanguage link multi|Séminaire israélite de France|fr}} in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''[[Who’s Who in France]]'' : Dictionnaire biographique de personnalités françaises vivant en France et à l’étranger, et de personnalités étrangères résidant en France, 44th edition for 2013 printed in 2012, 2371 p., 31 cm, {{ISBN|978-2-85784-053-4}}"'''Bernheim''', '''Gilles''', Uriel",  page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism and qualification scandal==
The affair started in early March when the Strass de la Philosophie blog revealed that a passage on hasidic exegesis from Bernheim’s work was almost identical to an interview of the philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard that appears in the 1996 book "Questioning Judaism" by Elisabeth Weber.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/france-s-chief-rabbi-apologizes-for-plagiarism-1.513288 France's chief rabbi apologizes for plagiarism], ''Haaretz'', April 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernheim acknowledged that his 2011 book "40 Jewish Meditations" contained one passage that his ghostwriter plagiarized without Bernheim’s knowledge.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-5249481"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/04/04/la-communaute-juive-est-atterree-par-les-plagiats-du-grand-rabbin-de-france_3153834_3224.html|title= La communauté juive est atterrée par les plagiats du grand rabbin de France}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I have been fooled," he wrote. "However, I am responsible. I apologize to the authors whose texts have been copied, to the people who have read these 'meditations' and to my publisher who was not informed of the existence of an outsider."&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;
It was also revealed that he did not actually qualify for the prestigious title of "''[[agrégé]]'' of philosophy" that had often been attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/france-s-chief-rabbi-resigns-admits-to-deception-local-media-reports-1.514955 (By [[Haaretz]], 11 April 2013 at 3:47 PM). Retrieved 13 April 1013.&lt;/ref&gt; The agrégé title required passing a rigorous examination that was necessary for becoming a professor of philosophy. While he may not have directly claimed to hold that qualification, he had allowed others to refer to him using the title without clarifying his actual status.

Le Figaro reported that "there was heavy pressure" on the part of unnamed officials from the Jewish community for Bernheim to resign.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-5249481"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/one-day-after-refusing-to-do-so-french-chief-rabbi-resigns/ |title=French chief rabbi quits amid plagiarism, qualification scandals |work=timesofisrael.com |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2014 |author=JTA |author2=Gavriel Fiske |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211914/http://www.timesofisrael.com/one-day-after-refusing-to-do-so-french-chief-rabbi-resigns/ |archivedate=8 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 2013 he resigned as chief rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22111313 France's top rabbi Gilles Bernheim quits in plagiarism row] at [[BBC Online]]; published 11 April 2013; retrieved 11 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gonocyte''' is a term created in 1957 by scientists Yves Clermont and Bernard Perey. Gonocytes relate to both fetal and neonatal germ cells from the point at which they enter the testis primordia until they reach the base membrane at the seminiferous cords and differentiate. It is responsible for [[gametogenesis]], which is [[spermatogenesis]] in males and [[oogenesis]] in females. Gonocytes include gametogonia (spermatogonia and oogonia), oocytes, ootids, and ova. The overall structures of fetal and postnatal gonocytes are described as large and spherical, with a prominent nucleus and two nucleoli.

He was the author of a vast collection of commentaries on sutra and tantra whose work was influential throughout Tibetan Buddhism. He established one of the definitive Tibetan understandings of the [[Prasaṅgika]] model of the [[Madhyamaka]] school of philosophy. He was the student of [[Rongtön]]  (Rongtön Shéja Künrik, {{bo|w=rong ston shes bya kun rig}}).&lt;ref name="Dreyfus301" /&gt; He founded the Thuptén Namgyél Monastery in Tanag ({{bo|w=rta nag thub bstan rnam rgyal gling}}), which is just north of [[Shigatse]].
[[File:Gorampa_Sonam_Sengge.jpg|thumb]]
==Philosophic views==
One of his most important and popular works is ''Distinguishing the Views'' ({{bo|t=ལྟ་བའི་ཤན་འབྱེད|w=lta ba'i shan 'byed}}), in which he argues for his view of [[Madhyamaka]]. He and other Sakya teachers classify themselves as presenting the "Freedom from Proliferation" ({{bo|w=spros bral|t=སྤྲོས་བྲལ་}}) Madhyamaka.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus302"&gt;Dreyfus (2003) p.302&lt;/ref&gt;

A critic of both [[Dolpopa]] and [[Je Tsongkhapa]], he joined into the polarized [[Prasangika]] and [[Svatantrika]] debate at that time, but he attempted an allegedly 'moderate' position between the 'extremes' he saw in their opposing views. Dolpopa disregarded the distinction between Prasangika and Svatantrika and considered them a later elaboration that damages the non-conceptual view of the ultimate. Gorampa sides more closely with Tsongkhapa that a distinction is reasonable to make and he also critiques the traditional Svatantrika approach. However, he disagreed with Tsongkhapa's "[[Eight Difficult Points]]" and instead posited his own sixteen points of distinction between the two views. 

Of particular note in his characterization, he does not agree with Tsonghkapa that the Prasangika and Svatantrika methods produce different results nor that the Prasangika is a "higher" view. He does also critique the Svatantrika approach as having too much reliance on logic, because in his view the component parts of syllogistic logic are not applicable in the realm of the ultimate. But this critique is constrained to the methodology, and he believed both approaches reach the same ultimate realization.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus302-306"&gt;Dreyfus (2003) pp.302-306&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he shared some strong doubts about [[Je Tsongkhapa]]. Gorampa insinuated that Tsongkhapa's conversations with [[Manjusri]] were actually with a demon:{{refn|group=note|José Cabezón: "Even as serious a scholar as Go rams pa cannot resist suggesting, for example, that Tsong kha pa's supposed conversations with Manjusri may have been a dialogue with a demon instead."&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José. ''Freedom from Extremes''. Wisdom Publications 2007, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|"Gorampa, in the ''Lta ba ngan sel (Eliminating the Erroneous View)'', accuses Tsongkhapa of being "seized by demons" (''bdud kyis zin pa'') and in ''the Lta ba'i shan 'byed (Distinguishing Views)'' decries him as a "nihilistic Madhyamika" (''dbu ma chad lta ba'') who is spreading "demonic words" (''bdud kyi tshig'')."&lt;ref&gt;Thakchoe, Sonam.

[[File:Hans Blüher 1888-1955.jpg|thumb|Hans Blüher]]
'''Hans Blüher''' (17 February 1888 in [[Freiburg in Schlesien]] - 4 February 1955 in [[Berlin]]) was a [[Germany|German]] writer and philosopher. He attained prominence as an early member and "first historian" of the [[Wandervogel]] movement. He was aided by his taboo breaking rebellion against schools and the Church. He was received with some genuine interest but sometimes perceived as scandalous.

His comments on the homosexual aspects of the Wandervogel movement and the role [[homoeroticism]] and [[male bonding]] played in the creation of European culture and institutions were fiercely combated. Blüher supported these with a theory of the [[Männerbund]].

During the transition from the [[German Empire]] to the [[Weimar]] liberal democracy, Blüher, a radical conservative and monarchist, became a staunch opponent of the Weimar Republic. In 1928, he had the opportunity to meet the former [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], in exile in the [[Netherlands]]. Blüher believed that [[pederasty]] and male bonding provided a basis for a stronger nation and state, which became a popular concept within certain segments of the [[Hitler Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Thorstad]], Speech to the ''Semana Cultural Lesbica-Gay,'' Mexico City, June 26, 1998. (hosted at [[NAMBLA]]'s website [https://www.webcitation.org/6A1tpiOsT here]). Archived 2012-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Blüher later supported the Nazis but turned on them in 1934, when [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] leader [[Ernst Röhm]] was murdered on Hitler's orders during the [[Night of the Long Knives]].

Since 1924, Blüher, who had married a doctor and had two children, had worked as a freelance writer and  practicing psychologist in Berlin-Hermsdorf. He worked there, after his retirement from public life during the Nazi period, on his major philosophical work of 1949, ''Die Achse der Natur''.

== Student at Gymnasium Steglitz ==

In 1896 Blüher's father, the pharmacist Hermann Blüher, his wife Helene and their eight-year-old son Hans, left Freiburg and took up residence first in Halle and then, in 1898, in [[Steglitz]] where the ten-year-old Hans was sent to the local Gymnasium. In his 1912 account Blüher wrote:

"The intellectual pleasures are the purest and the most perfect. They persist throughout life undiminished and constantly trigger new feelings of happiness. One should expect that an institution such as a school, which deals only with intellectual subjects, and at the youngest age of life, would almost have to generate a rapture of discovery and understanding: - And it produces just the opposite! The student works not only with occasional overexertion and difficulty, which is naturally unavoidable in even the most liberal of intellectual endeavors, but with an immense feeling of displeasure. And this is expected at an age which, on account of its tenderness and need for joy, is least of all appropriate. On these young shoulders, in fact, lies a burden which the man only thinks back on in horror and yet it is perpetually alive in his dreams. [...]

The "science" learned in schools and the whole conception of culture which is represented there is indeed not free at all but entirely imposed. It is in service to all kinds of ideals and possible prejudices; patriotism and religion necessitate, in order to find solid ground in the student's heart, a quite considerable staining and falsification of reality. [...] Whence shall the intellectual joy come if the instrument is out of tune with the student who could well play upon it...?"&lt;ref&gt;Hans Blüher: ''Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Zweiter Teil: Blüte und Niedergang.'' Zweite Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1912, S.&amp;nbsp;152&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later Blüher's criticism was, in part, much milder and more grateful. School director, Robert  Lück, who Blüher had described as one of the somewhat narrow-minded Christian educators, underwent a revaluation in Blüher's second version of his autobiographical work "Werke und Tage." Blüher praised Lück's life work and described his selection of faculty as masterful: "How he actually managed it remains a mystery to everyone. He had an obvious charisma. The college nearly resembled an order."&lt;ref&gt;Hans Blüher: ''Werke und Tage (Geschichte eines Denkers). Autobiographie.'' München 1953, S.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt;
In his autobiography, Blüher set his former school among the ranks of those gymnasiums to which he accorded a prominent role in German cultural life. Nowhere else in Germany was the soil for the dispute between humanistic education and the romantic counter-culture so fruitful; the Wandervogel and the [[German Youth Movement|youth movement]] could only have occurred here.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Blüher: ''Werke und Tage (Geschichte eines Denkers). Autobiographie''. München 1953, S.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wandervogel Movement ==

Hans Blüher was admitted to the Wandervogel in 1902 as a 33rd degree member. His initiation was a ceremonial procedure wherein Karl Fischer deterred "foxes" for each of the newcomers. After instruction of the goals and premises of the Wandervogel movement, the aspirant swore loyalty to Fischer and to obey when necessary. He promised this in the presence of at least two other witnesses who attested to the oath then Fischer wrote his name into the members' book.

Hans Blüher understood this community as a protest movement against the "weathered ideals" of the "old generation" which one should vigorously resist with his own views and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Blüher: ''Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Zweiter Teil: Blüte und Niedergang.'' Zweite Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1912, S.&amp;nbsp;189/191&lt;/ref&gt; Blüher had a strictly dismissive attitude of the pedagogical tendencies and leisurely hiking of the group. For example, provisions that set early rest stops out of consideration for the younger participants were to him proof of "an insufficient understanding of the great experience of horror that the forest and the night also produced in the minds of the older members." There is a weak disregard for the young personality in "breaking the power of such precious hours." Blüher even thought little of recommendations to call off hikes due to persistent rain so as to not negatively affect the clothes and mood of the hikers: "That is exactly what is recommended for the faint of heart who from the very outset admit that they do not have the ability to drown out the inclement weather with the exuberance of their youthfulness. Those who know the old Wandervogel bacchanalia and are no degenerates, also know the unforgettable glory of such rainy weather marches."

Even in his 60s, Blüher spoke praisingly of those regions of Mark Brandenburg in which the Steglitzer Wandervogel found their weekend adventures in nature. This comparatively inconspicuous landscape wanted to be discovered "with the full fervor and suppleness of our hearts: this landscape had to be conquered, its divine word had come to us, otherwise us youth would have perished in the foul breath of the culture of our fathers. [...]The [[Nuthe]]thal, upon which the first fire of our youth movement blazed, had imbued us with the historical force that had been in it for centuries and we partook of it. We came down from its hills and were a state."

These unusual formations of young people created a peculiar contrast to the rest of the citizenry of Steglitz when they returned home after an extensive hike:

{{Zitat|“Now everything had come to life in Steglitz. The tidy boys of the well-nourished citizens walked along Albrecht Street in new suits, little girls following behind. The Fichteberg aristocracy and the half-nobility had the Church behind them and they paraded home with glazed, God-fearing eyes. When their sons wore their colorful school caps they always only took hold of the visor with two fingers, because the other three had to hold their dapper pair of gloves. They saluted and gave honors. - And among these wild, merry figures, there was this colorful hodgepodge of students! They walked with their bulky boots on the delicate plaster; one of them stayed behind because Wolf had thrown him down the sandy hillside of Havelberg and his pants were split. [...] "That crazy Fischer!" they simply said and moved on.|ref=&lt;ref&gt;Hans Blüher: ''Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Erster Teil: Heimat und Aufgang.'' Dritte Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1913, S.&amp;nbsp;54&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hans Blüher, whose strikingly gaunt appearance earned him the nickname "Ghost," developed into one of Fischer's most loyal supporters but he also had Fischer's crucial support during his time with the Wandervogel movement.

During a summer trip to the Rhine in 1903, Blüher was sent home by expedition leader Siegfried Copalle for lacking identification, which did not meet with Fischer's approval. As a result, he defended him.
 
Another exceedingly lasting impression on Hans Blüher was made by the wealthy landowner Wilhelm "Willie" Jansen who met Blüher, himself an expedition leader now, on a 1905 summer trip from the Rhön to Lake Constance where Blüher won him for the Wandervogel movement.

{{Zitat|"Jansen fascinated the youth by his personality, in no time he had opened the West German schools for the Wandervogel and the young men clung to him like burs. Of course, it was no different with Fischer: hero love. But this was in an undoubtedly intensified form [...] You can believe it or not, but I have read it in numerous letters and heard it from many young people themselves; it was true eroticism that erupted here.”&lt;ref&gt;''Hans Blüher'' (biographische Hinweise). In: Werner Kindt (Hrsg.): ''Dokumentation der Jugendbewegung.'' Band&amp;nbsp;I: ''Grundschriften der deutschen Jugendbewegung.'' Diederichs, Düsseldorf 1963, S.&amp;nbsp;558 f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Blüher: ''Wandervogel. Geschichte einer Jugendbewegung. Zweiter Teil: Blüte und Niedergang.'' Zweite Auflage, Berlin-Tempelhof 1912, S.&amp;nbsp;57&amp;nbsp;f&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like Karl Fischer before him, Wilhelm Jansen was the idealized youth leader who came to his authority through charisma and talent and not articles or power, as the teachers had alleged. Through the element of voluntarism, the model of the youth leader received an unexpected dynamism, which was generally described as anything from romantically wistful to fascinatingly mysterious. The self-education of the youth also made it possible to break away from the traditions of their parents' generation, which they considered outdated, and test out their own ways of growing up. For Blüher, at least, Jansen was the pioneering personality of the youth movement:

"Jansen was among the first to introduce ancient gymnastics as an alternative to the barbaric and often tasteless German gymnastics (Turnen), because this most natural form of physical culture had been erased by Christian culture and gymnastics (Turnen) was a highly imperfect replacement for it. The first German palaestra in Charlottenburg near Berlin had been built by Jansen, one of the first light and air baths was on his estate, and his capital worked everywhere it was necessary to overcome prudery and concealment and replace it with the noble openness of nudity. The physical culture movement, which continues to progress today, owes its first successes to Jansen."

The motif of the naked body, pristinely and truly perceived, is found not only in the youth movement, but also in other life reform groups and schools of thought. In all these cases, reference is made to the noble and truly idealized nudity of ancient cultures.

'''Historian of the Movement'''

Hans Blüher, who graduated from high school in 1907, spent seven years in the Wandervogel movement before leaving in 1909. But even then, he did not completely break off ties with the group, particularly as Blüher stood by his early friendships during the split-up of the organization and reclaimed sovereignty of interpretation over the development of the movement at the behest of the movement itself and supported by Willie Jansen, who urged him to pre-empt another party's account of the Wandervogel with a work of his own.

From the very title of the work itself, the 24-year-old Blüher claimed to comprehend and explain the rise, peak, and decline of the movement. It was important to him, he wrote in the foreword, to tie together the seemingly unconnected factors and determine the moving parts of this movement. In contrast to the mere chronicler, every historian must confront this subjective side of his work.

"In the process, he may make major mistakes, perhaps pivotal ones, while the chronicler will at worst make a spelling mistake. I will describe the history of the youth movement, whose innermost being, so far as I understand it, has such a wealth of interesting facts that it will be well worthwhile to ponder them; a movement that was entirely born of our youth is perhaps the most remarkable thing that has ever happened on German soil. But it is precisely its interior that is most remarkable, the unspoken, the secret... It was a youth who ate at clean tables on weekdays and had nothing to scrutinize, who then, at foggy festivals by brown heathens and sandy landscapes, dressed in wild clothes, backpacked and disheveled, unrecognizable, lying by the fire at night, and speaking to each other of things never said full of anger, frustration, recklessness, and melancholy."

Blüher interpreted the institutional beginning of the Wandervogel movement as a "stroke of genius" on the part of Karl Fischer against school laws and the state authorities, who prohibited students from forming their own associations. By obtaining for a number of respected Steglitz citizens positions as board members on the "Board for School Transportation," he was able to establish the group on a permanent foundation and at the same time set the pattern for further initiatives: "This committee was the actual club. It was presented to the school and the names of the men ensured that everything went well. Quite apart from this was the actual youth movement with its leaders; it was ensured that the committee had as little as possible to do with it, only giving money and names and, as mentioned, 'vouched' for it to the public. The students themselves were entered into the "Student Book," but were not members of the association but rather only on a list where you could find their addresses."

"'''Harrison Bergeron'''" is a [[satirical]] and [[dystopia]]n [[science-fiction]] [[short story]] written by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and first published in October 1961. Originally published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', the story was republished in the author's ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' collection in 1968.

==Plot==
In the year 2081, the 211th, 212th, and 213th amendments to the Constitution dictate that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking, or more physically able than anyone else. The Handicapper General's agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear "handicaps": masks for those who are too beautiful, loud radios that disrupt thoughts inside the ears of intelligent people, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.

One April, 14-year-old Harrison Bergeron, an intelligent, athletic, and good-looking teenager, is taken away from his parents, George and Hazel Bergeron, by the government. They are barely aware of the tragedy, as Hazel has "average" intelligence (a euphemism for stupidity), and George has a handicap radio installed by the government to regulate his above-average intelligence.

Hazel and George watch ballet on television. They comment on the dancers, who are weighed down to counteract their gracefulness and masked to hide their attractiveness. George's thoughts are continually interrupted by the different noises emitted by his handicap radio, which piques Hazel's curiosity and imagination regarding handicaps. Noticing his exhaustion, Hazel urges George to lie down and rest his "handicap bag", {{convert|47|lb|kg}} of weights locked around George's neck. She suggests taking a few of the weights out of the bag, but George resists, aware of the illegality of such an action.

On television, a news reporter struggles to read the bulletin and hands it to the ballerina wearing the most grotesque mask and heaviest weights. She begins reading in her unacceptably natural, beautiful voice, then apologizes before switching to a more unpleasant voice. Harrison's escape from prison is announced, and a full-body photograph of Harrison is shown, indicating that he is {{convert|7|ft|m|spell=in}} tall and burdened by {{convert|300|lb|kg|spell=in}} of handicaps.

George recognizes his son for a moment, before having the thought eliminated by his radio. Harrison himself then storms the television studio in an attempt to overthrow the government. He calls himself the Emperor and rips off all of his handicaps, along with the handicaps of a ballerina, whom he proclaims his "Empress". He orders the musicians to play, promising them nobility if they do their best. Unhappy with their initial attempt, Harrison takes control for a short while, and the music improves. After listening and being moved by the music, Harrison and his Empress dance while flying to the ceiling, then pause in mid-air to kiss.

Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, enters the studio and kills Harrison and the Empress with a ten-gauge double-barreled shotgun. She forces the musicians to put on their handicaps, and the television goes dark. George, unaware of the televised incident, returns from the kitchen and asks Hazel why she was crying, to which she replies that something sad happened on television that she cannot remember. He comforts her and they return to their average lives.

==Characters==
*'''Harrison Bergeron''' is the fourteen-year-old son, who is {{convert|7|ft}} tall, a genius, and an extraordinarily handsome, athletic, strong, and brave person. He wants to live as an unimpeded human being and does not want to obey the laws of the government, which has taken on the responsibility of creating equality for the whole American society. He has been jailed by the Handicapper General's office for planning to overthrow the government. To eliminate any "unfair advantages", the Handicapper General forces him to wear the most extreme handicaps reflecting his extraordinary attributes: huge earphones and spectacles intended to make him half blind and give him tremendous headaches, disfiguring makeup in the form of blackened teeth and a red rubber nose to mask his extraordinary looks, and so many weights to compensate his prodigious strength that they make him look more like a junk yard than a man. When he escapes from jail, the government describes him as "a genius and an athlete" and tells people that he should be regarded as extremely dangerous. When Harrison enters the television studio, he is convinced that he can overthrow the government and declares "I am the Emperor! ... Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody must do what I say at once!". In addition to this talent and egotism, he also possesses artistic and romantic characteristics. He sings and dances with his Empress, defying gravity while doing so. Despite Harrison's superior physical prowess and intellectual faculties, he is stopped when the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers, shoots him and his Empress down with a shotgun.
*'''George Bergeron''' is Harrison's father and Hazel's husband. A very smart and sensitive character, he is handicapped artificially by the government. Like his son, he has to wear mental handicap earphones in his ears to keep him from thinking intensely and analytically. Because he is stronger than average, he has to wear weights around his neck. When his wife Hazel suggests that he could take these weights off for a while to relax, he rejects the idea. He wants to obey the laws and is unwilling to risk punishment for a little comfort. He believes that the situation in 2081 is better than it had been back in the days when fierce competition reigned in society. He has much respect for the rules and represents the common passive citizen who does not critique a government that manipulates individuals. Obeying the rules, he is even incapable of recognizing the tragic situation when his son has been shot to death - a harsh critique of passiveness towards authority.
*'''Hazel Bergeron''' is Harrison's mother and George's wife. Hazel has what is described as perfectly average intelligence, which means that she cannot think deeply about anything. However, she is a well-intentioned character, a loving wife and mother, who tries to comfort her husband by suggesting he removes his handicap weights. She cries when she sees what happens to her son but due to her impaired faculties quickly forgets the subject of her sorrow. In the end all her kindness counts for nothing as her stupidity outruns her good intentions. Hazel has much in common with the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers.
*'''Ballerina''', a beautiful dancer who was burdened with an especially ugly mask and excessive weights ("as big as those worn by two hundred pound men"), as she is the fairest, most beautiful and most graceful of the dancers. She reads an announcement card after the stammering announcer is unable to. It is likely, but not stated, that she is the same dancer who Harrison Bergeron takes as his Empress, who is later shot by Diana Moon Glampers for not wearing her handicaps, and dancing with Harrison Bergeron.
*'''Diana Moon Glampers''', despite appearing in person for only four sentences, represents the oppressive government and enforces the handicapping policies of the government. It is mentioned early on that Hazel resembles Diana, and Hazel mentions improvements she would make to Diana's handicap regulations. She appears ruthless when she kills Harrison and his Empress without warning, and threatens the musicians with a similar fate before the broadcast is interrupted, leaving their future ambiguous. Diana's first and middle names are possibly a reference to Diana, the Roman huntress, virgin goddess of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Khawaja |first=Zainab |date=July 14, 2011 |title=Socialism, Communism, &amp; Harrison Bergeron |url=http://zmeetsworld.com/2011/07/14/harrison-bergeron-an-interpretive-essay/ |website=ZMeetsWorld |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Here, Vonnegut is influenced by his early work as a journalist. His sentences are short and easily understood so as to be largely accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=William Rodney |date=1991 |title=Understanding Kurt Vonnegut |location=Columbia |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dystopian setting enhances his social and political critique by imagining a future world founded on absolute equality through handicaps assigned to various above-average people to counter their natural advantages. A similar subject can be found in [[L. P. Hartley]]'s dystopian novel ''[[Facial Justice]]'' from the previous year of 1960.

Yet Vonnegut also punctuates his dystopia with humor. Even the most horrifying scenes are underlined by jokes or absurdity. When the news announcer is supposed to read a news bulletin he has to hand it to a nearby ballerina because of his speech impediment, and the ballerina then alters her voice to a "grackle squawk" because it would be "unfair" to use her natural voice, described as a "warm, luminous, timeless melody". This absurdity highlights the madness of the world of "Harrison Bergeron".

==Parallels with ''The Sirens of Titan''==
A similar dystopian society to that of "Harrison Bergeron" appears in Vonnegut's 1959 novel ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]''. When the Space Wanderer returns to Earth he finds a society in which handicaps are used to make all people equal, eradicating the supposedly ruinous effects of blind luck on human society. The narrator claims that now "the weakest and the meekest were bound to admit, at last, that the race of life was fair".

The strong are burdened with "handicaps" (consisting of "bags of lead shot" hung from various parts of the body) and the beautiful hide their advantageous appearance through "frumpish clothes, bad posture, chewing gum and a ghoulish use of cosmetics". Unlike in "Harrison Bergeron", the citizens in ''The Sirens of Titan'' choose to wear these handicaps voluntarily as an act of faith towards ''the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent'', although it is suggested that not to do so would invite social condemnation. There are no handicaps for above-average intelligence mentioned in ''The Sirens of Titan''. The society of ''Harrison Bergeron'' addresses differences in intellectual and cognitive ability and their entailing advantages.

== Adaptations ==
The story has been adapted for the screen at least four times.

*[[PBS]] adapted several stories, including "Harrison Bergeron", in ''[[Between Time and Timbuktu]]'' (1972), with Avind Haerum in the title role.
*In 1995 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] produced a full-length made-for-television adaptation entitled ''[[Harrison Bergeron (film)|Harrison Bergeron]]'', starring [[Sean Astin]] as the title character and [[Christopher Plummer]] as John Klaxon. The adaptation diverged from the plot considerably, featuring Harrison being recruited by the National Administration Center, a secret cabal of geniuses within the government who ensure that the handicapped America functions. Working for the television division, Harrison becomes dissatisfied with the status quo and attempts to start another American revolution by taking over the nation's television broadcasting. He broadcasts old unhandicapped movies and music, while encouraging people to remove the brain-handicapping "bands" on their heads.
*In 2006, a short film also entitled ''Harrison Bergeron''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1223957|title=Harrison Bergeron}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released.
*In 2009, another short film called ''[[2081 (film)|2081]]'' was based on the original story and starred [[Armie Hammer]] as the title character. Joe Crowe, managing editor of the online magazine ''Revolution Science Fiction'', described the movie as "stirring and dramatic" and said it "gets right to the point, and nails the adaptation in about 25 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=4860 2081]" by Jow Crowe, ''Revolution Science Fiction'', retrieved 2010-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the real world ==
In 2005 the story was quoted by attorneys in a brief before the [[Kansas Supreme Court]]. Vonnegut was quoted as saying that while he did not mind the story being used in the suit, he disagreed with the lawyers' interpretation of it.&lt;ref name="Court_case_2005"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/may/05/vonnegut_lawyers_could| title = Vonnegut: Lawyers could use literary lesson| last = Rothschild| first = Scott| date = 2005-05-05| work = LJWorld.com| accessdate = 2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] quoted the story in ''[[PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12835">'''Harry D. Harootunian''' (born 1929) is an American historian of early modern and modern Japan with an interest in historical theory. He is Professor Emeritus of East Asian Studies, [[New York University]], and Max Palevsky Professor of History and Civilizations, Emeritus, [[University of Chicago]].

Harootunian edited volumes on 20th-century politics in Japan, but is best known for a series of wide-ranging monographs on the development of Japanese social and intellectual thought from late [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period through the middle of the 20th century.

==Career==
Harootunian took his Ph.D. in History in 1958 from [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], where he studied under [[John Whitney Hall]], after earning a master's degree there in Far Eastern Studies in 1953. He is a 1951 graduate of [[Wayne State University]]. He has taught at [[University of Rochester]], [[University of Chicago]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], where he was Dean of Humanities, and [[New York University]].

He was Editor, ''[[Journal of Asian Studies]]'', Coeditor, ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'', and with Rey Chow and Masao Miyoshi, co-edited the Asia-Pacific series for Duke University Press.

==Scholarship on Japanese intellectual history==
Harootunian's first [[monograph]], ''Toward Restoration; the Growth of Political Consciousness in Tokugawa Japan'' (1970), deals with the period  when a stable feudal Japan began to show tensions, leading up to the opening of the country in the 1850s and the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868. [[Kenneth Pyle]], reviewing the book in the [[American Historical Review]], wrote that many historians saw the Meiji Restoration not as a revolution but as a change carried out in the name of tradition by men who did not foresee its social ramifications. Harutoonian, said Pyle, “has little patience with this view.” The book attacked the “inordinate effort to minimize the revolutionary dimensions of the Meiji Restoration and argued instead that the activists were “no less eager to repudiate history than French revolutionaries in 1789. The values they espoused were traditional in name only.” Only the vocabulary was traditional. Pyle adds that “this is not an easy book” but the approach to intellectual history is “nonetheless intelligent and imaginative.”&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth B. Pyle, “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1869844 Review]” ''The American Historical Review ''76.1  (1971):  179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Things Seen and Unseen: Discourse and Ideology in Tokugawa Nativism'' (1988) focuses on [[Kokugaku]], which Harootunian translates as "nativist," a loosely related group that resisted Sinocentric, or Chinese, traditions and developed new frameworks which emphasized home-grown thought. Their ideas were then used by groups, especially agrarian elites, outside the capital and major cities to assert their legitimacy on the basis of Japanese traditions. The thinkers included such men as [[Kamo Mabuchi]] (1697-1769), [[Motoori Norinaga]] (1730-1801), and their successors, such as [[Hirata Atsutane]] (1776-1843).  [[Samuel H. Yamashita]], writing in the [[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]], said “without a doubt" this is "an extraordinary book... offering nothing less than a reinterpretation of the ''kokugaku '' movement, one that diverges in content and form from the existing scholarship, both Western and Japanese.” Yamashita saw echoes of [[Michel Foucault]] in Harootunian's drive to uncover the rules, rituals, and education that determine what is right and what is wrong and what it is possible to think. He also saw the influence of [[Hayden White]] in Harootunian's attention to language and formal structure, Harootunian, wrote Yamashita, wants to show how ''kokugaku ''scholars resisted and contested the prevailing "official culture and ideology." The last chapters of the book show that this ''kokugaku '' thought was misappropriated by political figures in the early 20th century for chauvinistic purposes. Yamashita added that this “is not, by conventional standards, a very readable book, but the puzzling and occasionally obtuse prose was partly intended" and that "readers unfamiliar with the issues being discussed and the theoretical material invoked will miss the main points of the book.”&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Hideo Yamashita,"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2719183 Review]," ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 52.2  (1992): 763-776.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Overcome by Modernity'' (2000) deals with the artists, critics, philosophers, poets, and social scientists  of the 1920s and 1930s, a period when Japan had entered into the “heroic phase of capitalism.”  They were caught in the dilemma of explaining why Japan had to overcome “modernity” while explaining why it could not. Jeffrey Hanes of the University of Oregon, wrote in the ''American Historical Review'', that  “this is a formidable book” that is a “challenging sometimes maddening read, but one that rewards us with a terrifically insightful and poignant evocation of Japan’s attempts to come to grips with the modern world into which it was thrust and into which it then threw itself.”  &lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey E. Hanes, “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/529615 Review],” ''The American Historical Review ''108.3  (2003): 809-810.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural studies, critical theory, and critique of Area Studies==
Harootunian was a proponent of the movement to adapt and apply [[critical theory]] in a way that would put Japan in the same frame of analysis as other capitalist countries rather than making it exotic. [[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]], a [[University of California, Berkeley]] sociologist, reviewed the use of [[cultural studies]] in the Japan field and saw Harutoonian and his University of Chicago colleague [[Tetsuo Najita]] as pioneers whose impact spread from Chicago through their example and the graduate students they trained. Lie referred to the two collectively as "Najitunian" {{sfnb|Lie|1994| p = 417}} The University of Hawaii historian  Patricia G. Steinhoff talked of the "paradigm shift" in the 1980s in which the field of Japanese studies learned to "speak Najitunian." {{sfnb|Steinhoff|2008}}

Both Lie and Steinhoff showed caution. Lie in particular objected to the influence of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' and used the "University of Chicago School" as an example. Lie's objection was that this approach put all Asian countries into one category, did not give enough weight to historical change, and did not place enough emphasis on class differences.{{sfnb|Lie|1994| p = }}  In reply to a review by [[Ian Buruma]], however, Harutoonian stated "I am not now nor have I ever been either a 'deconstructionist' or for that matter a Maoist." &lt;ref&gt;Harry Harootunian, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/oct/24/a-case-of-inverted-commas/ A Case of ‘Inverted Commas’] (Letter to the editor)  ''New York Review'' October 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Harootunian deplored the overuse of [[modernization theory]] in the development of the field, especially the involvement and distorting influence of government agencies and private foundations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Ford Foundation]]. The volume Harutoonian edited with [[Masao Miyoshi]] in 2002, ''Learning Places: The Afterlives of Area Studies'' is a collection of essays that critically examine the rise of Area Studies during the Cold War, then analyze the late 20th century, post-Cold War "need of foreign governments, mostly outside Euro-America, to pay American universities and colleges to teach courses on their histories and societies." The Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese governments especially felt this need. The editors argue that Area Studies movement was based on the wartime need to study the enemy, but "fifty years after the war's end, American scholars are still organizing knowledge as if confronted by an implacable enemy and thus driven by the desire to either destroy it or marry it." Universities seek to maintain this structure by soliciting these foreign donations. The [[Association for Asian Studies]], continue Harutoonian and Miyoshi, therefore missed the opportunity to make the study of Asia into a part of the general learning of the world rather than closing off the study of individual nations. Areas Studies also suffers from accepting the traditional disciplines. The newer cultural studies, on the other hand, rise above national borders or dissolve disciplinary boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Harootunian, Harry, and Masao Miyoshi. 2002. “Introduction: The ‘Afterlife’ of Area Studies.” In ''Learning Places: The Afterlives of Area Studies'', edited by Masao Miyoshi and H.D.Harootunian, Durham, N.C., and London: Duke University Press p. 1, 5-6, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Marx after Marx: History and Time in the Expansion of Capitalism'' (2015) Harootunian argues that "Western Marxism" should not be allowed to offer a purely European explanation of capitalism, since Marx himself offered a "deprovincialized" analysis rooted in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s2.netgalley.com/catalog/book/66078 Marx After Marx] Columbia University Press Website (Accessed July 2, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hillel Isaac Steiner''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|aɪ|n|ər}}; born 1942) is a Canadian political philosopher and is Emeritus Professor of Political Philosophy at the [[University of Manchester]]. He was elected to the Fellowship of the British Academy in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-42018?rskey=yhFetp&amp;result=34 "Steiner, Prof. Hillel Isaac"], ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'' (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2017). Retrieved 15 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Steiner's writings are focused on contemporary philosophical work on the conceptual analysis of freedom, rights and justice, and on the relation between moral and economic rationality. His most noted work is ''An Essay on Rights'' which won the [[Political Studies Association]]'s best book prize for 1994. In it, he develops what has since come to be known as a [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] theory of [[distributive justice]]. This book brings together Steiner's work on the pure negative conception of liberty, the Will Theory of rights, and a liberal model of exploitation. Embracing the libertarian right of self-ownership, he argues that its consistent universalization requires that individuals be vested with equal rights to negative freedom that are global in scope and that take account of interpersonal inequalities in natural resource values, including those of genetic endowments. He was also the first person to use the term "[[throffer]]", which is now used in and beyond political philosophy, in print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/hillel.steiner/ Prof. Hillel Steiner's page at the University of Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomcenter.arizona.edu/hsteiner Prof. Hillel Steiner's page at the University of Arizona]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the following organisations: [[American Philosophical Association]], [[Aristotelian Society]], [[Association for Legal and Social Philosophy]], [[Basic Income Earth Network]]. [[British Philosophical Association]], [[European Society for the History of Economic Thought]], [[Political Studies Association]], [[Society for Applied Philosophy]], and the [[September Group]].

[[File:Muhlenbergpassport.jpg|thumb|Passport for [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]], issued by James Hamilton, 1752]]
'''James Hamilton''' ({{circa}}1710 in Accomac County(?), Virginia{{spaced ndash}}14 August 1783, [[New York City]]), son of the well-known Philadelphia lawyer [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]], was a prominent lawyer and governmental figure in colonial [[Philadelphia]] and [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]. He served as Deputy Governor of the Province from 1748 to 1754 and again from 1759 to 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Armor, William C., Lives of the Governors of Pennsylvania, With the Incidental History of the State, from 1609 to 1872, Philadelphia, J.K. Simon (1873)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Hamilton was educated in Philadelphia and England before becoming a practicing lawyer in 1731. When on 28 December 1733 his father resigned as [[prothonotary#Chief court clerk|prothonotary]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]], Hamilton was appointed to the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nix|first=Foster C.|title=Andrew Hamilton's Early Years in the American Colonies|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 1964|volume=21|series=Third Series|issue=3|pages=390–407 [400]|publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1734 James's father [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]] sold him the town site of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] for 5 shillings. Later that month, on 21 May, the younger Hamilton secured a patent from the Penn family for his grant on the Lancaster land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood, Jr.|first=Jerome H.|title=The Town Proprietors of Lancaster, 1730-1790|journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|date=July 1972|volume=96|issue=3|pages=346–368 [351]|publisher=The Historical Society of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father on 4 August 1741, James Hamilton inherited his 150-acre estate known as Bush Hill north of the city.  He assisted his brother-in-law [[William Allen (loyalist)|William Allen]] in the administration of lands purchased by his father to be used for the [[Independence Hall|state house]] and surrounding public space.&lt;ref name="Browning"&gt;Browning, Charles H. (1916). "The State House Yard, and Who Owned It First after William Penn," ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 40''(1), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected to the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|provincial assembly]] in 1745, Hamilton was re-elected five times. He served as [[mayor of Philadelphia]] for one year from October 1745.  During his tenure as Mayor, Hamilton kept a record of servants and apprentices bound before him, which historians have used to gauge the nature and extent of indentured servitude in Philadelphia -- and Pennsylvania more generally because Philadelphia was the entry-point for indentured servants coming into the colony from Europe.&lt;ref&gt; George W. Nieble, "Servants and Apprentices Bound and Assigned before James Hamilton Mayor of Philadelphia, 1745" ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 30'' (1906) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20085343?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] &lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton became a member of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Council|provincial council]] in 1746. He was commissioned by the sons of [[William Penn]] as lieutenant-governor, as which he served until 1754, then again from 1759 to 1763, then briefly also in 1771 and 1773.

On 13 September 1761, Hamilton and William Allen conveyed Lot no. 1 and the other pieces of property obtained by Andrew Hamilton and Allen to [[Isaac Norris (statesman)|Isaac Norris II]] and the other trustees in charge of purchasing property for the Philadelphia state house. The conveyance of this land completed the area of the Yard: property that contained the state house and the public spaces surrounding it.&lt;ref name=Browning /&gt; 

During the period that the federal capital was located in Philadelphia, William Hamilton was on an extended stay in England. He rented Bush Hill to the government for the vice-president to use as his residence.

==Governor of Province of Pennsylvania==
===Deputy Governor, November 23, 1748 – October 3, 1754; October, 1759 – November 1763===
Hamilton was visiting London in 1748 when he received the commission of Deputy Governor for the province from the Penns&lt;ref&gt;Armor 1873&lt;/ref&gt;. Upon his return to Philadelphia, he was faced with some unrest from the Native American population.  Their territory north of the Blue Mountains (west of the Susquehanna River) was being encroached upon by settlers illegally. Hamilton authorized [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]] and [[Conrad Weiser]] to assist in [[Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania|removing these squatters]] after the provision in the Land Purchase of 1749, which authorized their removal by force if necessary&lt;ref&gt;Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: May 24, 1781-Sept. 3, 1790, Volume II, Bioren Publishing, Philadelphia (1810)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Other issues faced by Hamilton were&lt;ref&gt;Armor 1873&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Encroachment of the French Military into forts in the land of the Pennsylvania Charter at Presque Isle, Venango, La Boeuf and Du Quesne.
*Organizing and funding a defense (against the French) in opposition to the pacifist Quaker element in the Assembly
*Friction between the Assembly and Proprietors on taxing Proprietary land holdings
*Assembly discontent over the Proprietors’ refusal to hear appeals from them about the Deputy Governor's decisions
*Failure to disclose to the Assembly, the Proprietors’ directive concerning the financial interest of pecuniary bills which Hamilton would approve
*[[Albany Congress]] attended by [[John Penn (governor)|John Penn]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]], who proposed a colonial union for defense against the French and Indians

Hamilton resigned due to his deteriorating relations with the Assembly in the attempt to follow the Proprietors’ instructions.

Hamilton’s second turn as Deputy Governor followed the recall of [[William Denny (colonial governor of Pennsylvania)|William Denny]].  The [[French and Indian War]] was coming to its conclusion.  However, Pennsylvania was now facing [[Pontiac’s War]]. Delaware and Shawnee raided deep into frontier Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing settlers. An uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the [[Paxton Boys]] erupted in the colony. Hamilton was replaced by John Penn, William Penn’s grandson.

===President of Provincial Council 1771===
Hamilton (in effect) assumed the role of chief executive, when John Penn left Philadelphia to return to England when his father died.  The Council was prohibited to approve any act of the Assembly so the role was strictly ceremonial or administrative until October when [[Richard Penn (governor)|Richard Penn, Jr.]], (John’s brother) was appointed Deputy Governor of the province&lt;ref&gt;Armor 1873&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Legacy==
[[File:Andrew Hamilton Bush Hill Drawing.png|thumb|''Bush Hill. The Seat of Wm. Hamilton Esqr. near Philadelphia'', by James Peller Malcolm. Bush Hill was first the country seat of [[Andrew Hamilton (lawyer)|Andrew Hamilton]], then passed on to his heirs.]]
Hamilton was active in founding several institutions in Philadelphia, serving as president of the board of trustees of the College of Philadelphia (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and as the head of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

As he did not have a surviving son, his nephew William Hamilton inherited his estate of Bush Hill. During the period that the federal capital was located in Philadelphia, 

During the [[Yellow fever epidemic of 1793]], outbuildings at the Bush Hill estate were adapted for use as a fever hospital for several months.

'''Judaism''' has teachings and guidance for its adherents through the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[rabbinic literature]] relating to the notion and concept of [[peace]].

==Shalom==
{{Main|Shalom|S-L-M}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for peace is [[shalom]] which is derived from one of the names of God. Hebrew root word for "complete" or "whole" implying that according to Judaism and the teachings of the Torah, only when there is a true state of "wholeness" meaning that everything is "complete" does true "peace" reign. This the same for the directly related Arabic word [[S-L-M|Salaam]].

[[Shin (letter)|Shin]]-[[Lamedh]]-[[Mem]] ({{lang-ar|[[Wiktionary:س ل م|س ل م]]}} ''S-L-M''; {{lang-arc|[[Wiktionary:ܫܠܡܐ|ܫܠܡܐ]]}}; {{lang-he|[[Wiktionary:שלם|שלם]]}} ''Š-L-M''; {{lang-mt|S-L-M}}) is the [[Semitic root|triconsonantal]] root of many [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words, and many of those words are used as names. The root itself translates as "whole, safe, intact".

==Hebrew Bible==
The [[Torah]], [[Tanakh]] and its related literature write extensively concerning peace, as well as its opposite states. The word "shalom" meaning "peace" has been absorbed into the usage of the language from its Biblical roots and from there to many of the world's languages, religions and cultures as prized idioms and well-worn expressions. ''A New [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] of the Bible: [[Thesaurus]] of the Language of the Bible'' &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Even-Shoshan, ''A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible: Hebrew and Aramaic Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms'' (Kiryat Sepher Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1986 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; lists over almost 300 words connected with the root "SH-L-M" for "peace" and the same for "Solomon"

Notable examples: 
*The [[Priestly Blessing]] ({{bibleverse||Numbers|6:24–26|HE}}) ends with: "May God lift up his face onto you and give you '''peace'''" – יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ, וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָלוֹם
*{{bibleverse||Leviticus|26:6|HE}}: "And I shall place '''peace''' upon the land" וְנָתַתִּי שָלוֹם בָּאָרֶץ
*{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:12|HE}}: "Behold I give him my covenant of '''peace'''" - הִנְנִי נֹתֵן לוֹ אֶת-בְּרִיתִי, שָלוֹם
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|57:19|HE}}: "'''Peace, peace''' to the distant and the close" - שָלוֹם שָלוֹם לָרָחוֹק וְלַקָּרוֹב
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|34:15|HE}}: "Seek '''peace''' and pursue it" - בַּקֵּשׁ שָלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|119:165|HE}}: "Great '''peace''' to those who love Your Torah" -  שָלוֹם רָב, לְאֹהֲבֵי תוֹרָתֶךָ
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|125:5|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Psalms|128:6|HE}}: "'''Peace''' upon Israel" - שָׁלוֹם, עַל-יִשְׂרָאֵל

==Jerusalem==
{{Main|Jerusalem}}
The name of the city of [[Jerusalem]], ''Yerushalayim'' in Hebrew is made up of two words with "''-shalayim''" i.e. "-salem" denoting the concept of "peace", with "''Yeru-''" i.e. "Jeru-" denoting "fear [of God]" as a combined word. This [[Midrash]]ic explanation of the name relates it to the ''yir'eh'' from the name '''Adonai-yir'eh''' ("The Lord sees", [[Vulgate]] Latin ''Dominus videt'') given to Moriah by Abraham and the name '''Salem'''. Other midrashim say that Jerusalem means "City of Peace",'''[[Shalom]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/bechuko/klein.htm |title=Bar-Ilan University Parshat Hashavua Page |publisher=Biu.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solomon==
{{Main|Solomon}}
The name of the famous Biblical king [[Solomon]] (''Shlomo'' in Hebrew) means " 'peaceful' or 'complete' or 'whole' [one]."

==Jewish prayers==
{{Main|List of Jewish prayers and blessings}}
[[List of Jewish prayers and blessings]] are replete with constant references for a longing for peace on Earth and its attendant blessings.

==Modern Israel and peace==
{{Main|Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Israel–Jordan peace treaty|Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
The modern [[Judaism|Jewish]] state of Israel with its majority of [[Jews|Jewish]] citizens, since its inception and has been involved in a peace process with its Arab neighbors, such as:
*The [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]
*The [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]]
*The [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]

==Messianic Age==
{{Main|Messianic Age|Jewish Messianism}}
Judaism is the source-religion for the notion of a [[Messianic Age]], a [[theological]] term referring to a future time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without [[crime]], [[war]] and [[poverty]]. Many [[religion]]s have come to believe and await such an age; some refer to it as the "[[Kingdom of God]]".

According to Jewish tradition, the Messianic Era will be one of global peace and harmony, an era free of strife and hardship, and one conducive to the furtherance of the knowledge of the Creator. The theme of the [[Jewish Messiah]] ushering in an era of global peace is encapsulated in two of the most famous scriptural passages from the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the verses: {{bibleverse||Isaiah|2:4|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|HE}}:

{{quote|They shall beat their [[swords to plowshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare. (Isaiah 2:4)}}

{{quote|The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. (Isaiah 11:6-9)}}

==Rejection of violence==
{{rquote|right|The Jews are the mildest of men, passionately hostile to violence. That obstinate sweetness which they conserve in the midst of the most atrocious persecution, that sense of justice and of reason which they put up as their sole defense against a hostile, brutal, and unjust society, is perhaps the best part of the message they bring to us and the true mark of their greatness.|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] &lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, 1946, Reflexions sur la question juive&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Judaism's religious texts overwhelmingly endorse compassion and peace, and the Hebrew Bible contains the well-known commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself".&lt;ref name="Goldsmith Ed. 1991 181"&gt;*Reuven Firestone (2004), "Judaism on Violence and Reconciliation:  An examination of key sources" in ''Beyond violence: religious sources of social transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam'', Fordham Univ Press, 2004, pp 77, 81.

In fact, the love of peace and the pursuit of peace is one of the key principles in [[Jewish law]]. While Jewish tradition permits waging war and killing in certain cases, however, the requirement is that one always seek a just peace before waging war.&lt;ref name="Broyde"&gt;Fighting the War and the Peace: Battlefield Ethics, Peace Talks, Treaties, and Pacifism in the Jewish Tradition. Michael J. Broyde, 1998, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deut|20:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1947 [[Columbus Platform]] of [[Reform Judaism]], "Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has proclaimed to mankind the ideal of universal peace, striving for spiritual and physical disarmament of all nations. Judaism rejects violence and relies upon moral education, love and sympathy."&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;The Columbus Platform: The Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism opposes violence===

The philosophy of [[nonviolence]] has roots in Judaism, going back to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] of the middle third century. While absolute nonviolence is not a requirement of Judaism, the religion so sharply restricts the use of violence, that nonviolence often becomes the only way to fulfilling a life of truth, justice and peace, which Judaism considers to be the three tools for the preservation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bearing witness: violence and collective responsibility, Sandra L. Bloom, Michael Reichert, Routledge, 1998: page 242&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish law (past and present) does not permit any use of violence unless it is in self-defense.&lt;ref name=koltora&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/14-10%20The%20Halacha%20of%20Rodef%20and%20the%20Rabin%20Shooting.htm |title=Halacha File: The Halacha of Rodef and the Rabin Shooting |publisher=Koltorah.org |date=2004-11-20 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person that even raises his hand in order to hit another person is called "evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ask.com/questions-about/Rasha |title=Rasha? |publisher=Ask.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305002701/http://www.ask.com/questions-about/Rasha |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidelines from the Torah to the 'Jewish Way to Fight a War'===

When the time for war arrived, Jewish soldiers are expected to abide by specific laws and values when fighting. Jewish war ethics attempts to balance the value of maintaining human life with the necessity of fighting a war. Judaism is somewhat unusual in that it demands adherence to Jewish values even while fighting a war. The Torah provides the following rules for how to fight a war: 
#Pursue Peace Before Waging War.
#Preserve the Ecological Needs of the Environment.
#Maintain Sensitivity to Human Life.
#The Goal is Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_intro/level2/bl_war.htm |title=The Jewish Way to Wage War |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avoidance of violence===
The ancient orders (like those) of wars for Israel to eradicate idol worshiping does not apply today. Jews are not taught to glorify violence. The rabbis of the [[Talmud]] saw war as an avoidable evil. They taught: "The sword comes to the world because of delay of justice and through perversion of justice."

Jews have always hated war and "[[Shalom]]" expresses the hope for peace, in Judaism war is evil, but at times a necessary one, yet, Judaism teaches that one has to go to great length to avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;''Judaism'' by Arye Forta, Heinemann, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-435-30321-1}} , p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NhdoWlrzcg4C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Torah===
When [[Moses]] saw a Jew striking another in Egypt ({{bibleverse||Exodus|2:13|HE}}): "...he said to the ''rasha'' ("evil one"), why do you hit your fellow!?".&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 2:13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[midrash]] comments, "Rabbi Yitzhak said: from this you learn that whoever hits his fellow, is called a ''rasha''."&lt;ref&gt;Ginzey Schechter, Vol. I, p. 114, as cited by Rabbi Professor David Golinkin, "The Jewish Attitude Towards Non-Violent Protest and Civil Disobedience"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] ruled that whoever strikes his fellow transgresses a negative commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hovel Umazik 5:1, as cited by Rabbi Professor David Golinkin, "The Jewish Attitude Towards Non-Violent Protest and Civil Disobedience"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Deuteronomy]], an offer of peace is to be made to any city which is besieged, conditional on the acceptance of terms of tribute.&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;Judaism and the ethics of war, Norman Solomon. International Review of the Red Cross. Volume 87 Number 858 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Mishna===
In the [[Mishna]], Rabbi [[Shimon ben Gamliel]] taught: "The world rests on three things: justice, truth, and peace."&lt;ref&gt;Pirkei  Avot 1:18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishna]] sages further asked, who is a hero of heroes? They answered, not one who defeats his enemy but one who turns an enemy into a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Avot de Rabbi Natan 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Talmud===
[[Shalom]] ("peace"), is one of the underlying principles of the [[Torah]], {{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:17|HE}}"Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom ('peace')."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 3:17&lt;/ref&gt; " The Talmud explains, "The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom".&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Gittin 59b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] comments in his [[Mishneh Torah]]: "Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.'" &lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Chanukah 4:14&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Talmud]]ic teaching, the very fact of taking someone's life, even when justly doing so, it effects, nevertheless the person, as the Talmud regards even a justly court that did order (in ancient times) the death penalty justifiably, that particular court at that time was labeled "killer court" in shame.&lt;ref&gt;''El Talmud'' by Iser Guinzburg, Editorial MAXTOR, 2009, {{ISBN|84-9761-579-4}}, {{ISBN|978-84-9761-579-2}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and even King [[David]], regarded by Jewish tradition as the most pious righteous person, (and his wars were within God's permission or/and orders) was denied building the [[Solomon's Temple|Jewish Temple]], the Talmud explains that when King David] asked "Why can I not build the Bais Hamikdash?" [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]'s answer was: "Your hands have spilled blood (in all your many wars)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/temple/history_sub.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225034245/http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/temple/history_sub.html |date=February 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud also teaches: "Be of the persecuted rather than the persecutor".&lt;ref&gt;Bava Kama 93a&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later scholars===
Medieval Jewish commentators including the Spanish theologian and commentator [[Isaac Arama]] (c. 1420–1494), and [[Isaac Abravanel]] (1437–1508), emphasized the commitment of Judaism to peace.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

According to sixteenth century Rabbi [[Judah Loew]] of Prague, Jewish law forbids the killing of innocent people, even in the course of a legitimate military engagement.&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/War_and_Peace/Combat_and_Conflict/Ethics_of_Jewish_War.shtml |title=The Ethics of Jewish War |publisher=My Jewish Learning|date=|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian rabbi [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] (1800–1865) stated categorically that the only permissible war was defensive.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; Later, a similar position prohibiting offensive war was taken by Rabbi [[Yeshayahu Karelitz]] (the Hazon
Ish, 1878–1953).&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

===Modern scholars===
Rabbi [[Moshe Avigdor Amiel]] (1883–1946), who was the Chief Rabbi of [[Tel Aviv]], wrote that military restraint was an absolute demand of Torah law, for "Thou shalt not murder" applied irrespective of whether the victim was Arab or Jew, and was the basis of Jewish ethics.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

Israeli [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Shlomo Goren]], who had served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as both paratrooper and chief chaplain, was instrumental in the formulation of the IDF official doctrine of ethics, and the concept of [[Purity of arms]].&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Human life is undoubtedly a supreme value in Judaism, as expressed both in the Halacha and the prophetic ethic. This refers not only to Jews, but to all men created in the image of God."&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Violent tactics forbidden by Halakhah===
Jewish law prohibits the use of outright vandalism in warfare.&lt;ref name="mjl"/&gt; It forbids destruction of fruit trees as a tactic of war. It is also forbidden to break vessels, tear clothing, wreck that which is built up, stop fountains, or waste food in a destructive manner. Killing an animal needlessly or offering poisoned water to livestock are also forbidden.&lt;ref name="mjl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Nature_and_the_Environment/Traditional_Teachings/Bal_Tashit.shtml |title=Bal Tashhit: The Torah Prohibits Wasteful Destruction |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those few cases in the Bible in which this norm was violated are special cases. One example was when King [[Hezekiah]] stopped all the fountains in [[Jerusalem]] in the war against [[Sennacherib]], which Jewish scholars regards as a violation of the Biblical commandment.&lt;ref name="mjl"/&gt;

According to [[Maimonides]], on besieging a city in order to seize it, it must not be surrounded on all four sides but only on three sides, thus leaving a path of escape for whomever wishes to flee to save his life.&lt;ref name="ethics"/&gt; [[Nachmanides]], writing a century later, strengthened the rule and added a reason: "We are to learn to deal kindly with our enemy."&lt;ref name="ethics"/&gt;

===Notable rabbis===
Despite controversial public comments, [[Ovadia Yosef]], an influential Sephardic rabbi and distinguished rabbinical authority, advocates for peace negotiations in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] since the late 1980s. His main justification is the halakhic principle of ''[[Self-sacrifice in Jewish law|Pikuach Nefesh]]'', in which all the Jewish commandments (excluding [[adultery]], [[idolatry]], and [[murder]]) are put on hold if a life is put in danger. Using an argument first articulated by the late American rabbinical leader [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], Rabbi Yosef claims that the Arab–Israeli conflict endangers human lives, thereby meeting the above criteria and overruling the priority of commandments pertaining to settling the land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp439.htm |title=Interpretations of Jewish Tradition on Democracy, Land, and Peace |author=Gerald M. Steinberg |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |date=2000-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Israel is permitted—even obligated if saving lives is a definitive outcome—to make serious efforts to reach a peace settlement as well as to make arrangements to properly protect its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Rav Ovadia Yossef. "Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives", ''Tehumim'' Vol. 10, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rav Ovadia Yossef. "Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives", ''Crossroads: Halacha and the Modern World'' Vol. 3, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Yosef first applied the ''Pikuach Nefesh'' principle to Israel's conflicts with its neighbors in 1979, when he ruled that this argument granted Israel authority to return the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/v005/5.2yuchtman-yaar.html |title=Project MUSE - Shas: The Haredi-Dovish Image in a Changing Reality |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/ |title=Project MUSE - Israel Studies |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19065">{{17th Century Scholasticism}}
'''Lutheran scholasticism''' was a theological method that gradually developed during the era of [[Lutheran Orthodoxy]]. Theologians used the neo-Aristotelian form of presentation, already popular in academia, in their writings and lectures. They defined the Lutheran faith and defended it against the [[polemic]]s of opposing parties.

==Distinction between scholastic theology and method==
The term “scholasticism” is used to indicate both the [[Scholasticism#High Scholasticism|scholastic theology]] that arose during the pre-Reformation Church and the methodology associated with it. While Lutherans reject the theology of the scholastics, some accept their method.&lt;ref name=HEJ434&gt;[[Henry Eyster Jacobs|Jacobs, Henry Eyster]]. “[https://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA434&amp;vq=%22Scholasticism+in+the+Luth.+Church%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 Scholasticism in the Luth. Church].” ''Lutheran Cyclopedia.'' New York: Scribner, 1899. pp. 434–5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Eyster Jacobs]] writes of the scholastic method:
:The method is the application of the most rigorous appliances of logic to the formulation and analysis of theological definitions. The method ''per se'' cannot be vicious, as sound logic always must keep within its own boundaries. It became false, when logic, as a science that has only to do with the natural, and with the supernatural only so far as it has been brought, by revelation, within the sphere of natural apprehension, undertakes not only to be the test of the supernatural, but to determine all of its relations.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt;

==History==

===Background===
[[Scholasticism#High Scholasticism|High Scholasticism]] in [[Western Christianity]] aimed at an exhaustive treatment of theology, supplementing revelation by the deductions of reason. [[Aristotle]] furnished the rules according to which it proceeded, and after a while he became the authority for both the source and process of theology.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt;

===Initial rejection===
Lutheranism began as a vigorous protest against scholasticism, starting with [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt; Around the time he became a monk, Luther sought assurances about life, and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in [[Aristotle]] and the scholastics [[William of Ockham]] and [[Gabriel Biel]].&lt;ref name=Marty5&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He was deeply influenced by two tutors, [[Bartholomaeus Arnoldi]] von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers,&lt;ref name=Marty5/&gt; and to test everything himself by experience.&lt;ref name=Marty6&gt;[[Martin E. Marty|Marty, Martin]]. ''Martin Luther''. Viking Penguin, 2004, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of [[reason]], but none about the importance, for Luther, of loving God. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason.&lt;ref name=Marty6/&gt; For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through [[divine revelation]], he believed, and [[Scripture]] therefore became increasingly important to him.&lt;ref name=Marty6/&gt;

Martin Luther held that it was "not at all in conformity with the New Testament to write books about Christian doctrine." He noted that before the Apostles wrote books, they "previously preached to and converted the people with the physical voice, which was also their real apostolic and New Testament work."&lt;ref&gt;quotes found in ''WA 10'' I, I, p. 625, 15ff. taken from ''Morphologie des Luthertums [The Shaping of Lutheranism], (Munich: C.H. Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1931–32): Volume 1: Theologie und Weltanschauung des Luthertums hauptsächlich im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert [The Theology and World View of Lutheranism Mainly in the 16th and 17th Centuries]: translated by Walter A. Hansen: Werner Elert, The Structure of Lutheranism: The Theology and Philosophy of Life of Lutheranism Especially in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Walter R. Hansen, (St. Louis: CPH, 1962). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; To Luther, it was necessary to write books to counter all the false teachers and errors of the present day, but writing books on Christian teaching came at a price. "But since it became necessary to write books, there is already a great loss, and there is uncertainty as to what is meant."&lt;ref&gt;''WA 10'' I, I, p. 627, taken from ''Morphologie des Luthertums [The Shaping of Lutheranism], (Munich: C.H. Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1931–32): Volume 1: Theologie und Weltanschauung des Luthertums hauptsächlich im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert [The Theology and World View of Lutheranism Mainly in the 16th and 17th Centuries]: translated by Walter A. Hansen: Werner Elert, The Structure of Lutheranism: The Theology and Philosophy of Life of Lutheranism Especially in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Walter R. Hansen, (St. Louis: CPH, 1962). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin Luther taught preaching and lectured upon the [[books of the Bible]] in an exegetical manner. To Luther, St. Paul was the greatest of all [[Systematic theology|systematic theologians]], and his [[Epistle to the Romans]] was the greatest [[Dogmatic theology|dogmatics textbook]] of all time.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt;

Analysis of Luther's works, however, reveals a reliance on scholastic distinctions and modes of argument even after he had dismissed scholasticism entirely. Luther seems to be comfortable with the use of such theological methods so long as the content of theology is normed by scripture, though his direct statements regarding scholastic method are unequivocally negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Trueman|editor1-first=Carl R.|editor1-link=Carl Trueman|editor2-last=Clark|editor2-first=R.

===Loci method===
{{Main|Loci Theologici}}

====Beginning of the loci method====
[[File:Loci-communes.jpg|thumb|''Loci Communes'', 1521 edition]]
{{Main|Loci Communes}}
In contrast, [[Philipp Melanchthon]] scarcely began to lecture on Romans before he decided to formulate and arrange the definitions of the common theological terms of the epistle in his ''[[Loci Communes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For further investigation, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA99 Outlines of Loci Communes] (Google Books) and a selection from the work, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA101 "For What Reasons Should Good Works Be Done?"] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flourishing of the loci method====
[[Martin Chemnitz]], [[Mathias Haffenreffer]], and [[Leonhard Hutter]] simply expanded upon Melanchthon's ''Loci Communes''.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this from Chemnitz, see this [http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/WRHC/On%20Almsgiving.pdf chapter on almsgiving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226003419/http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/WRHC/On%20Almsgiving.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }} from his ''Loci Theologici''.&lt;/ref&gt; With Chemnitz, however, a biblical method prevailed. At Melanchthon's suggestion he undertook a course of self-study. He began by carefully working through the Bible in the original languages while also answering questions that had previously puzzled him. When he felt ready to move on, he turned his attention to reading through the early theologians of the church slowly and carefully. Then he turned to current theological concerns and once again read painstakingly while making copious notes.&lt;ref&gt;''Martin Chemnitii einhändige Lebens-Beschreibung. Nebst denen ihm zu Braunschweig gesetzen Epitaphiis [Martin Chemnitz's Submitted Life-Description {Autobiography}. Together with the Epitaphs Erected to Him in Braunschweig]''. 1719. Translated into English as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fi8bAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA472&amp;vq=%22An+Autobiography+of+Martin+Kemnitz%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 An Autobiography of Martin Chemnitz].'' A.L. Graebner, trans. ''Theological Quarterly'', vol. 3, no. 4 (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; His tendency was to constantly support his arguments with what is now known as [[biblical theology]]. He understood biblical revelation to be progressive—building from the earlier books to the later ones—and examined his supporting texts in their literary contexts and historical settings.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt;

===Analytic method===
Properly speaking, Lutheran scholasticism began in the 17th century, when the theological faculty of [[University of Halle-Wittenberg#History|Wittenberg]] took up the scholastic method to fend off attacks by Jesuit theologians of the [[Second scholasticism|Second Scholastic Period]] of Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Thorluck, A. ''Der Geist der lutherischen Theologen Wittenbergs im Verlaufe des 17. Jahrhunderts'', Hamburg und Gotha, 1852, p. 55. as cited in Preus, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origin of the analytic method====
The philosophical school of [[Neo-Aristotelianism]] began among Roman Catholics, for example, the universities [[University of Padua|Padua]] and [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]]. However, it spread to Germany by the late 16th century, resulting in a distinctly Protestant system of [[metaphysics]] associated with [[Humanism#Back to the sources|humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hägglund, Bengt, ''History of Theology''. trans. Lund, Gene, L. St. Louis: Concordia, 1968. p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] system of metaphysics held that [[Universal (metaphysics)|abstract concepts]] could explain the world in clear, distinct terms. This influenced the character of the [[History of scientific method#Early modern methodologists|scientific method]].&lt;ref name=L200&gt;Hägglund, Bengt, ''History of Theology''. trans. Lund, Gene, L. St. Louis: Concordia, 1968. p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacopo Zabarella]], a [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] from Padua, taught that one could begin with a goal in mind and then explain ways to reach the goal.&lt;ref name=L200/&gt; Although this was a scientific concept that Lutherans did not feel theology had to follow, by the beginning of the 17th century, Lutheran theologian [[Balthasar Mentzer]] attempted to explain theology in the same way. Beginning with God as the goal, he explained the doctrine of man, the nature of theology, and the way man can attain [[Beatific vision|eternal happiness]] with God. This form of presentation, called the [[Analytic method (theology)|analytic method]], replaced the [[Loci Theologici|loci method]] used by Melancthon in his ''Loci Communes''. This method made the presentation of theology more uniform, as each theologian could present Christian teaching as the message of salvation and the way to attain this salvation.&lt;ref name=L301&gt;Hägglund, Bengt, ''History of Theology''. trans. Lund, Gene, L. St. Louis: Concordia, 1968. p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flourishing of the analytic and synthetic methods====
After the time of [[Johann Gerhard]], Lutherans lost their attitude that philosophy was antagonistic to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Gass, W., Geschichte der protestantischen Dogmatik, I, 206ff. as cited in Preus, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutheran dogmaticians used [[syllogism|syllogistic]] arguments and the philosophical terms common in the neo-[[Aristotelianism]] of the time to make fine distinctions and enhance the precision of their theological method.&lt;ref name=RP&gt;Preus, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic Lutheran theologians engaged in a twofold task. First, they collected texts, arranged them, supported them with arguments, and gave rebuttals based on the theologians before them. Second, they completed their process by going back to the pre-Reformation scholastics in order to gather additional material which they assumed the Reformation also accepted. Even though the Lutheran scholastic theologians added their own criticism to the pre-Reformation scholastics, they still had an important influence. Mainly, this practice served to separate their theology from direct interaction with Scripture.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt; However, their theology was still built on Scripture as an authority that needed no external validation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Friedrich August Kahnis|Kahnis, Karl Friedrich August]], Die lutherische Dogmatik, Leipzig, 1874, I, 21. as cited in Preus, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Their scholastic method was intended to serve the purpose of their theology.&lt;ref&gt;Wundt, Maximilian., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6UIAAAAIAAJ Die deutsche Schulmetaphysik des 17. Jahrhunderts]'', Tübingen, 1939, p. 110. as cited in Preus, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dogmaticians preferred to use the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic method]], while others used the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic method]], but all of them allowed Scripture to determine the [[form and content]] of their statements.&lt;ref&gt;Kirn, Otto. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=II8rAAAAYAAJ Grundriss der evangelischen Dogmatik]'', Leipzip, 1905, p. 3ff. as cited in Preus, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abuse of the methods====
Some Lutheran scholastic theologians, for example, [[Johann Gerhard]],&lt;ref&gt;For several selections of Gerhard's theology, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA221 Loci Theologici Book. 1. Prooemium 31] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA224 Loci Theologici Book 1, Locus 2: De Natura Dei, ch. 4, 59.] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; used exegetical theology along with Lutheran scholasticism. However, in Calov, even his exegesis is dominated by his use of the analytic method&lt;ref&gt;Hägglund, Bengt, ''History of Theology''. trans. Lund, Gene, L. St. Louis: Concordia, 1968. p. 301. For examples of Calov's dogmatic method, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=eK9ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;vq=Calov&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 these selections] from Schmid's Dogmatics.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Johann Friedrich König]] and his student [[Johannes Andreas Quenstedt]],&lt;ref&gt;For several selections of Quenstedt's theology, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA221Theologia Didactico-Polemica Part 1, chapter 1, section 2, question 3] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA224 Theologia Didactico-Polemica chapter 4: De Deo, section 2, question 1] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; scholastic Lutheran theology reached its zenith.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt; However the 20th century Lutheran scholar [[Robert Preus]] was of the opinion that König went overboard with the scholastic method by overloading his small book, ''Theologia Positiva Acroamatica'' with Aristotelian distinctions.&lt;ref name=RP/&gt; He noted that the scholastic method was inherently loaded with pitfalls. In particular, dogmaticians sometimes established [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationships without suitable links. When dogmaticians forced [[the mystery of faith|mysteries of the faith]] to fit into a strict cause and effect relationships, they created "serious inconsistencies".&lt;ref name=RP/&gt; In addition, sometimes they drew unneeded or baseless conclusions from the writings of their opponents, which not only was unproductive, but also harmed their own cause more than that of their rivals.&lt;ref name=RP/&gt; Later orthodox dogmaticians tended to have an enormous number of artificial distinctions.&lt;ref name=L301/&gt;

====Merits of the methods====
On the other hand, the Lutheran scholastic method, although often tedious and complicated, managed to largely avoid vagueness and the fallacy of [[equivocation]]. As a result, their writings are understandable and prone to misrepresentation only by those entirely opposed to their theology.&lt;ref name=RP/&gt; The use of scholastic philosophy also made Lutheran orthodoxy more intellectually rigorous. Theological questions could be resolved in a clean cut, even scientific, manner. The use of philosophy gave orthodox Lutheran theologians better tools to pass on their tradition than were otherwise available. It is also worth noting that it was only after Neo-Aristotelian philosophical methods were ended that orthodox Lutheranism came to be criticized as austere, non-Christian formalism.&lt;ref name=L301/&gt;

===Late Orthodoxy (1685–1730)===
[[David Hollatz (dogmatician)|David Hollatz]]&lt;ref&gt;For a selection of Hollatz's theology, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=fYOjvC2T9qIC&amp;pg=PA222 Examen, chapter 1, Prolegomena, question 18.] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; combined [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] and scholastic elements.&lt;ref name=HEJ434/&gt;

===Content===
Scholastic dogmaticians followed the historical order of God's saving acts. First Creation was taught, then the Fall, followed by Redemption, and finished by the Last Things.&lt;ref name=L302&gt;Hägglund, Bengt, ''History of Theology''. trans. Lund, Gene, L. St. Louis: Concordia, 1968. p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; This order, as an independent part of the Lutheran tradition, was not derived from any philosophical method. It was followed not only by those using the loci method, but also those using the analytical.&lt;ref name=L301/&gt; The usual order of the loci:&lt;ref name=L302/&gt;

#Holy Scriptures
#Trinity (including [[Scholastic Lutheran Christology|Christology]] and the doctrine of the Holy Spirit)
#Creation
#Providence
#Predestination
#Image of God
#Fall of Man
#Sin
#Free Will
#Law
#Gospel
#Repentance
#Faith and Justification
#Good Works
#Sacraments

#Three Estates
#Last Things

[[File:Pir Meher Ali.jpg|thumb|Meher Ali Shah in middle age]]
'''Meher Ali Shah''' formally referred to as '''His Holiness, Huzoor Qibla e Aalam Tajdar-e-Golra Ala Hadrat Syedna Pir Meher Ali Shah sahib''',({{lang-ur|پیر مہر على شاه‬‎}}) born 1 Ramadan 1275 A.H., i.e., 14 April 1859 in [[Shrine of Meher Ali Shah|Golra Sharif]], was a Sufi scholar from [[Pakistan]] belonging to the [[Chishti Order|Chishti order]]. He is known as a Hanafi scholar leading the anti-[[Ahmadiyya]] movement. He wrote several books, most notably ''Saif e Chishtiyai'' ("The Sword of the Chishti Order"), a polemical work criticizing the Ahmadiyya movement of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meher e Muneer|pages=203–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mihr-e-munīr: Biography of Ḥaḍrat Syed Pīr Meher Alī Shāh ( in English)|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=7PXXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pir+Meher+Ali&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Muhammad+F%C4%81%E1%B8%8Dil+Kh%C4%81n%22&amp;source=gbs_word_cloud_r&amp;cad=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah was a descendent, on his father Syed Nazr Din Shah's side, of [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]] in the 25th generation, and of [[Muhammad]] through [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan Ibn-e-Ali]] in the 38th generation. On the side of his mother Masuma Mawsufa, he descended from [[Abdul Qadir Gilani|Abdul Qadir Jilani]] in the 24th generation and from [[Muhammad]] through [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussain Ibn-e-Ali]] in the 37th generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family and Ancestry|url=http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/Website/TheLightofGolraSharif/hazrat/family_and_ancestry.htm|publisher=The Light of Golra Sharif}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mihr-e-munīr: Biography of Ḥaḍrat Syed Pīr Meher Alī Shāh ( in English)|publisher=Golra Sharif|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=7PXXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=meher+e+muneer&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=family+and+ancestry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He therefore set out for higher education in different parts of India including Kanpur, Aligarh, and Saharanpur. His stay at Aligarh at the madrasah of Lutfullah of Aligarh was for two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ul Haq Gilani|first1=Ghulam Qutub|title=Early life and Education|url=http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/Website/TheLightofGolraSharif/hazrat/education.htm|website=The Light of Golra Sharif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah was a disciple and Khalifa of Khawaja Shams-ud-din Sialvi of [[Sial Sharif]] in the Silsila-e-Chishtia Nizamiyah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/ www.thelightofgolrasharif.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211233639/http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/ |date=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Pir-mehar-ali-shah.jpg|thumb|Pir Meher Ali Shah with Khawaja Muhammad din Sialvi of Sial Sharif]] His biography, Meher-e-Muneer, records that he was also made a [[Tariqa|khalifa]] by [[Imdadullah Muhajir Makki]], when he visited the latter in [[Mecca]].

== Supporter of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (The Unity of Existence) ==
Shah was a supporter of [[Ibn Arabi]]'s ideology of [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat-ul-Wujood]] but he made a distinction between the creation and the creator (as did Ibn Arabi).&lt;ref&gt;''Mulfuzaat -e- Mehrya'' by Meher Ali Shah&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote explaining the "Unity of Being" doctrine of [[Ibn Arabi]].

Like his comrade [[Qazi Mian Muhammad Amjad]], he was an authority on [[Ibn Arabi]] and his 37-volume work [[Ibn Arabi#Works|The Meccan Illuminations (Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya)]].

In 1933, Shah was absorbed in his meditation and mystic trances. That year the philosopher [[Muhammad Iqbal]] had to give a lecture at Cambridge University on Ibn Arabi's concept of Space and Time. He wrote a letter to the Shah stating that now there was nobody in all of [[Hindustan]] whom he could consult in this matter, and requesting him to tell about Ibn Arabi's work. In this letter Iqbal stated with respect that he knew he was disturbing the Shah's meditations, but as his motive was the service of Islam, therefore he dared to ask him a question. The Shah however, due to his meditation and bad health, could not reply.&lt;ref&gt;"Mehr Muneer" a Biography of Meher Ali shah by Maulana Faiz Ahmed&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In the early part of the month of Safar 1356-A.H (April 1937), he had an attack of cold, which soon developed into typhoid fever, which lasted for several days. His condition grew worse during the last days of Safar. On the morning of 29 Safar (11 May 1937), the pulse became irregular and the body temperature also underwent sudden changes. [[File:Pir meher ali shah sahib.jpg|thumb|Meher ali shah in his last days]]
Just before the arrival of the final irrevocable moment, he pronounced the words “[[Allah]]” from the deepest recesses of his heart in a manner which sent a shudder throughout his body from head to foot, and the reverberation of which was felt by every one who happened to touch the body. The next moment, he repeated the word “Allah” a second time and then turned his head towards the [[Qibla]], thus signaling that the end had finally come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PASSING AWAY OF HAZRAT SYEDNA PIR MEHER ALI SHAH|url=http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/Website/TheLightofGolraSharif/hazrat/passing_away_of_hazrat.htm|website=The Light of Golra Sharif}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mihr-e-munīr|page=296|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=7PXXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mihr+e+munir&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=passing+away+of+hadrat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikhail Sergeyevich Lunin''' (Russian: Михаил Сергеевич Лунин; December 29, 1787 - December 3, 1845 ), also spelt ''Mikhaïl Lounine'', was a Russian political philosopher, revolutionary, Mason, Decembrist, a Lieutenant of the Grodno Life Guards regiment and a participant of the Franco-Russian Patriotic War of 1812.  After a successful career in the military during the [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleonic invasion]], he became involved with multiple liberal Russian secret societies in the early 19th century, including the [[Union of Salvation]] and the [[Union of Welfare]], as well as the Northern Society and the Southern Society.  After the [[Decembrist Revolt]] took place in 1825, he was arrested due to his affiliations with the men responsible, and was subsequently exiled to a [[labor camp]] in [[Siberia]].  Lunin spent time in Finnish jails, three different prisons in Siberia, and lived on a farm under the watchful eye of the government during his life as an exile. Known for keeping good spirits and maintaining a firm defiance of autocratic rule, Lunin was eventually imprisoned again for writing in "opposition" to the Russian government, and lived out the rest of his life in a cell.

== Early life ==
Mikhail was born December 8, 1787, in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.  His father, Sergei Mikhailovich Lunin, was [[Actual Civil Councilor]] to the tsar, the fourth rank in the civil service division of the Russian government, and his mother was Fyeodosiya Mykytychna Lunina née Muravyova, the daughter of a wealthy family.  Fyeodosiya died in 1792 while giving birth to a daughter, leaving Sergei to raise her and his two sons, Mikhail and his brother, Nikita.  To ensure the boys got a proper education, Sergei hired several tutors and governors to come live with the family and train the boys in various subjects.  Due to the fact that these men either were often dismissed for being unsatisfactory or left of their own accord, Mikhail's education was at times uneven and inconsistent.  Even when there was a tutor or governor on hand, Mikhail did not experience much in the way of discipline, as his father was an often-distant figure, in accordance with the norms of the time.  Nevertheless, Mikhail's basic education—history, mathematics, literature, some French and Latin—was befitting of his station, but otherwise not unusual.  The hobbies he cultivated as a young man—dancing, fencing, horseback riding—were similarly suited to his background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin:  Catholic Decembrist|year=1976|publisher=Mouton|location=The Hague|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few details are known about Mikhail's home life as a child and as a young man, but there are some important takeaway points from this early period of his life.  First, Mikhail was a child of opulence and wealth.  The education his father was able to afford him, as well as the kind of home he lived in for several years and its many accouterments (such as servants, sculpted busts of Roman emperors, a music room with a piano, an orangery, and others), all indicate this.  In his impressionable years, Mikhail came to accept this degree of wealth as an expected part of life.  Second, one of the principal tutors in Mikhail's life, Abbé Vouvillier, was not just [[Catholicism|Catholic]], he was a devoted [[Jesuit]].  This likely occurred because, for a period of time, it was common among the Russian elite to hire Jesuit exiles from France following the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] in the 1790s.  Although this practice died out by 1800, Vouvillier had already been hired in 1797.  As would be expected of a Jesuit, he expressly hoped to convert people (like his charge, Mikhail) in Russia to Catholicism while he was there, a desire which Sergei, though aware of it, apparently did not take as any kind of threat, at least initially.  Considering Mikhail became a Catholic later in life, Vouvillier's early influence on him should not be understated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibid|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
Lunin first joined the military in September 1803 in order to defend Russia against Napoleon's invasion.  Because he was such a proficient swordsman and rider, he quickly advanced through the ranks, becoming a [[cornet (military rank)|cornet]] in the winter of 1805-06.  Over the course of his time in the military, Lunin had a tendency to be eccentric and brash, but he was capable nonetheless, demonstrating his bravery and courage on multiple occasions.  In one distinctive incident, his regiment was being held in reserve behind the front lines, but he decided to ride off by himself and fight simply because he did not want to stay idle while a battle was going on.  By 1815, his reputation was such that the imperial family knew him personally and spoke highly of him, anticipating that he would rise even higher in the ranks.  However, due to a combination of events and circumstances—trouble with personal debts and a desire to see more action among them—he wished to transfer to a regiment that was outside the capital.  After Lunin challenged a man of greater influence than he to a duel, though, the subsequent fallout compelled Lunin to retire from the military altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibid|pages=8–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversion to Catholicism ==
At the age of 26 in [[Vilna]]&lt;ref&gt;Barratt,G. R. ''The Catholicism of Mikhail Sergeyevich Lunin'', The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 49, No. 115 (Apr., 1971), pp. 255-271&lt;/ref&gt; Lunin met the French writer, editor and translator [[Hippolyte Auger]], who had joined the Russian army. For Auger, whose name was on the register of homosexuals then maintained by the Paris police,&lt;ref&gt;Registre des pédérastes de la Préfecture de police de Paris. BB4, f° 39.&lt;/ref&gt; it was love at first sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-childs/russias-other-heroes_b_1756392.html|title=Russia's Other Heroes: The Gay Voices of 1812|last=lecturer|first=Kevin Childs Freelance|last2=Culture|first2=Writer on|date=2012-08-09|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-08-17|last3=art|last4=history}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later wrote in his memoirs of Lunin: "the soft look, playful mouth, quick animation, imperturable manner offered, depending on the case, whatever you were looking for".&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires d'Auger (1810-1859'', Paul Cottin, Aux Bureaux de la Revue Rétrospective, 1891, p76&lt;/ref&gt; Lunin wanted to distance himself from his father, and in 1816 he and Auger decided to head to South America to join [[Simón Bolívar|Bolivar]]'s [[Libertadores|Liberadores]]. They only got as far as Paris, where they shared a tiny garret, Lunin engaged in a variety of pursuits, including taking lessons in French, English, algebra, and piano, and penning a novel about [[False Dmitriy I|"False" Dmitri,]] a 17th-century pretender to the Russian throne, who may have been gay. Auger introduced him to [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonians]], theatre acquaintances, and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]].

In 1817, Auger introduced Lunin to Father Fidèle de Grivel, another Jesuit like Vouvillier. It was after becoming acquainted with Grivel as well as an abbé named Thirias—whom Lunin also met as part of the social circle he and Auger entered into while in France—and having many opportunities to speak with them at length, that Lunin became openly Catholic.  This conversion sheds light on his views of both religion and politics.  His opinion of [[Orthodox Christianity]] was that it had become too diminished by the impositions and arbitrariness of man, and that the divine was thus neglected.  [[Protestantism]] subjugated faith to human reason, and he would not consider [[atheism]], so he settled on Catholicism, abjuring Orthodoxy, his religion by birth.  This faith in the [[Catholic Church]], as well as its hierarchy, inspired him in his political thinking such that he believed in the necessity of order and the rule of law.  These beliefs proved instrumental in his later involvement in secret societies plotting to overthrow the tsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibid|pages=21–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Russia ==
After hearing that his father had died, Lunin arrived back in Russia in April, 1817 to take charge of his estate.  Obliged to earn a living, Auger remained in Paris. Lunin quickly found that he had inherited a sizeable amount of debt in addition to various assets, so he began to set about paying it off.  During this process, Lunin completed a draft of his last will and testament, which stated that after his death the [[serfs]] of his estate would be freed and granted a portion of land, which would be increased over time.  The legality of this decision was questionable, but that did not matter to Lunin.  Originally, he intended to leave the estate to his sister, but in a later draft of his will he changed the beneficiary to his younger cousin, Nikolaj Aleksandrovi.  This was because if the estate went to Lunin's sister she would exercise only nominal control over it, while the real power would lie in the hands of her husband and Lunin's brother-in-law, A. F. Uvarov.  This was a problem because Lunin feared that Uvarov would not respect Lunin's wishes and keep the serfs in bondage.  Another significant change in Lunin's second draft of his will was that the serfs would still be freed, but they would not be granted any land.  The explanation for this is uncertain, but it seems to be the case that Lunin underwent some kind of change in attitude toward private property.  However it happened, he had come to feel that individual ownership of land often meant that the land was not used to its full potential, and certainly not to everyone's benefit.  In his eyes, because the land was crucial to Russia's ability to produce agriculture and enforce any kind of stability via a government, it was imperative that all land either be fully owned or partly owned by the government so that peasants would not be able to take advantage of each other depending on who had land and who did not.  This attitude, extended to the noble classes in Russia, constituted a definite threat to the status quo of the Russian state, and was a kind of signal for his future activity in societies whose goal it was to fundamentally transform the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibid|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Masons ==
Another important influence in Lunin's early life was the [[Freemasonry|Masons]].  At the time when he was a young man, they were more prominent in Saint Petersburg than they had ever been, even to the point where royal family members were joining lodges.  In general, lodges were distinct from other spheres of society because they allowed freedom of expression and often adhered to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] idealization of the power of human reason to enact continuous progress, a notable contrast to the spirit of autocracy that otherwise pervaded Russia.  Lunin first joined a lodge in 1817, Loge des Trois Vertus, which translates roughly to “Lodge of Three Virtues.”  It is significant that the lodge he joined was more French or English in its style as opposed to, say, German, for lodges in the latter tradition were more likely to engage in mysticism, whereas the former tended to engage more with practical issues relating to the economy and, after 1815, politics on some occasions.  Furthermore, the Lodge of Three Virtues just happened to be the most politically oriented in all of Russia.  Its members’ understanding of the Masonic creed, according to their own time and context, dictated that the equality of mankind was paramount and that this fact should be successfully disseminated throughout the world as much as possible.  It stood to reason that if this were the case, then such autocratic governments as that of Russia ought to be changed.

As a member of the “Lodge of Three Virtues”, Lunin was naturally sympathetic to these ideals, but he soon realized that there was little chance of any concrete action ever being taken to actually realize them.  In addition, he began to feel torn between his membership in the Masons and his ties to the Catholic Church.  Both organizations were distrustful of each other, with the Masons even accusing the Church of corruption.  Ultimately, his loyalty to Catholicism prevailed and he left the Masons altogether.  Lunin soon found other groups, though, secret societies that shared his desire for action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibid|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement With Secret Societies ==
Lunin was partly responsible for the creation of the first Decembrist society, the “Union of True and Faithful Sons of the Fatherland.”  However, his decision to depart for France in the fall of that year meant that he was absent from the group's deliberations for as long as he was out of the country, although he was still connected to it and others, like the Union of Salvation.  This came back to haunt him after the actual Decembrist Revolt took place and many people were arrested, in that he was later questioned about his knowledge of various groups’ stated plans and goals. The group's stated goals of transitioning Russia into a constitutional monarchy, abolishing serfdom and reducing the influence of foreigners in the government probably would have been alone enough to alarm the government, but some members went even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulam|first=Adam|title=Russia's Failed Revolutions:  From the Decembrists to the Dissidents|year=1981|publisher=Basic Books, Inc.|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, F. P. Šaxovskoj of the Union of Salvation suggested that the group should attempt to assassinate the tsar, an idea that Lunin was accused of initially endorsing and then subsequently supporting.  Lunin, for his part, insisted that he had known nothing of this proposal prior to arriving in Moscow.  Conversely, he was also suspected of collaborating with the Union of Salvation (later the Union of Welfare) because of his presence in Moscow, not his absence.  With regard to Lunin's support for assassinating the tsar, though, the record of his attendance and participation in a particular meeting seem to indicate this was not the case.  During the discussion of a paper on the merits of monarchic and republican governments, Lunin actually voiced his support for a limited monarchy and claimed that a Russian republic would be undesirable, thereby voicing tacit, if qualified, support for the tsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt 1976|pages=44–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is still the case that Lunin maintained ties with various secret political groups for a number of years—albeit not always the same ones—even when, at times, he professed not to.  This was particularly in evidence when he rejoined the army and was posted in [[Poland]].  At the time, there was a portion of Poland that desired greater autonomy in handling its own affairs, which was embodied in the Polish Secret Patriotic Society.  Because it and another Russian group, the Southern Society, had some goals in common—namely the tsar's ouster—they established a kind of liaison, with Lunin—at one time a member of the latter group—acting as a kind of go-between.  In summary, he remained connected to different societies, but his actual participation was often not what it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibid|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (In the case of the Southern Society, this might have been because its members were too radical for Lunin's taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raeff|first=Marc|title=The Decembrist Movement|year=1966|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=New Jersey|pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; )  
   
There seem to have been multiple reasons for Lunin's decreased activity in the groups. One is that he grew tired of the societies’ inability to come to an agreement on what should be done and take decisive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trigos|first=Ludmilla A.|title=The Decembrist Myth in Russian Culture|year=2009|publisher=St. Martin's Press LLC|location=New York|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He may also have come to doubt the possibility of successful, meaningful change taking place without the active participation and outcry of Russia's millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eidelman|first=N.|title=Conspiracy Against the Tsar:  A Portrait of the Decembrists|year=1985|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever the case, even though some of Lunin's connections were perhaps not particularly strong as time went on, taken together they were sufficient evidence for the imperial court to find him guilty and sentence him to exile in Siberia.  All this occurred, however, only after the actual Decembrist Revolt took place.

== Arrest and Trial ==
Lunin was not personally involved in the uprising at [[Senate Square (Saint Petersburg)|Senate Square]] in Saint Petersburg.  Furthermore, he was not immediately arrested even after his involvement with such groups as the Union of Salvation, the Union of Welfare and the Northern and Southern Society was verified.  Apparently, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]] preferred to let Lunin incriminate himself—or let his captured associates testify against him and bring decisive evidence that would allow the tsar to arrest him without pause.  However, [[Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich]], the brother of Tsar Nicholas and the man whom Lunin had been serving as an aide-de-camp, was equally determined that Lunin should not be arrested or implicated in any manner.  He defended Lunin in multiple letters to the tsar, but Nicholas continued to move forward by questioning those who had already been arrested about Lunin's involvement in the various societies.  What he was really after was decisive evidence against Lunin that not even the Grand Duke would be able to rationalize or explain away.  Nicholas got his wish after extensive interrogation of [[Pavel Pestel]], a man whom Lunin had become acquainted with through multiple societies over the years, compelled the prisoner to confess—perhaps inaccurately, as the interrogation methods of the Russian government were geared more toward confessions than the truth—that Lunin had himself suggested a particular plot in 1816 to assassinate [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]].  With his decisive evidence in hand, Nicholas had Lunin arrested on April 9, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt 1976|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that Nicholas had found his pretense to have Lunin arrested in the first place, the case against him was still not very strong.  There was no proof that he had joined the army in Poland with any ulterior motive in mind, and the ties he had with the different societies were either relatively weak or had been broken altogether, as with the Northern Society.  The court felt it could only find Lunin guilty if it were established that he himself had at some point suggested assassinating Tsar Alexander or at least attended meetings wherein such a suggestion was made.  Nikita Murav’ev, another of Lunin's imprisoned associates, finally made an admission to this effect after undergoing a great deal of pressure and advanced interrogational tactics.  Encouraged by this, the court brought Lunin in for direct questioning in the hope that he would confess, but he consistently denied that he had ever suggested or plotted the death of Alexander, or been part of a similar plan originated by anyone else.  Besides, as Lunin pointed out, Russian plots against the life of the tsar were hardly a novelty in the country's history, and in fact had been justified as replacing someone incompetent with a more capable ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Just Assassins:  The Culture of Terrorism in Russia|year=2010|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Illinois|page=26|editor=Anthony Anemone}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Regardless of whether Lunin actually endorsed or was involved with a plan to assassinate the tsar, it does seem to be the case that he had supported Grand Duke Konstantin for tsar instead of Nicholas, provided that the former lived up to his professed liberal views and enacted genuine reforms once in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gentes|first=Andrew A.|title=Exile, Murder and Madness in Siberia, 1823-61|year=2010|publisher=St. Martin's Press LLC|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the end, the court found him innocent of advocating regicide, but thanks to his connections to various societies and his alleged association with a regicidal plot by Pestel, he was found guilty under the categories of sympathizing with or proposing revolt as well as spreading propaganda and causing sedition or agitation.  He was originally sentenced to lose all his constitutional rights as a person and be permanently exiled to a location to be determined, but this was commuted to twenty years of hard labor ''followed by'' exile to a distant location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt 1976|pages=66–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to eyewitness accounts, Lunin was surprisingly sanguine upon hearing the verdict, perhaps fitting for a man of his religious conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Robert|title=The Fortress|year=1967|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing chapter of Lunin's pre-exile life again raised the issue of what was to be done with his assets.  Since nothing he owned would be his any longer, all of his possessions—as well as the debts he still had incurred—had to be dealt with accordingly.  An auction was held to sell off enough of his former goods to pay the debt off.  His will still dictated that his cousin, Nikolaj Aleksandrovi?, receive the estate and the serfs that came with it, but his sister Uvarova, despite having been previously disinherited in 1819, contested this.  The Supreme Court in Saint Petersburg initially ruled in favor of Nikolaj, but Uvarova continued to fight, prolonging the battle for a number of months, to the point where it became a public issue of sorts.  In December 1827, the Minister of Justice decided that Lunin, having no other heirs, was entitled to name whomever he wished as his beneficiary.  However, he also ruled that the serfs could not be freed, as doing so would be illegal.  About a month later, though, the case was reopened again after it emerged that Uvarova's position had not been adequately explained.  As it turned out, the Minister of Justice reversed his previous decision, granting Lunin's estates and goods to her.  None of this made any impact on Lunin, however, for he was already miles away, en route to his future as a prisoner in a labor camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt 1976|pages=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exile to Siberia ==

Nicholas I and his government planned to send the Decembrist exiles to two camps in eastern Siberia: Chita and Petrovskij Zavod, both in relative proximity to the Nercinck Mines. Neither Chita nor Petrovskij Zavod were prepared to take over a hundred prisoners right away, so it was decided that the prisoners should be kept in Finland until further arrangements could be made. Lunin and seven other Decembrists were taken to a Swedish-built stone fortress known as [[Sveaborg Fortress]], on Longgern Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the exiled Decembrists made their way eastward across Siberia, the local people along the way met them with sympathy and good nature. A man is recorded to have approached the exiles in a town called Kostrama saying, “Gentlemen, be brave, you are suffering for the most beautiful, the most noble cause. Even in Siberia you will find sympathy.” Respect for the Decembrist failed cause came mostly from the upper echelons of society. Most of the people living in Siberia knew little of who the exiles were, or were under the impression that they were simply military officers who had refused to acknowledge the new czar. However, whatever they believed about the Decembrists, the attitude across the board of the Siberians was one friendly acceptance, and many of the exiles received much needed care from the locals during hard times.

Nicholas I seems to have been obsessed unnecessarily with the Decembrists. This can be seen in the way he often oversaw their treatment and punishment personally. For example, many have wondered at the way the Decembrists were kept together in groups, when isolating them from their comrades would have done far more to break their spirits and crush their belief in the ideals of their cause. Even though most of Russia had little or know understanding of the Decembrist Revolution, Nicholas was paranoid of a “general uprising in eastern Siberia,” and followed his generals’ advice that guarding the exiles in groups would be more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as he felt he could, however, Nicholas did attempt to break the spirits of his exiles, ordering the separation of Lunin and close companion Nikita Murav'ev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunin remained at Sveaborg Fortress for a little over half a year, but the government never fully approved of the prisoner situation there. Steps had been taken to improve the security of the fortress, but the government remained unsure, and was displeased with the conversation and socializing between prisoners afforded by the construction of the prison cells. Thus the prisoners at Sveaborg were transported to various other prisons. Lunin and two others were sent to [[Vyborg Castle]]. Prison conditions at Vyborg were rough, and the cells had suffered a good deal from major floods a few years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently water continually seeped through cell walls and kept everything damp. The other two exiles fell sick with caries, but Lunin maintained a characteristically strong physical and mental disposition. He replied famously to a question of whether he had all he needed with “I am quite satisfied with everything. I lack only an umbrella.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eighteen in Vyborg, Lunin and three other exiles were escorted eastwards through Irkutsk to Chita, which contained the largest group of Decembrist exiles in Siberia at the time. The guards pressed as rapidly as possible on the journey, which was hard on the prisoners, and at times very dangerous. One of the exiles, Mixail Bestuzev, was nearly killed in a coach accident in which he was thrown off the coach sliding down a steep bank. His chains were caught in the coach, and Bestuzev was dragged a good distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chita ==

Lunin arrived in Chita at the end of June in 1828, two years after he had been sentenced there. Three hundred kilometers southeast of [[Lake Baikal]], Chita sat in a beautiful valley at the junction of two rivers (the Chita and the Ingoda). Many of the Decembrists who spent time there spoke of the natural beauty of the area, writing of its varied plant species, the vibrant colors, stunning views, “golden pastures and fragrant meadows,” and calling it the “Garden of Siberia.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, as they had found during much of their journey through Siberia, the local people living in Chita were amiable and hospitable towards the exiles, and in several cases gave excellent care to sick Decembrists, as can be seen by the way Decembrists often left something for a local family in their will. The general in overseeing the exiled Decembrists also tended to be humane in his treatment of the prisoners, a quality by no means over common in prison leadership at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all these things, however, life was still hard on Decembrists. Many struggled to recover from exhaustion or illness from their journey east, and many, Lunin included, struggled especially in the beginning to stretch the meager allowance from the government to cover all their basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to physical stress, the Decembrists also had to deal with the doubts as to the validity of their cause, and many wrestled with whether it was worth all their pain and heartache in exile. Lunin, however, “was not daunted, and remained cheerful,” if rather withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Chita, Lunin kept largely to himself, spending the vast majority of his time alone in his room, in the little chapel he had set up. Though quite the recluse, Lunin still managed to remain on pleasant terms with his fellow exiles and with the local people. He attended the lectures hosted by the Decembrists in the evenings (the Decembrists concerned themselves with educating and refining the cultural tastes of the local people around them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mazour|first=Anatole G.|title=Women in Exile: Wives of the Decembrists|year=1975|publisher=The Diplomatic Press|location=Tallahassee|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), occasionally played guitar for an evening of music with the other exiles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutherland|first=Christine|title=The Princess of Siberia|year=2001|publisher=Quartet Books Limited|location=London|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  worked extensively on an escape plan (first for everyone, then for himself), and whenever he was in contact with people, he struck those around him with his clever wit and cheerful spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the exiled Decembrists began to crack under the stress of living in Chita, and wrote to the czar requesting pardon, asking that they be allowed to serve as privates in the Russian army, which was at the time engaged in fighting in the Caucasus. For example, Alexander Bestuzhev wrote:

:To the noble soul trained in battles are understandable the sufferings of a military man destined to rot in idleness, when the glory of the Russian arms thunders over the cradle of the ancient world, over the grave of Mohammed. Asking you this grace, I do not seek advantages nor distinction: I only seek an opportunity to shed my blood for the glory of the Sovereign and honorably end the life granted to me, in order that after it the name criminal shall not be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mazour|first=Anatole G.|title=The First Russian Revolution|year=1937|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunin responded to the plea of his fellows in a letter with characteristic disdain for those who cheapened themselves by abandoning so noble a cause as theirs, writing:

:I hear that some of our political exiles have expressed their desire to serve as privates in the Caucasian army, hoping to make peace with the government. In my opinion it is unwise for them to do so before subjecting themselves to some slight scrutiny. The first day one should request that he be flogged fifty times, the second day a hundred, and the third day two hundred times, so that altogether it would make three hundred and fifty times. After such a scrutiny one could proclaim: dignus, dignus est intrare in isto doctor corpore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mazour|first=Anatole G.|title=The First Russian Revolution|year=1937|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
Twenty-six months after his arrival, when the barracks at Petrosvskij Zavod had been built to hold all of the Decembrists at Chita (as well as a group of Polish exiles), Lunin and the rest of the Decembrists at Chita were forced to make the seven hundred verst journey westward to their new home. Lunin hired a covered wagon with the money his sister had been so careful to keep him provided with, which eased somewhat the strain of the journey and gave him the privacy he so cherished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he spent so much of his time inside his carriage during the journey, the Siberian guides (of the [[Buryats|Buriat]] tribe) believed that he must be the most important criminal. At one point the a crowd of Buriats surrounded his carriage and they asked to know why he was being exiled. Lunin explained that he had tried to cut the “Great Khan’s” (Tsar Nicholas I) throat, and was thus being exiled, which greatly impressed the Buriats gathered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutherland|first=Christine|title=The Princess of Siberia|year=2001|publisher=Quartet Books Limited|location=London|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petrosvskij Zavod ==

In Petrosvskij Zavod, Lunin began slowly to flex his powerful mind once again. Whatever religious texts he could get his hands on, he read avidly. Because he had decided to restrict himself from non-religious texts, he didn’t read them to himself. Instead, still hungry for news of the world and of politics, he had others read for him and share with him what the books and papers said. Lunin, while not completely abandoning his reserved and secluded way of life, used his time at Petrosvskij Zavod to think and to explore and to glean everything he could from the people around him. The prison (for unlike Chita, which was merely a fortified “strongpoint,” Petrosvskij Zavod was a real prison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=Voices in Exile|year=1974|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) contained men from a wide range of backgrounds, and Lunin pressed many of them for information on a wide range of subjects, from thoughts about Russia's political future to information about Poland and the Americas. Spending more time with his fellow prisoners, he established yet again his reputation for being a unique, quirky, and yet pleasant man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron A.E. Rozen, a fellow exile, wrote of him later:

:M.S. Lunin lived in the most curious manner. He lived in No. 1, a totally dark cell in which no window had been pierced – a guard-room being built beside it. He did not share our common table, and kept his fasts after the custom of the Roman Church, which he had joined some years before when in Warsaw. One third of his cell was shut off by a curtain behind which, elevated on some steps, was a large crucifix blessed by the Pope, which his sister had sent him from Rome. All day long, loud Latin prayers would be audible in his cell…when he strolled among us he was invariably witty and agreeable. Whenever we called on him in his ell we always found him ready to converse in a secular and often jocular strain. He was greatly provoked by Victor Hugo’s Notre Dame de Paris, I recall, which penetrated even our wilds and was read avidly; he had the patience to burn the whole book with a candle…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:

== Urik ==

In the middle of June 1835, Lunin arrived in [[Urik (rural locality)|Urik]], a small town close to [[Irkutsk]]. His sentence to twenty years hard labor had been shortened to just under ten, and he had been sent along with several other Decembrists to live an work on a plot of land provided by the government. Lunin proved himself to be very industrious, building his house quickly and carefully, clearing the land around it, draining the bogs and creating a pretty little garden complete with smooth pathways, flowers, garden vegetables, and a summerhouse. He also grew corn fairly successfully. In addition to his manual labor, Lunin also continued to stretch himself intellectually. He stuck to his intense habit of spending time in prayer and study of the Bible, and also began building a library for himself with the help of his friend Nikita Murav’ev and his sister Urarova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here in Urik, Lunin received permission to write letters to family and friends, marking the beginning of a series of letters that he wrote in name to his sister Urarova, but in intent he was actually writing to the world at large. He told his sister, “I rejoice that my letters…engage you. They serve as an expression of those convictions for which I was led to the place of execution, to a cell, and to exile. The publicity enjoyed by my letters through their numerous copies turns them into a political weapon” “which I must use for the defense of freedom.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mazour|first=Anatole G.|title=The First Russian Revolution|year=1937|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these letters, Lunin addressed everything from his own personal story as a political exile to the pressing need for the emancipation of the serfs.

== Exile to Akatui and Death ==

Lunin admitted frankly that his design in writing his contentious letters was in part “to tease the white bear,” so it was only a matter of time before the authorities became upset and put a stop to his letters.25 In September 1838 Lunin had lost his letter writing privileges for a year after repeated instances of material deemed inappropriate by the government. Once this year ban was lifted, Lunin continued to write not merely in the same manner as he had before, but this time in an even more blatantly taunting manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hope in affecting change for Russia even as an exile living in Siberia is echoed in his words, “From the sighs of those living under thatched roofs storms are born which destroy palaces.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mazour|first=Anatole G.|title=The First Russian Revolution|year=1937|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841 the authorities over Lunin discovered a manuscript of his “A Glance at Russian Secret Societies from 1816 to 1826,” which infuriated Tsar Nicholas I. Not surprisingly, for it contained such statements as the following describing the Decemberists: “They are stripped of everything: their social status, their property, their health, their homeland, their liberty…But no one can rob them of popular sympathy towards them…The Russian mind may, for a while, be led astray, but Russian popular sentiment is not to be deceived.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lunin|first=M.S.|title=The First Breath of Freedom|year=1988|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the government retaliated by ordering copies of the article be collected immediately and sent back to St. Petersburg. Lunin was arrested in at home in Urik and his house was thoroughly searched. Lunin dodged questions in his interrogations to protect his friends by claiming he could only answer adequately in French, which the officers in charge of the arrest did not understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunin was sentenced to isolated imprisonment at the [[Akatui]] mine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; an area where it was said that even birds could not live because of the contamination in the air from the mines. Needless to say the conditions in the prison were severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mazour|first=Anatole G.|title=The First Russian Revolution|year=1937|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunin was kept in a cell with “water oozing from the walls” and high temperatures. Outbreaks of disease were common in such a climate, and the food was for the most part just bread and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunin's words sum up his Akatui experience: “the architect who built the prison of Akatui must have inherited Dante’s imagination.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zetlin|first=Mikhail|title=The Decembrists|year=1958|publisher=International Universities Press|location=New York|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all hardship he endured, Lunin managed to maintain a relatively happy disposition. He maintained his habits of prayer and was visited by a Catholic priest from time to time. Once again, he demonstrated a natural way with people: the other prisoners accepted him well, and though their contact with each other was minimal, Lunin attempted to intervene for fellow prisoners on several occasions, either for more humane treatment or for better medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zetlin|first=Mikhail|title=The Decembrists|year=1958|publisher=International Universities Press|location=New York|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister Uvarova pleaded in every way she could that Lunin be released or transferred to a more healthy environment, but to no avail. Lunin died after four years of imprisonment at Akatui, and the exact circumstances of his death remained unclear. Some believe he died at the hands of an angry prison guard, some from charcoal poisoning, and others that he died in his sleep from a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barratt|first=Glynn|title=M.S. Lunin: Catholic Reformer|year=1976|publisher=Mouton and Co.|location=The Hague|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mind Body Spirit Festival ''' is a [[festival]] that first took place at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Exhibition Centre in [[London]] in 1977. It was founded by Graham Wilson. The theme was the relationship between [[religion]], the [[paranormal]], [[spirituality]], [[Naturopathy | natural healing]], [[consciousness]] and personal growth with the aim of making these ideas more accessible to everyone. Now under the stewardship of Melvyn Carlile the show is now relocated in Olympia for 2019 and continues to grow year on year.

Today thousands of visitors from the UK and abroad attend the celebrations in London, attracted by an eclectic mix of musicians, international workshop leaders, best-selling authors, artists and cutting edge exhibitors

The Mind Body Spirit Festival was subsequently presented in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[San Francisco]], [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and in most major cities, often using the Mind Body Spirit name and following the successful formula of exhibitors, leading authors and authorities giving lectures and workshops, as well as a mix of [[ music]] and performances.

Over 41 years later, the Festival now incorporates The London Wellbeing festival and continues as an annual event in London, currently housed at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]], The Festival recently announced a second festival at the NEC Birmingham to take place in November.
Exhibitors include the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotees, Neals Yard, , [[Buddhist]] groups, [[Astrologers]], [[Tarot]] readers, [[vegetarian]]s, [[vegan]]s, [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] groups, the [[Anthroposophical Society]], [[Yoga]] practitioners [[Wellbeing]] and many others .

His work includes novels, plays, short stories, and essays, ranging from literary and social criticism to children's literature. He is the founder and editor of the Gikuyu-language journal ''[[Mũtĩiri]]''.

In 1977, Ngũgĩ embarked upon a novel form of [[theatre]] in his native Kenya that sought to liberate the theatrical process from what he held to be "the general bourgeois education system", by encouraging spontaneity and audience participation in the performances.&lt;ref name=dec&gt;Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, ''Decolonising the mind: the politics of language in African literature'', 1994, pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; His project sought to "demystify" the theatrical process, and to avoid the "process of alienation [that] produces a gallery of active stars and an undifferentiated mass of grateful admirers" which, according to Ngũgĩ, encourages passivity in "ordinary people".&lt;ref name=dec /&gt; Although ''[[Ngaahika Ndeenda]]'' was a commercial success, it was shut down by the authoritarian Kenyan regime six weeks after its opening.&lt;ref name=dec /&gt;

Ngũgĩ was subsequently imprisoned for over a year. Adopted as an [[Amnesty International]] [[prisoner of conscience]], the artist was released from prison, and fled Kenya.&lt;ref name="Padmore Institute"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org/collection/committee-release-political-prisoners-kenya | title=Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners in Kenya Collection: 1975-1998 | publisher=[[George Padmore Institute]] | accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, he taught at [[Yale University]] for some years, and has since also taught at [[New York University]], with a dual professorship in [[Comparative Literature]] and [[Performance Studies]], and at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. Ngũgĩ has frequently been regarded as a likely candidate for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan Mwangi, [http://allafrica.com/stories/201011090252.html "Despite the Criticism, Ngugi is 'Still Best Writer'"].

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
Ngũgĩ was born in [[Kamiriithu]], near [[Limuru]] in [[Kiambu|Kiambu district]], [[Kenya]], of [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] descent, and baptised '''James Ngugi'''. His family was caught up in the [[Mau Mau War]]; his half-brother Mwangi was actively involved in the [[Kenya Land and Freedom Army]], and his mother was tortured at Kamiriithu homeguard post.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Brendon. ''Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, gender, and the ethics of postcolonial reading'', 2010, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He went to The [[Alliance High School (Kenya)|Alliance High School]], and went on to study at [[Makerere University]] College in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]]. As a student he attended the [[African Writers Conference]] held at Makerere in June 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.90.mak.ac.ug/timeline/first-makerere-african-writers-conference-1962 | title=The First Makerere African Writers Conference 1962 |publisher= [[Makerere University]] | accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chimurengachronic.co.za/penpoints-gunpoints-and-dreams/ |title=Penpoints, Gunpoints, and Dreams: A history of creative writing instruction in East Africa |author=[[Billy Kahora|Kahora, Billy]]| work=[[Chimurenga Chronic]] |publisher= Chimurenga Who No Know Go Know| date= April 18, 2017 | accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PM&gt;Frederick Philander, [https://www.newera.com.na/2008/04/18/namibian-literatureat-the-cross-roads/ "Namibian Literature at the Cross Roads"], ''New Era'', 18 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gates, [https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2017/10/27/african-writers-readers-historians-gather-in-london/ "African Writers, Readers, Historians Gather In London"], ''[[PM News]]'', 27 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and his play ''The Black Hermit'' premiered as part of the event.&lt;ref&gt;John Roger Kurtz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Mdei1-NHu0C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=african+writers+conference+1962&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lmWSq8SkFZ&amp;sig=qg6LHvCBALf_wFVYAQtRzpYbvZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A2S9UqLcGNOBhAfO4YGoDA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=african%20writers%20conference%201962&amp;f=false ''Urban Obsessions, Urban Fears: The Postcolonial Kenyan Novel''], Africa World Press, 1998, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference Ngũgĩ asked [[Chinua Achebe]] to read the manuscripts of his novels ''The River Between'' and ''Weep Not, Child'', which would subsequently be published in Heinemann's [[African Writers Series]], launched in London that year, with Achebe as its first advisory editor.&lt;ref name=Currey&gt;James Currey, [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/ngugi-leeds-and-the-establishment-of-african-literature-james-currey/ "Ngũgĩ, Leeds and the Establishment of African Literature"], in ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'' 74 (December 2012), pp. 48–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Ngũgĩ received his B.A. in English from Makerere University College in 1963.

===First publications and studies in England===
His debut novel, ''[[Weep Not, Child]]'', was published in May 1964, becoming the first novel in English to be published by a writer from East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Hans M. Zell, Carol Bundy, Virginia Coulon, ''A New Reader's Guide to African Literature'', Heinemann Educational Books, 1983, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Currey /&gt;

Later that year, having won a scholarship to the [[University of Leeds]] to study for an MA, Ngũgĩ travelled to England, where he was when his second novel, ''[[The River Between]]'', came out in 1965.&lt;ref name=Currey /&gt; ''The River Between'', which has as its background the [[Mau Mau rebellion]], and described an unhappy romance between Christians and non-Christians, is currently on Kenya's national secondary school syllabus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200804011177.html |accessdate=5 December 2009 |title=Kenya: Publishers Losing Millions to Pirates |author=Wachira, Muchemi |work=The Daily Nation |date=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200711260298.html |accessdate=14 January 2010 |title=Kenya: Ngugi Book Causes Rift Between Publishers |author=Ngunjiri, Joseph |work=The Daily Nation |date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Ngugi Wa Thiong'o Man of Letters |url=https://issuu.com/www.its.leeds.ac.uk/docs/uol_alumni_magazine_issue_12_feb_2013 |pages=22&amp;ndash;23 |magazine=Leeds: Magazine for alumni of the University of Leeds UK |location=Leeds |publisher=University of Leeds |date=15 February 2013|issue=12, Winter 2012/13|access-date=22 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Leeds without completing his thesis on Caribbean literature,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9Nh5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6&amp;lpg=PT6&amp;dq=ngugi+MA+leeds+university&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NynsH9F5Sa&amp;sig=MDgbt4whkaCh4lfV1fFwYjCU5G0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1zNTM05bXAhWKKlAKHZTZBOMQ6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=ngugi%20MA%20leeds%20university&amp;f=false "Author Biography"], in ''A Study Guide for Ngugi wa Thiong'o's "Petals of Blood"'', Gale, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; for which his studies had focused on [[George Lamming]], about whom Ngũgĩ said in his 1972 collection of essays ''Homecoming'': "He evoked for me, an unforgettable picture of a peasant revolt in a white-dominated world. And suddenly I knew that a novel could be made to speak to me, could, with a compelling urgency, touch cords deep down in me. His world was not as strange to me as that of [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Dickens]], [[D. H. Lawrence]]."&lt;ref name=Currey /&gt;

===Change of name and imprisonment===
Ngũgĩ's 1967 novel ''[[A Grain of Wheat]]'' marked his embrace of [[Frantz Fanon|Fanonist]] [[Marxism]]. He subsequently renounced English, Christianity, and the name James Ngugi as [[colonialism|colonialist]]; he changed his name to '''Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o''', and began to write in his native Gikuyu and [[Swahili language|Swahili]].

In 1976 he helped set up The [[Kamiriithu Community Education and Cultural Centre]] which, among other things, organised African Theatre in the area. The uncensored political message of his 1977 play ''[[Ngaahika Ndeenda]]'' (''I Will Marry When I Want'') provoked the then Kenyan Vice-President [[Daniel arap Moi]] to order his arrest. While detained in the [[Kamiti Maximum Security Prison]], Ngũgĩ wrote the first modern novel in Gikuyu, ''Caitaani mũtharaba-Inĩ'' (''Devil on the Cross''), on prison-issued toilet paper.

After his release in December 1978,&lt;ref name=About /&gt; he was not reinstated to his job as professor at [[Nairobi University]], and his family was harassed. Due to his writing about the injustices of the dictatorial government at the time, Ngugi and his family were forced to live in exile. Only after Arap Moi was voted out of office, 22 years later, was it safe for them to return.

===Exile===
While in exile, Ngugi worked with the London-based Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners in Kenya (1982–98).&lt;ref name=About&gt;[http://ngugiwathiongo.com/about/ "About"], Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Padmore Institute" /&gt; In 1984 he was Visiting Professor at [[Bayreuth University]], and the following year was Writer-in-Residence for the [[Borough of Islington]] in London.&lt;ref name=About /&gt; He also studied film at [[Dramatiska Institutet]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] (1986).&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

His later works include ''Detained'', his prison diary (1981), ''[[Decolonising the Mind|Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature]]'' (1986), an essay arguing for African writers' expression in their native languages rather than European languages, in order to renounce lingering colonial ties and to build an authentic African literature, and ''Matigari'' (1987), one of his most famous works, a satire based on a Gikuyu folktale.

Ngũgĩ was Visiting Professor of English and Comparative Literature at [[Yale University]] between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name=About /&gt; In 1992, he became a professor of Comparative Literature and Performance Studies at [[New York University]], where he held the [[Erich Maria Remarque]] Chair. He is currently a Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature as well as the Director of the International Center for Writing and Translation at the [[University of California, Irvine]].

===2008–present===
On 8 August 2004, Ngũgĩ returned to Kenya as part of a month-long tour of East Africa.  On 11 August, robbers broke into his high-security apartment: they assaulted Ngũgĩ, sexually assaulted his wife and stole various items of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Outsider: an interview with Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=26 January 2006 |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,,1696522,00.html |location=London |first=Maya |last=Jaggi |authorlink=Maya Jaggi| accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Ngũgĩ has returned to America, and in the summer 2006 the American publishing firm [[Random House]] published his first new novel in nearly two decades, ''[[Wizard of the Crow]]'', translated to English from Gikuyu by the author.

On 10 November 2006, while in [[San Francisco]] at Hotel Vitale at the [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]], Ngũgĩ was harassed and ordered to leave the hotel by an employee. The event led to a public outcry and angered both African-Americans and members of the African diaspora living in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Incident at Hotel Vitale, San Francisco, California, Friday, November 10, 2006 | publisher=Africa Resource | date=10 November 2006 | url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting an apology by the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Hotel Responds to the Racist Treatment of Professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o | publisher=Africa Resource |date=10 November 2006 |url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=181:the-hotel-responds-to-the-racist-treatment-of-professor-ngugi-wa-thiongo&amp;catid=136:race&amp;Itemid=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent books are ''Something Torn and New: An African Renaissance'', a collection of essays published in 2009 making the argument for the crucial role of African languages in "the resurrection of African memory", about which ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said: "Ngugi’s language is fresh; the questions he raises are profound, the argument he makes is clear: 'To starve or kill a language is to starve and kill a people’s memory bank.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-465-00946-6 "Something Torn and New: An African Renaissance"] (review), ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', 26 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two well received autobiographical works: ''Dreams in a Time of War: a Childhood Memoir'' (2010)&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Busby|Busby, Margaret]], [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/dreams-in-a-time-of-war-by-ngugi-wa-thiongo-1927475.html "Dreams in a Time of War, By Ngugi wa Thiong'o"] (review), ''[[The Independent]]'', 26 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaggi, Maya]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/03/dreams-war-ngugi-wa-thiongo "Dreams in a Time of War by Ngugi wa Thiong'o"] (review), ''The Guardian'', 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Tom, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7619779/Dreams-in-a-Time-of-War-a-Childhood-Memoir-by-Ngugi-wa-Thiongo-review.html "Dreams in a Time of War: a Childhood Memoir by Ngugi wa Thiong’o: review"], ''The Telegraph'', 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arana, Marie, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/09/AR2010030903425.html "Marie Arana reviews 'Dreams in a Time of War' by Ngugi wa Thiong'o"], ''Washington Post'', 10 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/kenya/ngugi3.htm ''Dreams in a Time of War''] at ''[[The Complete Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''In the House of the Interpreter: A Memoir'' (2012), which was described as "brilliant and essential" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Tobar, Hector, [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/16/entertainment/la-ca-jc-ngugi-wathiongo-20121118 "Ngugi wa Thiong'o soars 'In the House of the Interpreter'"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; among other positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Margaret, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/in-the-house-of-the-interpreter-a-memoir-by-ngugi-wa-thiongo-8368336.html "In the House of the Interpreter: A Memoir, By Ngugi wa Thiong'o"] (review), ''The Independent'', 1 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ngugi-wa-thiongo/in-house-of-interpreter/ "In the House of the Interpreter"] review, ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', 29 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mushava, Stanely, [http://www.herald.co.zw/a-portrait-of-the-dissident-as-a-young-man/ "A portrait of the dissident as a young man"], ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|The Herald]]'' (Zimbabwe), 10 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5067">[[File:Stock person bw.png|thumb|right|130px|Personism states that being human does not give one exclusive claim to moral rights.]]

'''Personism''' is an [[ethical philosophy]] of [[personhood]] as typified by the thought of the [[utilitarian]] [[philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Peter Singer: a Christian Critique'', by Gordon R. Preece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Applied ethics: a non-consequentialist approach'', by David S. Oderberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Humanism and Personism: The false philosophy of Peter Singer'', by Jenny Teichman&lt;/ref&gt; It amounts to a branch of [[secular humanism]] with an emphasis on certain rights-criteria.&lt;ref name=SingerBeyond&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Taking Humanism Beyond Speciesism|journal=Free Inquiry|date=Oct–Nov 2004|volume=24|issue=6|pages=19–21|url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200410--.htm|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personists believe that rights are conferred to the extent that a creature is a [[person]].&lt;ref name=SingerBeyond/&gt; [[Michael Tooley]] provides the relevant definition of a person, saying it is a creature that is "capable of desiring to continue as a subject of experience and other mental states".&lt;ref name="anthology"&gt;''Bioethics: An Anthology'', by Helga Kuhse, Peter Singer&lt;/ref&gt; A [[worldview]] like [[secular humanism]] is personism when the empathy and values are extended to the extent that the creature is a person (apes get very similar rights, insects get vastly fewer rights, etc.).

Consequently, a member of the human species may not necessarily fit the definition of “person” and thereby not receive all the rights bestowed to a person. Hence, such philosophers have engaged in arguing that certain disabled individuals (such as those with a mental capacity that is similar to or is perceived as being similar to an infant) are not persons.  This philosophy is also supposedly open to the idea that such non-human persons as [[Artificial intelligence|machines]], [[Animal rights|animals]], and [[extraterrestrial intelligence]]s may be entitled to certain rights currently granted only to humans. Personism may have views in common with [[transhumanism]].

==Details==
Singer argues that "...despite many individual exceptions, humanists have on the whole been unable to free themselves from one of the most central of these Christian dogmas: the prejudice of [[speciesism]]."&lt;ref name=SingerBeyond /&gt;

Jaqueline Laing claims that Singer's philosophy has natural conclusions that contradict his own account&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline A. Laing (1997), "[http://www.mededtrust.org.uk/innocence Innocence and Consequentialism]: Inconsistency, Equivocation and Contradiction in the Philosophy of Peter Singer" in ''Human Lives: Critical Essays on Consequentialist Bioethics'', eds. J. A. Laing with D. S. Oderberg. London, Macmillan, pp. 196-224&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conflict with common philosophical intuition. In one such feature of his philosophy, Singer argues that [[fetuses]] and even [[infant|newborn humans]] are not yet [[person]]s and do not, therefore, have the same rights as an adult human or any other person. Thus the [[right to life]] does not apply to fetuses according to Singer's [[preference utilitarianism]] as a non-person can not have preferences (see [[Peter Singer#Abortion, euthanasia and infanticide|Singer on abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide]]). On the other hand, Michael Tooley distinguished between creatures that only have the ''possibility'' of becoming a person as he defined it (e.g. fetuses, or [[spermatozoa]] and an [[ovum]]) and a creature that already has that capacity, and is already owed moral consideration accordingly (e.g. a sleeping person).&lt;ref name="anthology"/&gt;

Personism also holds that certain animals ought to have more rights than they currently possess, including a right to life. Specifically, animals that are self-aware, such as great apes, dolphins, orcas, and elephants, would be recognized as having some of the rights of mentally competent adult humans. Singer himself is a [[vegetarian]], and advocates for [[vegetarianism]]. He adds that he is concerned with the rights of any creatures that currently exist, not with "potential" persons.

Medical ethicists, characterized in their philosophy as personists,&lt;ref name=infanticide&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infanticide: a reply to Giubilini and Minerva|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|pmid=23637448 | doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100664|pmc=3632995|volume=39|issue=5|pages=336-40 | last1 = Laing | first1 = JA}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued for parents to be allowed to kill their newborn babies because they are not "actual persons" and have received criticism for that position.&lt;ref name=infanticide/&gt;

==Other uses==
*Personism can refer to the actual philosophical topic of what constitutes a person.
*Personism can refer to a form of poetry mentioned by [[Frank O'Hara]] in which the poem is written directly towards another person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">'''Phytosemiotics''' is a branch of [[biosemiotics]] that studies the [[sign process]]es in plants, or more broadly, the vegetative [[semiosis]]. Vegetative semiosis is a type of sign processes that occurs at cellular and tissue level, including cellular recognition, [[plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]], plant [[signal transduction]], intercellular communication, immunological processes, etc.

The term 'phytosemiotics' has been introduced by [[Martin Krampen]] in 1981.

'''Pol Pot''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|p|ɒ|l|_|p|ɒ|t}}, {{IPAc-en|US|p|oʊ|l}}; {{lang-km|ប៉ុល ពត}} born '''Saloth Sâr''' 19 May 1925 – 15 April 1998)&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TIME/&gt; was a [[Cambodia]]n communist revolutionary and politician who served as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] from 1963 to 1981. Ideologically a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Khmer nationalism|Khmer nationalist]], he led the [[Khmer Rouge]]&lt;ref&gt;"Red Khmer", from the French ''rouge'' "red" (longtime symbol of socialism) and ''Khmer,'' the term for [[Khmer people|ethnic Cambodians]].&lt;/ref&gt; group from 1963 until 1997. From 1976 to 1979, he served as the [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]] of [[Democratic Kampuchea]].

Born to a prosperous farmer in [[Prek Sbauv]], [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French Cambodia]], Pol Pot was educated at some of Cambodia's elite schools. In the 1940s, Pol Pot moved to [[Paris]], France, where he joined the [[French Communist Party]] and adopted Marxism–Leninism, particularly as it was presented in the writings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]]. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he joined the Marxist–Leninist [[Khmer Việt Minh]] organisation in its guerrilla war against King [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s newly independent government. Following the Khmer Việt Minh's 1954 retreat into [[North Vietnam]], Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh, working as a teacher while remaining a central member of the Cambodian Marxist–Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped convert the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party—later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea—and in 1960 took control of it as party secretary. To avoid state repression, he relocated in 1962 to a [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] encampment in the jungle before visiting [[Hanoi]] and [[Beijing]]. In 1968, he re-launched the war against Sihanouk.

Renaming the country Democratic Kampuchea and seeking to create an [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist society]], Pol Pot's government forcibly relocated the urban population to the countryside to work on [[collective farming|collective farms]]. Those regarded as enemies of the new government were killed. These mass killings, coupled with malnutrition, strenuous working conditions, and poor medical care, killed between 1.5 to 3 million people of a population of roughly 8 million (about 25%), a period later termed the [[Cambodian genocide]]. Marxist–Leninists unhappy with Pol Pot's government encouraged Vietnamese intervention. In 1978, the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invaded Cambodia]], toppling Pol Pot's government in 1979. The Vietnamese installed [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation|a rival Marxist–Leninist faction opposed to Pol Pot]] and renamed the country as the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]]. Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge retreated to a jungle base near the Thai border. Until 1993, they remained part of a [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea|coalition internationally recognized]] as Cambodia's rightful government. The [[Ta Mok]] faction placed Pol Pot under house arrest, where he died in April 1998.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood: 1925–1941 ===
Pol Pot was born in the village of [[Prek Sbauv]], outside the city of [[Kampong Thom city|Kampong Thom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=7|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15}} He was given the name of Saloth Sâr, with the word ''sâr'' ("white, pale") referencing his comparatively light skin complexion.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} Biographer [[Philip Short]] placed his birth in March 1925,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}} although an earlier biography by David P. Chandler noted that French colonial records place it on 25 May 1928.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=7}} His family was of mixed [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]] and [[Khmer people|ethnic Khmer]] heritage, although they did not speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and lived as though they were fully Khmer.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=18}} His father, Loth—who later took the name of Phem Saloth—was a prosperous farmer who owned nine hectares of rice land and several draft cattle.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=15, 18}} Loth's house was one of the largest in the village and at transplanting and harvest time he hired poorer neighbors to carry out much of the agricultural labour.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=15}} Pol Pot's mother, Sok Nem, was locally respected as a pious Buddhist.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} Pol Pot was the eighth of nine children; two were female, and seven were male.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} Three of them died young.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=16}} They were raised as [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada Buddhists]], and on festivals they travelled to the Kampong Thom monastery.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=20}}

[[File:Prek Sbauv.JPG|thumb|left|Prek Sbauv, the village where Pol Pot was born and spent his early years]]
At the time, [[List of monarchs of Cambodia|Cambodia was a monarchy]], but the king had little political control, which was instead exercised by the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French colonial regime]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=14}} Pol Pot's family had connections to the Cambodian royal household; his cousin Meak was a consort of the king, [[Sisowath Monivong]], and later worked as a [[ballet]] teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=8|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=16–17}} When Pol Pot was six years old, he and an older brother were sent to live with Meak in the capital city of [[Phnom Penh]]; informal adoptions by wealthier relatives was a standard practice in Cambodian society at the time.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=8}} In Phnom Penh, he spent several months as a novice monk in the city's Vat Botum Vaddei monastery.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=9|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=20}} There he became literate in the [[Khmer language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=9|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=21}}

In the summer of 1935, Sâr went to live with his brother Suong and the latter's wife and child.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=23}} That year he began an education at a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] primary school, the École Miche,{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=23}} with Meak paying the tuition fees.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} Most of his classmates were the children of French bureaucrats and Catholic [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Vietnamese]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} He became literate in French and familiar with [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=17}} Sâr was not academically gifted and he was held back two years, only receiving his Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Complémentaires in 1941 when — Short argues — he was already eighteen.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=28}} Sâr had continued to visit Meak at the king's palace and it was there, among some of the king's concubines, that he had some of his earliest sexual experiences.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=27}}

=== Later education: 1942–1948 ===
{{contains Khmer text}}
While Sâr was at the school, the [[King of Cambodia]] died and in 1941 the French authorities appointed [[Norodom Sihanouk]] as his replacement.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=17|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=28–29}} A new junior middle school, the Collége Pream Sihanouk, was established in Kampong Cham and Sâr was selected to become a [[boarding school|boarder]] at the institution in 1942.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=18|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=28}} This level of education afforded him a privileged position in Cambodian society.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} There, he learned to play the [[violin]] and took part in school plays.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=31}} Much of his spare time was spent playing [[football]] and [[basketball]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=31}} Several of his fellow pupils, among them [[Hu Nim]] and [[Khieu Samphan]], later served in his government.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=19}} During the new year vacation in 1945, Sâr and several friends from the college theatre troupe went on a provincial tour in a bus to raise money for a trip to [[Angkor Wat]].{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=32–33}} In 1947, he left the school.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=21}}

That year he passed exams that admitted him into the [[Lycée Sisowath]], meanwhile living with Suong and his new wife.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=36}} In the summer of 1948, he sat the ''brevet'' entry exams for the upper classes of the Lycée, but he failed. Unlike several of his friends, he could not continue on at the school for a [[baccalauréat]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=42}} Instead, he enrolled in 1948 to study carpentry at the Ecole Technique in [[Russey Keo]], located in the northern suburbs of Phnom Pehn.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=42–43}} This drop from an academic education to a vocational one was likely a shock for the student.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=42}} Here, his fellow students were generally of a lower class than the students which he had encountered at his previous school, although they were not peasants.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} It was there where he met [[Ieng Sary]], who became a close friend and later became a fellow member of his government.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=22}} In the summer of 1949, Sâr passed his ''brevet'' and secured one of five scholarships allowing him to travel to France to study at one of its engineering schools.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=42–43}}

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], France was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and in 1945 the Japanese ousted French control over Cambodia, with Sihanouk proclaiming independence for his country.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=31}} After the war ended in the defeat of Germany and Japan, France re-asserted its control over Cambodia in 1946,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=34}} although allowed for the creation of a new constitution and the establishment of various political parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=37}} The most successful of these was the [[Democratic Party (Cambodia)|Democratic Party]], which won the [[Cambodian general election, 1946|1946 general election]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=23, 24|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=37}} According to Chandler, Sâr and Sary worked for the party during its successful election campaign,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=23, 24}} although Short maintained that Sâr himself had no contact with the party.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=42}} The king opposed the party's left-leaning reforms and in 1948 dissolved the National Assembly and began ruling by decree.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=24}} A nascent communist movement had also been established in Cambodia by operatives of [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s better established Vietnamese communist group, the [[Việt Minh]], although it had been beset by ethnic tensions between the Khmer and Vietnamese. News of the group was censored from the press and it is unlikely Sâr was aware of them.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=40–42}}

=== Paris: 1949–1953 ===
[[File:Panthéon May 12, 1960.jpg|thumb|Sâr arrived in Paris, France (pictured in 1960)]]
Access to further education abroad marked Sâr out as part of a tiny elite in Cambodia.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=43}} Sâr and the 21 other selected students sailed from [[Saigon]] aboard the ''SS Jamalque'' and arrived in [[Marseille]] nearly a month later; on the journey they stopped at [[Singapore]], [[Colombo]], and [[Djibouti]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=25, 27|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=45}} In Paris, Sâr enrolled at the [[EFREI|École Française de Radioélectricité]] to study [[radio electronics]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} He took a room in the [[Cité Universitaire]]'s Indochinese Pavilion,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=28}} then lodgings on the rue Amyot{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} and eventually a bedsit on the corner of the rue de Commerce and the rue Letelier.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=51}}

He spent three years in Paris, although left on several holidays.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=28}} In the summer of 1950, he was one of 18 Cambodian students who joined French counterparts in traveling to [[Yugoslavia]], a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] state, to volunteer in a labour battalion building a motorway in [[Zagreb]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=30|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=50}} He returned to Yugoslavia the following year for a camping holiday.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=51}} In Paris, Sâr made little or no attempt to assimilate into French culture,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=30}} never becoming completely at ease with the French language.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=49}} He spent much time reading and visiting the cinema.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=34}} He gained a familiarity with much French literature, one of his favorite authors being [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=34}} His most significant friendships in the country were with Ieng Sary, who had joined him there, [[Thiounn Mumm]], and [[Keng Vannsak]].{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=28–29}} He was a member of Vannsak's discussion circle, whose ideologically diverse membership discussed means to achieve Cambodian independence from French rule.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=52, 59}}

In Paris, Ieng Sary and two others established the Cercle Marxiste ("Marxist Circle"), a Marxist–Leninist organisation arranged in a [[clandestine cell system]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} The cells met to read Marxist texts and hold [[self-criticism]] sessions.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=64}} Sâr joined a cell that met on the rue Lacepède; his cell comrades included Hou Yuon, Sien Ary, and Sok Knaol.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} He helped to duplicate the Cercle's newspaper, ''Reaksmei'' ("The Spark"), named after [[Iskra|a former Russian paper]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=68}} In October 1951, Yuon was elected head of the Khmer Student Association (AEK; ''I'Association des Estudiants Khmers''), establishing close links between the organisation and the leftist [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=62}} The Cercle Marxiste manipulated the AEK and its successor organisations for the next 19 years.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=63}} Several months after the Cercle Marxiste's formation, Sâr and Sary joined the [[French Communist Party]] (CFP).{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=22, 28|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=66}} Sâr attended party meetings, including those of its Cambodian group and read its magazine, ''Les Cahiers Internationaux''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=66}} The Marxist–Leninist movement was then in a strong position globally; the [[Communist Party of China]] had recently come to power under [[Mao Zedong]] and the French Communist Party was one of the country's largest political parties,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=27}} attracting the votes of around 25% of the French electorate.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=69}}

Sâr found many of [[Karl Marx]]'s denser texts difficult, later revealing that he "didn't really understand" them.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=66}} Instead he became familiar with the writings of the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]],{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=34|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=67}} including Stalin's ''[[The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)]]''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=66}} Stalin's approach to Marxism—known as [[Stalinism]]—gave Sâr a sense of purpose in life.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=65}} Sâr also read Mao's work, especially ''[[On New Democracy]]'', a text outlining [[New Democracy|a Marxist–Leninist framework for carrying out a revolution in colonial and semi-colonial, semi-feudal societies]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=70}} Alongside these Marxist texts, Sâr read the [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s book on the [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]], ''The Great Revolution''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=72}} From Kropotkin, he took the idea that an alliance between intellectuals and the peasantry was necessary for revolution; that a revolution needed to be carried out to its final conclusion without compromise for it to succeed; and that egalitarianism was the basis of a communist society.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=74}}

In Cambodia, growing internal strife resulted in King Sihanouk dismissing the government and declaring himself Prime Minister.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=76–77}} In response to Sihanouk's growing power, Saloth wrote the article "Monarchy or Democracy?"; it was published in student magazine ''Khmer Nisut'' under the pseudonym "Khmer daom" ("Original Khmer").{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=39|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=79}} In this essay, he referred positively toward Buddhism, portraying Buddhist monks as an anti-monarchist force on the side of the peasantry.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=80}} At a meeting, the Cercle decided to send someone back to Cambodia to assess the situation and determine which rebel group they should support; Sâr volunteered for the role.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=83}} His decision to leave may also pertain to the fact that he had failed his second year exams two years in a row and had thus lost his scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=28|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=65, 82}} In December, he boarded the ''SS Jamaique'',{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=42|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=82}} returning to Cambodia without having gained any formal degree.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|pp=28, 42}}

== Revolutionary and political activism ==
=== Return to Cambodia: 1953–1954 ===
[[File:Norodom Sihanouk 1941.jpg|thumb|King Sihanouk disbanded the Cambodian government and National Assembly before securing independence from French colonial rule in 1953]]
Sâr arrived in Saigon on 13 January 1953, the same day on which Sihanouk disbanded the Democrat-controlled [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]], began [[Rule by decree|ruling by decree]] and imprisoned Democratic Members of Parliament without trial.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=83}} Amid the broader [[First Indochina War]] in neighboring [[French Indochina]], Cambodia was in a state of civil war,{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=85–86}} with civilian massacres and other atrocities being carried out by all sides.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=88–89}} Sâr spent several months at the headquarters of Prince [[Norodom Chantaraingsey]]—the leader of one of these factions—in Trapeng Kroloeung,{{sfn|Short|2004|p=87}} before moving to Phnom Pehn, where he met with fellow Cercle member Ping Say to discuss the situation.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=89}} Sâr regarded the most promising resistance group to be the [[Khmer Việt Minh]], a mixed Vietnamese and Cambodian guerrilla sub-group of the larger [[Việt Minh]], the Vietnamese [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] militia organized by the Marxist-Leninist [[Ho Chi Minh]]. Sâr believed that the Khmer Việt Minh to the broader Việt Minh and thus the international Marxist–Leninist movement made it the best group for the Cercle Marxiste to support.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=89–90}} His recommendation was agreed by the Cercle members in Paris.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=90}}

In August 1953, Sâr and Rath Samoeun travelled to Krabao, the headquarters of the Việt Minh Eastern Zone.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=90, 95}} Over the following nine months, around 12 other Cercle members joined them there.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=96}} They found that the Khmer Việt Minh was run by—and numerically dominated by—Vietnamese guerrillas, with Khmer recruits largely given menial tasks; Sâr was tasked with growing [[cassava]] and working in the canteen.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=44|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=96}} He gained a rudimentary grasp of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]],{{sfn|Short|2004|p=100}} and rose to become secretary and aide to [[Tou Samouth]], the Secretary of the Khmer Việt Minh's Eastern Zone.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=45|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=100}}

Sihanouk desired independence from French colonial rule, but after the French government refused his requests he called for public resistance to their administration in June 1953. Khmer troops deserted the French Army in large numbers and the French government—fearing a costly and protracted war to retain colonial control—relented.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=92–95}} In October, full military powers were transferred to Sihanouk and in November he declared Cambodia an independent kingdom.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=44–45|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=95}} Post-independence, the civil conflict intensified, with France backing Sihanouk's war against the rebel groups.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=101}} Following the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] held to end the First Indochina War, Sihanouk secured an agreement from the [[North Vietnam]]ese that they would withdraw Khmer Việt Minh forces from Cambodian territory.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=45–46|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=103–104}} The final Khmer Việt Minh units left Cambodia for North Vietnam in October 1954.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=46|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=104}} Sâr was not among them, deciding to remain in Cambodia; he trekked, via South Vietnam, to [[Prey Veng (city)|Prey Veng]] to reach Phnom Penh.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=46|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=104–105}} He and other Cambodian Marxist–Leninists now decided to move on from the armed struggle and pursue their aims through electoral means.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=105}}

=== Developing the Communist Party: 1955–1962 ===
The Cambodian Marxist-Leninists established a socialist party, [[Pracheachon]], to serve as a [[front organization]] through which they could compete in the forthcoming 1955 election while they continued to operate clandestinely.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=48}} Although Pracheachon had strong support in some areas, most observers expected the Democratic Party to win.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=46, 48|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=106}} The Marxist–Leninists engaged in [[entryism]] to influence Democratic policy; Vannsak had become deputy party secretary, with Sâr working as his assistant, perhaps helping to alter the party's platform.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=47–48|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=107–108}} Sihanouk feared a Democratic Party government and in March 1955 abdicated the throne in favor of his father, [[Norodom Suramarit]]. This allowed him to legally establish a political party, the [[Sangkum Reastr Niyum]], with which to contest the election.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=49|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=109–110}} The [[Cambodian general election, 1955|September election]] witnessed widespread voter intimidation and electoral fraud, resulting in Sihanouk's Sangkum winning all 91 seats.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=49, 51|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=110–112}} Sihanouk's establishment of a ''de facto'' one-party state extinguished hopes that the Cambodian Left could take power electorally.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=112–113}} The North Vietnamese government nevertheless urged the Cambodian Marxist–Leninists not to re-start the armed struggle; the former were focusing on undermining South Vietnam and had little desire to destabilize Sihanouk's regime given that it had—conveniently for them—remained internationally non-aligned rather than following the Thai and South Vietnamese governments in establishing an alliance with the anti-communist United States.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=113–114}}

Using a pseudonym, Sâr rented a house in the [[Chamkar Mon District|Boeng Keng Kang]] area of southern Phnom Penh.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=47|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=116}} Although not qualified to teach at a state school,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=54}} he gained employment teaching history, geography, French literature, and morals at a private school, the Chamraon Vichea ("Progressive Knowledge");{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=52|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=120}} his pupils, who included the later novelist [[Soth Polin]], described him as a good teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=54|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=120}} He courted society belle Soeung Son Maly,{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=116–117}} before entering a relationship with fellow communist revolutionary [[Khieu Ponnary]], who was the sister of Sary's wife Thirith.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=117}} They were married in a Buddhist ceremony in July 1956.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=52|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=118}}

Sâr remained deeply involved in the Cambodian left as he oversaw many of the Marxist–Leninists' underground communications while all correspondence between the Democratic Party and the Pracheachon went through him.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=116}} Sihanaouk had cracked down on the Marxist-Leninist movement, whose membership had halved since the end of the civil war.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=120}} Links with the North Vietnamese Marxist–Leninists declined, something Sâr later portrayed as a good thing.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=121}} He and other members increasingly regarded the Cambodians as being too subordinate to their Vietnamese counterparts; to deal with this, Sâr, Tou Samouth, and [[Nuon Chea]] drafted a programme and statutes for a new Marxist-Leninist party that would be allied, although not subordinate, to the Vietnamese.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=121–122}} They established party cells, emphasising the recruitment of small numbers of dedicated members, and organized political seminars in safe houses.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=122}} At a 1959 conference, the movement's leadership established the Kampuchean Labour Party, based upon the Marxist–Leninist model of [[democratic centralism]]. Sâr, Tou Samouth, and Nuon Chea were part of a four-man 'General Affair Committee' leading the party.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=135–136}} Its existence was to be kept secret from non-members.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=62}}

At the communist party's 1960 conference, held on the premises of a railway station, Samouth became party secretary and Nuon Chea his deputy, while Sâr took the third senior position and Ieng Sary the fourth.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=61–62|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=138}} Sihanouk vocally spoke out against the Cambodian Marxist-Leninists; although he was an ally of China's Marxist–Leninist government and admitted Marxism–Leninism's capacity to bring swift economic development and [[social justice]], he also warned of its [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] character and its suppression of personal liberty.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=139–140}} In January 1962, Sihanouk's security services cracked down further on Cambodia's socialists, incarcerating the leaders of Pracheachon and leaving the party largely moribund.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=63|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=140}} In July, Samouth was arrested, tortured and killed.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1pp=63–64|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=141}} Nuon Chea had also taken a step back from his political activities, leaving the way for Sâr to become party leader.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=141}} At the party's second conference, held in a central Phnom Penh apartment, Sâr was elected party secretary and the organisation was renamed the Kampuchean Workers' Party.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=66|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=141–142}}

As well as facing leftist opposition, Sihanouk's government also faced hostility from right-wing opposition centred upon Sihanouk's former Minister of State, [[Sam Sary]], who was backed by the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=124–125}} After the South Vietnamese supported a failed coup against Sihanouk, relations between the countries deteriorated and the United States initiated an economic blockade of Cambodia in 1956.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=127}} After Sihanouk's father died in 1960, Sihanouk introduced a constitutional amendment allowing himself to become head of state for life.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=60|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=131–32}} In February 1962, anti-government student protests turned into riots, at which Sihanouk dismissed the Sangkum government, called new elections, and produced a list of 34 left-leaning Cambodians, demanding that they meet him to establish a new administration.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=66|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2pp=142–143}} Sâr was on that list—perhaps because he was known as a leftist teacher rather than because he was known as a Marxist–Leninist leader—but refused to meet with Sihanouk. He and Ieng Sary left Phnom Penh for a [[Viet Cong]] encampment near Thboung Khmum in the jungle along Cambodia's border with South Vietnam.{{sfnm|1a1=Chandler|1y=1992|1p=67|2a1=Short|2y=2004|2p=144}} According to Chandler, "from this point on he was a full-time revolutionary".{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=67}}

=== Plotting Rebellion: 1962–1968 ===
Conditions at the Viet Cong camp were basic and food scarce.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=145}} As Sihanouk's government cracked down on the movement in Phnom Penh, growing numbers of its members fled to join Sâr in his jungle base.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=146}} In early 1964, Sâr established his own encampment, Office 100, on the South Vietnamese side of the border. Although allowing his actions to be officially separate from the Viet Cong, the latter still wielded significant control over his camp.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=146}} At a plenum of the party's Central Committee, it was agreed that they should re-emphasize their independence from the Vietnamese Marxist–Leninists and endorse armed struggle against Sihanouk.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=146}} The Central Committee met again in January 1965 to denounce the "peaceful transition" to socialism being espoused by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], accusing him of being a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=147}} In contrast to Khrushchev's interpretation of Marxism–Leninism, Sâr and his comrades sought to develop their own, explicitly Cambodian variant of the ideology.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=148}} Their interpretation moved away from the orthodox Marxist focus on the urban proletariat as the forces of a revolution to build socialism; instead they gave that role to the rural peasantry, who were a far larger class in Cambodian society.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=148–149}} By 1965, the party regarded Cambodia's small proletariat as being full of "enemy agents" and systematically refused them party membership.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=149}} Its main area of growth was in the rural provinces and by 1965 membership was at 2000.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=152}}

[[File:Banner of the Communist Party of Kampuchea.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the Communist Party of Kampuchea]]
In April 1965, Sâr travelled—by foot, along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]—to [[Hanoi]] to meet North Vietnamese government figures, among them [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Le Duan]].{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=156–157}} The North Vietnamese were preoccupied with the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] and thus did not want Sar's forces to destabilize Sihanouk's government; the latter's anti-American stance rendered him a ''de facto'' ally.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=157}} In Hanoi, Sâr read through the archives of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Workers' Party of Vietnam]], concluding that the Vietnamese Marxist–Leninists were committed to pursuing an Indochinese Federation and that their interests were therefore incompatible with those of Cambodia.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=158–159}} From Hanoi, he flew to Beijing, where his official host was [[Deng Xiaoping]] although most of his meetings were with [[Peng Zhen]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=159}} Sâr gained a sympathetic hearing from many in the governing [[Communist Party of China]]—especially [[Chen Boda]] and [[Zhang Chunqiao]]—who shared his negative view of Khruschev amid the [[Sino-Soviet split]].{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=159–160}}

After a month in Beijing, Sâr flew back to Hanoi before a four-month journey along the Ho Chi Minh trail to reach the Cambodian Marxist–Leninists new base at [[Loc Ninh]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=161}} In October 1966, he and other Cambodian party leaders reached several key decisions. They decided to rename their organisation the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]], a decision initially kept secret.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=161–162}} It was agreed that they would move their headquarters in [[Ratanakiri Province]], away from the Viet Cong, and that—despite the views of the North Vietnamese—they would command each of the party's zone committees to prepare for the re-launch of armed struggle.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=162}} North Vietnam refused to assist in this, rejecting their requests for weaponry.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=170}} In November 1967, Sâr travelled from [[Tay Ninh]] to the base Office 102 near Kang Lêng. During the journey, he fell ill with [[malaria]] and required a respite in a Viet Cong medical base near Mount Ngork.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=172}} By December, plans for armed conflict were complete, with the war to begin In the North-West Zone and then spread to other regions.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=173}} As communication across Cambodia was slow, each Zone would have to operate independently much of the time.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=174}}

=== Civil War: 1968 ===
In January 1968, the war was launched with an attack on the Bay Damran army post south of [[Battambang]].{{sfn|Short|2004|p=174}} Further attacks targeted police and soldiers and seized weaponry.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=174}} The government responded with [[scorched earth]] policies, aerially bombarding areas where the rebels were active.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=175}} Members of the Buddhist hierarchy and other establishment figures expressed concern about the brutality of government troops.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=176}} In some areas, troops were rewarded for each severed head they procured, resulting in them targeting civilians as well as rebels and in Phnom Penh soldiers beheaded two children using the frons of palm trees because they were accused of being rebel spies. Such reports of brutality aided the insurgents' cause.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=175}} As the uprising spread, over 100,000 villagers joined the rebels.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=174}} In the summer, Pol Pot relocated his base thirty miles north, to the more mountainous Naga's Tail, to avoid encroaching government troops.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=176}} In this base, called K-5, Sâr established his growing dominance over the party and had his own separate encampment, his own staff and guards and no outsider was allowed to meet him without an escort.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=176}} He took over from Sary as the Secretary of the North East Zone.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=177}} In September, Sihanouk's warm relations with China deteriorated and he instituted a marked political shift to the right, improving relations with the United States.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=180–182}}

== Leadership ==
[[File:Nicolae Ceaușescu with Pol Pot.jpg|thumb|Pol Pot on a visit to Romanian Marxist–Leninist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in 1978]]
The movement was estimated to consist of no more than 200 regular members, but the core of the movement was supported by a number of villages many times that size. While weapons were in short supply, the insurgency still operated in twelve out of nineteen districts of Cambodia. In 1969, Sâr called a party conference and decided to change the party's propaganda strategy. Before 1969, opposition to [[Norodom Sihanouk]] was the main focus of its propaganda. However, the party decided in 1969 to shift the focus of its propaganda in order to oppose the right-wing parties of Cambodia and their alleged pro-American attitudes. While the party ceased making anti-Sihanouk statements in public, in private the party had not changed its view of him.

The road to power for Sâr and the Khmer Rouge was opened by the events of January 1970, in Cambodia. While he was out of the country,  Sihanouk ordered the government to stage anti-Vietnamese protests in the capital. The protests quickly spilled out of control and the embassies of both North and South Vietnam were wrecked. Sihanouk, who had ordered the protests, then denounced them from [[Paris]] and blamed unnamed individuals in Cambodia for inciting them. These actions, along with clandestine operations by Sihanouk's followers in Cambodia, convinced the government that he should be removed as [[head of state]]. The National Assembly voted to remove Sihanouk from office and closed Cambodia's ports to North Vietnamese weapons traffic, demanding that the North Vietnamese leave Cambodia.

The North Vietnamese reacted to the political changes in Cambodia by sending Premier [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Sâr was also contacted by the North Vietnamese, who reversed their position, offering him whatever resources he wanted for his [[insurgency]] against the Cambodian government. Sâr and Sihanouk were actually in [[Beijing]] at the same time, but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Sâr or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly afterward, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia asking them to rise up against the government and to support the Khmer Rouge. In May 1970, Sâr finally returned to Cambodia and the insurgency gained traction.

Earlier on 29 March 1970, the North Vietnamese had taken matters into their own hands and launched an offensive against the Cambodian army. A force of North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia reaching to within {{convert|15|mi|km|round=5|abbr=on|order=flip}} of [[Phnom Penh]] before being pushed back. In these battles, the Khmer Rouge and Sâr played a very small role.

In October 1970, Sâr issued a resolution in the name of the Central Committee.

Throughout 1971, the Vietnamese (North Vietnamese and Viet Cong) did most of the fighting against the Cambodian government while Sâr and the Khmer Rouge functioned almost as auxiliaries to their forces. Sâr took advantage of the situation in order to gather in new recruits and to train them according to a higher standard than was previously possible. Sâr also put the resources of all Khmer Rouge organizations into political education and indoctrination. While accepting anyone regardless of background into the Khmer Rouge army at this time, Sâr greatly increased the requirements for membership in the party. Students and so-called "middle peasants" were now rejected by the party. Those with clear peasant backgrounds were the preferred recruits for party membership. These restrictions were ironic in that most of the senior party leadership including Sâr came from student and middle peasant backgrounds. They also created an intellectual split between the educated old guard party members and the uneducated peasant new party members.

In early 1972, Sâr toured the insurgent/North Vietnamese controlled areas in Cambodia. He saw a regular Khmer Rouge army of 35,000 men taking shape supported by around 100,000 [[Irregular military|irregulars]]. China was supplying five million dollars a year in weapons and Sâr had organized an independent revenue source for the party in the form of [[rubber]] plantations in eastern Cambodia using forced labor.

After a central committee meeting in May 1972, the party under the direction of Sâr began to enforce new levels of discipline and conformity in areas under their control. Minorities such as the [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]] were forced to conform to Cambodian styles of dress and appearance. These policies, such as forbidding the Chams from wearing jewelry, were soon extended to the whole population. A haphazard version of [[land reform]] was undertaken by Sâr. Its basis was that all land holdings should be of uniform size. The party also confiscated all private means of transportation. The 1972 policies were aimed at reducing the peoples of the liberated areas to a sort of feudal peasant equality. These policies were generally favorable at the time to poor peasants and were extremely unfavorable to refugees from towns, who had fled to the countryside.

In 1972, the North Vietnamese army's forces began to withdraw from the fighting against the Cambodian government. Sâr issued a new set of decrees in May 1973 that started the process of reorganizing peasant villages into [[cooperative]]s where property was jointly owned and where individual possessions were banned.

=== Control of the countryside ===
[[File:Khmer rouge clothing.jpg|thumb|Clothing worn during the Khmer Rouge's period of control]]
The Khmer Rouge advanced during 1973. After they reached the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Sâr issued orders that the city be taken during the peak of the [[Wet season|rainy season]]. The orders led to futile attacks and wasted lives within the Khmer Rouge army. By the middle of 1973, the Khmer Rouge under Sâr controlled almost two-thirds of the country and half the population. North Vietnam realized that it no longer controlled the situation and it began to treat Sâr as more of an equal leader than as a junior partner.

In late 1973, Sâr made strategic decisions that determined the future of the war. First, he decided to cut the capital off from contact with outside sources of supplies, putting the city under siege. Second, he enforced tight control over people trying to leave the city through Khmer Rouge lines. He also ordered a series of general [[purge]]s of former government officials, and anyone with an education. A set of new prisons were also constructed in Khmer Rouge run areas. The Cham minority attempted an uprising in order to stop the destruction of their culture. The uprising was quickly crushed as Sâr ordered that harsh physical torture be used against most of those involved in the revolt. As previously, Sâr tested out harsh new policies against the Cham minority before extending them to the general population of the country.

The Khmer Rouge also had a policy of evacuating urban areas and forcibly relocating their residents to the countryside. When the Khmer Rouge took the town of [[Kratié (town)|Kratié]] in 1971, Sâr and other members of the party were shocked at how fast the "liberated" urban areas shook off socialism and went back to the old ways. Various ideas were tried in order to re-create the town in the image of the party, but nothing worked. In 1973, Sâr decided out of total frustration that the only solution was to send the entire population of the town to the fields in the countryside. He wrote at the time "if the result of so many sacrifices was that the capitalists remain in control, what was the point of the revolution?". Shortly after, Sâr ordered the evacuation of the {{formatnum:15000}} people of Kompong Cham for the same reasons. The Khmer Rouge then moved on in 1974 to evacuate the larger city of [[Oudong]].

Internationally, Sâr and the Khmer Rouge gained the recognition of 63 countries as the true government of Cambodia. A move was made at the UN to give the seat for Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge; they prevailed by three votes.

In September 1974, Sâr gathered the central committee of the party together. As the military campaign was moving toward a conclusion, Sâr decided to move the party toward implementing a socialist transformation of the country in the form of a series of decisions, the first being to evacuate the main cities, moving the population to the countryside. The second dictated that they would cease putting money into circulation and quickly phase it out. The final decision was that the party would accept Sâr's first major purge. In 1974, Sâr had purged a top party official named Prasith. Prasith was taken out into a forest and shot without being given any chance to defend himself. His death was followed by a purge of cadres who, like Prasith, were ethnically [[Thai people|Thai]]. Sâr's explanation was that the [[class struggle]] had become acute, requiring a strong stand against party enemies.

The Khmer Rouge were positioned for a final offensive against the government in January 1975. Simultaneously, Sihanouk proudly announced at a press event in Beijing Sâr's "death list" of enemies who were to be killed after victory. The list, which originally contained seven names, was expanded to 23 and it included the names of all senior government leaders along with the names of all officials who were in positions of leadership within the police and military. The rivalry between Vietnam and Cambodia also came out into the open. [[North Vietnam]] as the rival socialist country in [[Indochina]] was determined to take [[Saigon]] before the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh.

In April 1975, the government formed a Supreme National Council with new leadership, with the aim of negotiating a surrender to the Khmer Rouge. It was headed by [[Sak Sutsakhan]] who had studied in France with Sâr and was a cousin of the Khmer Rouge Deputy Secretary [[Nuon Chea]]. Sâr reacted to this by adding the names of everyone involved in the Supreme National Council onto his post-victory death list. Government resistance finally collapsed on 17 April 1975.

The Khmer Rouge took [[Phnom Penh]] on 17 April 1975. As the leader of the Communist Party, Sâr became the ''de-facto'' leader of the country. He adopted the title "brother number one" and used the [[Noms de guerre|''nom de guerre'']] Pol Pot. [[Philip Short]] offered an explanation for the origin of Pol Pot's name, stating that Sâr announced that he was adopting the name in July 1970. Short suspects that it derives from ''pol'' as "the Pols were royal slaves, an aboriginal people" and that "Pot" was simply a "euphonic monosyllable" that he liked.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare,'' p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Khmer word ''pol'' is derived from Sanskrit ''bala'' ("army", "guard") and the Khmer spelling differs from the spelling of Pol Pot's name.&lt;ref name="Ferlus 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferlus |first=Michel |title=Toward Proto Pearic: problems and historical implications |journal=Mon-Khmer Studies |date=2011 |issue=Special Issue No. 2 |pages=38–51 |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00992631/document |accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name has no particular meaning in Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mydans|first1=Seth|title=DEATH OF POL POT; Pol Pot, Brutal Dictator Who Forced Cambodians to Killing Fields, Dies at 73|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/17/world/death-pol-pot-pol-pot-brutal-dictator-who-forced-cambodians-killing-fields-dies.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=9 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambodia adopted a new constitution on 5 January 1976, officially changing the country's name to [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. The newly established Representative Assembly held its first [[plenary session]] from 11 to 13 April, electing a new government with Pol Pot as [[List of Prime Ministers of Cambodia|prime minister]]. His predecessor, [[Khieu Samphan]], became [[List of heads of state of Cambodia|head of state]] as President of the State Presidium. Prince [[Sihanouk]] received no role in the government and was placed in detention. The Khmer Rouge rėgime saw agriculture as the key to [[nation-building]] and national defense.&lt;ref name="Short 288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2005|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pol Pot's goal for the country was to have 70–80% of the farm mechanization completed within 5 to 10 years, to build a modern industrial base on the farm mechanization within 15 to 20 years, and to become a self-sufficient state.&lt;ref name="Short 288"/&gt; He wanted to take the economy and make it the primary source of goods for the nation, sever foreign relationships and radically reconstruct the society to maximize the production of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2005|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid foreign domination of industries, Pol Pot refused to purchase goods from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2005|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the fall of Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge began to implement their concept of [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]] and ordered the complete [[Forced migration|evacuation]] of Phnom Penh and all other recently captured major towns and cities. Those leaving were told that the evacuation was due to the threat of severe American bombing and that it would last for no more than a few days. Western media depicted the events as a "[[death march]]", with American sources predicting that the Khmer Rouge policy of forced evacuation would result in famine and the mass death of hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jack|last2=Whitten|first2=Les|title=Genocide in Cambodia?|agency=''The Washington Post''|date=4 June 1975|quote=In CIA jargon, the agency has "no assets" left in Cambodia.

Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge had been evacuating captured urban areas for many years, but the evacuation of Phnom Penh was unique in its scale. Pol Pot stated that "the first step in progress [was] deliberately designed to exterminate an entire class".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Short|2005|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first operations to evacuate urban areas occurred in 1968, in the [[Ratanakiri Province|Ratanakiri]] area and aimed at moving people deeper into Khmer Rouge territory to control them more easily. From 1971–1973, the motivation changed. Pol Pot and the other senior leaders were frustrated that urban Cambodians retained old capitalist habits of trade and business. When all other methods had failed, the government adopted the policy of evacuation to the countryside in order to solve the "problem".

In 1976, Pol Pot's régime reclassified Kampucheans into three groupings, i.e. as full-rights (base) people, as candidates and as depositees, so called because they included most of the new people who had been deposited from the cities into the communes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Karl D.|chapter=The Ideology of Total Revolution|editor1-last=Jackson|editor1-first=Karl D.|title=Cambodia, 1975–1978: Rendezvous with Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noWXAwAAQBAJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|publication-date=2014|page=52|isbn=9781400851706|accessdate=17 April 2015|quote=[...] the population of Democratic Kampuchea was divided into three categories, based on their class backgrounds and their political pasts: individuals with full rights (''penh sith''), those who were candidates for full rights (''triem''), and those who had no rights whatsoever (''bannheu''). [...] The lowest category, the ''bannheu'' or depositees, had no rights whatsoever, not even the right to food. These were former landowners, army officers, bureaucrats, teachers, merchants, and urban residents [...].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depositees were marked for destruction. Their rations were reduced to two bowls of rice soup or [[Rice congee|''p'baw'']] per day, leading to widespread starvation. "New people" were allegedly given no place in the elections which took place on 20 March 1976, despite the fact that the constitution established [[universal suffrage]] for all Cambodians over the age of 18.

The Khmer Rouge leadership boasted over the state-controlled radio that only one or two million people were needed to build the new [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[utopia]]. As for the others, as their proverb put it: "To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss".&lt;ref name="children_of_cambodias_killing_fields"&gt;Children of Cambodia's Killing Fields, ''Worms from Our Skin.''

Hundreds of thousands of the new people and later the depositees were taken out in [[shackle]]s to dig their own [[mass grave]]s as the Khmer Rouge soldiers [[Premature burial|buried them alive]]. A Khmer Rouge extermination prison directive ordered: "Bullets are not to be wasted". Such mass graves are often referred to as "[[the Killing Fields]]".

The Khmer Rouge also classified people based on their religious and ethnic backgrounds. Under the leadership of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge had a policy of [[state atheism]].&lt;ref name="Wessinger2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wessinger|first=Catherine|title=Millennialism, Persecution, and Violence: Historical Cases|year=2000|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|language=English |isbn=9780815628095|page=282|quote=Democratic Kampuchea was officially an atheist state, and the persecution of religion by the Khmer Rouge was matched in severity only by the persecution of religion in the communist states of Albania and North Korea, so there were not any direct historical continuities of Buddhism into the Democratic Kampuchea era.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All religions were banned, and the repression of adherents of [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|title=The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=495|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinn-Judge, Westad|first=Odd Arne, Sophie|title=The Third Indochina War: Conflict Between China, Vietnam and Cambodia, 1972–79|publisher=Routledge|page=189|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhism]] was extensive.

According to [[François Ponchaud]]'s book ''Cambodia: Year Zero'': "Ever since 1972, the guerrilla fighters had been sending all the inhabitants of the villages and towns they occupied into the forest to live and often burning their homes, so that they would have nothing to come back to". The Khmer Rouge systematically destroyed food sources that could not be easily subjected to centralized storage and control, cut down fruit trees, forbade fishing, outlawed the planting or harvesting of mountain leap rice, abolished medicine and hospitals, forced people to march long distances without access to water, exported food and refused offers of [[humanitarian aid]]. As a result, a humanitarian catastrophe unfolded: hundreds of thousands died of starvation and brutal government-inflicted overwork in the countryside. To the Khmer Rouge, outside aid went against their principle of national [[autarky|self-reliance]]. According to Solomon Bashi, the Khmer Rouge exported 150,000 tons of rice in 1976 alone. In addition: {{quote|Coop chiefs often reported better yields to their supervisors than they had actually achieved. The coop was then taxed on the rice it reportedly produced. Rice was taken out of the people's mouths and given to the Center to make up for these inflated numbers [...] 'There were piles of rice as big as a house, but they took it away in trucks. We raised chickens and ducks and vegetables and fruit, but they took them all. You'd be killed if you tried to take anything for yourself.'&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Bashi (2010), [http://works.bepress.com/solomon_bashi/1 "Prosecuting Starvation at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia,"] ExpressO.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Henri Locard, "the reputation of KR leaders for Spartan austerity is somewhat overdone. After all, they had the entire property of all expelled town dwellers at their full disposal, and they never suffered from [[malnutrition]]."&lt;ref name="Locard"&gt;Locard, Henri, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf State Violence in Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979) and Retribution (1979–2004)], ''European Review of History'', Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2005, pp. 121–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Property was collectivized, and education was dispensed at communal schools. Children were raised on a communal basis. Even meals were prepared and eaten communally. Pol Pot's regime was extremely paranoid. [[Political dissent]] and opposition was not permitted. People were treated as opponents based on their appearance or background. [[Torture]] was widespread, thousands of politicians and [[bureaucrat]]s accused of association with previous governments were executed. The régime turned Phnom Penh into a ghost city, while people in the countryside died of [[starvation]] or illnesses, or were simply killed.

Modern research has located 20,000 mass graves from the Khmer Rouge era all over Cambodia. Various studies have estimated the death toll at between 740,000 and 3,000,000—most commonly arriving at figures between 1.7&amp;nbsp;million and 2.2&amp;nbsp;million, with perhaps half of those deaths being due to executions, and the rest being attributable to starvation and disease.&lt;ref name="CountingHell"/&gt; Demographic analysis by Patrick Heuveline suggests that between 1.17 and 3.42 million Cambodians were killed.&lt;ref name="Heuveline, Patrick 2001"&gt;Heuveline, Patrick (2001).

Pol Pot aligned the country diplomatically with the People's Republic of China and adopted an anti-Soviet line. This alignment was more political and practical than it was ideological. Vietnam was aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], so Cambodia aligned itself with the Asian rival of the Soviet Union and Vietnam (China had supplied the Khmer Rouge with weapons for years before they took power).

In December 1976, Pol Pot issued directives to the senior Khmer Rouge leadership to the effect that Vietnam was now an enemy. Defenses along the border were strengthened and unreliable deportees were moved deeper into Cambodia. Pol Pot's actions came in response to the Vietnamese Communist Party's [[National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|fourth Congress]] (14 to 20 December 1976), which approved a resolution describing Vietnam's special relationship with Laos and Cambodia. It also talked of how Vietnam would forever be associated with the building and defense of the other two countries.

Unlike many communist leaders, Pol Pot never became the object of a [[cult of personality|personality cult]].  Even when he was in power, the CPK maintained the secrecy it had kept up during its years in the battlefield. For over two years after taking power, the party only referred to itself as [[Angkar]] ("Organization"). It was not until a speech on 15 April 1977 that Pol Pot revealed the CPK's existence. At that time, international observers confirmed the identification of Pol Pot as Saloth Sâr.

== Conflict with Vietnam ==
{{main|Cambodian–Vietnamese War}}
[[File:TuolSlang4.jpg|thumb|Bust of Pol Pot in the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]]]
In May 1975, a squad of Khmer Rouge soldiers raided and took the island of [[Phú Quốc]]. By 1977, relations with [[Vietnam]] began to fall apart. There were small border clashes in January. Pol Pot tried to prevent border disputes by sending a team to Vietnam. The negotiations failed, which caused even more border disputes. On 30 April, the Cambodian army, backed by artillery, crossed over into Vietnam. In attempting to explain Pol Pot's behavior, one region-watcher{{Specify|date=October 2007}}&lt;!--and source, of course--&gt; suggested that Cambodia was attempting to intimidate Vietnam by irrational acts into respecting or at least fearing Cambodia to the point they would leave the country alone. However, these actions only served to goad the Vietnamese people and government against the Khmer Rouge.

In May 1976, Vietnam sent its air force into Cambodia in a series of raids. In July, Vietnam forced a Treaty of Friendship on [[Laos]] that gave Vietnam almost total control over the country. In Cambodia, Khmer Rouge commanders in the Eastern Zone began to tell their men that war with Vietnam was inevitable and that once the war started their goal would be to recover parts of Vietnam (Khmer Krom) that were once part of Cambodia, whose people, they alleged, were struggling for independence from Vietnam. Whether these statements were the official policy of Pol Pot has never been confirmed.

In September 1977, Cambodia launched [[Division (military)|division]]-scale raids over the border, which once again left a trail of murder and destruction in villages. The Vietnamese claimed that around 1,000 people had been killed or injured. Three days after the raid, Pol Pot officially announced the existence of the formerly secret Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) and finally announced to the world that the country was a Communist state. In December, after having exhausted all other options, Vietnam sent 50,000 troops into Cambodia in what amounted to a short raid. The raid was meant to be secret. The Vietnamese withdrew after declaring that they had achieved their goals and the invasion was just a warning. Upon being threatened, the Vietnamese army promised to return with support from the Soviet Union. Pol Pot's actions made the operation much more visible than the Vietnamese had intended and they created a situation in which Vietnam appeared to be weak.

After making one final attempt to negotiate a settlement with Cambodia, Vietnam decided that it had to prepare for a full-scale war. Vietnam also tried to pressure Cambodia through China. However, China's refusal to pressure Cambodia and the flow of weapons from China into Cambodia were both signs that China also intended to act against Vietnam.

When Cambodian socialists rebelled in the eastern zone in May 1978, Pol Pot's armies could not crush them quickly. On 10 May, his radio broadcast a call not only to "exterminate the 50&amp;nbsp;million Vietnamese" but also to "purify the masses of the people" of Cambodia. Of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million easterners, branded as "Khmer bodies with Vietnamese minds", at least 100,000 were exterminated in six months. Later that year, in response to threats to its borders and the Vietnamese people, [[Cambodian-Vietnamese War|Vietnam attacked Cambodia]] to overthrow the Khmer Rouge, which Vietnam justified on the basis of self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newint.org/features/1993/04/05/original/ |title=The Original Cambodian |publisher=New Internationalist |date=April 1993 |work=242 |first=Ben |last=Kiernan |accessdate=16 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambodian army was defeated, the regime was toppled and Pol Pot fled to the [[Thailand|Thai]] border area. In January 1979, Vietnam installed a new government under Khmer Rouge defector [[Heng Samrin]], composed of Khmer Rouge who had fled to Vietnam to avoid the purges. Pol Pot eventually regrouped with his core supporters in the Thai border area where he received shelter and assistance. At different times during this period, he was located on both sides of the border. The military government of Thailand used the Khmer Rouge as a buffer force to keep the Vietnamese away from the border. The Thai military also made money from the shipments of weapons from China to the Khmer Rouge. Eventually, Pol Pot rebuilt a small military force in the west of the country with the help of the People's Republic of China. The [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] began around this time.

The [[China|People's Republic of China]] was the main international supporter of the Khmer Rouge and its leader Pol Pot. The Chinese provided financial and military support to the party even after its overthrow in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andy Carvin|Carvin, Andy]] "[http://www.edwebproject.org/sideshow/khmeryears/fall.html KR Years: The fall of the Khmer Rouge]"&lt;/ref&gt; The UN also recognized the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]], which included the Khmer Rouge, instead of the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]].

Pol Pot lived in the [[Phnom Malai]] area, giving interviews in the early 1980s and accusing all of those who opposed him of being traitors and "puppets" of the [[Vietnam]]ese until he disappeared from public view. In 1985, his "retirement" was announced, but he retained his influence over the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opus.macmillan.yale.edu/workpaper/pdfs/GS24.pdf |title=Kelvin Rowley, '&amp;#39;Second Life, Second Death: The Khmer Rouge After 1978'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=8 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216054030/http://opus.macmillan.yale.edu/workpaper/pdfs/GS24.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cadre interviewed during this period described Pol Pot's views on the death toll under his government: {{quote|He said that he knows that many people in the country hate him and think he's responsible for the killings. He said that he knows many people died. When he said this he nearly broke down and cried. He said he must accept responsibility because the line was too far to the left, and because he didn't keep proper track of what was going on. He said he was like the master in a house he didn't know what the kids were up to, and that he trusted people too much. For example, he allowed [one person] to take care of central committee business for him, [another person] to take care of intellectuals, and [a third person] to take care of political education. [...] These were the people to whom he felt very close, and he trusted them completely. Then in the end [...] they made a mess of everything [...] They would tell him things that were not true, that everything was fine, that this person or that was a traitor. In the end they were the real traitors. The major problem had been cadres formed by the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in David P. Chandler, ''Brother Number One: A Political Biography of Pol Pot'', Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 1985, the Vietnamese launched a major offensive and overran most of the Khmer Rouge and other insurgent positions. The Khmer Rouge headquarters at Phnom Malai and its base near [[Pailin]] were completely destroyed, though the Vietnamese attackers suffered substantial losses during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA318310&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=R. R. Ross, '&amp;#39;Current Indochinese Issues'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pol Pot fled to Thailand where he lived for the next six years. His headquarters was a plantation villa near [[Trat]].

Pol Pot officially resigned from the party in 1985 citing [[asthma]] as a contributing factor, but he continued to be the de facto leader of the Khmer Rouge and he also remained a dominant force within the anti-Vietnamese alliance. He handed day-to-day power to [[Son Sen]], his hand-picked successor.

In 1986, his new wife Mea Son gave birth to a daughter, Sitha, (now Sar Patchata, wed in 2014), named after the heroine of the Khmer religious epic, the [[Reamker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Short|2005|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Pol Pot moved to China for medical treatment for [[cancer]]. He remained there until 1988.

In 1989, Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge established a new stronghold in the west near the Thai border and Pol Pot relocated back into Cambodia from Thailand. Pol Pot refused to cooperate with the peace process, and he continued to fight against the new coalition government. The Khmer Rouge kept the government forces at bay until 1996, when troops started deserting. Several important Khmer Rouge leaders also defected. The government followed a policy of making peace with Khmer Rouge individuals and groups, after negotiations with the organization as a whole failed. In 1995, Pol Pot experienced a [[stroke]] that paralyzed the left side of his body.

Pol Pot ordered the execution of his lifelong right-hand man Son Sen on 10 June 1997 for attempting to make a settlement with the government. Eleven members of his family were also killed, although Pol Pot later denied that he had ordered this. He then fled his northern stronghold, but was later arrested by Khmer Rouge military Chief [[Ta Mok]] on 19 June 1997. Pol Pot had not been seen in public since 1980, two years after his overthrow at the hands of an invading Vietnamese army. He was sentenced to death in absentia by a Phnom Penh court soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-06-21/world/9706_21_pol.pot_1_khieu-samphan-anlong-veng-fields-reign?_s=PM:WORLD | work=CNN | title=Pol Pots Khmer Rouge denounces him | date=17 June 1997 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918095455/http://articles.cnn.com/1997-06-21/world/9706_21_pol.pot_1_khieu-samphan-anlong-veng-fields-reign?_s=PM:WORLD | archivedate=18 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, he was subjected to a [[show trial]] for the death of Son Sen and sentenced to lifelong [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybercambodia.com/dachs/killing/polpot.html Nate Thayer, "Dying Breath The inside story of Pol Pot's last days and the disintegration of the movement he created," ''Far Eastern Economic Review'', April 30, 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219201855/http://www.cybercambodia.com/dachs/killing/polpot.html |date=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:Graf pol pot.JPG|thumb|Pol Pot's grave in the [[Anlong Veng District]] of [[Oddar Meanchey Province]]]]
On the night of 15 April 1998, two days before the 23rd anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover of Phnom Penh, the [[Voice of America]], of which Pol Pot was a devoted listener, announced that the Khmer Rouge had agreed to turn him over to an international tribunal. According to his wife, he died in his bed later that night while waiting to be moved to another location. Ta Mok claimed that his death was due to [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nate Thayer]]. "Dying Breath" ''Far Eastern Economic Review''. 30 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ta Mok later described the way he died: "He was sitting in his chair waiting for the car to come. But he felt tired. His wife asked him to take a rest. He laid down on his bed. His wife heard a gasp of air. It was the sound of dying. When she touched him he had already died. It was at 10:15 last night".&lt;ref&gt;David P. Chandler, ''Brother Number One: A Political Biography of Pol Pot'', Westview Press, Boulder, CO., 1999, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite government requests to inspect the body, it was [[Cremation|cremated]] at [[Anlong Veng District|Anlong Veng]] in the Khmer Rouge zone a few days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|kZgk_dI4JFo|Footage}} of the body of Pol Pot.&lt;/ref&gt; raising suspicions that he had committed suicide by taking an overdose of the medication which he had been prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gittings|first=John|first2=Mark|last2=Tran|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/21/cambodia|title=Pol Pot 'killed himself with drugs'|work=The Guardian|date=21 January 1999|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Sucheng (2004). ''Survivors: Cambodian Refugees in the United States''. University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|978-0252071799}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Nate Thayer]], who was present, held the view that Pol Pot killed himself when he became aware of Ta Mok's plan to hand him over to the United States.

Thayer confirmed that "Pol Pot died of a lethal dose of a combination of [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[chloroquine]]".&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Poole, "Pol Pot `suicide' to avoid US trial",'' The Independent'', London, 21 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political ideology ==
Pol Pot was influenced by Marxism and desired an entirely self sufficient agrarian society free from all foreign influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/08/07/why-the-world-should-not-forget-khmer-rouge-and-the-killing-fields-of-cambodia/|title=Why the world should not forget Khmer Rouge and the killing fields of Cambodia|last=Taylor|first=Adam|date=7 August 2014|work=Washington Post|access-date=15 February 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's work has been described as a "crucial formative influence" on Pol Pot's thought.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=67}} Also heavily influential was the work of Mao Zedong, particularly his ''On New Democracy''.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=70}} In the mid-1960s, Pol Pot reformulated his ideas about Marxism–Leninism to better suit the Cambodian situation.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=148}}

In rejecting the revolutionary role of the proletariat, Pol Pot emphasised the idea of a revolutionary alliance between the peasantry and the intellectuals, an idea that Short linked to his reading of Kropotkin while in Paris.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=150}} He devised the idea that peasants could still develop a "proletarian consciousness" and that it was this approach which connected him with orthodox Marxist thought.{{sfn|Short|2004|pp=149–150}} Philip Short thought that "the grammar of Theravada Buddhism permeated" Cambodian Marxist thought as much as [[Confucianism]] had influenced the development of [[Maoism]] in China.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=150}}

Pol Pot was an extreme nativist and xenophobe who sought to remove all ethnic and religious minorities from Kampuchea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/books/review/pol-pot-the-killers-smile.html|title='Pol Pot': The Killer's Smile|last=Vollmann|first=William T.|date=27 February 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=15 February 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia1.html|title=GENOCIDE –  CAMBODIA|website=www.ppu.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/survival-cambodias-ethnic-minorities|title=The Survival of Cambodia's Ethnic Minorities|access-date=15 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, native religions were banned as part of the attempt to eliminate religion from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/pol-pot|title=Pol Pot - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hmd.org.uk/genocides/khmer-rouge-ideology|title=Khmer Rouge Ideology {{!}} Holocaust Memorial Day Trust|website=hmd.org.uk|language=en|access-date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and characteristics ==
[[File:Mural painting celebrating Pol Pot in Sundsvall.jpg|thumb|Graffiti commemorating Pol Pot in [[Sundsvall]], Sweden]]
Pol Pot had a thirst for power.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=3}} He was introspective{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=6}} and highly reclusive.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=7}} Short stated that he "delighted in appearing to be what he was not&amp;nbsp;– a nameless face in the crowd".{{sfn|Short|2004|p=6}} During his political career, he used a wide array of pseudonyms: Pouk, Hay, Pol, 87, Grand-Uncle, Elder Brother, First Brother and in later years 99 and Phem.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=5}} He told a secretary that "the more often you change your name the better. It confuses the enemy".{{sfn|Short|2004|p=5}} In later life he concealed and falsified many details of his life.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=7}}

Pol Pot displayed what Chandler called a "genteel charisma",{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=5}} with many observers commenting on his distinctive smile.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=44}} As a child, his brother characterized him as having been sweet tempered and equable while fellow school pupils recalled Pol Pot as having been mediocre, but pleasant.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=5}} As a teacher, he was characterized by his pupils as having been calm, honest and persuasive,{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=5}} having an "evident good nature and attractive personality".{{sfn|Short|2004|p=120}} According to Short, Pol Pot's varied and eclectic upbringing meant that he was "able to communicate naturally with people of all sorts and conditions, establishing an instinctive rapport that invariably made them want to like him".{{sfn|Short|2004|p=44}}

Pol Pot had a nationalistic attitude and displayed little interest in events outside Cambodia.{{sfn|Chandler|1992|p=6}}

During his childhood, Pol Pot developed a love of music and romantic French poetry, with the work of [[Paul Verlaine]] being among his favorites.{{sfn|Short|2004|p=31}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">[[Psychology|Psychological]] movements are considered to be '''post-cognitivist''' if they are opposed to or move beyond the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories posited by [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], and others.

Researchers who have followed post-cognitive directions include [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[James J. Gibson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]].&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F., Thompson, E., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). The embodied mind: Cognitive science and human experience. Cambridge MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work carries forward some of the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Lev Vygotsky]] and others.

==Hubert Dreyfus' critique of cognitivism==
Using the principles of Heidegger's philosophy, Dreyfus has been critical of cognitivism from the beginning. Despite continued resistance by old-school philosophers of cognition, he felt vindicated by the growth of new approaches. When Dreyfus' ideas were first introduced in the mid-1960s, they were met with ridicule and outright hostility.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=211–243}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=120–132}} By the 1980s, however, many of his perspectives were rediscovered by researchers working in [[robotics]] and the new field of [[connectionism]]—approaches now called "[[Artificial intelligence#Sub-symbolic|sub-symbolic]]" because they eschew early [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) research's emphasis on high level symbols. Historian and AI researcher [[Daniel Crevier]] writes: "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments."{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=125}} Dreyfus said in 2007 "I figure I won and it's over—they've given up."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mind Over Machine'' (1986), written during the heyday of [[Expert system|expert systems]], Dreyfus analyzed the difference between human expertise and the programs that claimed to capture it. This expanded on ideas from ''What Computers Can't Do'', where he had made a similar argument criticizing the "[[Artificial intelligence#Symbolic|cognitive simulation]]" school of AI research practiced by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] in the 1960s.

Dreyfus argued that human problem solving and expertise depend on our background sense of the context, of what is important and interesting given the situation, rather than on the process of searching through combinations of possibilities to find what we need. Dreyfus would describe it in 1986 as the difference between "knowing-that" and "knowing-how", based on Heidegger's distinction of [[present-at-hand]] and [[ready-to-hand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} and see [http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/html/paper_socrates.html From Socrates to Expert Systems]. The "knowing-how"/"knowing-that" terminology was introduced in the 1950s by philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing-that is our conscious, step-by-step problem solving abilities. We use these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires us to stop, step back and search through ideas one at time. At moments like this, the ideas become very precise and simple: they become context free symbols, which we manipulate using logic and language. These are the skills that Newell and Simon had demonstrated with both psychological experiments and computer programs. Dreyfus agreed that their programs adequately imitated the skills he calls "knowing-that".

Knowing-how, on the other hand, is the way we deal with things normally. We take actions without using conscious symbolic reasoning at all, as when we recognize a face, drive ourselves to work or find the right thing to say. We seem to simply jump to the appropriate response, without considering any alternatives. This is the essence of expertise, Dreyfus argued: when our intuitions have been trained to the point that we forget the rules and simply "size up the situation" and react.

The human sense of the situation, according to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our bodies and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions, attitudes and knowledge about the world. This "context" or "background" (related to Heidegger's [[Dasein]]) is a form of knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we do not, what we expect and what possibilities we do not consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential. The things that are inessential are relegated to our "fringe consciousness" (borrowing a phrase from [[William James]]): the millions of things we are aware of, but are not really thinking about right now.

Dreyfus did not believe that AI programs, as they were implemented in the 1970s and 1980s, could capture this "background" or do the kind of fast problem solving that it allows. He argued that our unconscious knowledge could ''never'' be captured symbolically. If AI could not find a way to address these issues, then it was doomed to failure, an exercise in "tree climbing with one's eyes on the moon."{{sfn|Dreyfus|1992|p=119}}

A '''result''' (also called '''upshot''') is the final consequence of a [[sequence]] of actions or events expressed qualitatively or quantitatively.  Possible results include [[wikt:advantage|advantage]], [[disadvantage]], [[Gain (accounting)|gain]], [[injury]], [[:wikt:loss|loss]], value and [[victory]]. There may be a range of possible outcomes associated with an event depending on the point of view, historical distance or relevance. Reaching no result can mean that actions are inefficient, ineffective, meaningless or flawed.

Some types of result are as follows:
* in general, the outcome of any kind of [[research]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] or [[phenomenon]]
* in [[game]]s (e.g. [[The result in cricket|cricket]], [[lottery|lotteries]]) or [[war]]s, the result includes the identity of the victorious party and possibly the effects on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]
* in [[mathematics]], the final value of a [[calculation]] (e.g. arithmetic operation), [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[statistics|statistical expression]], or the final statement of a [[theorem]] that has been proven
* in [[statistics]], any [[information]] analyzed, extracted or interpolated from [[Opinion poll|poll]]s, [[Test method|tests]] or logs
* in [[computer sciences]], the [[return value]] of a function, state of a system or list of records matching a query (e.g. web search). The ''result type'' is the [[data type]] of [[What app link The|the]] data returned by a function.
* in [[science]], the ''outcome'' of an [[experiment]] (e.g. see [[null hypothesis]])
* in [[forensics]] and [[justice]], the ''proof'' of guilt or innocence of a suspect after evaluating evidence in a [[criminal investigation]]
* in [[economics]] and [[accounting]], the profit or loss at the end of a fiscal period.
* in [[democracy]],

==In management==
In [[management]] and related fields, a result is a piece of [[information]] that has certain properties in absolute terms or in relation to previous results or settings:

'''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan''' {{audio|Svpr.ogg|listen}} (5 September 1888&amp;nbsp;– 17 April 1975) was an Indian philosopher and statesman{{sfn|Lawhead|2009|p=382}} who served as the [[List of Vice Presidents of India|first]] [[Vice President of India]] (1952–1962) and the [[List of Presidents of India|second]] [[President of India]] (1962-1967).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr98/fe0898/f2808981.html Dr.Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan: The Philosopher President, Press Information Bureau, Government of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of India's most distinguished twentieth-century scholars of [[comparative religion]] and philosophy,&lt;ref name="Pollock"&gt;[http://www.museindia.com/focuscontent.asp?issid=43&amp;id=3330 Sheldon Pollock (2011), ''Crisis in the Classics'', Social Research Vol. 78 : No.1 : Spring 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; after completing his education at [[Madras Christian College]] in 1911, he became Assistant Professor and later Professor of Philosophy at Madras Presidency College then subsequently Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Mysore]] (1918-1921); the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the [[University of Calcutta]] (1921–1932) and [[Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics]] at [[University of Oxford]] (1936–1952) by which he became the first Indian to hold a professorial chair at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was Upton Lecturer at Manchester College, Oxford in 1926, 1929, and 1930. In 1930 he was appointed Haskell lecturer in Comparative Religion at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;The Madras Mail, Saturday, February 8, 1936, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

His philosophy was grounded in [[Advaita Vedanta]], reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary understanding.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; He defended Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism",{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}} contributing to the formation of contemporary Hindu identity.{{sfn|Flood|196|p=249}} He has been influential in shaping the understanding of Hinduism, in both India and the west, and earned a reputation as a bridge-builder between India and the West.&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/ Hawley, ''Radhakrishnan'', IEP bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radhakrishnan was awarded several high awards during his life, including a knighthood in 1931, the [[Bharat Ratna]], the highest civilian award in India, in 1954, and honorary membership of the British Royal [[Order of Merit]] in 1963. He was also one of the founders of Helpage India, a non profit organisation for elderly underprivileged in India. Radhakrishnan believed that "teachers should be the best minds in the country". Since 1962, his birthday is being celebrated in India as [[Teachers' Day]] on 5 September.&lt;ref group=web name=BharatRatna/&gt;

His early years were spent in Thiruttani and Tirupati. His father was a subordinate revenue official in the service of a local [[zamindar]] (local landlord). His primary education was at K.V High School at Thiruttani. In 1896 he moved to the Hermansburg Evangelical Lutheran Mission School in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]] and Government Higher Secondary School, [[Walajapet]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Gopal: ''Radhakrishnan; a Biography'' (1989) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
[[File:President John F. Kennedy with Indian President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, in the Oval Office (1).jpg|thumb|right|Indian President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan with US President John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, 1963]]Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined [[Voorhees College (India)|Voorhees College]] in [[Vellore]] but switched to the [[Madras Christian College]] at the age of 17. He graduated from there in 1906 with a Voorha master's degree in Philosophy, being one of its most distinguished alumni.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Gopal: ''Radhakrishnan; a Biography'' (1989) p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than choice. Being a financially constrained student, when a cousin who graduated from the same college passed on his philosophy textbooks in to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academic course.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan'' (1952) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Gopal: ''Radhakrishnan; a Biography'' (1989) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Radhakrishnan wrote his thesis for the M.A. degree on "The Ethics of the Vedanta and its Metaphysical Presuppositions".&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Gopal: ''Radhakrishnan; a Biography'' (1989) p.17&lt;/ref&gt; It "was intended to be a reply to the charge that the [[Vedanta]] system had no room for ethics."{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112}} He was afraid that this M.A. thesis would offend his philosophy professor, Dr. Alfred George Hogg. Instead, Hogg commended Radhakrishnan on having done most excellent work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Radhakrishnan's thesis was published when he was only twenty. According to Radhakrishnan himself, the criticism of Hogg and other Christian teachers of Indian culture "disturbed my faith and shook the traditional props on which I leaned."{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112}} Radhakrishnan himself describes how, as a student,

{{quote|The challenge of Christian critics impelled me to make a study of Hinduism and find out what is living and what is dead in it. My pride as a Hindu, roused by the enterprise and eloquence of [[Swami Vivekananda]], was deeply hurt by the treatment accorded to Hinduism in [[Timeline of Christian missions|missionary institutions]].{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}}}}

This led him to his critical study of [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]]{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112}} and a lifelong defence of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}}

===Marriage and family===
Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamu,&lt;ref group=note name=skspell&gt;Radhakrishnan's wife's name is spelled differently in different sources. It is spelled ''Sivakamu'' by Sarvepalli Gopal (1989); ''Sivakamuamma'' by Mamta Anand (2006); and still differently by others.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a distant cousin, at the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Gopal: ''Radhakrishnan; a Biography'' (1989) p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  As per tradition the marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by the family. The couple had five daughters and a son, [[Sarvepalli Gopal]]. Sarvepalli Gopal went on to a notable career as a historian. Sivakamu died in 1956. They were married for over 51 years.

===Academic career===
[[File:Radhakrishnan telugu signature.jpg|thumb|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan drawn by Bujjai and signed by Radhakrishnan in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as "Radhakrishnayya".|alt=hand made portrait of Mr. President.]]
In April 1909, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the [[Madras Presidency College]]. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the [[University of Mysore]], where he taught at its [[Maharaja's College, Mysore]]. &lt;ref group=web name="times10"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Maharaja's royal gift to Mysore  | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-25/mysore/28281284_1_mysore-crawford-hall-maharaja-s-college | publisher = The Times of India | date =  25 July 2010| accessdate = 11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MurtyVohra1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kotta Satchidananda Murty|author2=Ashok Vohra|title=Radhakrishnan: His Life and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6FsaptULgAC&amp;pg=PA26|chapter= 3. Professor at Mysore|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1401-0|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like ''The Quest'', ''Journal of Philosophy'' and the ''International Journal of Ethics''. He also completed his first book, ''The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore''. He believed [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]]'s philosophy to be the "genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit". His second book, ''The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy'' was published in 1920.

In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the [[University of Calcutta]]. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the [[Hibbert Lecture]] on the ideals of life which he delivered at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College, Oxford]] in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as ''An Idealist View of Life''.

In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in the June 1931 [[Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref group=web name="london-gazette1"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33722 |date=2 June 1931 |page=3624 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formally invested with his honour by the [[Governor-General of India]], the [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Earl of Willingdon]], in April 1932.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33816 |date=12 April 1932 |page=2398 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence,&lt;ref name=banerji&gt;{{cite book |title=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a centenary tribute

He was the [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Andhra University]] from 1931 to 1936. In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not public at the time. Further nominations for the award would continue steadily into the 1960s. In 1939 Pt. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU).{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=90}} He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.

Menon, walks behind President Kennedy at West Wing Entrance, White House, Washington, D.C on 4 June 1963]]
Radhakrishnan started his political career "rather late in life",{{sfn|Bron|1970|p=152}} after his successful academic career.{{sfn|Bron|1970|p=152}} His international authority preceded his political career.{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}} In 1931 he was nominated to the League of Nations [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|Committee for Intellectual Cooperation]], where after "in Western eyes he was the recognized Hindu authority on Indian ideas and a persuasive interpreter of the role of Eastern institutions in contemporary society."{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}} When India became independent in 1947, Radhakrishnan represented India at [[UNESCO]] (1946–52) and was later [[Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union]], from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice-President of India in 1952, and elected as the second President of India (1962–1967).

Radhakrishnan did not have a background in the Congress Party, nor was he active in the struggle against British rules.  He was the ''politician in shadow''.
{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}} His motivation lay in his pride of [[Hindu culture]], and the defence of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}} According to Brown,

{{quote|He had always defended Hindu culture against uninformed Western criticism and had symbolized the pride of Indians in their own intellectual traditions.{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}}}}

===Teachers' Day===
When he became the President of India, some of his students and friends requested him to allow them to celebrate his birthday, on 5 September. He replied,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if September 5th is observed as Teachers' Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/philosopher-teacher-president-remembering-dr-s-radhakrishnan/life-as-a-teacher/slideshow/60374990.cms |title=Philosopher, teacher, president: Remembering Dr S Radhakrishnan |date=2017-09-05 |work=[[The Economic Times]] |access-date=2018-04-16 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Along with [[Ghanshyam Das Birla]] and some other social workers in the pre-independence era, Radhakrishnan formed the Krishnarpan Charity Trust.

==Philosophy==
Radhakrishnan tried to bridge eastern and western thought,{{sfn|Schillp|1992}} defending Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism",{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=153}} but also incorporating Western philosophical and religious thought.{{sfn|Sharf|1998}}

===Advaita Vedanta===
Radhakrishnan was one of the most prominent spokesmen of [[Neo-Vedanta]].{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Hacker|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=179}} His metaphysics was grounded in [[Advaita Vedanta]], but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for a contemporary understanding.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#H2 Michael Hawley, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975)'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world. Nicholas F. Gier: "Ramakrsna, Svami Vivekananda, and Aurobindo (I also include M.K. Gandhi) have been labeled "neo-Vedantists," a philosophy that rejects the Advaitins' claim that the world is illusory. Aurobindo, in his ''The Life Divine'', declares that he has moved from Sankara's  "universal illusionism" to his own "universal realism" (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term."{{sfn|Gier|2013}}}} Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but "a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real."&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;

===Intuition and religious experience===
{{See also|Mysticism#Mystical experience|l1=Mystical experience|Religious experience}}

"Intuition", or ''anubhava'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; synonymously called "religious experience",&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; has a central place in Radhakrishnan's philosophy as a source of knowledge which is not mediated by conscious thought.{{sfn|Sharf|1998}} His specific interest in experience can be traced back to the works of [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Francis Herbert Bradley]] (1846–1924), [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), and [[Friedrich von Hügel]] (1852–1925),{{sfn|Sharf|1998}} and to [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} who had a strong influence on Radhakrisnan's thought.{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=179}} According to Radhakrishnan, intuition is of a self-certifying character (''svatassiddha''), self-evidencing (''svāsaṃvedya''), and self-luminous (''svayam-prakāsa'').&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; In his book ''An Idealist View of Life'', he made a powerful case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely intellectual forms of thought.&lt;ref group=web &gt;{{cite web |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/September/engpdf/1-4.pdf|title=The Great Indian Philosopher : Dr. Radhakrishnan|publisher=State Govt. Of Orissa |format=PDF |accessdate=November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Radhakrishnan, ''intuition'' plays a specific role in all kinds of experience.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; Radhakrishnan discernes five sorts of experience:&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;
# Cognitive Experience:
## Sense Experience
## Discursive Reasoning
## Intuitive Apprehension
# Psychic Experience
# Aesthetic Experience
# Ethical Experience
# Religious Experience

===Classification of religions===

For Radhakrishnan, theology and creeds are intellectual formulations, and symbols of religious experience or "religious intuitions".&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; Radhakrishnan qualified the variety of religions hierarchically according to their apprehension of "religious experience", giving Advaita Vedanta the highest place:&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|This qualification is not unique to Radhakrishnan. It was developed by nineteenth-century Indologists,{{sfn|King|1999|p=169}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13}} and was highly influential in the understanding of Hinduism, both in the west and in India.{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}}}
# The worshippers of the Absolute
# The worshippers of the personal God
# The worshippers of the incarnations like Rama, Kṛiṣhṇa, Buddha
# Those who worship ancestors, deities and sages
# The worshippers of the petty forces and spirits

Radhakrishnan saw Hinduism as a scientific religion based on facts, apprehended via intuition or religious experience.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; According to Radhakrishnan, "[i]f philosophy of religion is to become scientific, it must become empirical and found itself on religious experience".&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; He saw this empiricism exemplified in the Vedas:

{{quote|The truths of the ṛṣis are not evolved as the result of logical reasoning or systematic philosophy but are the products of spiritual intuition, dṛṣti or vision. The ṛṣis are not so much the authors of the truths recorded in the Vedas as the seers who were able to discern the eternal truths by raising their life-spirit to the plane of universal spirit. They are the pioneer researchers in the realm of the spirit who saw more in the world than their followers. Their utterances are not based on transitory vision but on a continuous experience of resident life and power. When the Vedas are regarded as the highest authority, all that is meant is that the most exacting of all authorities is the authority of facts.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;}}

From his writings collected as The Hindu View of Life, Upton Lectures, Delivered at Manchester College, Oxford, 1926: "Hinduism insists on our working steadily upwards in improving our knowledge of God. The worshippers of the absolute are of the highest rank; second to them are the worshippers of the personal God; then come the worshippers of the incarnations of Rama, Krishna, Buddha; below them are those who worship deities, ancestors, and sages, and lowest of all are the worshippers of petty forces and spirits. The deities of some men are in water (i.e., bathing places), those of the most advanced are in the heavens, those of the children (in religion) are in the images of wood and stone, but the sage finds his God in his deeper self. The man of action finds his God in fire, the man of feeling in the heart, and the feeble minded in the idol, but the strong in spirit find God everywhere". The seers see the supreme in the self, and not the images."

To Radhakrishnan, Advaita Vedanta was the best representative of Hinduism, as being grounded in intuition, in contrast to the "intellectually mediated interpretations"&lt;ref group="web" name="IEP" /&gt; of other religions.&lt;ref group="web" name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|''Anubhava'' is a central term in Shankara's writings. According to several modern interpretators, especially Radakrishnan, Shankara emphasises the role of personal experience (''anubhava'') in ascertaining the validity of knowledge.{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=1-14}} Yet, according to Rambacham himself, ''sruti'', or textual authority, is the main source of knowledge for Shankara.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}}} He objected against charges of "quietism"{{refn|group=note|Sweetman: "[T]he supposed quietist and conservative nature of Vedantic thought"{{sfn|Sweetman|2004|p=13-14}}}} and "world denial",{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=179-181}} instead stressing the need and ethic of social service,{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=179-181}} giving a modern interpretation of classical terms as ''tat-tvam-asi''.{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=180}} According to Radhakrishnan, Vedanta offers the most direct intuitive experience and inner realisation, which makes it the highest form of religion:
{{quote|The Vedanta is not a religion, but religion itself in its most universal and deepest significance.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;}}

Radhakrishnan saw other religions, "including what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,"&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby Hinduising all religions.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;

Although Radhakrishnan was well-acquainted with western culture and philosophy, he was also critical of them. He stated that Western philosophers, despite all claims to [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], were influenced by [[theology|theological]] influences of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Charles Moore (eds.), ''A Source Book in Indian Philosophy'', Princeton: Princeton University Press 1989, 610–639&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy on Indian Philosophy book ==
In the issue of the Modern Review, January [[1929]] a certain [[Jadunath Sinha]] made a sensational claim that his own thesis was copied by his teacher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on ''Indian Philosophy'' book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/742051|title=Subcontinental plagiarism|last=Bakhtiar|first=Idrees|date=2012-08-14|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/editorial/letters-to-the-editor/do-sarvepalli-radhakrishnan-write-the-book-of-indian-philosophy-controversy-arises-1.858698?ref=letters-to-the-editor-new-stry|title=সম্পাদক সমীপেষু: জেনে রাখা ভাল|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that none other than Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had plagiarised from him.

Then without any conclusion the court hushed up this sensational issue as Radhakrishnan’s stature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Influence==
Radhakrishnan was one of India's best and most influential twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Pollock"/&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;

Radhakrishnan's defence of the Hindu traditions has been highly influential,{{sfn|Sharf|1998|p=100}} both in India and the western world. In India, Radhakrishnan's ideas contributed to the formation of India as a nation-state.{{sfn|Long|2007|p=173}} Radhakrishnan's writings contributed to the hegemonic status of Vedanta as "the essential worldview of Hinduism".{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=199}} In the western world, Radhakrishnan's interpretations of the Hindu tradition, and his emphasis on "spiritual experience", made Hinduism more readily accessible for a western audience, and contributed to the influence Hinduism has on modern [[spirituality]]:
{{quote|In figures such as Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan we witness Vedanta traveling to the West, where it nourished the spiritual hunger of Europeans and Americans in the early decades of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=199}}}}

===Appraisal===
Radhakrishnan has been highly appraised. According to Paul Artur Schillp:

{{quote|Nor would it be possible to find a more excellent example of a living "bridge" between the East and the West than Professor Radhakrishnan. Steeped, as Radhakrishnan has been since his childhood, in the life, traditions, and philosophical heritage of his native India, he has also struck deep roots in Western philosophy, which he has been studying tirelessly ever since his undergraduate college-days in Madras Christian College, and in which he is as thoroughly at home as any Western philosopher.{{sfn|Schillp|1992|p=ix}}}}

And according to Hawley:

{{quote|Radhakrishnan's concern for experience and his extensive knowledge of the Western philosophical and literary traditions has earned him the reputation of being a bridge-builder between India and the West. He often appears to feel at home in the Indian as well as the Western philosophical contexts, and draws from both Western and Indian sources throughout his writing. Because of this, Radhakrishnan has been held up in academic circles as a representative of Hinduism to the West. His lengthy writing career and his many published works have been influential in shaping the West's understanding of Hinduism, India, and the East.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;}}

===Criticism and context===
Radhakrishnan's ideas have also received criticism and challenges, for their perennialist{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} and universalist claims,{{sfn|Mazumdar|Kaiwar|2009|p=36}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and the use of an East-West dichotomy.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;

====Perennialism====
{{Main|Perennial philosophy}}

According to Radhakrishnan, there is not only an underlying "divine unity"{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} from the seers of the Upanishads up to modern Hindus like Tagore and Gandhi,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} but also "an essential commonality between philosophical and religious traditions from widely disparate cultures."{{sfn|King|2001}} This is also a major theme in the works of [[Rene Guenon]], the [[Theosophical Society]], and the contemporary popularity of eastern religions in modern [[spirituality]].{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Sharf|1998}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} Since the 1970s, the Perennialist position has been criticised for its essentialism.{{sfn|Sharf|1998}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} Social-constructionists give an alternative approach to religious experience, in which such "experiences" are seen as being determined and mediated by cultural determants:{{sfn|Sharf|1998}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{refn|group=note|See, especially, [[Steven T. Katz]]:
* ''Mysticism and Philosophical Analysis'' (Oxford University Press, 1978)
* ''Mysticism and Religious Traditions'' (Oxford University Press, 1983)
* ''Mysticism and Language'' (Oxford University Press, 1992)
* ''Mysticism and Sacred Scripture'' (Oxford University Press, 2000)}} As Michaels notes:
{{quote|Religions, too, rely not so much on individual experiences or on innate feelings – like a ''sensus numinosus'' (Rudolf Otto) – but rather on behavioral patterns acquired and learned in childhood.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=100}}}}

Rinehart also points out that "perennialist claims notwithstanding, modern Hindu thought is a product of history",{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} which "has been worked out and expressed in a variety of historical contexts over the preceding two hundreds years."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} This is also true for Radhakrishan, who was educated by missionaries{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} and, like other neo-Vedantins used the prevalent western understanding of India and its culture to present an alternative to the western critique.{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004}}

====Universalism, communalism and Hindu nationalism====
According to Richard King, the elevation of Vedanta as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta as the "paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion"{{sfn|King|2002|p=128}} by colonial Indologists but also neo-Vedantins served well for the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]], who further popularised this notion of Advaita Vedanta as the pinnacle of Indian religions.{{sfn|King|2002|p=129-130}} It

{{quote|...provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression.{{sfn|King|2002|p=133}}}}

This "opportunity" has been criticised. According to Sucheta Mazumdar and Vasant Kaiwar,

{{quote|... Indian nationalist leaders continued to operate within the categorical field generated by politicized religion [...] Extravagant claims were made on behalf of Oriental civilization. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's statement – "[t]he Vedanta is not a religion but religion itself in its "''most universal and deepest significance''" – is fairly typical.{{sfn|Mazumdar|Kaiwar|2009|p=36}}}}

Rinehart also criticises the inclusivism of Radhakrishnan's approach, since it provides "a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|Rinehart: "Though neo-Hindu authors prefer the idiom of tolerance to that of inclusivism, it is clear that what is advocated is less a secular view of toleration than a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth. Thus Radhakrishnan's view of experience as the core of religious truth effectively leads to harmony only when and if other religions are willing to assume a position under the umbrella of Vedanta. We might even say that the theme of neo-Hindu tolerance provided the Hindu not simply with a means to claiming the right to stand alongside the other world religions, but with a strategy for promoting Hinduism as the ultimate form of religion itself."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}}} According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is [[Communalism (South Asia)|communalism]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} the idea that "all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.pluralindia.com/book/Illustrated_prmier/Chapter_5.pdf Ram Puniyani, ''COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5'']&lt;/ref&gt; Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and that "the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda."{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} Yet Rinehart also points out that it is

{{quote|...clear that there isn't a neat line of causation that leads from the philosophies of Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan to the agenda of [...] militant Hindus.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Neither is Radhakrishnan's "use" of religion in the defence of Asian culture and society against colonialism unique for his person, or India in general. The complexities of Asian nationalism are to be seen and understood in the context of colonialism, modernisation and [[nation-building]]. See, for example, [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], for the role of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lankese struggle for independence,{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[D.T. Suzuki]], who conjuncted [[Zen]] to [[Nihonjinron|Japanese nationalism]] and [[Bushido|militarism]], in defence against both western hegemony ''and'' the pressure on Japanese Zen during the [[Meiji Restoration]] to conform to [[Shinbutsu Bunri]].{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-A}}}}}}

====Post-colonialism====
{{Main|Orientalism|Post-colonialism}}

Colonialism left deep traces in the hearts and minds of the Indian people, influencing the way they understood and represented themselves.{{sfn|King|2001}} The influences of "colonialist forms of knowledge"&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; can also be found in the works of Radhakrishnan. According to Hawley, Radhakrishnan's division between East and West, the East being spiritual and mystical, and the West being rationt and colonialist forms of knowledge constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Arguably, these characterizations are "imagined" in the sense that they reflect the philosophical and religious realities of neither "East' nor West."&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;

Since the 1990s, the colonial influences on the 'construction' and 'representation' of Hinduism have been the topic of debate among scholars of Hinduism{{sfn|Sweetman|2004}} Western Indologists are trying to come to more neutral and better-informed representations of India and its culture, while Indian scholars are trying to establish forms of knowledge and understanding which are grounded in and informed by Indian traditions, instead of being dominated by western forms of knowledge and understanding.{{sfn|Sweetman|2004}}{{refn|group=note|Sweetman mentions:

====Plagiarism Controversy====
Radhakrishnan was accused of Plagiarism by his student Jadunath Sinha  who accused him of  copying from his  doctoral thesis, "Indian Psychology of Perception" published in 1925 in his book "Indian Philosophy" published in 1927. Jadunath Sinha filed a case in the [[Calcutta High Court]] claiming damages for Rs 20000. Radhakrishnan filed counter case for defamation of character demanding Rs 100000 from Sinha. Though Jadunath Sinha's case was strong as many of his articles were already published, the High cost of litigation along with intervention of [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]] who mediated between them made them  settle the issue out of court.&lt;ref name="Minor1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Neil Minor|title=Radhakrishnan: A Religious Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LzRkWABC6sC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=10 September 2017|year=1987|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-554-5|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyo.in/politics/teachers-day-dr-sarvepalli-radhakrishnan-education-universities/story/1/19357.html | title=Why Teachers' Day in India is a sham | publisher=Dailyo | date=6 September 2017 | accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dawn.com/news/742051 | title=Subcontinental plagiarism | publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] | work=Idrees Bakhtiar | date=14 August 2012 | accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social equality''' is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same status in certain respects, including [[civil rights]], [[freedom of speech]], [[property rights]] and equal access to certain social goods and services. However, it also includes concepts of [[health equality]], [[economic equality]] and other social securities. It also includes equal opportunities and obligations, and so involves the whole of society. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced [[social class]] or [[caste]] boundaries and the absence of [[discrimination]] motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity.&lt;ref name="Blackford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackford|first1=Russell|date=July 20, 2006|title=Genetic enhancement and the point of social equality|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/689/%20Genetic%20enhancement%20and%20the%20point%20of%20social%20equality|journal=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sex, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability must absolutely not result in [[equal justice under law|unequal treatment under the law]] and should not reduce opportunities unjustifiably.

''[[Equal opportunity|Equal opportunities]]'' is interpreted as being judged by ability, which is compatible with a free-market economy. Relevant problems are [[horizontal inequality]] − the inequality of two persons of ''same'' origin and ability and differing opportunities given to individuals − such as in (education) or by inherited capital.

Conceivements of social equality may vary per philosophy and individual and other than [[egalitarianism]] it does not necessarily require all social inequalities to be eliminated by artificial means but instead often recognizes and respects natural differences between people.

==Ontological==
The standard of equality that states everyone is created equal at birth is called '''ontological equality'''. This type of equality can be seen in many different places like the [[Declaration of Independence]]. This early document, which states many of the values of the [[United States of America]], has this idea of equality embedded in it. It clearly states that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights". The statement reflects the philosophy of [[John Locke]] and his idea that we are all equal in certain [[natural rights theory|natural rights]].  Although this standard of equality is seen in documents as important as the Declaration of Independence, it is "one not often invoked in policy debates these days".&lt;ref name=YMAY&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself|date=2013|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this notion of equality is often used to justify inequalities such as material inequality. Dalton Conley claims that ontological equality is used to justify material inequality by putting a spotlight on the fact, legitimated by theology, that "the distribution of power and resources here on earth does not matter, because all of us are equally children of God and will have to face our maker upon dying". [[Dalton Conley]], the author of ''You May Ask Yourself'', claims that ontological equality can also be used to put forth the notion that poverty is virtue. [[Luciano Floridi]], author of a book about [[information]], wrote about what he calls the ontological equality principle. His work on information ethics raises the importance of equality when presenting information. Here is a short sample of his work:
:Information ethics is impartial and universal because it brings to ultimate completion the process of enlargement of the concept of what may count as a centre of a (no matter how minimal) [[morality|moral claim]], which now includes every instance of being understood informationally, no matter whether physically implemented or not. In this respect information ethics holds that every entity as an expression of being, has a dignity constituted by its mode of existence and essence (the collection of all the elementary properties that constitute it for what it is), which deserve to be respected (at least in a minimal and overridable sense), and hence place moral claims on the interacting agent and ought to contribute to the constraint and guidance of his ethical decisions and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Very Short Introductions : Information: A Very Short Introduction|date=2010|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Floridi goes onto claim that this "ontological equality principle means that any form of reality (any instance of information/being), simply for the fact of being what it is, enjoys a minimal, initial, overridable, equal right to exist and develop in a way which is appropriate to its nature."&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;
Values in his claims correlate to those shown in the sociological textbook ''You May Ask Yourself'' by Dalton Conley. The notion of "ontological equality" describes equality by saying everything is equal by nature. Everyone is created equal at birth. Everything has equal right to exist and develop by its nature.&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;

==Opportunity==
{{Main article|Equality of opportunity}}

Another standard of equality is equality of opportunity, "the idea that everyone has an equal chance to achieve wealth, social prestige, and power because the rules of the game, so to speak, are the same for everyone".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt; This concept can be applied to society by saying that no one has a head start. This means that, for any social equality issue dealing with wealth, social prestige, power, or any of that sort, the equality of opportunity standard can defend the idea that everyone had the same start. This views society almost as a [[game]] and any of the differences in equality are due to luck and playing the "game" to one's best ability. Conley gives an example of this standard of equality by using a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] to describe society. He claims that "Monopoly follows the rules of equality of opportunity" by explaining that everyone had an equal chance when starting the game and any differences were a result of the luck of the dice roll and the skill of the player to make choices to benefit their wealth. Comparing this example to society, the standard of equality of opportunity eliminates inequality because the rules of the games in society are still fair and the same for all; therefore making any existing inequalities in society fair. Lesley A. Jacobs, the author of ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities: The Theory and Practice of Egalitarian Justice'', talks about equality of opportunity and its importance relating to egalitarian [[justice]]. Jacobs states that 
:at the core of equality of opportunity... is the concept that in competitive procedures designed for the allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the benefits and burdens of social life, those procedures should be governed by criteria that are relevant to the particular goods at stake in the competition and not by irrelevant considerations such as race, religion, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors that may hinder some of the competitors’ opportunities at success. (Jacobs, 10). 
This concept points out factors like [[race (biology)|race]], [[gender]], [[social class|class]] etc. that should not be considered when talking about equality through this notion. Conley also mentions that this standard of equality is at the heart of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois society]], such as a modern capitalist society, or "a society of commerce in which the maximization of profit is the primary business incentive".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  It was the equal opportunity ideology that civil rights activists adopted in the era of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s. This ideology was used by them to argue that [[Jim Crow laws]] were incompatible with the standard of equality of opportunity.

==Condition==
{{Main article|Leveling mechanism}}
Another notion of equality introduced by Conley is equality of condition. Through this framework is the idea that everyone should have an equal starting point. Conley goes back to his example of a game of Monopoly to explain this standard. If the game of four started off with two players both having an advantage of $5,000 dollars to start off with and both already owning hotels and other property while the other two players both did not own any property and both started off with a $5,000 dollar deficit, then from a perspective of the standard of equality of condition, one can argue that the rules of the game "need to be altered in order to compensate for inequalities in the relative starting positions".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  From this we form policies in order to even equality which in result bring an efficient way to create fairer [[competition]] in society. Here is where [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] comes into play where we change society in order to give an equality of [[human condition|condition]] to everyone based on race, gender, class, religion etc. when it is made justifiable that the proponents of the society makes it unfair for them.

Sharon E. Kahn, author of ''Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University'', talks about equality of condition in their work as well and how it correlates to [[freedom]] of individuals. They claim that in order to have individual freedom there needs to be equality of condition "which requires much more than the elimination of legal barriers: it requires the creation of a [[level playing field]] that eliminates structural barriers to opportunity".&lt;ref name="CAN: UBC Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahn|first1=Sharon|title=Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University|date=2000|publisher=CAN: UBC Press|location=Vancouver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSlKx1Lxlz8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=equality&amp;f=false|isbn=9780774808088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work talks about the academic structure and its problem with equalities and claims that to "ensure equity...we need to recognize that the [[university]] structure and its organizational culture have traditionally privileged some and marginalized other; we need to go beyond theoretical concepts of equality by eliminating systemic barriers that hinder the equal participation of members of all groups; we need to create and equality of condition, not merely an equality of opportunity".&lt;ref name="CAN: UBC Press"/&gt; "Notions of equity, diversity, and inclusiveness begin with a set of premises about individualism, freedom and rights that take as given the existence of deeply rooted inequalities in social structure," therefore in order to have a culture of the inclusive university, it would have to "be based on values of equity; that is, equality of condition" eliminating all systemic barriers that go against equality.&lt;ref name="CAN: UBC Press"/&gt;

==Outcome==
{{Main article|Equality of outcome}}
A fourth standard of equality is equality of outcome, which is "a position that argues each player must end up with the same amount regardless of the fairness".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  This ideology is predominately a [[Marxist philosophy]] that is concerned with equal distribution of power and resources rather than the rules of society. In this standard of equality, the idea is that "everyone contributes to society and to the economy according to what they do best.".&lt;ref name=YMAY/&gt;  Under this notion of equality, Conley states that "nobody will earn more power, prestige, and wealth by working harder".

When defining equality of outcome in [[education]], "the goals should not be the liberal one of equality of access but equality of outcome for the median number of each identifiable non-educationally defined group, i.e. the average women, negro, or proletarian or rural dweller should have the same level of educational attainment as the average male, white, suburbanite".&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Martin|title=Welfare &amp; Human Nature : The Human Subject in Twentieth-Century Social Politics|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome and the benefits from equality from education from this notion of equality promotes that all should have the same outcomes and benefits regardless of race, gender, religion etc. The equality of outcome in Hewitt's point of view is supposed to result in "a comparable range of achievements between a specific [[disadvantaged]] group – such as an ethnic [[minority group|minority]], women, lone parents and the disabled – and society as a whole".&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">'''Textual entailment''' ('''TE''') in [[natural language processing]] is a directional relation between text fragments. The relation holds whenever the truth of one text fragment follows from another text. In the TE framework, the entailing and entailed texts are termed ''text (t)'' and ''hypothesis (h)'', respectively. Textual entailment is not the same as pure [[entailment|logical entailment]] — it has a more relaxed definition: "''t'' entails ''h''" (''t'' ⇒ ''h'') if, typically, a human reading ''t'' would infer that ''h'' is most likely true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/publications/RTEChallenge.pdf Ido Dagan, Oren Glickman and Bernardo Magnini. The PASCAL Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge, p. 2] ''in:'' Quiñonero-Candela, J.; Dagan, I.; Magnini, B.; d'Alché-Buc, F. (Eds.) ''Machine Learning Challenges. Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', Vol. 3944, pp. 177-190, Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternatively: ''t'' ⇒ ''h'' if and only if, typically, a human reading ''t'' would be justified in inferring the proposition expressed by ''h'' from the proposition expressed by ''t''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korman|first=Daniel Z.|last2=Mack|first2=Eric|last3=Jett|first3=Jacob|last4=Renear|first4=Allen H.|date=2018-03-09|title=Defining textual entailment|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=69|issue=6|pages=763–772|doi=10.1002/asi.24007|issn=2330-1635|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KORDTE|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The relation is directional because even if "''t'' entails ''h''", the reverse "''h'' entails ''t''" is much less certain.&lt;ref name="daga2004"&gt;[http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/publications/ProbabilisticTE_fv07.pdf Dagan, I. and O. Glickman. 'Probabilistic textual entailment: Generic applied modeling of language variability'] in: ''PASCAL Workshop on Learning Methods for Text Understanding and Mining'' (2004) Grenoble.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tata"&gt;[http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/events/CALP07/papers/6.pdf Tătar, D. e.a. ''Textual Entailment as a Directional Relation'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Determining whether this relationship holds is an informal task, one which sometimes overlaps with the formal tasks of [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] (satisfying a strict condition will usually imply satisfaction of a less strict conditioned); additionally, textual entailment partially subsumes [[entailment (linguistics)|word entailment]].  

==Examples==
Textual entailment can be illustrated with examples of three different relations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=Textual_Entailment_Portal Textual Entailment Portal] on the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] wiki&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a '''positive TE''' (text entails hypothesis) is:
*text: ''If you help the needy, God will reward you''.
:hypothesis: ''Giving money to a poor man has good consequences''.

An example of a '''negative TE''' (text contradicts hypothesis) is:
*text: ''If you help the needy, God will reward you''.
:hypothesis: ''Giving money to a poor man has no consequences''.

An example of a '''non-TE''' (text does not entail nor contradict) is:
*text: ''If you help the needy, God will reward you''.
:hypothesis: ''Giving money to a poor man will make you a better person''.

==Ambiguity of natural language==

A characteristic of natural language is that there are many different ways to state what you want to say: several meanings can be contained in a single text and that the same meaning can be expressed by different texts. This variability of semantic expression can be seen as the dual problem of language ambiguity. Together they result in a [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] mapping between language expressions and meanings. The task of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasing]] involves recognizing when two texts have the same meaning and creating a similar or shorter text that conveys almost the same information. Textual entailment is similar&lt;ref name="Ion2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Androutsopoulos|first1=Ion|last2=Malakasiotis|first2=Prodromos|title=A Survey of Paraphrasing and Textual Entailment Methods|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|volume=38|pages=135–187|year=2010|doi=10.1613/jair.2985|url=https://www.jair.org/media/2985/live-2985-5001-jair.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2017|arxiv=0912.3747}}&lt;/ref&gt; but weakens the relationship to be unidirectional. Mathematical solutions to establish textual entailment can be based on the directional property of this relation, by making a comparison between some directional similarities of the texts involved.&lt;ref name="tata" /&gt;

== Approaches ==

Textual entailment measures [[natural language understanding]] as it asks for a semantic interpretation of the text, and due to its generality remains an active area of research. Many approaches and refinements of approaches have been considered, such as [[word embedding]], logical models, graphical models, rule systems, contextual focusing, and machine learning.&lt;ref name="Ion2009" /&gt; Practical or large-scale solutions avoid these complex methods and instead use only surface syntax or lexical relationships, but are correspondingly less accurate.&lt;ref name="daga2004" /&gt; However, even state-of-the-art systems are still far from human performance; a study found humans to be in agreement on the dataset 95.25% of the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bos|first1=Johan|last2=Markert|first2=Katja|title=Recognising Textual Entailment with Logical Inference|journal=Proceedings of the Conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing|date=1 January 2005|pages=628–635|doi=10.3115/1220575.1220654|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9757/a78f70b9a2e5975ebec01e9452c1caf75739.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while algorithms from 2016 had not yet achieved 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Zhao|first1=Kai|last2=Huang|first2=Liang|last3=Ma|first3=Mingbo|title=Textual Entailment with Structured Attentions and Composition|date=4 January 2017|eprint=1701.01126|class=cs.CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Many natural language processing applications, like [[question answering]] (QA),  [[information extraction]] (IE),  [[automatic summarization|summarization]], [[multi-document summarization|multi-document]] summarization, and evaluation of [[machine translation]] (MT) systems, need to recognize that a particular target meaning can be inferred from different text variants. Typically entailment is used as part of a larger system, for example in a prediction system to filter out trivial or obvious predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shani|first1=Ayelett|title=How Dr. Kira Radinsky Used Algorithms to Predict Riots in Egypt|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.554263|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=Haaretz|date=25 October 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Natural Ontological Attitude'''" (1984) is the name of a paper published by philosopher [[Arthur Fine]] in which he coins the term "natural ontological attitude" (NOA). It deals with the [[philosophy of science]]. He published a sequel, "And Not Antirealism Either"&lt;ref&gt;''Noûs'' 18, pp. 51-65, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year, and both papers were later anthologized in the book ''The Shaky Game'' (1986).

==Overview==
Fine published "The Natural Ontological Attitude"&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific Realism'', pp. 83-107, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984 and a sequel, "And Not Antirealism Either"&lt;ref&gt;''Nous'' 18, pp. 51-65, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. His subject is the nature and validity of scientific knowledge and his goal is to get the reader to abandon either realism or antirealism as he understands them. In their place he advocates a "natural ontological attitude" (NOA). Both articles were republished as chapters in Fine's book ''The Shaky Game,''&lt;ref&gt;''The Shaky Game'', pp. 112-50, University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; which takes its title from a comment by Einstein that physicists who undermine causality in physics are playing a shaky/risky game.

Fine argues that both realists and anti-realists share a basic "core" position about both everyday things and scientific statements. Realists and antirealists both trust the evidence of their senses that tables, chairs and other people are present before us and in some sense exist. They also trust the substantiated pronouncements of science that protons and electrons exist and have the size, mass and charge science assigns them. To quote Fine about such common ("core") positions: "…it is possible to accept the evidence of one's senses and accept, ''in the same way'' [his italics], the confirmed results of science….".&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'', p. 127,&lt;/ref&gt; Stated another way: "…both realist and antirealist accept the results of scientific investigations as 'true,' on par with more homely [commonplace, everyday] truths."

Fine asks, if everybody, realist and antirealist included, shares a core position about entities that exist and propositions that are true (e.g., F = ma) where do the differences lie? They lie, according to Fine, in the additions that partisans make to the core. Antirealists may add "the pragmatic…[or] instrumentalist…[or] conventionalist conceptions of truth…[or maybe add an overlay of] idealism, constructivism, phenomenalism [or] empiricism."&lt;ref&gt;''Shakey Game'', pp. 128-29,&lt;/ref&gt; Spelling out what realists add to the core position takes Fine a long paragraph that boils down to simply one charge: "correspondence with the world … claims about reality."&lt;ref&gt;''Shakey Game'', p. 129,&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine then goes on. "It seems to me that when we contrast the realist and the antirealist in terms of what they each want to add to the core position, a third alternative emerges—and an attractive one at that. It is the core position itself, ''and all by itself'' [his italics]."&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' p. 129,&lt;/ref&gt;  Fine continues, "…at heart, the grip of realism only extends to the homely connection of everyday truths with scientific truths, and that good sense dictates our acceptance of the one on the same basis as our acceptance of the other, then the homely line makes the core position, all by itself, a compelling one...."&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' pp. 129-30,&lt;/ref&gt;

Realism itself is unpalatable to Fine because of the realist's desire to connect truths about an entity (say the mass or charge of an electron) to an actual, existing entity (electron). It is permissible to believe in the properties of an electron but not in the electron itself as the bearer of those properties. That is the mistake realists make. Yet Fine admits that the working scientist believes "…in the existence of those entities to which his theories refer."&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' p. 130,&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fine concedes that practitioners of science are in no need of the goals, interpretations or justifications of science that theorists can provide.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'', top of p. 148,&lt;/ref&gt; And although scientists may discover more and more properties of, or facts about, an entity, Fine insists that we should not confuse successive advances in our knowledge of an entity with closer approximations as to what that entity actually is.

Antirealists also come under criticism. Theorists who define truth in terms of "acceptance" (rational agreement), or behaviorism or empiricism are all "truthmongers" who are seeking some foundation, some rationale, for what they believe. They make the same basic mistake as the realists since they "rely on metaphysical or epistemological hearing aids"&lt;ref&gt;''Shaky Game'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; to hear the voice of science. Only NOA is immune from these delusions and distractions. Fine concludes ''And Not Antirealism Either'' by arguing that truth is a semantical concept and not an ontological or metaphysical concept. He argues that those who wish to ground "truth" in correspondence, empiricism, pragmatism, acceptance, etc. are all making the same fundamental mistake. Embrace NOA he argues and be non-judgmental and heuristic in your pursuit of knowledge. Reject the concept of "truth" as a gold standard to which all knowledge must be compared or evaluated.

==Criticism==
Since Fine criticizes both realists and antirealists he has come in for criticism from both sides. Many critics could not resist some word play with NOA/NOAH, ark, and "Fine."&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Schlagel, "Critical Notice: Fine's 'Shaky Game' (and Why NOA is no Ark for Science)", ''Philosophy of Science,'' Vol. 58, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 307-323. Also the Musgrave article below.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Musgrave]] argues that Fine distorts the varied positions of antirealists especially with regard to their support of the "core."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Musgrave, "NOA'S Ark -- Fine for Realism," ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 39 No. 157, pp. 383-98.&lt;/ref&gt; He and others object to the way Fine equates his "core" position with their definition (or anti-definition) of "true."

Robert Klee writes: "NOA seems like obvious inconsistent fence-sitting."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Klee, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Science: Cutting Nature at Its Seams'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Schlagel writes "I find it utterly implausible that Fine could be serious when he argues that explanatory success could have nothing at all to do with truth."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Cutting Nature at Its Seams'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stathis Psillos]] writes "When is the question of theory-acceptance scientifically relevant, and when is it not? Fine refrains from saying, perhaps, because, in the final analysis, it always is relevant."&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
The '''title-transfer theory of contract''' ('''TTToC''') is a [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legal]] interpretation of [[contract]]s developed by [[economist]] [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[jurist]] [[Williamson Evers]]. The theory interprets all contractual obligations in terms of [[property rights]],&lt;ref name="The ethics of liberty 19"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|title=The ethics of liberty.|year=1982|publisher=Humannities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, N.J.|isbn=0-391-02371-3|chapter=19|quote=Their error is a failure to realize that the right to contract is strictly derivable from the right of private property}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewing a contract as a bundle of [[Title (property)|title]] transfers. The TTToC stands in oppositions to most mainstream contract theories which view contractual obligations as the result of a binding promise.&lt;ref name="SOME PROBLEMS WITH CONTRACT AS PROMISE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=E. Barnett|first=Randy|title=Some Problems With Contract As Promise|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=July 1992|url=http://randybarnett.com/some.htm#Document0zzFN_Fd|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123005617/http://randybarnett.com/some.htm#Document0zzFN_Fd|archivedate=2013-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fried|first=Charles|title=Contract as Promise|year=1981 |publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-16925-5 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/about/privatelaw/contract.as.promise.1.56.fried.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the approach often claim it is superior on grounds of both consistency and ethical considerations. The TTToC is often supported by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]s.

==Interpretation of contracts==
The TTToC considers a contract to be a transfer of property titles between parties to the contract. Title transfers can be [[Causality|conditional]], implying a title transfer is to take effect only if a specified condition is met, as well as future oriented implying a title transfer is to take effect at a specified future point in time. For example, in a [[loan]] contract the lender transfers title to the principal to the borrower, and the borrower transfers to the lender a future title to the amount of the principal plus the interest. When the loan matures the transfer of title from borrower to lender takes effect, and the lender is entitled to obtain the money, which now belongs to him. It is important to mention the lender is entitled to obtain the money only when that money exists and is in the possession of the borrower. Another example is a [[service (economics)|service provision]] contract in which the [[service (economics)|service consumer]] transfers a future title of money to a service provider ''on the condition'' that a certain act of service is performed. If the service is not provided the condition of the transfer is not met and the conditional title transfer of money does not take effect. Contracts can be agreed upon either by explicit verbal agreement (as is the case with formal written contracts) or by [[Implied-in-fact contract|implicit]] representation of agreement (as is the case when a restaurant order is placed by a passerby).

==Fraud==
Under the TTToC [[breach of contract]] is only what can be interpreted as an act of [[theft]].&lt;ref name="A LIBERTARIAN THEORY OF CONTRACT: TITLE TRANSFER, BINDING PROMISES, AND INALIENABILITY"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinsella|first=N. Stephan|title=A Libertarian Theory of Contract: Title Transfer, Binding Promised, and Inalienability|journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies|date=Spring 2003|volume=17|pages=11–37|quote=Ultimately, contracts are enforced simply by recognizing that the transferee, instead of the previous owner, is the current owner of the property. If the previous owner refuses to turn over the property transferred, he is committing an act of aggression (trespass, use of the property of another without permission) against which force may legitimately be used.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a specified condition for a conditional title transfer from party A to party B is not met, yet party B still captures possession of the property he is not entitled to, he has committed theft, whether the possession was taken by force, or [[Larceny#Larceny by trick|by false representation of fact]] creating the impression the transfer conditions has been met.

If a service provider has failed to perform an act of service, he has not committed theft. In such cases provisions should be made in advanced for the non-breaching party to be entitled to compensation, in the condition of a failure to provide the agreed upon service.

==Implications==
Since the TTToC is based on property rights, it is compatible with the [[non-aggression principle]]. The TTToC ensures ownership of every owned good is well defined at any point in time. Contracts regarding unalienable property titles are not binding. Some argue that since [[self-ownership|ownership of one's body]] is unalienable, [[voluntary slavery]] contracts are not binding under the TTToC.&lt;ref name="The ethics of liberty 19 2"&gt;{{citation|quote=Each man has control over his own will and person, and he is, if you wish, “stuck” with that inherent and inalienable ownership. Since his will and control over his own person are inalienable, then so also are his rights to control that person and will. That is the ground for the famous position of the Declaration of Independence that man’s natural rights are inalienable; that is, they cannot be surrendered, even if the person wishes to do so.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Promises that are not made with the intention of being legally binding are also non-enforceable under the TTToC.&lt;ref name="SOME PROBLEMS WITH CONTRACT AS PROMISE 2"&gt;{{cite journal|quote=But a moral theory of promising, standing alone, would have courts enforcing purely moral commitments, which is tantamount to legislating virtue. Such an open-ended rationale leads to serious problems for the value of freedom of contract. First, it commits courts to enforcing promissory commitments that the parties themselves may never have contemplated as "contractual" or legally enforceable, thereby undermining the value of freedom from contract. Second, once the moral behavior of the promissor is deemed relevant to the issue of enforceability, the promise theory also appears to make relevant to the issue of enforcement other moral aspects of the promisor's behavior that may argue against enforcement, thereby undermining the value of freedom to contract. In this manner, the common-law rights of contract can come to resemble the judicial discretion of a court of equity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Understand}}

'''Understanding''' is a [[psychological]] process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a [[person]], situation, or [[message]] whereby one is able to think about it and use [[concept]]s to deal adequately with that object.
Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bereiter|first=Carl|title=Education and mind in the Knowledge Age|url=http://www.cocon.com/observetory/carlbereiter/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225000806/http://www.cocon.com/observetory/carlbereiter/|archivedate=2006-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding is often, though not always, related to learning concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability to predict the behaviour of an object, animal or system—and therefore may, in some sense, understand it—without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal or system in their culture. They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognised standard concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make [[inference]]s.

==Examples==
# One understands the weather if one is able to [[prediction|predict]] (e.g. if it is very cloudy, it may rain) and/or give an [[explanation]] of some of its features, etc.
# A [[psychiatrist]] understands another person's [[anxiety|anxieties]] if he/she knows that person's anxieties, their causes, and can give useful [[Advice (opinion)|advice]] on how to cope with the anxiety.
# One understands a piece of [[rhetoric|reasoning]] or an [[logical argument|argument]] if one can consciously reproduce the information content conveyed by the message.
# One understands a [[language]] to the extent that one can reproduce the information content conveyed by a broad range of spoken utterances or written messages in that language.

==Shallow and deep==
Someone who has a more sophisticated understanding, more predictively accurate understanding, and/or an understanding that allows them to make explanations that others commonly judge to be better, of something, is said to understand that thing "deeply". Conversely, someone who has a more limited understanding of a thing is said to have a "shallow" understanding. However, the depth of understanding required to usefully participate in an occupation or activity may vary greatly.

For example, consider [[multiplication]] of [[integer]]s. Starting from the most shallow level of understanding, we have (at least) the following possibilities:

# A small child may not understand what multiplication is, but may understand that it is a type of [[mathematics]] that they will learn when they are older at school. This is "understanding of context"; being able to put an as-yet not-understood concept into some kind of context. Even understanding that a concept is not part of one's current knowledge is, in itself, a type of understanding (see the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]], which is about people who do not have a good understanding of what they do not know).
# A slightly older child may understand that multiplication of two integers can be done, at least when the numbers are between 1 and 12, by looking up the two numbers in a [[times table]]. They may also be able to memorise and recall the relevant times table in order to answer a multiplication question such as "2 times 4 is what?". This is a simple form of operational understanding; understanding a question well enough to be able to do the operations necessary to be able to find an answer.
# A yet older child may understand that multiplication of larger numbers can be done using a different method, such as [[long multiplication]], or using a [[calculator]]. This is a more advanced form of operational understanding because it supports answering a wider range of questions of the same type.
# A teenager may understand that multiplication is repeated addition, but not understand the broader implications of this. For example, when their teacher refers to multiplying 6 by 3 as "adding 6 to itself 3 times", they may understand that the teacher is talking about two entirely equivalent things. However, they might not understand how to ''apply'' this knowledge to implement multiplication as an [[algorithm]] on a [[computer]] using only addition and [[loop (computing)|looping]] as basic constructs. This level of understanding is "understanding a definition" (or "understanding the definition" when a concept only has one definition).
# A teenager may also understand the mathematical idea of abstracting over individual whole numbers as variables, and how to efficiently (i.e. not via trial-and-error) solve algebraic equations involving multiplication by such variables, such as &lt;math&gt;2x = 6&lt;/math&gt;. This is "relational understanding"; understanding how multiplication relates to division.
# An [[undergraduate]] studying mathematics may come to learn that "the integers equipped with multiplication" is merely one example of a range of mathematical structures called [[monoid|monoids]], and that theorems about monoids apply equally well to multiplication and other types of monoids.

For the purpose of operating a [[cash register]] at [[McDonald's]], a person does not need a very deep understanding of the multiplication involved in calculating the total price of two [[Big Mac]]s. However, for the purpose of contributing to [[number theory]] research, a person would need to have a relatively deep understanding of multiplication — along with other relevant arithmetical concepts such as division and [[prime number]]s.

== Assessment ==
It is possible for a person, or a piece of "intelligent" software, that in reality only has a shallow understanding of a topic, to appear to have a deeper understanding than they actually do, when the right questions are asked of it. The most obvious way this can happen is by [[memorization]] of correct answers to known questions, but there are other, more subtle ways that a person or computer can (intentionally or otherwise) deceive somebody about their level of understanding, too. This is particularly a risk with [[artificial intelligence]], in which the ability of a piece of artificial intelligence software to very quickly try out millions of possibilities (attempted solutions, theories, etc.) could create a misleading impression of the real depth of its understanding. Supposed AI software could in fact come up with impressive answers to questions that were difficult for unaided humans to answer, without really understanding the concepts ''at all'', simply by dumbly applying rules very quickly. (However, see the [[Chinese room]] argument for a controversial philosophical extension of this argument.)

[[Test (assessment)|Examinations]] are designed to assess students' understanding (and sometimes also other things such as knowledge and writing abilities) without falling prey to these risks. They do this partly by asking multiple different questions about a topic to reduce the risk of [[measurement error]], and partly by forbidding access to reference works and the outside world to reduce the risk of someone else's understanding being passed off as one's own. Because of the faster and more accurate computation and memorization abilities of computers, such tests would arguably often have to be modified if they were to be used to accurately assess the understanding of an artificial intelligence.

Conversely, it is even easier for a person or artificial intelligence to fake a ''shallower'' level of understanding than they actually have; they simply need to respond with the same kind of answers that someone with a more limited understanding, or no understanding, would respond with — such as "I don't know", or obviously wrong answers. This is relevant for judges in [[Turing test]]s; it is unlikely to be effective to simply ask the respondents to mentally calculate the answer to a very difficult arithmetical question, because the computer is likely to simply dumb itself down and pretend not to know the answer.

==As a model==
[[Gregory Chaitin]], a noted computer scientist, propounds a view that comprehension is a kind of [[data compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin |url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192140/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Limits of Reason", he argues that ''understanding'' something means being able to figure out a simple set of rules that explains it. For example, we understand why day and night exist because we have a simple [[conceptual model|model]]—the rotation of the earth—that explains a tremendous amount of data—changes in brightness, temperature, and atmospheric composition of the earth. We have compressed a large amount of information by using a simple model that [[prediction|predicts]] it. Similarly, we understand the number [[repeating decimal|0.33333...]] by thinking of it as one-third. The first way of representing the number requires five concepts ("0", "decimal point", "3", "infinity", "infinity of 3"); but the second way can produce all the data of the first representation, but uses only three concepts ("1", "division", "3"). Chaitin argues that comprehension is this ability to compress data.

==Components==
=== Cognition and affect ===
{{Main article | cognition | affect (psychology)}}
Cognition is the process by which [[sense|sensory]] inputs are transformed. Affect refers to the experience of feelings or [[emotion]]s. Cognition and affect constitute understanding.

==Religious perspectives==
In [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], understanding is one of the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].

'''Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki''' ({{lang-la|Laurentius Grimaldius Goslicius}}; between 1530 and 1540 &amp;ndash; 31 October 1607) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[szlachcic|nobleman]], [[Bishop of Poznań]] (1601–1607), political thinker and philosopher best known for his book ''[[De optimo senatore]]'' (1568).

==Biography==
Born near [[Płock]], after studying at [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]] and at [[Padua]] and [[Bologna]],&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt; he entered the Roman Catholic Church. In 1569 he also joined the Polish [[kanclerz|royal chancery]] and as a secretary served two kings, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and [[Stephen Báthory|Stefan Batory]], and was successively appointed bishop of [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (1586), [[Chełm]] (1590), [[Przemyśl]] (1591), and [[Poznań]] (1601).&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gos_tr"/&gt; Goślicki was a man of affairs,  highly esteemed by contemporaries, and frequently engaged in active politics. He was also a staunch advocate of [[religious tolerance]] in Poland. It was due to his influence and to a letter that he wrote to the Pope against the [[Jesuits]] that they were prevented from establishing schools at [[Kraków]] during his reign. He was the only [[prelate]] who, in 1587, acceded to the [[Warsaw Confederation]].

Goślicki's Latin book ''[[De optimo senatore]]'' (published during his stay in Italy in Venice, 1568&lt;ref name="Gos_tr"/&gt;) and dedicated to King Zygmunt August, subsequently appeared in four English translations: as ''The Counsellor'' ( considered inaccurate) in 1598, ''A commonwealth of good counsaile'' in 1607, ''The Accomplished Senator... Done into English... By Mr. Oldisworth'' in 1733, and most recently as ''The Accomplished Senator'' in K. Thompson's translation in 1992. The book proved immensely important in Britain among forces opposed to the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy; it was widely quoted and cited in opposition pamphlets and leaflets during the period leading up to the [[British Civil Wars]] of the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;Poland’s 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, 22 September 1998 http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book Goślicki shows the ideal statesman who is well versed in the humanities as well as in economy, politics, and law. He argued that law is above the ruler, who must respect it, and that it is illegitimate to rule over a people against its will. He equated godliness with reason, and reason with law.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt; Many of the book's ideas comprised the foundations of Polish [[History of Poland (1569–1795)|Nobles' Democracy]] (1505–1795) and were based on 14th-century writings by [[Stanisław of Skarbimierz]].  The book was not translated into Polish for 400 years.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;

[[Image:6 Poznan 129.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Goślicki's tomb in [[Poznań]] cathedral]]

The book was influential abroad, exporting the ideas of Poland's [[Golden Freedom]] and democratic system. It was a political and social classic, widely read and long popular in England after its 1598 translation;&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/Criticism/shakespearein/poland2.html What Did Shakespeare Know About Poland? Internet Shakespeare Editions]&lt;/ref&gt; read by [[Elizabeth I of England]], it was also known by [[Shakespeare]], who used his depiction of an incompetent senator as a model for [[Polonius]] in [[Hamlet]].&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt; Its ideas might be seen in the turmoil that gripped England around the times of [[Glorious Revolution]].&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt; Goślicki's ideas were perhaps suggestive for future national constitutions. Goślicki never wrote that "all men are created equal," but did say, "Sometimes a people, justly provoked and irritated, by the Tyranny and Usurpations of their Kings, take upon themselves the undoubted Right of vindicating their own liberties." The book was allegedly read by [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Algernon Sydney]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] (who had it in his library&lt;ref name="Jefflib"&gt;[http://info-poland.icm.edu.pl/classroom/constitution.html The Constitution of 3 May 1791] by Hon. Carl L. Bucki&lt;/ref&gt;), but there is no evidence of a direct link with Jefferson's [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;[[Daniel H. Cole]], "From Renaissance Poland to Poland's Renaissance. The Struggle for Constitutionalism in Poland by Mark Brzezinski," ''Michigan Law Review'', Vol. 97, No. 6, 1999 pp. 2062–2102, says (p 2075) the direct link between Goślicki and Jefferson remains elusive—that is no one has shown Jefferson read Goślicki, although it was so asserted by the Polish ambassador to the U.S. in 1932. {{jstor|1290243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goślicki argued that distinguished senators were more useful to a state than the king or the common people:
:For the king, being alone, cannot see everything and it often happens that either he yields to desires or his emotions disturb his ability of discretion. Also an ignorant crowd without a thought and head (as a proverb says) cannot by any means possess such prudence, while the senate, composed of men distinguished by virtue, prudence, and glory of accomplished deeds is capable from its middle position, as if from an observation point, of caring for the common weal of the state, perceiving those matters which are beneficial, and freeing it from disturbances, rebellions, and dangers.&lt;ref name="Gos_tr"&gt;Wawrzyniec Goślicki, [http://staropolska.gimnazjum.com.pl/ang/renaissance/goslicki.php3 THE ACCOMPLISHED SENATOR Book One] Translated by [[Michael J. Mikoś]]. Contains short bio.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an influence in the framing the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791]], which historian [[Norman Davies]] calls "the first constitution of its kind in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA699 |first=Norman |last=Davies |title=Europe: A History |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=699 |isbn=0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4564">The '''White House Big Dig''' was the name used in press reports to describe a multi-year construction project at the [[White House]] that began in September 2010 and temporarily concluded in 2012, with a second phase planned for the future. According to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA), the $376-million project, which involved a multi-story excavation adjacent to the [[West Wing]], was to replace electrical wiring and update air conditioning. A second phase of the project, with an unannounced start date, will involve a similar excavation adjacent to the [[East Wing]]. Funds for the White House Big Dig were allocated by a congressional appropriation made in late 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White House 'Big Dig': West Wing entrance fenced off|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post_now/post/white-house-big-dig-west-wing-entrance-fenced-off/2011/04/04/AFvegfbC_blog.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huff"/&gt;

Despite the utilitarian description of its purpose, the project came to be the object of intense media speculation. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' characterized the GSA description of the project as a "nothing to see here story" while ''[[The New York Times]]'', citing an anonymous source, claimed it was "security-related construction."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Storey|first1=Will|title=Big Hole in White House Lawn Prompts Equally Big Questions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/us/big-hole-on-white-house-lawn-prompts-speculation.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davenport|first1=Christian|title=In the Nation's Capital, Underground is Where it's At|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-the-nations-capital-underground-is-where-its-at/2011/11/22/gIQABFo42N_story.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Associated Press]] reported that a privacy screen was placed around the construction site for its duration and sub-contractors on the project were required to cover identifying marks or logos on their company vehicles, measures it implied were unusual.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Mark|title=White House Big Dig Remains A Mystery As Construction Wraps Up|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/white-house-big-dig-remai_n_1877484.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=[[Huffington Post]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]], meanwhile, equated the construction project as a "mystery" on-par with "what happened to the [[dinosaur]]s".

'''''Zen and the Art of Consciousness''''' (2011), originally titled&lt;ref name=BlackmorePsychologyToday&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackmore|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Blackmore| title='Ten Zen Questions' - is there a better title?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ten-zen-questions/201008/ten-zen-questions-is-there-better-title|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=7 July 2014|date=23 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Ten Zen Questions''''' (2009), is a book by [[Susan Blackmore]]. It describes her thoughts during [[zazen]] retreats and other self-directed meditative exercises, and how those thoughts relate to the [[neuroscience]] of [[consciousness]]. Most chapters in the book center around a [[Zen]] question and describe Blackmore's inner monologue contemplating the question's implications for subjective experience. The final chapter features a response by Blackmore's Zen teacher.

==Summary==

Blackmore regards her book as an "attempt to see whether looking directly into one's own mind can contribute to a science of consciousness."

Blackmore practices Zen, though she's not a [[Buddhist]] herself. Rather, "I am someone with a questioning mind who has stumbled upon Zen and found it immensely helpful." Some of Blackmore's questions are not strictly Zen but rather come from [[Mahamudra]] traditions, though she got them from a Zen instructor, John Crook.&lt;ref name=Bodhipaksa2009 /&gt;

Blackmore's discussion revolves around ten questions, discussed in the following sections.&lt;ref name=BookContents&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackmore|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Blackmore|title=Contents|url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Books/Tenzen/contents.htm|website=Dr. Susan Blackmore|accessdate=7 July 2014|date=25 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1. Am I conscious now?===

Blackmore asks herself, "Am I conscious now?" and answers "Of course I am. Yes, I am conscious now." But she feels as though by asking the question, she has in a sense "awakened" herself, which leads her to wonder if she was conscious just before asking. She repeatedly asks herself the question, each time saying "yes". As she continues asking it over the years, the "waking up" experience becomes more gradual. Likewise, asking the question all the time becomes easier, and eventually, "The words aren't really necessary any more. Rather, there just seems to be a questioning attitude, an openness of mind."

===2. What was I conscious of a moment ago?===

Blackmore tries to figure out what she was conscious of just beforehand. When she asks, she can remember many sensations—for instance, the wood floor and the cat's purr. It seems as though she had been aware of them for a while back in time, yet she only seemed to "notice" them when she thought about the question. Likewise, Blackmore thinks about her breath, which "is always there", but she's not sure if she was watching it prior to asking the question.

Blackmore is skeptical of current efforts to find [[neural correlates of consciousness]] because "if I don't know which sights and sounds I was conscious of, and which I was not, then this whole line of scientific research must be entirely misguided."

===3. Who is asking the question?===

Blackmore probes who "she" is. One approach is to find "a boundary, or edge, or divide" between what she's looking at and the person doing the looking. For instance, noticing a twist of her hair, she asks, "Am I this side of the hair and the experiences the other? No. That’s silly." She tries to trace a path from the external world through to herself, but she can never find herself. "Look for the viewing self and find only the view. I am, it seems, the world I see."

===4. Where is this?===

Blackmore observes flowers and asks where resides the experience of them—e.g., their yellowness. Clearly it's not in the flowers themselves because, for instance, what looks yellow to Blackmore would look different to a bee with a very different visual system. Another option is that the color is represented by a pattern of neural firing in her [[visual cortex]], but it's not clear why that neural activity is "yellow itself".

===5. How does thought arise?===

Blackmore reflects on the nature of "abiding in tranquillity and moving in thought." She notices that her thoughts can seem to take on "parallel threads". Some thoughts "happen right here, in the midst of tranquillity" while others are more active. The latter "drag part of the mind away" and split it in two. Blackmore envisions this "as a theory about what is happening in the brain, with groups of neurons organising themselves in different places, their patterns arising and falling away, though with no experiencing self."

===6. There is no time. What is memory?===

Blackmore asks whether time exists. She thinks about the present, past, future, and imaginary things. She realizes that "Although I can label them differently, and they vary in vividness and how much confidence I have in their details, they all seemed to be made of the same kind of stuff."

===7. When are you?===

Blackmore recounts experiences during mindfulness when she felt as though she could "leap off into nothingness" and briefly not exist. She feels as though events in the world arise from nothingness, "springing up out of no-place and no-time".

===8. Are you here now?===

Blackmore considers the metaphor of "life as a string of beads" and rejects it because her mind seems to contain "many streams" of experience that "arise and fall away, their observers coming and going with them." Her reflection leads her to agree with [[Daniel Dennett]]'s critique of the [[Cartesian theater]]. Instead her experience is closer to Dennett's [[multiple-drafts model]]. She also feels how to ''be'' her own thoughts, reminiscent of [[William James]]'s view that "''thought is itself the thinker'', and psychology need not look beyond".

===9. What am I doing?===

Blackmore explores the absence of [[free will]] in a causally closed universe. After having pondered the problem for a long time, Blackmore's sense of free will faded:
{{quote|This seems to be all that happens; decisions are made because of countless interacting events, and afterwards a little voice inside says "I did that", "I decided to do that".}}
Still, Blackmore learned during a Zen retreat that she could ''take'' responsibility. Once a decision was made, "That's what happened, these are the consequences. Things just are the way they are."

===10. What next?===

Blackmore explores questions of [[reincarnation]], self-continuity, and "the timeless, emptiness, or void, or whatever it is, out of which phenomena appear."

==Reactions==

[[Steven Poole]] said Blackmore writes "in a style that is deliberately fragmentary, a succession of false starts or paths petering out into nothingness (which may also be the point)." He compared some parts to "a surreal existential horror novel".&lt;ref name=Poole2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poole|first1=Steven|title=Ten Zen Questions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/14/ten-zen-questions|accessdate=7 July 2014|agency=The Guardian|date=13 Mar 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenny Doe noted that Blackmore's prose "is not always up to the job of capturing the profundity and mystery of the Zen experience, and occasionally ends up reminiscent of the ramblings of a stoned student." That said, Doe feels the book is a great starting point for laypeople to explore philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name=Doe2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doe|first1=Jenny|title=Introspection as methodology|journal=The Psychologist|date=Aug 2009|volume=22|issue=8|page=686|url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=22&amp;editionID=178&amp;ArticleID=1549|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Freeman welcomed Blackmore's investigation of conscious experience. He recommended reading the book "slowly and reflectively" because of its dense meditative tone. "The reading becomes a reliving of the experience."&lt;ref name=Freeman2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Anthony|title=Susan Blackmore: ''Ten Zen Questions''|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|date=2009|volume=16|issue=2-3|pages=206–207|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/16_2-3%20books.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]] noted how Blackmore's views on the self as a construction make sense of her previous work arguing that [[near-death experiences]] are also a construction of the mind. He feels the book "should be compulsory reading for anyone in consciousness studies and certainly on every psychology course" and that if more scientists introspected as Blackmore does, "consciousness research would follow an entirely different and more progressive path."&lt;ref name=Fenwick2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenwick|first1=Peter|title=Am I Conscious Now?|journal=Network Review|date=2009|volume=99|publisher=The Scientific and Medical Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodhipaksa calls Blackmore's "an extraordinary book: a sometimes heady but deeply rewarding read." He notes how Blackmore's discussion parallels some classic ideas from Buddhism, including the distinction between awareness and awareness of awareness. Bodhipaksa criticizes Blackmore's inference from becoming aware of sounds that happened in the past to assuming that her consciousness of them is "an attribution made later" because he points out that sounds can persist in [[echoic memory]] for 4 seconds: "A lot of Blackmore's descriptions of mindfulness seem to have involved paying attention to what’s in echoic memory rather than what she was currently listening to." Finally, Bodhipaksa notes that some of Blackmore's use of terminology was loose and may reflect "a 'feeling' of significance that hasn't been fully thought out or articulated."&lt;ref name=Bodhipaksa2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodhipaksa|title="Ten Zen Questions," by Susan Blackmore|url=http://www.wildmind.org/blogs/book-reviews/ten-zen-questions-by-susan-blackmore|website=Wildmind|accessdate=7 July 2014|date=12 Mar 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron Sloman]] found Blackmore's book to be "an excellent read if you have the right kind of interest and the right kind of patience." He found the book valuable as an account of what it feels like to be puzzled "about consciousness, freedom, self, the relationships between mind and brain," but he said it fails to consider the standpoint of ''designing'' a thinking system and therefore misses out on useful insights. He feels "the attempt to understand consciousness simply by gazing inwardly at it can have limited success." It might be "like trying to make the [[Tracing (software)|trace]]-printing portion of a debugging package trace itself." Sloman also feels that Blackmore's rejection of "contents of consciousness", "the self", and "free will" are based too much on confused notions of what those things mean, and "she has not considered the right sorts of explanations" for those concepts. Nevertheless, Sloman thinks ''Zen and the Art of Consciousness'' "may become a classic because of the unique combination of qualities the author brings to it."&lt;ref name=Sloman2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sloman|first1=Aaron|title=Comments on Susan Blackmore, Zen and the Art of Consciousness, Paperback: Oneworld Publications, 2011, Previously published as: Ten Zen Questions|url=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/blackmore-zen-consciousness.html|website=Home Page: Aaron Sloman|accessdate=7 July 2014|date=14 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
