      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45940">The '''[[American Psychological Association]] (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct''' (for short, the '''Ethics Code''',  as referred to by the APA) includes an introduction, preamble, a list of five aspirational principles and a list of ten enforceable standards that [[psychologists]] use to guide ethical decisions in practice, research, and education. The principles and standards are written, revised, and enforced by the APA. The code of conduct is applicable to psychologists in a variety of areas across a variety of contexts. In the event of a violation of the code of conduct, the APA may take action ranging from termination of the APA membership to the loss of licensure, depending on the violation. Other professional organizations and licensing boards may adopt and enforce the code.

The first version was published by the APA in 1953.&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; The need for such a document came after psychologists were taking on more professional and public roles post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; A committee was developed and reviewed situations submitted by psychologists in the field who felt they had encountered ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; The committee organized these situations into themes and included them in the first document which was 170 pages in length.&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; Over the years, a distinction was made between aspirational principles and enforceable standards. Since, there have been nine revisions with the most recent published in 2002 and amended in 2010.&lt;ref name="Current Code" /&gt;

Despite the development and use of a complete ethical code, there have still been ethical violations and controversies.  For instance, although the APA takes an explicit stance against [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation" /&gt; this treatment remains controversial amongst many psychologists and religious groups and is still being practiced by some.&lt;ref name="josephnicolosi.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Nicolosi {{ndash}} Reparative Therapy|url=http://josephnicolosi.com/|website=Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also some disagreement within the field about the ethical implications of using a treatment that may be less effective than another known treatment, although some psychologists argue that all therapy treatments are equally effective (see: the [[Dodo bird verdict]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ahn, Hyun-nie|author2=Wampold, Bruce|last-author-amp=yes|title=Where oh where are the specific ingredients?

Bush|Bush administration]].  This presented an obvious violation of the organization's code of ethics and has been addressed by the APA in the form of reports, responses to media outlets, amendments to policies, and rejections of the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|title=Timeline of APA Policies &amp; Actions Related to Detainee Welfare and Professional Ethics in the Context of Interrogation and National Security|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/statements/interrogations.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction and preamble===
The introduction of the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct is designed to describe the document's purpose. It also informs the reader of its organization, applicability, and procedural matters.&lt;ref name="Current Code" /&gt; The introduction states that the code applies to psychologists' scientific, educational, and professional roles, that may include "clinical psychology; counseling psychology; school psychology; research; teaching; supervision; public service; policy development; social intervention; development of assessment instruments; conducting assessments; educational counseling; organizational counseling; forensic activities; program design and evaluation; and administration," (pg. 2)&lt;ref name="Current Code" /&gt; The introduction also includes information on what contexts these situations apply to, including electronic and face-to-face communication. It provides information on the procedures for filing an ethical complaint, along with a description the investigation process and possible outcomes.&lt;ref name="Current Code" /&gt; The preamble is a description of aspirations which the American Psychological Association expects of psychologists, and reviews the main purpose for having such an ethical code.&lt;ref name="Current Code" /&gt;

===General ethical principles===
There are five general principles that serve as the ideals to which psychologists should aspire within the profession. The principles represent ethical goals but do not explicitly inform or instruct adherence to the goals; instead, the principles aim to influence and to guide professional behavior with respect to the psychologist, research subjects, students, and the individuals who seek psychological services.

====Principle A: Beneficence and nonmaleficence====
The beneficence and non maleficence principle of the APA general principles guides psychologists to perform work that is beneficial to others yet does not hurt anyone in the process of carrying out that work. Psychologists are to remain aware of their professional influence and the potential consequences therein on individuals and groups who seek counsel with the psychologist, especially with respect to preventing misuse or abuse, while additionally maintaining awareness of how the psychologist's own physical and mental health may influence their work. Among professional interactions and research, psychologists ought to respect and protect the rights and welfare of patients and participants.

====Principle B: Fidelity and responsibility====
The fidelity and responsibility principle of the APA general principles inspires psychologists to cultivate a professional and scientific environment built upon trust, accountability, and ethical considerations. Psychologists are bound to the community by way of their profession and must conduct themselves in a responsible and ethical manner while also maintaining a similar check on colleagues. Furthermore, psychologists are expected to altruistically devote some of their time to the community.

====Principle C: Integrity====
The integrity principle of the APA general principles aims to encourage psychologists to engage in honest, transparent practices within all aspects of the field of psychology. That is, psychologists should not engage in behavior that could be misconstrued as dishonest, exploitative, or otherwise malicious. When [[deception]] is appropriately used (most likely during psychological research), psychologists have a responsibility to mitigate the effects of its use on the overall field.

====Principle D: Justice====
The justice principle of the APA general principles states that people are entitled to the advances made within the field of psychology and to the services offered by professionals within the field. Furthermore, psychologists should prevent unjust practices by remaining aware of their biases, level of competence, and area and limits of expertise.

====Principle E: Respect for people's rights and dignity====
The APA general principle concerning respect for people's rights and dignity recognizes individuals' rights to privacy and confidentiality. Psychologists are to respect the individuals' rights while also acknowledging the worth of the individual by taking judicious precautions and engaging in positive, professional interactions, avoiding the influence of any personal bias towards the individual or group. This entails awareness of the vulnerabilities experienced by any particular population of people and necessitates understanding of and respect for diversity, including, but not limited to, factors concerning gender, race, religion, disability, and socioeconomic status.

===Ethical standards===

The ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct put forth by the APA consists of ten ethical standards. The ethical standards are enforceable rules applicable for psychologists in academia and practice. These are written broadly to guide psychologists in varied areas and roles, addressing situations most psychologists may encounter in their professional roles. The types of situations include those related to resolving ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising and public statements, record keeping and fees, education and training, research and publication, assessment, and therapy. The ethical standards are enforced for the benefit of the psychologists, clients, students, and other individuals that work with psychologists. Any psychologist that is a member of the APA is expected to adhere to the ethical standards. Any violation of an ethical standard may result in sanctions ranging from termination of APA membership to loss of licensure.

====Resolving ethical issues====
The resolving ethical issues section of the APA Ethical Standards is broadly designed to guide psychologists through a variety of ethical issues. One of the first sections describes how to approach when the work of psychologists' is misused or misrepresented, such as happens in the popular press. Psychological research is often misrepresented. Two of the sections describe how to resolve conflicts between the ethical code of psychologists and a variety of governing bodies, laws, or regulations as well as organizational demands related to working as a psychologist. There is a section related to informal resolution of ethical violations for situations where such a resolution is possible while protecting confidentiality. If the incident extends beyond being able to be resolved informally, there are guidelines for reporting ethical violations as well as working with and cooperating with ethics committees. In regards to ethical complaints, there is also a section outlining what might be considered an improper complaint. Lastly, the Resolving Ethical Issues section describes unfair discrimination against complainants and respondents to protect those involved in ethics related investigations.

====Competence====
The competence section of the APA Ethical Standards is designed to guide psychologists in how to define their own competence and how to approach clients or patients that might fall outside of that area of expertise. This ethical standard begins by helping psychologists define the boundaries of their own competence. The different types of mental health related problems and potential treatments are highly varied. It is impossible for a psychologists to be competent in all areas, and in fact, unethical to attempt to portray themselves in such a way. If a psychologist feels that he/she has not been trained to ensure competence in a specific area to treat a client, he/she should make an appropriate referral. This ethical standard also provides psychologists with guidelines on providing services in emergency situations. Although psychologists should refrain from providing service outside of their area of competence, in times of emergency the psychologist is obligated to help where possible. Psychologists are also required to maintain competence. This is usually done through the completion of continuing education credits. This standard also provides the psychologist with a bases from which to make scientific and professional judgment in an ethically consistent manner. Outlines are also provided for delegating work to others and resolving personal problems and conflicts.

====Human relations====
The human relations section of the APA Ethical Standards provides psychologists guidance with how to approach situations related to the process of working with people in a helping field. This section outlines how to identify and avoid unfair discrimination, sexual harassment, and other types of verbal and nonverbal harassment. These types of behavior have strong adverse influences on mental health. As such, psychologists must be particularly vigilant in identifying and avoiding these kinds of behavior. This section also outlines how to avoid harm when treating patients. Some treatments have been shown to cause harm, and as such, should be avoided. The section also provides guidance for navigating and avoiding a number of multiple relationships. Situations where a clinician has more than one relationship with the client beyond just being a client can be difficult to navigate, which can also lead to conflicts of interest, which are also covered. Guidance is also provided for how to approach requests for service from third-parties, that is, when someone other than the patient is requesting services for the said patient. Exploitative relationships are also covered and should be avoided, according to the ethical standards. This section provides guidance for cooperating with other professionals, which is often a situation faced in multi-disciplinary treatment teams. Guidance is provided for providing and obtaining informed consent for treatment. Another section outlines how to provide psychological services to or through organizations. And lastly, guidance is provided for how to navigate situations in which there is an interruption of psychological services for various reasons.

====Privacy and confidentiality====
The privacy and confidentiality section of the APA Ethical Standards is written to help provide psychologists with guidelines for maintaining appropriate confidentiality and respecting the privacy of the clients and patients under their care. Specific guidelines are provided for maintaining confidentiality for the psychologist's patients as well as discussing the limits of confidentiality with them. In certain situations where the safety of the patient or others is at risk, confidentiality must be broken as law enforcement needs to be motivated. Guidelines are also provided for how to ethically record therapy sessions for various reasons including training. Steps are covered for the psychologist to minimize intrusions on privacy for patients. Sections on disclosures and consultations provide guidance on how and when psychologists should disclose information and how to ethically consult with other professionals while maintaining appropriate levels of confidentiality. Lastly, this section guides psychologists on how and when to use confidential information for didactic or other purposes while protecting confidentiality of the client.

====Advertising and other public statements====
The advertising and other public statements section of the APA Ethical Standards is designed to guide psychologists through the process of advertising their practice and making other types of public statements. This section begins by outlining how to avoid false and deceptive statements, in specific of one's level of competence. As described in the competence section, it is unethical to provide services outside of your area of expertise. The section also outlines statements by others regarding a psychologist's work and competence. The section goes on to outline how to accurately and honestly describe workshops and non-degree granting educational programs. Media presentations and testimonials regarding one's work, and how to do so ethically and accurately, is also covered. This section also states that obtaining testimonials from past or current clients is not acceptable.{{citation needed|reason=Section 5.05 regarding testimonials does not refer to past clients|date=June 2016}} The section closes by outlining how to ethically navigate situations of in-person solicitation of services.

====Record keeping and fees====
The record keeping and fees standard of the APA ethical standards is developed to guide psychologists in maintaining records of professional and scientific work in confidentiality. This standard states that maintaining records allow professionals to share information with other professionals if needed, help replicate research findings, and abide by the requirements of the institution and the law. In an event of an emergency, psychologists are not allowed to withhold records of clients who have failed to make payments. Psychologists are expected to arrange fees and financial arrangements in compliance with the law and accept barter only in situations that doing so, does not negatively impact the treatment. Psychologists are also expected to maintain and provide accurate reports of treatment, funding, and diagnostic details. This standard also emphasizes that psychologists should receive payment based on the services provided rather than the referral.

====Education and training====
The education and training standard of the APA ethical standards is designed to help psychologists create high-quality programmes that train future psychologists with appropriate knowledge and practice. Psychologists creating education and training programmes are responsible for presenting clear descriptions of the programmes, including the pre-requirements for acceptance and the requirements for completion of the programme. Psychologists are expected to teach accurate and current material supported by scientific evidence. Psychologists should not require students to disclose any personal information, unless it is listed as a programme requirement, or to evaluate whether such experiences are negatively impacting a student's performance. If individual or group therapy is a requirement of the programme, the psychologists are responsible for allowing students to attend individual or group therapy outside of the programme. Furthermore, faculty members are not allowed to provide therapy services to the students. Supervisors are required to provide timely feedback to the students and supervisees based on their performance and the requirements of the programme. Psychologists involved in the programme are prohibited from engaging in sexual relationships with students and supervisees.

====Research and publication====
The research and publication standard of the APA ethical standards is developed to highlight research and publication ethics that psychologists are expected to adhere to. This standard emphasizes the necessity of approval by the institute prior to carrying out the research, providing accurate information about the research study, and carrying out the research in accordance with the approval. When obtaining informed consent, details of the study should be presented to the participants, including but not limited to, the objective of the study, the procedures, benefits and potential risks associated with the study, and the participants' right to decline to participate and withdraw from the study without any penalty. However, studies which are not expected to cause any harm, such as observing in a naturalistic environment, using anonymous questionnaires, or if permitted by the law, informed consent may not be necessary to be obtained. Compensation for participation should not be used to persuade an unwilling participant. At the conclusion of the study, each participant should be presented with a summary of the study and the participant should be provided with an opportunity to ask any questions he/she has. Further, if there has been some harm caused to the participant due to participation in the study, necessary steps should be followed to minimize the harm. This standard also provides guidelines and instructions on animal research. Psychologists are responsible for reporting accurate findings and taking necessary steps to correct any errors in research and publication. Psychologists are also required to only present original data as their work and share publication credits based on the contributions rather than authority. Psychologists are also expected to be willing to share research data when required for verification, and maintain confidentiality of the participants during the review process.

====Assessment====
The assessment standard of the APA ethical standards is developed to broadly address guidelines on assessments. This standard states that the psychologist's views should be supported by findings from assessments, while reporting the limitations of assessments. If a viewpoint is not based on assessment results, psychologists should provide evidence to justify their judgment. Psychologists are responsible for using valid and reliable assessments that are administered in a preferred language by the client. Informed consent is expected to be obtained in accordance to the guidelines on the "Informed Consent" standard, unless the assessment is required by the law, a routine practice or required to test for the ability to make decisions. Psychologists using an interpreter are expected to obtain informed consent from the client for the use of an interpreter as well as maintain confidentiality and test security. Psychologists may refrain from releasing test data in order to protect a participant. Psychologists are also responsible for developing valid and reliable assessments and interpreting test results by taking other factors that may influence the interpretations while also indicating any limitations associated with the interpretations. Psychologists are required to be appropriately trained in order to administer assessments and are responsible for using current tests. Psychologists are also responsible for providing necessary information when outsourcing interpretation and the interpretation of test results. Psychologists are required to explain the test results to the client or other identified persons, unless otherwise specified. Psychologists are also required to maintain security and integrity in regards to all test material.

====Therapy====
The therapy section of the APA ethical standards is broadly written to guide psychologists through various aspects of providing psychological services. Psychologists are required to obtain informed consent from clients prior to treatment by presenting sufficient details about the therapy technique, including how established the treatment is and whether a psychologist in training will be assisting the client. When psychologists are required to provide services in a group setting, psychologists are required to identify the role of the psychologist and notify the clients of the limitations of confidentiality. If a psychologist is required to provide services for a client already receiving mental health services from another professional, the psychologist is required to discuss with the client or other identified persons to minimize conflict and harm. Psychologists should not engage in sexual relationships with current clients or with those closely related to clients. Psychologists should not be sexually engaged with past clients within two years of termination and even after two years of termination, psychologists will have to provide enough details to ensure that this ethical standard is not violated by being involved with a past client. In the event of a termination of employment, necessary steps should be taken in order to ensure client care. Termination of therapy should occur when the client shows significant improvements, does not benefit further from treatment, is being harmed by the treatment, or the clinician is threatened by the client or a person related to the client. Psychologists are expected to prepare clients for termination and provide sources for alternative services.

==History==

===Origins===
"These rules should do much more than help the unethical psychologist keep out of trouble; they should be of palpable aid to the ethical psychologist in making daily decisions." —Nicholas Hobbs (1948, p.&amp;nbsp;81)&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobbs|first1=Nicholas|title=The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology|journal=American Psychologist|date=March 1948|volume=3|issue=3|pages=80–84|doi=10.1037/h0060281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first committee on Ethical Standards for Psychologists was developed in 1947 and chaired by [[Edward Tolman]].&lt;ref name="Decoding the Ethics Code" /&gt; The committee was created because psychologists were becoming more involved in professional activities and public works during and following [[World War II]]. To gain insight on what to include, the committee sought information from psychologists in the field.&lt;ref name="Decoding the Ethics Code" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The first code" /&gt; Psychologists discussed situations in which they felt they encountered ethical dilemmas.

A second committee was formed and headed by [[Nicholas Hobbs]]. This 8-member committee was responsible for the creation of the first document. The committee used contributions from over 2,000 psychologists to create the first principles.&lt;ref name="The first code" /&gt; The committee reviewed the situations submitted by psychologists to the first committee and attempted to organize the situations into themes.&lt;ref name="Decoding the Ethics Code"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Celia B. |authorlink=Celia Fisher |date=2013 |origyear=2003 |chapter=A Code of Ethics for Psychology: How Did We Get Here? |title=Decoding the Ethics Code: A Practical Guide for Psychologists |edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9781412997607 |oclc=794176340 |pages=2–14 |chapterurl=http://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/49938_ch_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes that emerged reflected many of the political and social issues of the time including [[racial segregation]], post-war politics, and the testing industry.&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; The first version of the Ethical Standards of Psychologists was adopted in 1952 and published in 1953 by the American Psychological Association (APA).&lt;ref name="Decoding the Ethics Code" /&gt; The document was over 170 pages in length.&lt;ref name="The first code"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=January 2003 |title=The First Code |journal=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=31 |issue=1 |page=63 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan03/firstcode.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224115533/http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan03/firstcode.aspx |archivedate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version contained many [[ethical dilemma]]s that psychologists had written about and submitted to the first committee as [[case example]]s.

===Revision history===
Revisions to the 1953 version continued over the decades until the most recent version which was published in 2002 and amended in 2010. Each revision has been guided by a set of objectives put forth by Hobbs in 1948: "to express the best ethical practices in the field as judged by a large representative sample of members of the APA; to reflect an explicit value system as well as clearly articulated decisional and behavioral rules; to be applicable to the full range of activities and role relationships encountered in the work of psychologists; to have the broadest possible participation among psychologists in its development and revisions; and to influence the ethical conduct of psychologists by meriting widespread identification and acceptance among members of the discipline".&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt;

Revisions occurred over the years pertaining to many changes in society. [[Culture]], [[politics]], the [[legal system]], the [[economy]] and the [[healthcare]] system have all been influential in the development of the past and current ethical codes. The case examples were also removed.&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; Prior to 1981, there was no principle or standard that addressed conflict between [[law]] and ethics.&lt;ref name="Revision Information" /&gt; One of the biggest changes occurred with the 1992 version of the code. Before this version, there was no distinction between [[principles]] and [[Standard of care|standards]]. This version was the first to make that distinction.&lt;ref name="The development of a code of ethical standards for psychology" /&gt; The principles are considered to be aspirational while the standards are enforceable by agencies adopting them, including the APA.

The current version of the code was developed in 2002, became effective in 2003, and was amended in 2010.&lt;ref name="Current Code"&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Psychological Association|title=Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct|journal=American Psychologist|date=2002|volume=57|pages=1060–1073|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/principles.pdf|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.57.12.1060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments were made to the Introduction and Applicability Sections along with Standard 1.02 Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority and Standard 1.03 Conflicts Between Ethics and Organizational Demands.&lt;ref name="2010 Amendments"&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Psychological Association|title=2010 Amendments to the 2002 "Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct"|journal=American Psychologist|date=2010|volume=65|issue=5|page=493|doi=10.1037/a0020168|pmid=20642307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical controversies==
{{Split portions|American Psychological Association|discuss=Talk:American Psychological Association#Ethical controversies proposed merge|date=August 2015|section=yes}}

===Conversion therapy===
{{See also|Conversion therapy}}

Conversion therapy (also referred to as reparative therapy) is the practice of attempting to change the patient’s [[sexual orientation]] to [[heterosexual]].  Among the most prominent supporters of conversion therapy is the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH), which continues to characterize [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder, despite the declassification of homosexuality as a disorder in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) in 1973.&lt;ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation" /&gt; One of the most notable members of NARTH is founder and former president Dr. [[Joseph Nicolosi]], who practices conversion therapy and has published case studies some of his clients.&lt;ref name="josephnicolosi.com"/&gt;

The American Psychological Association (APA) task force report on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation concluded that conversion therapy was "unlikely to be successful" and involved "some risk of harm".&lt;ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation"&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|title=Report of the Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=Washington, DC: American Psychological Association|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a call to action in 2001, concluding that "there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Office of the Surgeon General (US)|author2=Office of Population Affairs (US)|title=The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior.|journal=U. S. Department of Health and Human Services|date=2001|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44225/|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the task force's report, the APA recommends that therapists adopt an affirmative, supportive approach for clients who present for therapy to change their sexual orientation rather than attempting to convert their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="APA Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation"/&gt;

===Animal research===
{{See also|Animal testing}}

Currently, the APA enforces ethical standards to protect nonhuman animal subjects from unnecessary harm during the research process.  Some of the requirements for using nonhuman animals in research include: proper justification of the research, maintenance and inspection of appropriate housing for the animals, minimizing discomfort and stress whenever possible, and preference of noninvasive measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of Nonhuman Animals in Research|url=http://www.apa.org/science/leadership/care/guidelines.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these guidelines, however, many advocacy groups exist to either reduce or eliminate animal research, arguing that it is unethical to capture animals and subject them to research procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Humane Society of the United States|title=The Humane Society of the United States|url=https://secure.humanesociety.org/site/SPageServer/;jsessionid=FCE8B02875D82EC42BA68E2ED1463192.app304b?pagename=hsus_donation_general_ppc_splash&amp;cr=THSR_Donate&amp;s_src=ad_search_gg_donoracq2015&amp;gclid=CPbGyOWrg8YCFQeKaQodqpYA8w|website=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|title=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|url=http://www.peta.org/|website=PETA|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|title=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|url=https://www.aspca.org/secure/ps-gn-p2?ms=MP_PMK_Googlenonbrand-T4&amp;initialms=MP_PMK_Googlenonbrand-T4&amp;pcode=WPSE9XXGOGN2PK00024&amp;lpcode=WPSE9XXGOGN1PK00024&amp;gclid=CMTpxOGsg8YCFQccaQodXQMAJw|website=The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, a recent study showed that only 52% of the public approves of animal research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pew Research Center|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|journal=Pew Research Center|date=9 July 2009|url=http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/public-praises-science-scientists-fault-public-media/|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scientists believe that this low approval rate is primarily the result of receiving manipulative misinformation from anti-animal research groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Allyson J.|title=Animal research: The bigger picture and why we need psychologists to speak out|url=http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2012/04/animal-research.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence-based practice===
{{See also|Dodo bird verdict}}
A current controversy among mental health professionals is the use of specific psychological treatments which are not strongly supported by research.  Proponents of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement argue that it is unethical to administer a therapeutic intervention with questionable research support (such as [[psychoanalysis]]) when another treatment's effectiveness has been demonstrated for the client's condition, particularly when the intervention in question is potentially harmful (such as conversion therapy).  Proponents argue that administration of an empirically questionable treatment violates the general Principle A of the ethical principles of psychologist: Beneficence and nonmaleficence (or "do no harm").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lilienfeld|first1=Scott O.|title=Psychological Treatments That Cause Harm|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=March 2007|volume=2|issue=1|pages=53–70|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the movement object that all psychotherapies are equally effective (termed "the Dodo bird verdict")&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and assert that restricting therapists to only evidence-based treatments limits opportunities to discover new techniques.  Further complicating the issue is the fact that there is debate about what kind of evidence is needed to constitute "good research support" for or against a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Division 12 of the APA|title=Do all psychologists agree on which treatments are supported by research?|url=http://www.div12.org/psychological-treatments/frequently-asked-questions/#support|website=Society of Clinical Psychology|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychologists involved in torture===
{{See also|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse}}

During the [[Iraq War]], [[Amnesty International]] released a series of reports, calling attention to violations of the human rights of prisoners in [[Abu Ghraib Prison]] and American detention camps, and the role of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in enacting these abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Amnesty International|title=Iraq: Responsibilities of the occupying powers|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/089/2003/en/|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=Amnesty International|date=15 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Irene|title=Open letter from AI Secretary General, Irene Khan to President George Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister José Maria Aznar and President Saddam Hussein|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/027/2003/en/|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=Amnesty International|date=19 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite news|author=Amnesty International|title=Iraq: People come first: Amnesty International's 10-point appeal to all parties involved in possible military action in Iraq|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/022/2003/en/|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=Amnesty International|date=18 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reports called on the occupying powers to protect the human rights of any detained civilians by giving them a fair and timely trial, not detaining civilians arbitrarily, and treating all people ethically while in detention.  Amnesty International also called for justice, by trying individual perpetrators of abuse for their crimes.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

Despite these reports, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] instituted "enhanced" interrogation techniques, stating publicly that reported abuses were isolated incidents, and not standard practice.  Internal memos from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] revealed that an [[executive order]] by [[George W. Bush]] had sanctioned certain interrogation techniques, such as playing loud music, depriving prisoners of sleep, and stripping prisoners of their clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Civil Liberties Union|title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Interested Persons Memo on FBI documents concerning detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay|url=https://www.aclu.org/aclu-interested-persons-memo-fbi-documents-concerning-detainee-abuse-guantanamo-bay|website=ACLU|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA reportedly required involvement from health professionals to continue its practice of "enhanced" interrogations on detainees, to maintain the lawfulness of their practices.  Psychiatrists and medical doctors were reluctant to participate in interrogations, however some psychologists participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hajjar|first1=Lisa|title=How the World's Largest Psychological Association Aided the CIA's Torture Program|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/how-worlds-largest-psychological-association-aided-cias-torture-program/|accessdate=5 June 2015|agency=The Nation|date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recently released report by a group of psychologists alleges the same, implicating a number of APA officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Stephen Soldz |author2=Nathaniel Raymond |author3=Steven Reisner |title=Report on American Psychological Association’s Role in Bush-Era Interrogation Program|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/01/us/document-report.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the abuses were made public, the APA created a task force called Psychological Ethics and National Security (PENS) and released a report stating that the APA Code of Ethics applies to psychologists working in any setting, and that psychologists do not facilitate or participate in any degrading or cruel behavior, referring back to the APA's 1986 Resolution Against Torture.  The report also called on psychologists to report any suspected or observed inhumane treatment to the appropriate authorities and obey federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security|title=Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/pens.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2015|agency=American Psychological Association|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Critique of Pure Tolerance''''' is a 1965 book by the philosopher [[Robert Paul Wolff]], the sociologist [[Barrington Moore Jr.]], and the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], in which the authors discuss the political role of [[Toleration|tolerance]]. The book has been described as "peculiar" by commentators, and its authors have been criticized for advocating intolerance and the suppression of dissenting opinions.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
The book includes a foreword jointly written by its authors,{{sfn|Wolff|Moore|Marcuse|1969|pages=v–vi}} and three other contributions, "Beyond Tolerance" by Robert Paul Wolff,{{sfn|Wolff|1969|pages=3–52}} "Tolerance and the Scientific Outlook" by Barrington Moore Jr.,{{sfn|Moore|1969|pages=53–79}} and "Repressive Tolerance", by Herbert Marcuse.{{sfn|Marcuse|1969|pages=81–123}}

The authors explain that the book's title refers to the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), and suggest that their ideas may resemble those of Kant. They note that they have different perspectives on [[philosophy]], with Wolff accepting, and Marcuse opposing, the approach of [[analytic philosophy]], and Moore being critical of philosophy in general. They write that the purpose of the book is to discuss the political role of tolerance and that despite their disagreements with each other they believe that "the prevailing theory and practice of tolerance" is hypocritical and conceals "appalling political realities."{{sfn|Wolff|Moore|Marcuse|1969|pages=v–vi}}

Wolff argues that tolerance should be studied "by means of an analysis of the theory and practice of democratic [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]."{{sfn|Wolff|1969|pages=3–52}}

Marcuse argues that "the realization of the objective of tolerance" requires "intolerance toward prevailing policies, attitudes, opinions, and the extension of tolerance to policies, attitudes, and opinions which are outlawed or suppressed." He makes the case for "liberating tolerance", which would consist of intolerance to right-wing movements and toleration of left-wing movements.{{sfn|Marcuse|1969|pages=81–123}}

==Publication history==
''A Critique of Pure Tolerance'' was published by [[Beacon Press]] in 1965. In 1969, it was published as a Beacon Paperback.{{sfn|Wolff|Moore|Marcuse|1969|page=ii}}

==Reception==
===Academic journals===
''A Critique of Pure Tolerance'' received a negative review from the sociologist [[Nathan Glazer]] in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.{{sfn|Glazer|1966|pages=419–420}} The book was also reviewed by the philosopher [[John Herman Randall Jr.]] in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'' and L. Del Grosso Destreri in ''Studi di Sociologia''.{{sfn|Randall|1966|pages=457–465}}{{sfn|Del Grosso Destreri|1968|pages=99–101}}

Glazer described the book as "peculiar". He credited Marcuse with being open in his advocacy of intolerance, but accused Wolff of being incapable of distinguishing "facts from theory" in his criticisms of tolerance and pluralist democracy. He disagreed with Wolff's view that "The application of the theory of pluralism always favors the groups in existence against those in formation", maintaining that it was contradicted by many historical examples, including the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s, and described his views as "politically naive." He accused Moore of advocating violence, and wrote that Marcuse appeared to support measures such as breaking up meetings and destroying the literature of his opponents. He considered it fortunate that "the means by which he might impose his opinions are not terribly impressive."{{sfn|Glazer|1966|pages=419–420}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Maurice Cranston]], writing in his anthology ''The New Left'' (1970), called ''A Critique of Pure Tolerance'' Marcuse's most popular and disturbing work to date. Cranston commented that the book was published, "in a peculiar format, bound in black like a prayer book or missal and perhaps designed to compete with ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|The Thoughts of Chairman Mao]]'' as devotional reading at student sit-ins."{{sfn|Cranston|1970|page=87}}

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], writing in ''Marcuse'' (1970), argued that Marcuse's theory of the right of revolutionary minorities to suppress opinions is dangerous both because it is false and because it is "a doctrine which if it were widely held would be an effective barrier to any rational progress and liberation". He accused Marcuse of having "taken over from liberal and right-wing critics of the European revolutionary tradition a theory which they falsely ascribed to the left, but which was rarely held until Marcuse espoused it." He argued, against Marcuse, that the proper end of tolerance is not truth but rationality, and that Marcuse's proposals undermined the possibility of rationality and critical discussion. He also argued that Marcuse's case against tolerance made those radicals who espouse it "allies of the very forces which they claim to attack."{{sfn|MacIntyre|1970|pages=89–91}} Ronald Bayer, writing in ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis'' (1987), identified Marcuse's arguments about "repressive tolerance" as an influence on gay rights activists, who disrupted lectures by psychiatrists and refused to tolerate the views of their opponents as they campaigned for [[homosexuality]] to be declassified as a mental disorder.{{sfn|Bayer|1987|pages=98–99, 227}}

'''Analytical feminism''' is  a line of philosophy that applies analytic concepts and methods to feminist issues and applies feminist concepts and insights to issues that have traditionally been of interest to analytic philosophers. Like all [[Feminism|feminists]], analytical feminists insist on recognizing and contesting [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |title=One Woman's Attempt at a Definition |author=Ann E. Cudd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324073853/http://web.ku.edu/~acudd/Anfemdef.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “analytical feminism” dates back to the early 1990s when the Society for Analytical Feminism was opened in at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/analyticalfeminism/|title= Society for Analytical Feminism |author= Norco College - Riverside Community College District}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an opportunity to discuss and examine issues concerning analytical feminism, in part to contrast the more prevalent influences of [[postmodernism]] and [[post-structuralism]], and also to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is neither inherently or  irredeemably male-biased. Analytic feminists have attempted to rehabilitate certain key concepts, such as truth, reason, objectivity, agency and autonomy, both because they are normatively compelling as well as in some ways liberating and empowering for women. Not limited to these concepts, analytical feminism has contributed to the historical arena of analytic philosophy such as the philosophy of language, [[epistemology]], [[metaphysic]]s and the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter01.html#chapter01sec04|title=History of Analytical Feminism|author=Monash University Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the American philosophical magazine ''[[Hypatia]]'' published a special issue&lt;ref name="Hy 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hypatia-Special Issue: Analytic Feminism-August 1995|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1111/hypa.1995.10.issue-3|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifying the meaning of analytic feminism in the mainstream Anglo-American analytical context and in the range of [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosophical positions]]. In this issue, the authors such as [[Ann Cudd]] of the [[University of Kansas]], [[Ann Garry]] of [[California State University Los Angeles]], and Lynn Hankinson Nelson of the [[University of Washington]] proposed that analytic feminism typically was unrecognized and  somewhat depreciated by not only analytical philosophers but academic  feminist agenda as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm|title=THE NATURALISM QUESTION. HOW TO RE-THINK THE ANALYTIC – CONTINENTAL DICOTHOMY FROM A FEMINIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE|author=Alessandra Allegrini|access-date=2011-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928142832/http://www.women.it/cyberarchive/files/allegrini.htm#|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered a sub-category of both analytic philosophy, and feminism, analytic feminism acknowledge the philosophical traditions of both fields while simultaneously addressing prominent issues within said fields.

==Philosophical approach==
Analytical feminism, as defined by Ann E. Cudd: "Analytic feminism holds that the best way to counter  [[sexism]] and [[androcentrism]] is through forming a clear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality, justice, and the good while recognising that these notions have often been perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy." (1996: 20) Analytic feminists engage the literature traditionally thought of as analytic philosophy, but also draw on other traditions in philosophy as well as work by feminists working in other disciplines, especially [[sociology]] and [[biology]]. They, like most [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]], value clarity and precision in argument and tend to use more rigorously structured logical and linguistic analysis in reaching their conclusions and positions as compared to other philosophical approaches.

The majority of philosophers, including feminist philosophers, have at least some formal training in analytic philosophy, with some possessing extensive education and experience regarding analyticity. There has been a conscious effort to use the word ‘analytical’, the reason being that within the field of philosophy there is sometimes an inclination to assume all feminist work as tied to other methods to philosophy, whereas upon review much of the work in feminism is closer in method to analytic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most analytic feminists, the  best method for scholars to counter sexism and androcentrism in their respective areas of inquiry is by forming a clear conception of and practicing logical consistency and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/analytic-feminism-eoph/ |title= Analytic Feminism |author= bookrags }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrines===
Even though analytical feminists retain only some traditional concepts{{Clarify|date=February 2013}}, it is not doctrinaire—indeed, there is even a spirit of contrarianism within it. Nevertheless, analytic feminists share a thing that we may call a "core desire" rather than a core principle, that is to say, the need to hold on to enough of the essential normative notions of the modern European tradition to aid the kind of [[norm (social)|norm]]ativity which is necessary for both [[feminist political theory]] and philosophy. This "core desire"  finds its appearance by means of the core concepts of analytical feminism.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge building===
Analytic feminists' use of core ideas and their excerpt to the work of traditional analytic philosophers permit them to communicate with and build bridges amongst different types of scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other feminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in social studies.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructing philosophy===
One tenet of analytic feminism holds that if philosophers positions are applicable universally, they must be usable by men and women alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of ''The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy'', is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline  (Fricker and Hornsby 2000).

Not basing the approach on any 'essential' characteristics, be they experiences or otherwise, it can maintain the importance of a variety of perspectives, while crafting a 'working' theory. 'Working' is defined as being particularly inclusive, of both men and women, but also simultaneously eliminating oppressive consequences. A wide range of experiences, interests, and background must be reflected with the theory 'working' only if it is applicable to all these issues and concerns.

There are a variety of approaches regarding the reconstruction of philosophy within analytic feminism. Some philosophers, such as Bailey (Bailey 2010) and Gary (Garry 2012), include the use of [[intersectionality]] in their approach. Miranda Fricker (2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011) make use of concept of [[Privilege (social inequality)]] in theirs, particularly with regard to epistemic ignorance and [[epistemic injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Andrew Feenberg''' (born 1943) is an American philosopher. He holds the [[Canada Research Chairs|Canada Research Chair]] in the Philosophy of Technology in the School of Communication at [[Simon Fraser University]] in Vancouver.  His main interests are [[Philosophy of technology|philosophy of technology]], [[continental philosophy]], [[critique of technology]] and [[science and technology studies]].

==Education==
Feenberg studied philosophy under [[Herbert Marcuse]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and was awarded his PhD in 1972.  During this time Feenberg was active in the [[New Left]], founding a journal entitled ''Alternatives'' and participating in the [[May 1968 in France|May '68]] events in Paris.

==Feenberg's philosophy of technology==
Feenberg's primary contribution to the philosophy of technology is his argument for the democratic transformation of technology.  From his book ''Transforming Technology,''  
:"What human beings are and will become is decided in the shape of our tools no less than in the action of statesmen and political movements.  The design of technology is thus an ontological decision fraught with political consequences.  The exclusion of the vast majority from participation in this decision is profoundly undemocratic" (p.3).
Feenberg provides the theoretical foundation for this idea through the Critical Theory of Technology which he develops over three books: ''The Critical Theory of Technology'' (1991) (re-published as ''Transforming Technology: A Critical Theory Revisited''  [2002]), ''Alternative Modernity: The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory'' (1995), and ''Questioning Technology'' (1999). The basis of Feenberg's critical theory of technology is a concept of dialectical technological rationality he terms instrumentalization theory.  Instrumentalization theory combines the social critique of technology familiar from the philosophy of technology ([[Karl Marx]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jacques Ellul]]) with insights taken from the empirical case studies of [[science and technology studies]].  Applications of his theory include studies of online education, [[Minitel|the Minitel]], the Internet, and digital games.

Feenberg has also published books and articles on the philosophy of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Marxist theory|Karl Marx]], [[György Lukács|Georg Lukacs]], and [[Kitaro Nishida|Kitarō Nishida]].

The '''Basava Purana''' is a 13th-century [[Telugu language|Telugu]] [[epic poem]]. It was written by [[Palkuriki Somanatha]]. It is a sacred text of [[Lingayat]]. The epic poem narrates the life story of philosopher and social reformer [[Basava]] (1134–1196 CE), the founder of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Lingayat]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/54674/Basava-Purana Basava Purana] [[Britannica.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known by several other names such as Basavanna, Basaweshwara, Basavesha, and Basavaraja. It is also an anthology of several Lingayat saints (also known as Shiva Sharanas, devotees of Lord Shiva) and their philosophies. In contrast to [[campu]] style (poems in verse of various metres interspersed with paragraphs of prose), Somanatha adopted the [[desi]] (native) style and composed the purana in [[dwipada]] (couplets), a meter popular in oral tradition and closely related to folk songs. 

Later  in 1369  A.D., it was translated to [[Kannada language]] by [[Bhima Kavi]], this version contains detailed description and in time was considered his standard biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lingayatreligion.com/Lingayat/BasavaPuranas.htm Basava in Literature] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092032/http://lingayatreligion.com/Lingayat/BasavaPuranas.htm |date=May 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/Library.nsf/%28docid%29/3E4576CF4860643665257202004A7DC5?OpenDocument&amp;StartKey=Basava&amp;count=50 Basava purana by  Bheema Kavi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104214600/http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/Library.nsf/%28docid%29/3E4576CF4860643665257202004A7DC5?OpenDocument&amp;StartKey=Basava&amp;count=50 |date=January 4, 2009 }} cscsarchive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2fhCH-NRatUC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Basava+purana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HEqeGPvqYd&amp;sig=R0ZgNA1Tb3DLzs3wQ2anbgw3Po0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MNjaT8zLCs3rrQf7j_2PCQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Basava%20purana&amp;f=false Extract of 1969 version]&lt;/ref&gt;There are several Kannada and Sanskrit Lingayath puranas inspired by Bhima Kavi's Basava Purana.

The '''''Book of Nepos''''' is a lost 3rd century Christian text written by an [[Christianity in Egypt|Egyptian]] bishop Nepos,&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 1.&lt;/ref&gt; which advocated for a strictly [[Hermeneutics#Literal|literal]] [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation of the Bible]] against [[Hermeneutics#Allegorical|allegorical]] readings. This included especially a literal reading of the [[Book of Revelation]], a minority position at the time.

The ''Book of Nepos'' no longer exists, and is known only indirectly through [[Eusebius]], who quoted a work by [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] criticizing Nepos.&lt;ref name="RobinsonRobinson2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas A. Robinson|author2=Thomas Arthur Robinson|title=Who Were the First Christians?: Dismantling the Urban Thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-g41DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=1 December 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-062054-7|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/nepos-arsinoe Nepos of Arsinoë], New Catholic Encyclopedia, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology and reception ==
Nepos was a strict literalist (believing the entire [[Bible]] is true in a literal sense), and his text, also known as the '''Refutation of the Allegorisers''' or '''Refutation of the Allegorists''' was aimed at refuting the arguments of those who held that certain sections of the Bible were mere [[allegory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]]' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the text is aimed at discrediting the position, held by a minority of Christians at the time, that the [[book of Revelation]] should be interpreted allegorically rather than literally.

Amongst the teachings in the text is the belief that [[Jesus]] would come to earth and physically reign as monarch for 1000 years during an age of righteous delight. This belief was regarded as fairly orthodox in the early church (e.g. it was held by [[Irenaeus]], and [[Justin Martyr]]), however, the later church came to view Revelation as more allegorical. Indeed, Dionysius of Alexandria felt moved to write a text (''On the Promises'') against it, although he regarded Nepos highly and attempted to criticize the doctrine without insulting Nepos personally.

The ''Book of Nepos'' was so popular within the villages around Alexandria that Dionysius went there in person to refute it.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, Book VII, Chapter XXIV 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In deference to Nepos and the prior orthodoxy of strict literalism, he did so politely, entering a respectful dialogue with those from the village and contesting each of the arguments they took from the ''Book of Nepos'' in turn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM)''' is a non-profit organization set out to preserve ancient manuscripts of the New Testament. This aim is accomplished by taking high resolution digital photographs of all extant Greek New Testament [[biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]]. The organization was founded by [[Daniel B. Wallace]], a professor at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], in Texas on September 13, 2002, and acts under the umbrella of The Center for the Research of Early Christian Documents (CRECD). Wallace is the executive director of CSNTM. 

Wallace has said the goal of the center is to photograph 1.3 million leaves of Greek New Testament manuscripts, and estimates this goal will not be reached until 2020.&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;Fleck, Deborah"[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relnewtestament_08met.ART.Central.Edition1.4688c1c.html Fleck, Deborah, "Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts working to preserve ancient pieces,"] The Dallas Morning News, March 8, 2008. Retrieved April 18, 2008. Additional information from other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSNTM team has already photographed manuscripts in [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople at the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church]]; the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in Münster, Germany; [[Tübingen University]], Germany; the Monastery of St. John the Theologian on the island of Patmos, Greece; the National Archive in Tirana, Albania; the [[University of Michigan]]; several colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]; [[University of Glasgow]]; [[Gennadius Library]]; [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], The [[Chester Beatty Library]], various locations throughout Greece, and other sites. The Center and Wallace have also examined manuscripts in Vienna, Cologne, Florence, Berlin, at St. Catherine’s Monastery (Sinai), The [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], the University of Dresden, [[Harvard University]], the British Library, [[Princeton University]], and several other sites.

The activity of CSNTM is limited by several factors, including international law, finances, and the traditional thinking of the other institutions regarding the copying of valuable manuscripts. In spite of these difficulties CSNTM has digital images of:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Washingtonianus]]
* [[Codex Boernerianus]]
* [[Codex Beratinus]]

Although the primary focus of the CSNTM is [[digital preservation]] of New Testament manuscripts, it also works with printed books related to textual criticism such as von Soden's Greek New Testament ("Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte," Verlag von Arthur Glaue, Berlin 1902-1910). CSNTM holds also one manuscript of New Testament, Gregory-Aland minuscule 2882, a 10th- or 11th-century copy of Luke’s Gospel.

There have been some questions raised about her authority to teach Zen from some members of the Zen community. Author [[James Ishmael Ford]] writes of her, "Perhaps the most prominent of apparently self-declared teachers is the widely read author and meditation teacher Cheri Huber. Huber may have studied briefly with Jay DuPont...but it is not clear that she was authorized to teach by him or anyone else as a Zen teacher."&lt;ref name="zenmaster"/&gt;

[[Image:Hatching.jpg|thumb|right|A chick hatching from an egg]]
{{Wiktionary|chicken-or-egg question}}
The '''chicken or the egg''' [[causality]] [[dilemma]] is commonly stated as "which came first: the [[chicken]] or the [[egg (biology)|egg]]?". The dilemma stems from the observation that all chickens hatch from eggs and all chicken eggs are laid by chickens. "Chicken-and-egg" is a metaphoric adjective describing situations where it is not clear which of two events should be considered the ''cause'' and which should be considered the ''effect'', or to express a scenario of [[infinite regress]]. [[Plutarch]] posed the question as a philosophical matter in his essay "[[Moralia|The Symposiacs]]", written in the [[1st century|1st century CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch of Chaeronea. ''The Symposiacs'' Question III. https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/complete.html#section15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQNEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=chicken+and+the+egg+problem+Plutarch&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsnJLLra3XAhUi9IMKHZ5GDBAQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=chicken%20and%20the%20egg%20problem%20Plutarch&amp;f=false|title=The Demiurge in Ancient Thought|last1=O'Brien|first1=Carl Séan|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-07536-8|location=Cambridge, England|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient paradox==
The question represents an ancient folk paradox addressing the problem of origins and [[first cause]].&lt;ref name="paradox"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorensen|first=Roy|title=A Brief History of the Paradox: Philosophy and the Labyrinths of the Mind|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=Oxford|year=2003|pages=4-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], writing in the fourth century B.C., concluded that this was an infinite sequence, with no true origin.&lt;ref name="paradox" /&gt; Plutarch, writing four centuries later, specifically highlighted this question as bearing on a "great and weighty problem (whether the world had a beginning)."&lt;ref name="Fabry"&gt;{{cite web
| title=Now You Know: Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?
| url=http://time.com/4475048/which-came-first-chicken-egg/
| first=Merrill
| last=Fabry
| date=2016-09-21
| website=[[Time Magazine]]
| accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth century CE, [[Macrobius]] wrote that while the question seemed trivial, it "should be regarded as one of importance."&lt;ref name="Fabry" /&gt;

By the end of the 16th century, the well-known question seemed to have been regarded as settled in the Christian world, based on the origin story of the [[Bible]]. In describing the creation of animals, it allows for a first chicken that did not come from an egg. However, later enlightenment philosophers began to question this solution.&lt;ref name="Fabry" /&gt;

==Scientific resolutions==
Although the question is typically used metaphorically, [[evolutionary biology]] provides literal answers, made possible by the Darwinian principle that species [[Evolution|evolve]] over time, and thus that chickens had ancestors that were not chickens,&lt;ref name="Fabry" /&gt; similar to a view expressed by the Greek philosopher [[Anaximander]] when addressing the paradox.&lt;ref name="paradox" /&gt;

If the question refers to eggs in general, the egg came first. The first [[amniote]] egg—that is, a hard-shelled egg that could be laid on land, rather than remaining in water like the eggs of fish or amphibians—appeared around 312 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|last2=Donoghue|first2=Philip C. J.|date=2007-01-01|title=Paleontological Evidence to Date the Tree of Life|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/24/1/26/1070944|journal=[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=26–53|doi=10.1093/molbev/msl150|issn=0737-4038|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, chickens are domesticated descendants of [[red junglefowl]] and probably arose little more than eight thousand years ago, at most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miao|first=Y-W|last2=Peng|first2=M-S|last3=Wu|first3=G-S|last4=Ouyang|first4=Y-N|last5=Yang|first5=Z-Y|last6=Yu|first6=N|last7=Liang|first7=J-P|last8=Pianchou|first8=G|last9=Beja-Pereira|first9=A|date=2012-12-05|title=Chicken domestication: an updated perspective based on mitochondrial genomes|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201283|journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]]|language=en|volume=110|issue=3|pages=277–282|doi=10.1038/hdy.2012.83|issn=1365-2540|via=|pmc=3668654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the question refers to ''chicken'' eggs specifically, the answer is still the egg,&lt;ref name=SOR&gt;{{cite journal|first= Roy A. |last=Sorensen|title=The Egg came before the chicken|journal=Mind|volume=101|number=403|pages=541–542|year=1992|url=https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-abstract/101/403/541/947797?redirectedFrom=fulltext|doi=10.1093/mind/101.403.541}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the explanation is more complicated. The process by which the chicken arose through the interbreeding and domestication of multiple species of wild jungle fowl is poorly understood, and the point at which this evolving organism became a chicken is a somewhat arbitrary distinction. Whatever criteria one chooses, an animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a [[wiktionary:proto-|proto]]-chicken) laid a fertilized egg that had DNA identical to the modern chicken (due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the father's sperm, or the fertilised [[zygote]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Alternatively, if the question refers specifically to the chicken egg as it exists today, the answer may be different. Chickens produce a protein, ovocleidin-17 (OC-17), that is expressed in the uterus and causes the formation of the thickened calcium carbonate shell around modern chicken eggs. Because OC-17 is expressed by the hen and not the egg, the bird in which the protein first arose, though having hatched from a non-reinforced egg, would then have laid the first egg having such a reinforced shell: the chicken would have preceded this first "modern" chicken egg.&lt;ref name="Zushi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| |publisher=NBCnews.com |date=14 July 2010|title=Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

== Etymology ==
The word "dictator" comes from the classical [[Latin]] language word ''dictātor'', agent noun from ''dictare (dictāt-'', past participial stem of ''dictāre'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/52299#eid6726598 dictate ''v.''] + ''-or'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132131#eid33232093 -or ''suffix''].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/52304?p=emailAOE6bjQCOi1ZQ&amp;d=52304|title=Oxford English Dictionary, (the definitive record of the English language)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin use, a ''dictator'' was a judge in the Roman republic temporarily invested with absolute power.

== Types of dictatorships ==
Right after the end of [[World War II]], with a more relaxed political and social climate, several studies regarding the classification of various forms of government have been conducted. Among these, has been intensely discussed by historians and political scientists the conceptualization and definition of the dictatorship form of government. Eventually, it has been concluded that dictatorship is a form of government in which the absolute power is concentrated in the hands of a leader (commonly identified as a [[dictator]]), a "small clique", or a "government organization", and it aims the abolition of political pluralism and civilian mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title="Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development."|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5104816959|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 87| issue =  3|pages= 567–576|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[democracy]], which is generally compared to the concept of dictatorship, is defined as a form of government where the supremacy belongs to the population and rulers are elected through contested [[election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurki|first=Milja|date=2010|title="Democracy and Conceptual Contestability: Reconsidering Conceptions of Democracy in Democracy Promotion."

A new form of government that, in the 20th century, marked the beginning of a new political era and is commonly linked to the concept of dictatorship, is known as [[totalitarianism]]. This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology. Here, the government has "total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Neil|date=2010|title="Totalitarianism, Social Science, and the Margins."|url=https://www.jstor.org.cod.idm.oclc.org/stable/canajsocicahican.35.3.463?Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=totalitarianism&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dtotalitarianism&amp;refreqid=search%3A6a280895bb33aa61d205ac6488129c93&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie|volume= 35| issue =  3|pages= 463–469|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hannah Arendt]], totalitarianism is a new and extreme form of dictatorship composed of "atomized, isolated individuals".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=661026|title=Dictators and dictatorships: understanding authoritarian regimes and their leaders|last=Ezrow|first=Natasha M|last2=Frantz|first2=Erica|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|year=|isbn=9781441116024|location=New York, NY:|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she affirmed that ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organized. According to the political scientist [[Juan Linz]], the distinction between an authoritarian regime and a totalitarian one is that while an authoritarian regime seeks to suffocate politics and political mobilization, totalitarianism seeks to control politics and political mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/985592359|title=Totalitarian and authoritarian regimes|last=Linz|first=Juan J|date=2009|publisher=Rienner|isbn=9781555878665|location=Boulder, Colo.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one of the most recent classification of dictatorships, formulated, do not identify [[Totalitarianism]] as a form of dictatorship. In her study, she focused in how elite-leader and elite-mass relations influence [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics. Geddes typology identifies the key institutions that structure elite politics in dictatorships (i.e. parties and militaries). The study is based and directly related to factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Military dictatorships ===
{{main|Military dictatorship}}
Military dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an [[institution]]. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members; they are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the [[military]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedrich|first=Carl|date=1950|title="Military Government and Dictatorship."|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5723774494|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 267|pages= 1–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single-party dictatorships ===
{{Main|One-party state}}
Single-party dictatorships are regimes in which one party dominates politics. In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. Other parties may legally exist, compete in elections, and even hold legislative seats, yet true political power lies with the dominant party. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and “organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders".&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Personalist dictatorships ===
Personalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator. These individuals are all typically handpicked to serve their posts by the dictator.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peceny|first=Mark|date=2003|title="Peaceful Parties and Puzzling Personalists."|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/208155326|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 97| issue =  2|pages= 339–342|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monarchies ===
[[File:Salman of Saudi Arabia (2017-10-05) 2.jpg|thumb|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1159990 Call them ‘Dictators’, not ‘Kings’]". ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]''. 28 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Monarchic dictatorships are regimes in which "a person of royal descent has inherited the position of head of state in accordance with accepted practice or constitution". Regimes are not considered dictatorships if the monarch’s role is largely ceremonial but [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], such as [[Saudi Arabia]] can be considered [[hereditary dictatorship]]s. Real political power must be exercised by the monarch for regimes to be classified as such. Elites in monarchies are typically members of the [[royal family]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Hybrid dictatorships ===
Hybrid dictatorships are regimes that blend qualities of personalist, singleparty, and military dictatorships. When regimes share characteristics of all three forms of dictatorships, they are referred to as triple threats. The most common forms of hybrid dictatorships are personalist/single-party hybrids and personalist/military hybrids.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Measuring dictatorships ==
[[File:Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy index.svg|thumb|259x259px|[[Democracy Index]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yabiladi.com/img/content/EIU-Democracy-Index-2015.pdf|title=Democracy Index 2015|last=|first=|date=21 January 2016|website=Economist Intelligence Unit|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue represents more democratic countries, while yellow and red are considered as [[hybrid regime]] and [[authoritarian]], respectively. Most dictatorships are represented as darker shades of red.]]
One of the tasks in [[political science]] is to measure and classify regimes as either dictatorships or democracies. [[Freedom House]], [[Polity IV]] and [[Democracy-Dictatorship Index]] are three of the most used [[data series]] by political scientists.&lt;ref name="ClarkGolder2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://college.cqpress.com/sites/principlescp/Home/chapter5.aspx|title=Principles of Comparative Politics|author1=William Roberts Clark|author2=Matt Golder|author3=Sona N Golder|date=23 March 2012|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=978-1-60871-679-1|chapter=Chapter 5. Democracy and Dictatorship: Conceptualization and Measurement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, two research approaches exist: the minimalist approach, which focuses on whether a country has continued elections that are competitive, and the substantive approach, which expands the concept of democracy to include human rights, [[freedom of the press]], and the [[rule of law]]. The Democracy-Dictatorship Index is seen as an example of the minimalist approach, whereas the [[Polity data series]], is more substantive.&lt;ref name="AutoJF-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cqpress.com/sites/principlescp/Home/chapter5.aspx |title=Democracy and Dictatorship: Conceptualization and Measurement |website=cqpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MøllerSkaaning2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jørgen |last=Møller |first2=Svend-Erik |last2=Skaaning |date=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtWoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Requisites of Democracy: Conceptualization, Measurement, and Explanation |publisher=Routledge |pages=78– |isbn=978-1-136-66584-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClarkGolder2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=William Roberts |last=Clark |first2=Matt |last2=Golder |first3=Sona Nadenichek |last3=Golder |date=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmPuAAAAMAAJ |title=Principles of comparative politics |publisher=CQ Press. |isbn=978-0-87289-289-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoJF-4"&gt;[http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/10/12/0022002712459707?patientinform-links=yes&amp;legid=spjcr;0022002712459707v1 Divergent Incentives for Dictators: Domestic Institutions and (International Promises Not to) Torture] [http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/cconrad2/Academic/Research_files/JCRAppendix25March2011.pdf Appendix] "Unlike substantive measures of democracy (e.g., Polity IV and Freedom House), the binary conceptualization of democracy most recently described by Cheibub, Gandhi and Vree-land (2010) focuses on one institution—elections—to distinguish between dictatorships and democracies. Using a minimalist measure of democracy rather than a substantive one better allows for the isolation of causal mechanisms (Cheibub, Gandhi and Vreeland, 2010, 73) linking regime type to human rights outcomes."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Between the two world wars, four types of dictatorships have been described: Constitutional, Communist (nominally championing the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]"), Counterrevolutionary and [[fascism|Fascist]]. Since [[World War II]], a broader range of dictatorships has been recognized, including [[Third World]] dictatorships, theocratic or religious dictatorships and dynastic or family-based dictatorships.&lt;ref name="Coppa2006"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTv99LBYSL4C|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Dictators: From Napoleon to the Present|author=Frank J. Coppa|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-5010-0|page=xiv|quote=In the period between the two world wars, four types of dictatorships were described by a number of smart people: constitutional, the communist (nominally championing the "dictatorship of the proletariat"), the counterrevolutionary, and the fascist. Many have rightfully questioned the distinctions between these prototypes. In fact, since World War II, we have recognized that the range of dictatorships is much broader than earlier posited and it includes so-called Third World dictatorships in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and religious dictatorships....They are also family dictatorships ....|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republican origins ===
During the [[Roman Republic|Republican phase]] of [[Ancient Rome]], a [[Roman dictator]] was the special magistrate who held well defined powers, normally for six months at a time, usually in combination with a [[Roman consul|consulship]]. Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. In execution, their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to law and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a king in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].

=== 19th-century Latin American caudillos ===
{{main|Caudillo}}
[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|[[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] wearing [[Mexico|Mexican]] military uniform]]
After the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as "[[personalismo]]s".

The wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].

=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===
In the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and Fascist dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:
* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hirohito]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy, [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and other Fascist dictatorships;
* [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s [[North Korea]] and other [[Communism|Communist]] dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, China and other countries.

=== Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===
[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]
After World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies. Whatever their form, these dictatorships had an adverse impact on economic growth and the quality of political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papaioannou|first=Kostadis|author2=vanZanden, Jan Luiten|date=2015|title=The Dictator Effect: How long years in office affect economic development|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1744137414000356|journal=Journal of Institutional Economics|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1744137414000356|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dictators who stayed in office for a long period of time found it increasingly difficult to carry out sound economic policies.

The often-cited exploitative dictatorship is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled [[Zaire]] from 1965 to 1997, embezzling over $5&amp;nbsp;billion from his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/07/mobutu.wrap/|title=Mobutu dies in exile in Morocco|author=|date=7 September 1997|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratization ===
The global dynamics of [[democratization]] has been a central question for political scientists.&lt;ref name="Huntington2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMjyTFG04JYC|title=The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th Century|author=Samuel P.

==   Theories of dictatorship ==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
[[Mancur Olson]] suggests that the emergence of dictatorships can be linked to the concept of "roving bandits", individuals in an atomic system who move from place to place extracting wealth from individuals. These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into "stationary bandits". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from "roving bandits" into "stationary bandits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Divino afflante Spiritu''''' ("Inspired by the [[Holy Spirit]]") is a [[papal encyclical]] letter issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] on 30 September 1943 calling for new translations of the Bible from the original languages, instead of the [[Latin Vulgate]] of [[Jerome]], which was revised multiple times and had formed the textual basis for all [[Catholic]] vernacular translations until then. It inaugurated the modern period of Roman Catholic [[biblical studies]] by encouraging the study of [[textual criticism]] (or ''lower criticism''), pertaining to text of the Scriptures themselves and transmission thereof (for example, to determine correct readings) and permitted the use of the [[historical-critical method]] (or ''higher criticism''), to be informed by [[Catholic theology|theology]], [[Sacred Tradition]], and [[ecclesiastical history]] on the historical circumstances of the text, hypothesizing about matters such as authorship, dating, and similar concerns.{{sfn|Soulen|Soulen|2001|p=49}} The eminent Catholic biblical scholar [[Raymond E. Brown]] described it as a "Magna Carta for biblical progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |author-link=Raymond E. Brown |year=1990 |chapter=Church Pronouncements |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Raymond E. |editor1-link=Raymond E.

Murphy |title=[[The New Jerome Biblical Commentary]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=1167}} Cited in {{harvnb|Donahue|1993|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The encyclical appeared on the 50th anniversary of ''[[Providentissimus Deus]]'', an 1893 encyclical in which [[Pope Leo XIII]] condemned the use of [[higher criticism]]. Pius XII noted that advances had been made in [[archaeology]] and historical research, which made it advisable to further define the study of the [[Bible]].

Previously, Catholic translations of the Bible into modern languages were usually based on the Latin Vulgate, the text used in the Liturgy. They generally referred back to the source texts (in [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic]] and [[Biblical Greek]]) only to clarify the exact meaning of the [[Latin]] text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cunningham |first1=Philip A. |last2=Radtke |first2=Barbara A. |year=2015 |title=Catholic Approach to the Bible |url=http://www.bc.edu/schools/stm/crossroads/resources/birthofjesus/intro/catholic_approachtothebible.html |work=The Birth of Jesus: Two Gospel Narratives |location=Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts |publisher=Boston College |access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his encyclical, Pius stressed the importance of diligent study of the original languages and other cognate languages to arrive at a deeper and fuller knowledge of the meaning of the sacred texts:
{{quote|We ought to explain the original text which was written by the inspired author himself and has more authority and greater weight than any, even the very best, translation whether ancient or modern. This can be done all the more easily and fruitfully if to the knowledge of languages be joined a real skill in literary criticism of the same text.{{sfn|''The New American Bible''|2011|p=xxi, xxiii}}}}

Newer Catholic translations of the Bible have been based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages, taking into account as well the ancient translations that sometimes clarify what seem to be transcription errors in those manuscripts. However, the Latin Vulgate remains the official Bible in the [[Latin Rite]] of the Catholic Church.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Douglas Neil Walton''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] academic and author, known for his books and papers on [[argumentation]], logical [[fallacies]] and [[informal logic]]. He is presently Distinguished Research Fellow of the [[Centre for Research in Reasoning, Argumentation, and Rhetoric]] (CRRAR) at the [[University of Windsor]], Ontario, Canada, and before that (2008–14), he held the Assumption Chair of Argumentation Studies at the University of Windsor. Walton’s work has been used to better prepare legal arguments and to help develop artificial intelligence.

A special issue of the journal ''Informal Logic'' surveyed Walton’s contributions to informal logic and argumentation theory up to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Informal Logic'', 27(1), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A [[festschrift]] honoring his contributions, Dialectics, Dialogue and Argumentation: An Examination of Douglas Walton’s Theories of Reasoning and Argument, ed. C. Reed and C. W. Tindale, London: College Publications, 2010, shows how his theories are increasingly finding applications in computer science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Education==
Walton earned his PhD from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1972.

==Work==
Walton’s work represents a distinctive approach built around a set of practical methods to help a user identify, analyze and evaluate arguments in specialized areas such as law and science, as well as arguments of the kind used in everyday conversational discourse. Walton has called this approach logical argumentation, and as a method it has twelve defining characteristics, shown below in a simplified list.  
# The method analyzes and evaluates argumentation concerning a contestable claim, one where there is evidence for the claim as well as against it. The claim is tested evidentially by the pro and con arguments that support or attack it. 
# The procedure for examining and criticizing the arguments on both sides forms a dialogue structure in which two sides, the claimant and its opponent, take turns putting forward speech acts (for example, asking questions and putting forward arguments). 
# The dialogue has rules for incurring and retracting commitments that are activated by speech acts. For example, when a participant makes an assertion (claim), he or she becomes committed to the proposition contained in the assertion. 
# The method uses the notion of commitment (acceptance) as the fundamental tool for the analysis and evaluation of argumentation rather than the notion of belief. The reason is that belief is held to be a psychological notion internal to an agent that can only be determined indirectly, by inference to the best explanation of the agent’s speech and actions. 
# The method assumes a database of commonly accepted knowledge that, along with other commitments, provides premises for arguments. The knowledge base is set in place at the opening stage, but can be revised as new relevant information comes in. 
# The method comprises the study of explanations as well as arguments, including the form of argument called inference to the best explanation or abductive reasoning.  
# The dialogue system is dynamic, meaning that it continually updates its database as new information comes in that is relevant to an argument being considered.  
# The arguments advanced are (for the most part) defeasible, meaning that they are subject to defeat as new relevant evidence comes in that refutes the argument.  
# Conclusions are accepted on a presumptive basis, meaning that in the absence of evidence sufficient to defeat it, a claim that is the conclusion of an argument can be tentatively accepted, even though it may be subject to later defeat. 
# The dialogue uses critical questioning as a way of testing plausible explanations and finding weak points in an argument that raise doubt concerning the acceptability of the argument. 
# The method uses standards of proof. Criteria for acceptance are held to depend on standards that require the removal of specifiable degrees of reasonable doubt. 
# The method is based on argumentation schemes, such as argument from expert opinion, that represent commonly used types of arguments that are defeasible.

In the method, schemes work as heuristic devices that only offer presumptive support of a claim that may have to be withdrawn as new evidence comes in. The schemes connect arguments together into sequences, often called chaining, by taking the conclusion of one argument as a premise in a subsequent argument. Some common schemes are argument from goal-based reasoning, argument from negative consequences, argument from positive consequences, inference to the best explanation (abductive reasoning), argument from sign, argument from analogy, argument from precedent, argument from an established rule, argument from evidence to a hypothesis, argument from cause to effect, argument from correlation to cause, argument from sunk costs, argument from threat, argument from perception, argument from witness testimony, argument from expert opinion, argument from ignorance, argument from commitment, direct ad hominem argument, argument from inconsistency of commitments, slippery slope argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Eclecticism''' is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly to a single [[paradigm]] or set of assumptions, but instead draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies different theories in particular cases. However, this is often without conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined.

It can sometimes seem inelegant or lacking in simplicity, and eclectics are sometimes criticized for lack of consistency in their thinking. It is, however, common in many fields of study. For example, most [[psychologists]] accept certain aspects of [[behaviorism]], but do not attempt to use the theory to explain all aspects of human behavior.

Eclecticism in [[ethics]], [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] is also known as [[syncretism]].

==Origin&lt;!--linked from 'Aetius'--&gt;==
Eclecticism was first recorded to have been practiced by a group of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman philosophy|Roman]] [[philosopher]]s who attached themselves to no real system, but selected from existing philosophical beliefs those doctrines that seemed most reasonable to them. Out of this collected material they constructed their new system of philosophy. The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐκλεκτικός}} (''eklektikos''), literally "choosing the best",&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&amp;nbsp;– in philosophy and theology, the practice of selecting doctrines from different systems of thought without adopting the whole parent system for each doctrine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29klektiko%2Fs {{lang|grc|ἐκλεκτικός}}],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from {{lang|grc|ἐκλεκτός}} (''eklektos''), "picked out, select".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29klekto%2Fs {{lang|grc|ἐκλεκτός}}], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; Well known eclectics in [[Greek philosophy]] were the [[Stoics]] [[Panaetius]] and [[Posidonius]], and the [[New Academic]]s [[Carneades]] and [[Philo of Larissa]]. Among the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Cicero]] was thoroughly eclectic, as he united the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and New Academic doctrines. Other eclectics included [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].

==Architecture and art==
[[Image:New York-palota 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[New York Palace (Budapest)|New York Palace]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]
The term eclecticism is used to describe the combination, in a single work, of elements from different historical styles, chiefly in architecture and, by implication, in the fine and decorative arts. The term is sometimes also loosely applied to the general stylistic variety of 19th-century architecture after [[neoclassicism]] ({{circa|1820|lk=on}}), although the revivals of styles in that period have, since the 1970s, generally been referred to as aspects of [[Historicism (art)|historicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard K. Eaton, ''The Architecture of Choice: Eclectism in America, 1880-1910'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Eclecticism plays an important role in critical discussions and evaluations but is somehow distant from the actual forms of the artifacts to which it is applied, and its meaning is thus rather indistinct. The simplest definition of the term—that every work of art represents the combination of a variety of influences—is so basic as to be of little use. In some ways Eclecticism is reminiscent of [[Mannerism]] in that the term was used pejoratively for much of the period of its currency, although, unlike Mannerism, Eclecticism never amounted to a movement or constituted a specific style: it is characterized precisely by the fact that it was not a particular style.

==Martial arts==
{{see also|Hybrid martial arts}}
Some [[martial arts]] can be described as eclectic in the sense that they borrow techniques from a wide variety of other martial arts.

In [[textual criticism#Eclecticism|textual criticism]], eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the [[New Testament]] (currently, the [[United Bible Society]], 4th ed. and Nestle-Aland, 27th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref name="ISBN 9039001057"&gt;Aland, B. 1994: 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy&lt;!--'Eclectic philosophy' and 'Eclectics' redirect here--&gt;==
In [[ancient philosophy]], the '''Eclectics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; use elements from multiple philosophies, texts, life experiences and their own philosophical ideas. These ideas include life as connected with existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. [[Antiochus of Ascalon]] ({{circa|125|69&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), was the pupil of [[Philo of Larissa]], and the teacher of [[Cicero]]. Through his influence, Platonism made the transition from [[New Academy]] [[Academic skepticism|skepticism]] to Eclecticism.&lt;ref name="zeller"&gt;[[Eduard Zeller]], ''Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy'', 13th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|273}} Whereas Philo had still adhered to the doctrine that there is nothing absolutely certain, Antiochus returned to a pronounced dogmatism. Among his other objections to skepticism was the consideration that without firm convictions no rational content of life is possible.&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|273}} Antiochus pointed out that it is a contradiction to assert that nothing can be asserted or to prove that nothing can be proved; that we cannot speak of false ideas and at the same time deny the distinction between false and true.&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|274}} He expounded the Academic, [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]], and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] systems in such a way as to show that these three schools deviate from one another only in minor points.&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|274}} Antiochus himself was chiefly interested in ethics, in which he tried to find a middle way between [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]]. For instance, he said that [[virtue]] suffices for happiness, but for the highest grade of happiness bodily and external goods are necessary as well.&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|274}}

This eclectic tendency was favoured by the lack of dogmatic works by Plato.&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|305}} Middle Platonism was promoted by the necessity of considering the main theories of the post-Platonic schools of philosophy, such as the Aristotelian logic and the Stoic psychology and ethics (theory of goods and emotions).&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|306}} On the one hand the Middle Platonists were engaged like the later Peripatetics in scholarly activities such as the exposition of Plato's doctrines and the explanation of his dialogues; on the other hand they attempted to develop the Platonic theories systematically. In so far as it was subject in this to the influence of [[Neopythagoreanism]], it was of considerable importance in preparing the way for [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref name="zeller"/&gt;{{rp|306}}

In [[modern philosophy]], [[Victor Cousin]] was the founder of eclectic [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: Brahman to Derrida'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, p. 10: "Victor Cousin's eclectic spiritualism".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{See also|Clinical pluralism|Eclectic psychotherapy|Integrative psychotherapy#Comparison with eclecticism}}
Eclecticism is recognized in approaches to [[psychology]] that see many factors influencing behavior and [[cognition]] or [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. In the 1970s, psychologists started using whichever approaches and techniques that they deemed appropriate for their client.&lt;ref name="intropsych"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intropsych.com/ch13_therapies/eclecticism_in_therapy.html|title=Eclecticism in Therapy {{!}} in Chapter 13: Therapies {{!}} from Psychology: An Introduction by Russ Dewey|website=www.intropsych.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They take multiple perspectives into consideration while identifying, explaining, and changing the behavior of the client.&lt;ref name="intropsych"/&gt;

'''''Ethical Consumer''''' is a not-for-profit UK magazine and website which publishes information on the social, ethical and environmental behaviour of companies and issues around [[trade justice]] and  [[ethical consumerism]]. It was founded in 1989 by Rob Harrison and Jane Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/poll/2010/sep/14/unsung-green-hero|accessdate=15 December 2011|title =Vote for your unsung green hero |location=London|work=The Guardian|author=Shanta Barley|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Workers-of-the-world-co-operate/|accessdate=15 December 2011|title=Workers of the world, co-operate!|author=Tim Hunt|website=RedPepper.org|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The mission of the ''Ethical Consumer'' is to promote "a society where the environment is respected, where human rights are properly protected and where animals are no longer cruelly exploited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/aboutus/ourmission/ourmanifesto.aspx|title=Our manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethical Consumer publishes reports and calls for boycotts of companies deemed unethical by its findings.

==History==
''Ethical Consumer'' magazine and its associated websites are produced by the Ethical Consumer Research Association (ECRA). Between 1989 and 2009 ECRA was a [[worker cooperative|worker co-operative]], based in [[Manchester]], UK. In 2009 ECRA became a not-for-profit multi-stakeholder [[cooperative|co-operative]] consisting of worker members and investor/subscriber members. It is an [[industrial and provident society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/AboutUs/MembersArea/uniquestructure.aspx|accessdate=15 December 2011| title =Co-op Structure|website=EthicalConsumer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company ratings ==
''Ethical Consumer'' publishes a company ratings tables which rate various products across 19 criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/Home/QuickGuide.aspx|accessdate=15 December 2011|title=Quick Guide to using Ethical Consumer|website=EthicalConsumer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data behind the ratings tables is produced by research into the social, ethical and environmental records of companies, using  media reporting, [[NGO]] reports, corporate communications and primary research.

== Other activities ==
The Corporate Critic website provides access to ECRA's database, tracking over 30,000 companies, providing information such as rating, ownership structure and turnover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3593">'''George Steven Botterill''' (born 8 January 1949) is a Welsh [[chess]] player, writer and philosopher.

Botterill was born in [[Bradford]] and learned chess at the age of seven.
From 1969 to 1972 he played for [[Oxford University]], and became one of Britain's leading young players.
In 1971 he won the Slater Young Masters tournament at [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]], and at Hastings 1971/2 he was the top scorer among the British players with 6.0/15.
Botterill won the 1974 [[British Chess Championship|British Championship]] at [[Clacton]], winning the playoff at [[Llanelli|Llanelli, Wales]] by a half point over [[William Hartston]] after a seven-way tie for first.
In 1977 Botterill won his second British Championship, this time outright.

Botterill won the [[Welsh Chess Championship|Welsh Championship]] in 1973 (jointly).
In 1974 he became a lecturer in [[philosophy]] at the [[Aberystwyth University|University of Wales at Aberystwyth]], and began to play for the Welsh international team.
In the Preliminary Group of the European Championship he scored 1½–½ against Dutch top board GM [[Jan Timman]] and 1–1 against English top board Hartston.
Botterill played first board for [[Wales]] at the 1976 [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]] and previously represented England at the World Student Team Championship and [[European Team Chess Championship]] of 1973. He holds the title of International Master.

Botterill is best known as a chess writer, in particular for his [[chess opening]] collaborations with [[Raymond Keene]]: ''The Modern Defence'' (London 1973) and ''The Pirc Defence'' (London 1974).  He is currently Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16629">'''Heavy NP shift''' is an operation that involves re-ordering ([[shifting (syntax)|shifting]]) a "heavy" [[noun phrase]] (NP) to a position to the right of its canonical position under certain circumstances. The heaviness of the NP is determined by its grammatical complexity; whether or not shifting occurs can impact the grammaticality of the sentence. 

Ross (1967) is thought to have been the first to systematically investigate the properties of heavy NP shift. Although the term '''heavy NP shift''' derives from the theoretical framework of [[transformational grammar]], which describes the process in terms of movement of the NP, linguists working in other frameworks also use this term. And in approaches to syntax where NP is analyzed as a determiner phrase (DP), heavy NP shift is called heavy DP shift.

== Factors contributing to the heaviness of an NP ==

Early observations of weight or heaviness have been credited to a rhythmical feel that unconsciously takes shape in languages, that is, the tendency of growth, to go from shorter to longer elements within a phrase. In these early observations, it was noted that when there are two constituents differing in size, the smaller constituent usually precedes the longer one &lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T. and Arnold, J., 2003. Post-verbal constituent ordering in English. Topics in English Linguistics, 43, pp.119-154.&lt;/ref&gt;. This observation has been more recently coined as the "principle of end-weight".&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R., Greenbaum, S., Leech, G.N. and Svartvik, J., 1972. A grammar of contemporary English.&lt;/ref&gt; The literature proposes many different definitions of weight or heaviness such as number of words in the NP (length of NP), number of nodes in the NP, and more generally number of phrasal nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T. and Arnold, J., 2003. Post-verbal constituent ordering in English. Topics in English Linguistics, 43, pp.119-154.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other observations on heaviness include: 

=== Complexity of NP ===
::*A NP's internal syntactic structure makes it 'complex'. A complex or heavy NP is one with a noun head and a modifying clause. &lt;ref&gt;Ross, J. 1967. Constraints on variables in syntax. Ph.D. Dissertation, MIT.&lt;/ref&gt;
      
::'''ex:''' NP[my rich uncle from Detroit] is complex as its noun head ''my'' and a modifying clause ''rich uncle from Detroit''. The internal structure is complex enough to be shifted to the right of its canonical position. 
::NP[N'[N my][NP[NP[AP rich][NP uncle]][PP[P from][NP Detroit]]]]]

=== Separability of NP ===
::* According to Chomsky (1975)&lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T. and Arnold, J., 2003. Post-verbal constituent ordering in English. Topics in English Linguistics, 43, pp.119-154.&lt;/ref&gt;, the separability of the indirect object is determined by the complexity of the direct object (NP). It is not length in words but rather the complexity of the object that determines the "naturalness of formation". 

::'''ex:''' "They brought '''all the leaders of the riot''' in" appears more natural than "They brought '''the man I saw''' in." According to Chomsky (1975), the constituent [the man I saw], although shorter than the constituent [all the leaders of the riot], is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T. and Arnold, J., 2003. Post-verbal constituent ordering in English. Topics in English Linguistics, 43, pp.119-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relative weight of NP ===
::*The relative weight of post verbal constituents influences their order, not the weight of any one constituent such as NP.&lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T. and Arnold, J., 2003. Post-verbal constituent ordering in English. Topics in English Linguistics, 43, pp.119-154.&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that independent of NP length and complexity, the NP did not shift unless it was at least 4 words longer than the surrounding material.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

::'''ex:''' The canonical phrase, I gave NP['''the valuable book that was extremely difficult to find'''] PP[to Mary], is more likely to shift the heavy NP to the end of the phrase since the NP is more than 4 words longer than the following prepositional phrase (PP).&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance ::theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Early versus late attachment of NP ===
::*A theory of Early Immediate Constituents (EIC)&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to explain word order variation at a phrase level of grammaticalization or more simply, a "save the hardest for last"&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, J.E., Losongco, A., Wasow, T. and Ginstrom, R., 2000. Heaviness vs. newness: The effects of structural complexity and discourse status on constituent ordering. Language, pp.28-55.&lt;/ref&gt; approach. Constituents are syntactically grouped so they can be recognized and produced rapidly and efficiently as possible. The parser must analyze the VP and it's immediate constituents then calculate how early the listener will be able to identify all the constituents by counting the number of words it takes until all immediate constituents (IC's) are recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, J.E., Losongco, A., Wasow, T. and Ginstrom, R., 2000. Heaviness vs. newness: The effects of structural complexity and discourse status on constituent ordering. Language, pp.28-55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

::'''ex:''' According to EIC, the phrase, [I gave&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mary&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; '''the&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; valuable book that was extremely difficult to find'''] is easy to remember because this phrase only requires 4 words (indicated by subscript numbers) to find all IC's. Compare this to, [I gave&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; '''the&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; valuable&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; book&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; that&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; was&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; extremely&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; difficult&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; find&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''' to&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; Mary], which requires 11 words to find all IC's. According to the EIC, the first example is preferred because it is easier to comprehend.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, J.E., Losongco, A., Wasow, T. and Ginstrom, R., 2000. Heaviness vs. newness: The effects of structural complexity and discourse status on constituent ordering. Language, pp.28-55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

::The EIC theory also proposes that word and constituent order varies cross linguistically and is dependent on whether a language is head final (such as Japanese and Korean) or head initial (such as English).&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== New information precedes old information ===
::*Pragmatic effects have been thought to influence heavy NP shift. According to this theory, items are sequenced so unpredictable content (new or important information) precedes predictable content (old or unimportant information)&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Heavy NP shift in different languages==

===Heavy NP shift in English===
Examples 1a, 2a, and 3a all show canonical order whereas 1b, 2b, 3b show the NP shifted to the right of its canonical position:

::1. a) I gave '''the book that I bought last week ''' to Mary.
::1. b) I gave to Mary '''the book that I bought last week.'''

::2. a) I met '''my rich uncle from Detroit''' on the street. 
::2. b) I met on the street '''my rich uncle from Detroit.'''

::3. a) I sent '''the recipes from the paper that I was talking about''' to you.  
::3. b) I sent to you '''the recipes from the paper that I was talking about'''. 
 
If a constituent is not considered 'heavy' or 'complex', the shift would not make grammatical sense or would be considered awkward to a native speaker of English, e.g. 

::4. a) I sent '''it''' to you. 
::4. b) *I sent to you '''it. '''

In example 4, the verb ''sent'' has a personal pronoun as its direct object. Typically, nothing can intervene between a verb and its personal pronoun in most dialects of English, e.g.

::5. a) I consider '''the problem''' unsolvable. 
::5. b) *I consider unsolvable '''the problem'''. 
In example 5b, the NP ''the problem'' is not complex enough to be shifted.

=== Heavy NP shift in Japanese===

'''Japanese''' is an SOV (subject, object, verb) language. Particles in Japanese encode syntactic functions, marking the relationship of the subject and object (NP) to the verb. This allows Japanese speakers to 'scramble' the order of particle-marked phrases which is important when considering word ordering biases such as heavy NP shift. In corpus studies and experiments, it has been shown that Japanese-speakers have a long-before-short bias, contrasting English biases of short-before-long in the presence of a heavy NP.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In an experiment&lt;ref&gt;Yamashita, H. and Chang, F., 2001. “Long before short” preference in the production of a head-final language. Cognition, 81(2), pp.B45-B55.&lt;/ref&gt;, participants had to create a sentence from a set of phrases that varied in length of the direct object (DO) and indirect object (IO) for dative verbs. In Japanese, the order for dative verbs is; subject (S) -indirect object (IO) -direct object (DO). For example, the 'short' phrase:

:: Masako wa(S) otoko ni(IO) '''keeki o'''(DO) haitatusita(V), translates to, ''Masako delivered '''the cake''' to the man''. 

In this study, participants chose this order for a short phrase the majority of the time, without rearranging the order of the IO and DO. However, when the DO and IO were lengthened, the participants were more likely to shift the longer phrase before the short phrase even if it switched the order from S-IO-DO to S-DO-IO. For example, the phrase:

::Masako wa(S) otoko ni(IO) '''sinbun de syookaisareta keeki o'''(DO) haitatusita(V).

was shifted so that the long DO was before the short IO:

:: Masako wa(S) '''sinbun de syookaisareta keeki o'''(DO) otoko ni(IO) haitatusita(V). 

If the IO was longer than the DO, the participants were less likely to switch the order, leaving it as S-IO-DO. This suggests that Japanese speakers have a bias towards placing longer phrases before shorter ones.

===Heavy NP shift in German===

'''German''' word order is variable and flexible and relies on a rich inflectional system. Rearrangements of an NP and PP can take place similar to English i.e. [NP PP V] or [PP NP V]. German does not allow a direct object NP to the right of a final verb.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John A. A performance theory of order and constituency. Vol. 73. Cambridge University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The examples below show the rearrangement of a heavy NP and a PP. Either order is acceptable in German as word order variation is not as strict as it is in other languages such as English. 

::'''1 a.)''' Ich habe [NP '''meinen reichen Onkel aus Berlin'''] [PP auf der Straße] [V getroffen].
::Gloss: I have my rich uncle from Berlin on the street met
::English translation: 'I met [NP '''my rich uncle from Berlin'''] [PP on the street].'

::'''1 b.)''' Ich habe [PP auf der Straße] [NP '''meinen reichen Onkel aus Berlin'''] [V getroffen].
::Gloss: I have on the street my rich uncle from Berlin met
::English translation: 'I met [PP on the street] [NP '''my rich uncle from Berlin'''].'

==Analyses of heavy NP shift==

=== Movement analyses of heavy NP shift ===

For analyses that treat heavy NP shift as movement, there are two kinds of shifts when considering heavy NPs: one involves rightward movement, the involves leftward movement.

==== Heavy NP shift as rightward movement ====

The first, and most traditional, is when a "heavy" object NP is shifted rightward to the end of the utterance. According to one theory &lt;ref&gt;Ross, J. 1967. Constraints on variables in syntax. Ph.D. Dissertation, MIT.&lt;/ref&gt; a complex NP will be shifted rightward if it does not cross over a verb. Another theory proposes a leftward movement of a "light" indirect object. According to this theory&lt;ref&gt;Kayne, R.S., 1994. The antisymmetry of syntax (No. 25). mit Press.&lt;/ref&gt; an indirect object is moved leftward independently of verb movement to a higher specifier position, next to the verb and before the direct object, leaving the heavy NP ''in situ''. 

This syntax tree shows an example of rightward movement of a heavy NP. The entire constituent ''my rich uncle from Detroit'' has 'shifted' from its position as a complement to the verb to an adjunct of the VP. This tree has been created using a particular style of syntax, mainly X-bar Theory.

==== Heavy NP shift as leftward movement ====

The syntax tree below shows an example of leftward movement of a 'light' indirect object. The constituent ''on the street'' has 'shifted' from its position in a small clause environment past the direct object to a higher functional specifier position leaving the 'heavy NP' ''in situ''&lt;ref&gt;Kayne, R.S., 1994. The antisymmetry of syntax (No. 25). mit Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. This syntax tree has been created using a particular style of syntax, mainly X-bar Theory.

=== Processing analyses of heavy NP shift ===
Psycholinguists want to understand when speakers resort to shifting heavy NPs to the end of a phrase. A study of printed corpus material&lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T., 1997. End-weight from the speaker's perspective. Journal of Psycholinguistic research, 26(3), pp.347-361.&lt;/ref&gt; found that different verbs exhibit different word order variation. The study focused on whether speakers and writers produce the word of heavy NP shift for their own benefit, or if they take into account the needs of the listener or reader. In this study, two verb classes were compared to test the choice of early and late commitment (points when the speaker has 'committed' themselves to producing a VP immediately followed by NP and PP constituents). The study examined transitive verbs, which require an NP object (e.g. ''bring'', ''carry'', ''make'', ''put'', etc.) and prepositional or intransitive verbs that do not require an NP object (e.g. ''add'', ''build'', ''call'', ''draw'', ''leave'', etc.).

&lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T., 1997. End-weight from the speaker's perspective. Journal of Psycholinguistic research, 26(3), pp.347-361.&lt;/ref&gt;Example of utterance with transitive verb:

::Pat brought '''a box with a ribbon around it''' →to the party.

::Pat brought →to the party '''a box with a ribbon around it'''. 

Example of utterance with intransitive verb:

::Pat wrote '''something about Chris'''→ on the blackboard. 

::Pat wrote on the blackboard →'''something about Chris'''. 

The arrows indicate where the speaker commits to producing a VP with an NP and PP following. They also indicate where the listener is sure the VP will contain a NP and PP. 

After analyzing written and spoken corpus data it was found that heavy NP shift is more common with intransitive verbs. This suggests using heavy NP shift word order with intransitive verbs allows the producer more time to decide whether they will include a direct object or not. This reduces the amount of planning needed and gives the speaker more time to articulate their thoughts. Having this extra time should in turn reduce the chance of the producer having to correct or abort an utterance &lt;ref&gt;Wasow, T., 1997. End-weight from the speaker's perspective. Journal of Psycholinguistic research, 26(3), pp.347-361.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Herman Leo Van Breda''' (born '''Leo Marie Karel'''; 28 February 1911, [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]], [[Belgium]] – 3 March 1974, [[Leuven]]) was a [[Franciscan]], philosopher and founder of the Husserl Archives at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium.

On 19 August 1934, he was ordained as a priest and in 1936 he started studying [[philosophy]] at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1941 with a dissertation on the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]]. Later he became a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he stayed until his death in 1974.

==Husserl Archives==
Van Breda saved the extensive writings and manuscripts of [[Edmund Husserl]] from destruction by the [[Nazi]]s.

For the preparation of his PhD thesis he traveled to [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]] in 1938, where he found, in the legacy of Edmund Husserl (1859–1938), more than 40000 ''[[Gabelsberger shorthand|Gabelsberger]]'' [[stenography]] manuscripts and his complete research library. The political situation in [[Germany]] at that time convinced him of the necessity to transport these manuscripts and Husserl’s private library to [[Leuven]]. In order to smuggle the documents out of [[Nazi]] Germany, he needed the support not only of the rector of the Catholic University of Leuven, but also of the Belgian government. The Belgian Prime Minister at that time, [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], allowed van Breda to bring the documents from Freiburg to the Belgian embassy in Berlin and diplomatic couriers to bring them to Leuven in Belgium.

Van Breda also was able to convince Husserl's former assistants, [[Eugen Fink]] and [[Ludwig Landgrebe]], to collaborate on the editing of these documents in Leuven. At the beginning of [[World War II]] the documents were being kept in the university library in Leuven, which burned to ashes on 17 May 1940. Fortunately, one week before the fire Van Breda decided to bring the documents to the Higher Institute of Philosophy.

In 1943 the documents were, for safety, distributed over different locations in Leuven, including a shelter in the cellar of the Institute of Philosophy and the [[Postel Abbey|Abbey of Postel]]. After the war they were brought back to the Institute of Philosophy, where they form the basis for the [[Husserliana]], the complete works of Edmund Husserl.

For his work on spreading Husserl’s work he was awarded an [[honoris causa]] doctorate from the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]].

'''The''' '''Holberg Prize''' is an international prize awarded annually by the [[government of Norway]] to outstanding scholars for work in [[the arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], law and theology, either within one of these fields or through interdisciplinary work. The prize is named after the Danish-Norwegian writer and academic [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1684 - 1754). The Holberg Prize comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian kroner ([[Norwegian krone|NOK]]) (approximately $750 000 or €660 000), which are intended to be used to further the research of the recipient. The winner of the Holberg Prize is announced in March, and the award ceremony takes place every June in Bergen, Norway.

== History ==
The prize was established by the [[Parliament of Norway]] in honor of [[Ludvig Holberg]] in 2003 and complements its sister prize in mathematics, the [[Abel Prize]]. Ludvig Holberg, who excelled in all the disciplines covered by the award, played an important part in bringing the Enlightenment to the Nordic countries and is also well known as a playwright and author. The objective of the prize was to increase awareness of the value of academic scholarship in the arts,humanities, social sciences, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as the "Nobel Prize" for the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology.

== Selection criteria ==
The Holberg Prize is awarded annually to scholars who have made "outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law or theology." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars holding positions at universities and other research institutions, including academies, are eligible to nominate candidates to the Holberg Prize and the Nils Klim Prize. Self-nominations are not permitted. The Holberg Board awards the prize at the recommendation of the Holberg Committee.The Holberg Committee meets twice. At the first meeting, in early fall, they choose a shortlist from the nominations. The Committee then gather assessments on the short-list candidates from internationally recognized scholars before giving their final recommendation to the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Holberg Prize is funded through a direct allocation from the Norwegian government's budget. It is administered by the University of Bergen on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Research. The University of Bergen appoints the executive board of the Holberg Prize. The Holberg Board consists of the board chair and four board member. The board members must work in different institutions, and at least one board member must work outside the university and university college sector. Board members are appointed for a period of four years and may be reappointed once. Current chair of the Holberg board is professor [[Sigmund Grønmo]]. 
[[File:Bergen Museum garden.jpg|thumb|''The Holberg Prize is awarded annually in the University Aula in Bergen.'']]

The Holberg Board awards the prize at the recommendation of the Holberg Committee who consists of five outstanding researchers in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology. The current Holberg Prize Academic Committee is composed of: [[Hazel Genn|Dame Hazel Genn]] (Committee chairman, [[University College London]]), [http://www.swedishcollegium.se/subfolders/Fellows/Permanent_Fellows/bjorn.html Björn Wittrock] ([[Uppsala University]]), [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), [[Graeme Turner]] ([[University of Queensland|The University of Queensland]]) and [[Cui Zhiyuan]] ([[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua University).]]

Previous members of the Holberg Committee are among others: [[Mary Jacobus (academic)|Mary Jacobus]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), [[Helga Nowotny]] ([[ETH Zurich]]), [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] ([[New York University]]), [[Toril Moi]] ([[Duke University]]), [[Stein Kuhnle]] ([[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|The Norwegian Academy og Science and Letters]]),  [[Johan Olsen|Johan P. Olsen]] ([[University of Bergen]]), and [[Pratap Bhanu Mehta]] ([[Centre for Policy Research|Center for policy research]]).

== The Holberg Week ==
During The Holberg Week in June, The Holberg Prize hosts a series of lectures, discussions and other events in honor of the Holberg Laureate and the Nils Klim Laureate. The events feature the laureates, as well as other high-profile international scholars. The program feature, among other things, the Holberg Symposium, the Nils Klim Seminar and the Holberg Lecture. All events during the Holberg week, with the exception of the award ceremony and government banquet, are open to all and have free entrance. Several of the events are also livestreamed, and available to an international audience.

In addition to The Holberg Week, The Holberg Debate is held in December each year. The debate marks Ludvig Holberg's ideas of enlightenment, and seeks to discuss and find answers to key social issues. The Holberg Debate was held for the first time in 2016. Former participants in the Holberg Debate are [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[Jostein Gripsrud]], [[Jonathan Heawood]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Julian Assange]].

== Other prizes ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6711">'''Hongaku''' ({{cjkv|c=本覺|p=běnjué|rr=bongak}}) is an [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian Buddhist doctrine]] often translated as "inherent", "innate", "intrinsic" or "original" [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] and is the view that all sentient beings already are enlightened or awakened in some way. It is closely tied with the concept of [[Buddha-nature]].

==Origins and development==
The doctrine of innate enlightenment was developed in China out of the Buddha-nature doctrine. It is first mentioned in the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]] scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Sueki Fumihiko, "Two Seemingly Contradictory Aspects of the Teaching of Innate Enlightenment (hongaku) in Medieval Japan", Japanese Journal of Religious Study 22 (1-2), pp. 3-16, 1995. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112093012/http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag32125.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqueline Stone, The awakening of faith in the Mahayana sees original enlightenment as "true [[tathātā|suchness]] considered under the aspect of conventional deluded consciousness and thus denotes the potential for enlightenment in unenlightened beings."&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jacqueline|title=Medieval Tendai hongaku thought and the new Kamakura Buddhism: A reconsideration|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=1 May 1995|volume=22|issue=1-2|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2559|doi=10.18874/jjrs.22.1-2.1995.17-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval China, the doctrine developed from the [[Huayan]] school and also influenced [[Chan Buddhism]].

The doctrine is also a common theme of the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]] and was taught by Chinese Chan masters as "seeing original nature". Inherent enlightenment was often associated with the teachings of [[subitism| sudden enlightenment]] and contrasted with the "gradual" approach and the idea of “acquired enlightenment” or ''shikaku''. The first Japanese to write of this doctrine was [[Kūkai]] (774–835), founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]].

==In Japanese Buddhism==
The doctrine of innate enlightenment was very influential in [[Tendai]] from the [[cloistered rule]] era (1086–1185) through the [[Edo period]] (1688–1735).&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; The Tendai view of hongaku saw it as encompassing not only all sentient beings, but all living things and all nature, even inanimate objects - all were considered to be Buddha. This also includes all our actions and thoughts, even our deluded thoughts, as expressions of our innately enlightened nature.&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

Tamura Yoshirõ (1921–1989) saw original {{Nihongo|enlightenment thought|本覺思想|hongaku shisō}} as being defined by two major philosophical elements.&lt;ref&gt; Tamura Yoshirō (1987), Japanese culture and the Tendai concept of original enlightenment, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 14 (2-3), 203-205 [https://web.archive.org/web/20131229102232/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2355 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; One was a radical non-dualism, in which everything was seen as empty and interconnected, so that the differences between ordinary person and Buddha and all other distinctions, were ontologically negated. The other feature of hongaku was the affirmation of the phenomenal world as an expression of the nondual realm of Buddha nature. This was expressed in phrases such as “the worldly passions are precisely enlightenment” and “birth and death are precisely nirvana.”&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

The Tendai doctrine of hongaku had deep impact on the development of [[Kamakura period#Flourishing of Buddhism|New Kamakura Buddhism]], for many of those who founded new Kamakura Buddhist schools (Eisai, Honen, Shinran, Dogen and Nichiren) studied Tendai at [[Mount Hiei]].&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

During the 1980s a Japanese movement known as [[Critical Buddhism]] has attacked original enlightenment as an ideology that supports the status quo and legitimates social injustice by accepting all things as they are as expressions of original Buddha nature.

This view is pursued in at least three ways: libertarians deny that the universe is deterministic, the hard determinists deny that any free will exists, and pessimistic incompatibilists (hard indeterminists) deny both that the universe is determined and that free will exists.

Incompatibilism is contrasted with [[compatibilism]], which rejects the determinism/free will dichotomy.

== Libertarianism ==
{{Main|libertarianism (metaphysics)}}

Metaphysical [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] argues that free will is real and that determinism is false. Such dualism risks an [[infinite regress]] however;&lt;ref&gt;Libertarian free will asserts that human actions do not have causes and are chosen consciously - i.e. are not random. This begs the question: what causes these actions? Since they can't be chosen at random by, as explained above, this question can be asked for each subsequent answer to it, thus forming an infinite regress. Similarly, in the 20th century, in the Frankfurt's concept of [[Free will#Free will as psychological state|hierarchical mesh]]. Similarly, G. Strawson (1998, 2004), Free will, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; if any such mind is real, an objection can still be raised using the standard argument against free will{{clarify|date=May 2017}} that it is shaped by a necessity or chance.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} Libertarian Robert Kane (among others) presented an alternative model:

[[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] (editor of the ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'') is a leading incompatibilist philosopher in favour of free will. Kane seeks to hold persons morally responsible for decisions that involved indeterminism in their process. Critics maintain that Kane fails to overcome the greatest challenge to such an endeavor: "the argument from luck".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, if a critical moral choice is a matter of luck (indeterminate quantum fluctuations), then on what grounds can we hold a person responsible for their final action? Moreover, even if we imagine that a person can make an act of will ahead of time, to make the ''moral'' action more probable in the upcoming critical moment, this act of 'willing' was itself a matter of luck.

[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarianism]] in the philosophy of mind is unrelated to the like-named political philosophy. It suggests that we actually do have free will, that it is incompatible with determinism, and that therefore the future is not determined. For example, at this moment, one could either continue reading this article if one wanted, or cease. Under this assertion, being that one could do either, the fact of how the history of the world will continue to unfold is not currently determined one way or the other.

One famous proponent of this view was [[Lucretius]], who asserted that the free will arises out of the random, chaotic movements of atoms, called "[[clinamen]]". One major objection to this view is that science has gradually shown that more and more of the physical world obeys completely deterministic laws, and seems to suggest that our minds are just as much part of the physical world as anything else. If these assumptions are correct, incompatibilist libertarianism can only be maintained as the claim that free will is a supernatural phenomenon, which does not obey the laws of nature (as, for instance, maintained by some religious traditions).

However, many libertarian view points now rely upon an [[indeterministic]] view of the physical universe, under the assumption that the idea of a deterministic, "clockwork" universe has become [[quantum indeterminacy|outdated]] since the advent of [[quantum mechanics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} By assuming an indeterministic universe libertarian philosophical constructs can be proposed under the assumption of [[physicalism]].

There are libertarian view points based upon indeterminism and [[physicalism]], which is closely related to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/williams-mind.shtml |title=Why Naturalists Should Mind about Physicalism, and Vice Versa |author-last=Williams |author-first=Peter S. |journal=[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]] |volume=4 |issue= 2–3 |date= Summer 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem for [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic]] libertarianism is to explain how indeterminism can be compatible with rationality and with appropriate connections between an individual's beliefs, desires, general character and actions. A variety of naturalistic libertarianism is promoted by [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/#2.2A summary of Kane's views by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Robert. “Free Will: New Directions for an Ancient Problem.” (2003). In Free Will, Robert Kane (ed.) (2003) Malden, MA: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; who emphasizes that if our ''character'' is formed indeterministically (in "self-forming actions"), then our actions can still flow from our character, and yet still be incompatibilistically free.

Alternatively, libertarian view points based upon indeterminism have been proposed without the assumption of naturalism. At the time [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'',&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality (noting that, under a physicalist point of view, the non-physical entity must be independent of the self-identity or mental processing of the sentient being). Lewis mentions this only in passing, making clear that his thesis does not depend on it in any way.

Others may use some form of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s [[anomalous monism]] to suggest that although the mind is in fact part of the physical world, it involves a different level of description of the same facts, so that although there are deterministic laws under the physical description, there are no such laws under the mental description, and thus our actions are free and not determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/david_sosa/iWeb/SosaSite/Papers_files/FreeMental!.rtfDavid Sosa -- ''Free Mental Causation!'' (MS Word)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hard determinism ==
[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] said "Man is free to do what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills" The Hard Determinist says that obviously, then, there is no 'free will']]
{{Main|hard determinism}}

Those who reject free will and accept [[determinism]] are variously known as "hard determinists", hard incompatibilists, free will skeptics, illusionists, or impossibilists. They believe that there is no 'free will' and that any sense of the contrary is an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Smilansky, ''Free Will and Illusion'', Oxford, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, hard determinists do not deny that one has desires, but say that these desires are [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. According to this philosophy, no wholly [[randomness|random]], [[wiktionary:Spontaneous|spontaneous]], mysterious, or [[miracle|miraculous]] events occur.
Determinists sometimes assert that it is stubborn to resist scientifically motivated determinism on purely intuitive grounds about one's own sense of freedom. They reason that the history of the development of science suggests that determinism is the logical method in which reality works.

[[William James]] said that philosophers (and scientists) have an "antipathy to chance."&lt;ref&gt;William James, ''The Dilemma of Determinism'', p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute chance, a possible implication of [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[indeterminacy principle]], implies a lack of [[causality]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This possibility often disturbs those who assume there must be a causal and lawful explanation for all events.

=== Moral implications ===
Since many believe that free will is necessary for [[moral responsibility]], this may imply disastrous consequences for their theory of [[ethics]].

As something of a solution to this predicament, it has been suggested that, for the sake of preserving moral responsibility and the concept of ethics, one might embrace the so-called "illusion" of free will. This, despite thinking that free will does not exist according to determinism. Critics argue that this move renders morality merely another "illusion", or else that this move is simply hypocritical.

The Determinist will add that, even if denying free will does mean morality is incoherent, such an unfortunate result has no effect on the [[truth]]. Note, however, that hard determinists often have some sort of '[[Ethics|moral]] system' that relies explicitly on determinism. A Determinist's moral system simply bears in mind that every person's actions in a given situation are, in theory, predicted by the interplay of environment and upbringing. For instance, the Determinist may still [[Punishment|punish]] undesirable behaviours for reasons of behaviour modification or deterrence.

== Hard incompatibilism ==
&lt;!-- [[Hard incompatibilism]] redirects here. --&gt;
Hard incompatibilism, like hard determinism, is a type of skepticism about free will. 'Hard incompatibilism' is a term coined by [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] to designate the view that both determinism and indeterminism are incompatible with having free will and moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Living without Free Will|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Hard determinism|hard determinist]], the hard incompatibilist holds that if determinism were true, our having free will would be ruled out. But Pereboom argues in addition that if our decisions were indeterministic events, free will would also be precluded. In his view, free will is the control in action required for the [[Desert (philosophy)|desert]] aspect of moral responsibility—for our deserving to be blamed or punished for immoral actions, and to be praised or rewarded for morally exemplary actions. He contends that if our decisions were indeterministic events, their occurrence would not be in the control of the agent in the way required for such attributions of desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility for free will that remains is [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] [[Agent causation (philosophy)|agent causation]], according to which agents as substances (thus not merely as having a role in events) can cause actions without being causally determined to do so. Pereboom argues that for empirical reasons it is unlikely that we are agent causes of this sort, and that as a result, it is likely that we lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[https://philpapers.org/rec/PERDHI Derk Pereboom, "Defending Hard incompatibilism", ''Midwest Studies'' 29 (2005), pp. 228–47.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental research ==
In recent years researchers in the field of [[experimental philosophy]] have been working on determining whether ordinary people, who aren't experts in this field, naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy Nahmias, Stephen Morris, Thomas Nadelhoffer, and Jason Turner. (forthcoming).[http://philpapers.org/archive/NADIII/“Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?,”] Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental work has even conducted cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).[http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/Is_Belief_in_Free_will_a_Cultural_Universal "Is belief in free will a cultural universal?"] Mind &amp; Language&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other. Still, there has been some evidence that people can naturally hold both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases which ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give ''incompatibilist'' answers, but when presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give ''compatibilist'' answers).&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Nichols and Joshua Knobe. (forthcoming).[http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/Nichols-Knobe.pdf “Moral Responsibility and Determinism: The Cognitive Science of Folk Intuitions.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211132936/http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/Nichols-Knobe.pdf |date=December 11, 2009 }} Nous.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7179">'''{{IAST|Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa}}''' (fl. c. 800&lt;ref&gt; dated to ca. 770–830 by Franco (1994) and ca. 800–840 by Balcerowicz (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[scepticism|sceptical]] (''[[ajñana]]'') [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]],  author of the '''''Tattvopaplavasiṃha''''' (''[[tattva]]-upa.plava-siṃha'' "The Lion that Devours All Categories"/"The Upsetting of All Principles").

The text was discovered in a single manuscript in the 20th century. Its original 1940 edition attributed it to the [[materialist]] [[Charvaka]] school, but scholarly opinion on this point remains divided. The work is primarily [[epistemology|epistemological]] in nature, reminiscent of the sceptical philosophy of [[David Hume]].
 
==''Tattvopaplavasimha''==
The manuscript of ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' was discovered in 1926 and published in 1940 by Saṁghavī and Pārīkh. The  book examines [[epistemology]], where Jayarāśi considers the [[pramāna]] (sources of knowledge) accepted in establishing conclusions (perception, inference, and testimony), and proves that none of them are sufficient for establishing knowledge. Inference relies on [[inductive reasoning]], which cannot be shown to be universal premises. Testimony requires the reliability of the witness, which must be established by another of the pramāna. Even direct perception cannot establish truth, because it requires that the perception not be erroneous or illusory, which also cannot be established. Therefore, Jayarāsi argues that none of the sources of knowledge are valid, and nothing can be known for certain.

Jayarāsi challenged the [[āstika]] establishment's belief in supernatural beings by attacking their epistemology. Since none of the sources of knowledge are valid, how can anything be said about these beings? Therefore, he argued for the reasonability of atheism, and that happiness in one's life is the most reasonable goal. Jayarasi represented a philosophy of extreme [[skepticism]], claiming no school of philosophy can claim its view of reality as knowledge, including the Cārvāka itself; however, because Cārvāka philosophy represents common sense, it could be used as a guide.

==Association with Cārvāka==
''Tattvopaplavasimha'' is regarded by some authors as belonging to the  [[Cārvāka]] (Lokāyata) school.  [[Sukhlal Sanghvi]] and [[Rasiklal Parikh]], [[D.R. Shastri]], [[Eli Franco]], [[Karin Presidendanz]], and [[Piotr Barcelowicz]] are examples.
Franco (1994), for instance, says "''Tattvopaplavasimha'' is the only Lokayata text which has been discovered so far".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Franco|1994|page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is opposed by scholars including [[Karel Werner]], [[Walter Ruben (Indologist)|Walter Ruben]], [[K.K Dixit]], [[Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya]], [[M. K. Gangopadhyaya]], [[A H Salunkhe]], and [[Ramkrishna Bhattacharya]].
Werner (1995), for instance, is sceptical of the claim that ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' is a Cārvāka text. He however accepts that the text is an important secondary source for Cārvāka.

According to [[Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya]], "Jayarāśi, who claims to be intellectually superior to Bṛhaspati, could ... hardly be a follower of Bṛhaspati himself, i.e., could hardly be the leader of any imaginary offshoot of the Cārvāka or Bārhaspatya system".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1964|page=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In support of his view that ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' is not a Cārvāka/Lokāyata text, Chattopadhyaya says "it is moreover necessary to remember that Jayarāśi claims as his final achievement the annihilation of the vanity of the ''Pāṣaṇḍin [pākhaṇḍin]''-s (''Tattvopaplavasiṃha'' Baroda edition p.125). Now whatever might have been the exact meaning of the word ''pāṣaṇḍin'', it could by no stretch of imagination have excluded the Lokāyatikas and Cārvākas." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1964|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salunkhe also holds that Jayarasi Bhatta did not belong to the Cārvāka school of philosophy as he denies even ''[[Pratyakşa]] pramana'' and four ''[[Mahābhūta]]''s that Cārvāka had accepted. He notes Jayarsi as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] and anti-philosophic rather than a materialistic Lokāyatika.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salunkhe|2009|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramkrishna Bhattacharya]] adduces an argument from within the text itself to refute the claim that ''Tattvopaplava-siṃha'' is a Cārvāka text. He says, "there is indeed a Cārvāka at the very beginning of the Tattvopaplava-siṃha. But he is not Jayarāśi, but another person who is presented as a Cārvāka out to challenge Jayarāśi’s doctrine of upsetting tattva as such. This objector has to be a Cārvāka, for who but a Cārvāka would refer to the basic premises of materialism and stand upon them? The presence of this objector and the way Jayarāśi gets into controversy with him clearly indicate that Jayarāśi himself was not a Cārvāka or did not even belong to ‘a section of the Cārvāka’ (''cārvākaikadeśya'')".&lt;ref name="Bhatta2"&gt;Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna.

'''Jean Baudrillard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|oʊ|d|r|i|ˈ|ɑːr}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ bodʁijaʁ|lang}}; 27 July 1929 – 6 March 2007) was a French [[sociology|sociologist]], philosopher, [[sociology of culture|cultural theorist]], political commentator, and photographer. He is best known for his analyses of media, contemporary culture, and technological communication, as well as his formulation of concepts such as [[simulation]] and [[hyperreality]]. He wrote about diverse subjects, including [[consumerism]], [[Gender role|gender relations]], economics, [[social history]], art, Western [[foreign policy]], and popular culture. Among his best known works are ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' (1981), ''America'' (1986), and ''[[The Gulf War Did Not Take Place]]'' (1991). His work is frequently associated with [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]] and specifically [[post-structuralism]].

==Life==
Baudrillard was born in [[Reims]], northeastern France, on 27 July 1929. His grandparents were [[peasant]] farm workers and his father a policeman.  During high school (at the [[Lycée]] at Reims), he became aware of [[pataphysics]] (via philosophy professor Emmanuel Peillet), which is said to be crucial for understanding Baudrillard's later thought.&lt;ref name="Francois L 2004, p.317"&gt;François L'Yvonnet, ed., Cahiers de l'Herne special volume on Baudrillard, Editions de l'Herne, 2004, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first of his family to attend university when he moved to Paris to attend the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Poole. [https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2028464,00.html "Jean Baudrillard. Philosopher and sociologist who blurred the boundaries between reality and simulation"], ''[[The Guardian]]''. 7 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There he studied German language and [[German literature|literature]],&lt;ref&gt;In 1948, he completed his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) on [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Martin Luther|Luther]] (see [http://www.larevuedesressources.org/+journees-jean-baudrillard-musee-du-quai-branly-paris-17-18-09-2010,863+.html Journées Jean Baudrillard Musée du quai Branly Paris 17-18/09/2010]).&lt;/ref&gt; which led him to begin teaching the subject at several different [[lycée]]s, both Parisian and provincial, from 1960 until 1966.&lt;ref name="Francois L 2004, p.317"/&gt; While teaching, Baudrillard began to publish reviews of literature and translated the works of such authors as [[Peter Weiss]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Emil Mühlmann|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;François L'Yvonnet, ed., Cahiers de l'Herne special volume on Baudrillard, Editions de l'Herne, 2004, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching German, Baudrillard began to transfer to sociology, eventually completing and publishing in 1968 his doctoral thesis ''Le Système des Objets'' (''[[The System of Objects]]'') under the dissertation committee of [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. Subsequently, he began teaching Sociology at the [[Paris X Nanterre]], a university campus just outside Paris which would become heavily involved in the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Turner's introduction to ''The Intelligence of Evil'', Berg (2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Baudrillard worked closely with Philosopher Humphrey De Battenburge, who described Baudrillard as a "visionary".&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Arthur (1982). ''French Philosophers in the 20th Century'', p. 9. MacMillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; At Nanterre he took up a position as ''Maître Assistant'' (Assistant Professor), then ''Maître de Conférences'' (Associate Professor), eventually becoming a professor after completing his accreditation, ''L'Autre par lui-même'' (''The Other by Himself'').

In 1970, Baudrillard made the first of his many trips to the United States ([[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado), and in 1973, the first of several trips to [[Kyoto]], Japan. He was given his first camera in 1981 in Japan, which led to his becoming a photographer.&lt;ref&gt;François L'Yvonnet, ed., Cahiers de l'Herne special volume on Baudrillard, Editions de l'Herne, 2004, pp. 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he moved to IRIS (Institut de Recherche et d'Information Socio-Économique) at the [[University of Paris|Université de Paris-IX Dauphine]], where he spent the latter part of his teaching career. During this time he had begun to move away from sociology as a discipline (particularly in its "classical" form), and, after ceasing to teach full-time, he rarely identified himself with any particular discipline, although he remained linked to academia. During the 1980s and 1990s his books had gained a wide audience, and in his last years he became, to an extent, an intellectual celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Barry Sandywell's article "Forget Baudrillard", in ''Theory, Culture and Society'' (1995, issue 12)&lt;/ref&gt; being published often in the French- and English-speaking popular press. He nonetheless continued supporting the Institut de Recherche sur l'Innovation Sociale at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] and was ''[[Satrap]]'' at the [[Pataphysics|Collège de Pataphysique]]. Baudrillard taught at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/biography/ Jean Baudrillard] Faculty page at [[European Graduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated at the Canadian theory, culture, and technology review ''[[Ctheory]]'', where he was abundantly cited. He also participated in the ''[[International Journal of Baudrillard Studies]]'' from its inception in 2004 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies |title=Baudrillard Studies |publisher=Ubishops.ca |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999–2000, his photographs were exhibited at the [[Maison européenne de la photographie]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;François L'Yvonnet, ed., Cahiers de l'Herne special volume on Baudrillard, Editions de l'Herne, 2004, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Baudrillard attended the major conference on his work, "Baudrillard and the Arts", at the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe]] in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;François L'Yvonnet, ed., Cahiers de l'Herne special volume on Baudrillard, Editions de l'Herne, 2004, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core ideas==
Baudrillard's published work emerged as part of a generation of French thinkers including: [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jacques Lacan]] who all shared an interest in [[semiotics]], and he is often seen as a part of the [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] philosophical school.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pericles Trifonas, ''Barthes and the Empire of Signs'', Icon (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In common with many post-structuralists, his arguments consistently draw upon the notion that signification and meaning are both only understandable in terms of how particular words or "signs" interrelate. Baudrillard thought, as do many post-structuralists, that meaning is brought about through ''systems'' of signs working together. Following on from the [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], Baudrillard argued that meaning (value) is created through difference—through what something is not (so "dog" means "dog" because it is not-"cat", not-"goat", not-"tree", etc.). In fact, he viewed meaning as near enough self-referential: objects, images of objects, words and signs are situated in a web of meaning; one object's meaning is only understandable through its relation to the meaning of other objects; for instance, one thing's prestige relates to another's mundanity.

From this starting point Baudrillard theorized broadly about human society based upon this kind of self-referentiality. His writing portrays societies always searching for a sense of meaning—or a "total" understanding of the world—that remains consistently elusive. In contrast to [[post-structuralists|Post-structuralism]] (such as [[Michel Foucault]]), for whom the formations of knowledge emerge only as the result of relations of power, Baudrillard developed theories in which the excessive, fruitless search for total knowledge leads almost inevitably to a kind of delusion. In Baudrillard's view, the (human) subject may try to understand the (non-human) object, but because the object can only be understood according to what it signifies (and because the process of signification immediately involves a web of other signs from which it is distinguished) this never produces the desired results. The subject is, rather, ''seduced'' (in the original Latin sense, ''seducere'', to lead away) by the object. He argued therefore that, in final analysis, a complete understanding of the minutiae of human life is impossible, and when people are seduced into thinking otherwise they become drawn toward a "simulated" version of reality, or, to use one of his [[neologism]]s, a state of "hyperreality". This is not to say that the world becomes unreal, but rather that the faster and more comprehensive societies begin to bring reality together into one supposedly coherent picture, the more insecure and unstable it looks and the more fearful societies become.&lt;ref&gt;see here Baudrillard's final major publication in English, ''The Intelligence of Evil'', where he discussed the political fallout of what he calls "Integral Reality"&lt;/ref&gt; Reality, in this sense, "dies out".&lt;ref&gt;as he argued in the book ''The Perfect Crime'', Verso (1995) for instance&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Baudrillard argued that the excess of signs and of meaning in late 20th century "global" society had caused (quite paradoxically) an effacement of reality. In this world neither liberal nor Marxist utopias are any longer believed in. We live, he argued, not in a "[[Global village (term)|global village]]", to use [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s phrase, but rather in a world that is ever more easily petrified by even the smallest event. Because the "global" world operates at the level of the exchange of signs and commodities, it becomes ever more blind to ''symbolic'' acts such as, for example, terrorism. In Baudrillard's work the symbolic realm (which he develops a perspective on through the [[anthropology|anthropological]] work of [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Georges Bataille]]) is seen as quite distinct from that of signs and signification. Signs can be exchanged like commodities; symbols, on the other hand, operate quite differently: they are exchanged, like gifts, sometimes violently as a form of [[potlatch]]. Baudrillard, particularly in his later work, saw the "global" society as without this "symbolic" element, and therefore symbolically (if not militarily) defenseless against acts such as the [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Rushdie Fatwa]]&lt;ref&gt;see here ''The Transparency of Evil'', Verso (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; or, indeed, the [[September 11 terrorist attack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s against the United States and its military and economic establishment.

===The object value system===
In his early books, such as ''[[The System of Objects]]'', ''For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign'', and ''The Consumer Society'', Baudrillard's main focus is upon consumerism, and how different objects are consumed in different ways. At this time Baudrillard's political outlook was loosely associated with [[Marxism]] (and [[Situationism]]), but in these books he differed from [[Karl Marx]] in one significant way. For Baudrillard, as for the situationists, it was consumption rather than production that was the main driver of [[capitalist society]].

Baudrillard came to this conclusion by criticising Marx's concept of "use-value". Baudrillard thought that both Marx's and [[Adam Smith]]'s economic thought accepted the idea of genuine needs relating to genuine uses too easily and too simply. Baudrillard argued, drawing from [[Georges Bataille]], that needs are constructed, rather than innate. He stressed that all purchases, because they always signify something ''socially'', have their fetishistic side. Objects always, drawing from [[Roland Barthes]], "say something" about their users. And this was, for him, why consumption was and remains more important than production: because the "ideological genesis of needs" precedes the production of goods to meet those needs.&lt;ref&gt;p. 63 in ''For a Critique&amp;nbsp;...'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote that there are four ways of an object obtaining value. The four value-making processes are:&lt;ref&gt;as set out in ''For a Critique&amp;nbsp;...'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first is the ''functional'' value of an object; its instrumental purpose (use value). A pen, for instance, writes; a refrigerator cools.
# The second is the ''exchange'' value of an object; its economic value. One pen may be worth three pencils; and one refrigerator may be worth the salary earned by three months of work.
# The third is the ''symbolic'' value of an object; a value that a subject assigns to an object ''in relation to another subject'' (i.e., between a giver and receiver). A pen might symbolize a student's school graduation gift or a commencement speaker's gift; or a diamond may be a symbol of publicly declared marital love.
# The last is the ''sign'' value of an object; its value within a ''system'' of objects. A particular pen may, while having no added functional benefit, signify prestige relative to another pen; a diamond ring may have no function at all, but may suggest particular social values, such as taste or class.

Baudrillard's earlier books were attempts to argue that the first two of these values are not simply associated, but are disrupted by the third and, particularly, the fourth. Later, Baudrillard rejected Marxism totally (''The Mirror of Production'' and ''Symbolic Exchange and Death''). But the focus on the difference between sign value (which relates to commodity exchange) and symbolic value (which relates to [[Marcel Mauss|Maussian]] gift exchange) remained in his work up until his death. Indeed, it came to play a more and more important role, particularly in his writings on world events.

===''Simulacra and Simulation''===
{{Main article|Simulacra and Simulation}}
As he developed his work throughout the 1980s, he moved from economic theory to mediation and [[mass communication]]. Although retaining his interest in [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[semiotics]] and the logic of symbolic exchange (as influenced by anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]]), Baudrillard turned his attention to the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], developing ideas about how the nature of social relations is determined by the forms of communication that a society employs. In so doing, Baudrillard progressed beyond both Saussure's and [[Roland Barthes]]'s formal semiology to consider the implications of a historically understood version of structural semiology.

Simulation, Baudrillard claims, is the current stage of the simulacrum: all is composed of references with no referents, a hyperreality.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-i-the-precession-of-simulacra/ Simulacra and Simulations. The Precession of Simulacra.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729034203/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-i-the-precession-of-simulacra |date=29 July 2010 }} [[European Graduate School]].&lt;/ref&gt; Progressing historically from the Renaissance, in which the dominant simulacrum was in the form of the counterfeit—mostly people or objects appearing to stand for a real referent (for instance, royalty, nobility, holiness, etc.) that does not exist, in other words, in the spirit of pretense, in dissimulating others that a person or a thing does not really "have it"—to the [[Industrial Revolution]], in which the dominant simulacrum is the product, the series, which can be propagated on an endless production line; and finally to current times, in which the dominant simulacrum is the model, which by its nature already stands for endless reproducibility, and is itself already reproduced.

===The end of history and meaning===
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, one of Baudrillard's most common themes was [[historicity (philosophy)|historicity]], or, more specifically, how present-day societies utilise the notions of progress and modernity in their political choices. He argued, much like the political theorist [[Francis Fukuyama]], that history had ended or "vanished" with the spread of [[globalization]]; but, unlike Fukuyama, Baudrillard averred that this end should not be understood as the culmination of history's progress, but as the collapse of the very ''idea'' of historical progress. For Baudrillard, the end of the [[Cold War]] did not represent an ideological victory; rather, it signaled the disappearance of utopian visions shared between both the political Right and Left. Giving further evidence of his opposition toward Marxist visions of global communism and liberal visions of global civil society, Baudrillard contended that the ends they hoped for had always been illusions; indeed, as ''The Illusion of the End'' argues, he thought the idea of an end itself was nothing more than a misguided dream:

{{quote|The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illusion of the End'', or ''Selected Writings'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within a society subject to and ruled by fast-paced electronic communication and global information networks the collapse of this façade was always going to be, he thought, inevitable. Employing a quasi-scientific vocabulary that attracted the ire of the physicist [[Alan Sokal]], Baudrillard wrote that the speed society moved at had destabilized the linearity of history: "we have the [[particle accelerator]] that has smashed the referential orbit of things once and for all".&lt;ref&gt;''The Illusion of the End'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In making this argument Baudrillard found some affinity with the [[postmodern philosophy]] of [[Jean-François Lyotard]], who famously argued that in the late 20th century there was no longer any room for "[[metanarrative]]s". (The triumph of a coming communism being one such metanarrative.) But, in addition to simply lamenting this collapse of history, Baudrillard also went beyond Lyotard and attempted to analyse how the idea of forward progress was being employed in spite of the notion's declining validity. Baudrillard argued that although genuine belief in a universal endpoint of history, wherein all conflicts would find their resolution, had been deemed redundant, universality was still a notion utilised in world politics as an excuse for actions. Universal values which, according to him, no one any longer believed universal were and are still rhetorically employed to justify otherwise unjustifiable choices. The means, he wrote, are there even though the ends are no longer believed in, and are employed in order to hide the present's harsh realities (or, as he would have put it, unrealities). "In the Enlightenment, universalization was viewed as unlimited growth and forward progress. Today, by contrast, universalization is expressed as a forward ''escape''."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/the-violence-of-the-global/ "The Violence of the Global"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152945/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/the-violence-of-the-global/ |date=27 May 2010 }}, [[European Graduate School]]. Translated by François Debrix.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves the notion of "escape velocity" as outlined in ''The Vital Illusion'' (2000), which in turn, results in the postmodern ''fallacy of escape velocity''  on which the postmodern mind and critical view cannot, by definition, ever truly break free from the all-encompassing "self-referential" sphere of discourse.

==Political commentary==

===On the Gulf War===
Baudrillard's provocative 1991 book ''[[The Gulf War Did Not Take Place]]'' raised his public profile as an academic and political commentator. He argued that the first [[Gulf War]] was the inverse of the [[Clausewitz]]ian formula: not "the continuation of politics by other means", but "the continuation of the absence of politics by other means". Accordingly, [[Saddam Hussein]] was not fighting the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]], but using the lives of his soldiers as a form of sacrifice to preserve his power (p.&amp;nbsp;72, 2004 edition). The Coalition fighting the [[Iraqi military]] was merely dropping 10,000 tonnes of bombs daily, as if proving to themselves that there was an enemy to fight (p.&amp;nbsp;61). So, too, were the Western media complicit, presenting the war in real time, by recycling images of war to propagate the notion that the U.S.-led [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition]] and the Iraqi government were actually fighting, but, such was not the case. Saddam Hussein did not use his military capacity (the [[Iraqi Air Force]]). His power was not weakened, evinced by his easy suppression of the 1991 [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|internal uprisings]] that followed afterwards. Over all, little had changed. Saddam remained undefeated, the "victors" were not victorious, and thus there was no war—i.e., the Gulf War did not occur.

The book was originally a series of articles in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the French newspaper ''[[Libération]]''. These were published in three parts: "The Gulf War Will Not Take Place", published during the American military and rhetorical buildup; "The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place", published during military action; and "The Gulf War Did Not Take Place", published afterwards.

&lt;!-- This makes no sense as it stands: Much of the repute that Baudrillard found as a result of the book was based on his critique that the Gulf War was not ineffectual, as Baudrillard portrayed it: People died, the political map was altered, and Saddam Hussein's regime was harmed.--&gt;Some critics accused Baudrillard of instant [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]]; a denial of the physical action of the conflict (which was related to his denial of reality in general). Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and [[George Berkeley|Berkelian]] idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin (in his book ''Baudrillard and the Media'') have argued that Baudrillard was more concerned with the West's technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, and what that means for the present possibility of war. Merrin argued that Baudrillard was not denying that something had happened, but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral "atrocity masquerading as a war". Merrin viewed the accusations of amorality as redundant and based on a misreading. In Baudrillard's own words (pp.&amp;nbsp;71–72):

{{quote|Saddam liquidates the communists, Moscow flirts even more with him; he gases the Kurds, it is not held against him; he eliminates the religious cadres, the whole of Islam makes peace with him&amp;nbsp;... Even&amp;nbsp;... the 100,000 dead will only have been the final decoy that Saddam will have sacrificed, the blood money paid in forfeit according to a calculated equivalence, in order to preserve his power. What is worse is that these dead still serve as an alibi for those who do not want to have been excited for nothing: at least these dead will prove this war was indeed a war and not a shameful and pointless hoax&amp;nbsp;...}}

===On the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001===
In contrast to the "[[non-event]]" of the Gulf War, in the essay ''The Spirit of Terrorism''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Baudrillard. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/the-spirit-of-terrorism/ "The Spirit of Terrorism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825013330/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/the-spirit-of-terrorism |date=25 August 2010 }}, [[European Graduate School]]. 2 November 2001, Translated by Rachel Bloul&lt;/ref&gt; he characterised the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City as the "absolute event". Seeking to understand them as a reaction to the technological and political expansion of capitalist globalization, rather than as a war of religiously based or civilization-based warfare, he described the absolute event and its consequences as follows:

{{quote|This is not a clash of civilisations or religions, and it reaches far beyond Islam and America, on which efforts are being made to focus the conflict in order to create the delusion of a visible confrontation and a solution based upon force. There is indeed a fundamental antagonism here, but one that points past the spectre of America (which is perhaps the epicentre, but in no sense the sole embodiment, of globalisation) and the spectre of Islam (which is not the embodiment of terrorism either) to triumphant globalisation battling against itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

In accordance with his theory of society, Baudrillard portrayed the attacks as a symbolic reaction to the inexorable rise of a world based on commodity exchange. This stance was criticised on two counts. [[Richard Wolin]] (in ''The Seduction of Unreason'') forcefully accused Baudrillard and [[Slavoj Žižek]] of all but celebrating the terrorist attacks, essentially claiming that the United States received what it deserved. Žižek, however, countered that accusation to Wolin's analysis as a form of intellectual barbarism in the journal ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'', saying that Wolin failed to see the difference between fantasising about an event and stating that one is deserving of that event. Merrin (in ''Baudrillard and the Media'') argued that Baudrillard's position affords the terrorists a type of moral superiority. In the journal ''Economy and Society'', Merrin further noted that Baudrillard gives the symbolic facets of society unfair privilege above semiotic concerns. Second, authors questioned whether the attacks were unavoidable. [[Bruno Latour]], in ''Critical Inquiry, '' argued that Baudrillard believed that their destruction was forced by the society that created them, alluding to the notion that the Towers were "brought down by their own weight". In Latour's view, this was because Baudrillard conceived only of society in terms of a symbolic and semiotic dualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Latour|first1=Bruno|title=Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=30|issue=2|page=228|doi=10.1086/421123|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Denis Dutton]], founder of ''Philosophy &amp; Literature'''s "Bad Writing Contest"—which listed examples of the kind of willfully [[obscurantist]] prose for which Baudrillard was frequently criticised—had the following to say:

{{quote|Some writers in their manner and stance intentionally provoke challenge and criticism from their readers. Others just invite you to think. Baudrillard's hyperprose demands only that you grunt wide-eyed or bewildered assent. He yearns to have intellectual influence, but must fend off any serious analysis of his own writing, remaining free to leap from one bombastic assertion to the next, no matter how brazen. Your place is simply to buy his books, adopt his jargon, and drop his name wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denisdutton.com/baudrillard_review.htm |title=Dutton, Denis, "Jean Baudrillard", Philosophy and Literature 14 (1990) 234-38 |publisher=Denisdutton.com |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, only one of the two major confrontational books on Baudrillard's thought—[[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris's]] ''Uncritical Theory: Postmodernism, Intellectuals and the Gulf War'' ({{ISBN|0-87023-817-5}})—seeks to reject his media theory and position on "the real" out of hand. The other—[[Douglas Kellner]]'s ''Jean Baudrillard: From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyond'' ({{ISBN|0-8047-1757-5}})—seeks rather to analyse Baudrillard's relation to postmodernism (a concept with which Baudrillard has had a continued, if uneasy and rarely explicit, relationship) and to present a Marxist counter. Regarding the former, William Merrin (discussed above) published more than one denunciation of Norris's position. The latter Baudrillard himself characterised as reductive (in Nicholas Zurbrugg's ''Jean Baudrillard: Art and Artefact'').

Willam Merrin's work has presented a more sympathetic account, which attempts to "place Baudrillard in opposition to himself". Thereby Merrin has argued that Baudrillard's position on [[semiotic]] analysis of meaning denies himself his own position on symbolic exchange. Merrin thus alludes to the common criticism of structuralist and post-structuralist work (a criticism not dissimilar in either Baudrillard, Foucault, or [[Deleuze]]) that emphasising interrelation as the basis for subjectivity denies the human agency from which social structures necessarily arise. ([[Alain Badiou]] and [[Michel de Certeau]] have made this point generally, and Barry Sandywell has argued as much in Baudrillard's specific case.)

Finally, [[Mark Poster]], until his death in 2012 was Baudrillard's editor and one of a number of academics who argued for his contemporary relevance; he remarked (p.&amp;nbsp;8 of Poster's 2nd ed. of ''Selected Writings''):

{{quote|Baudrillard's writing up to the mid-1980s is open to several criticisms. He fails to define key terms, such as the code; his writing style is hyperbolic and declarative, often lacking sustained, systematic analysis when it is appropriate; he totalizes his insights, refusing to qualify or delimit his claims. He writes about particular experiences, television images, as if nothing else in society mattered, extrapolating a bleak view of the world from that limited base. He ignores contradictory evidence such as the many benefits afforded by the new media&amp;nbsp;}}

Nonetheless Poster is keen to refute the most extreme of Baudrillard's critics, the likes of [[Alan Sokal]] and Norris who see him as a purveyor of a form of reality-denying irrationalism (''ibid'' p.&amp;nbsp;7):

{{quote|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial issue that reason remains operative in some actions, that if I want to arrive at the next block, for example, I can assume a [[Newtonianism|Newtonian universe]] (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for ''X''&amp;nbsp;meters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor [[proletarian]]s, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.}}

'''Jean Vanier''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Canada|CC]], [[National Order of Quebec|GOQ]],&lt;/small&gt; born September 10, 1928, is a Canadian [[Christian philosophy|Catholic]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]], and [[humanitarian]]. In 1964 he founded [[L'Arche]], an international federation of communities spread over 37 countries,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; for people with [[developmental disabilities]] and those who assist them. Subsequently, in 1971, he co-founded [[Faith and Light]] with [[Marie-Hélène Mathieu]], which also works for people with developmental disabilities, their families, and friends in over 80 countries. He continues to live as a member of the original L'Arche community in [[Trosly-Breuil]], France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the years, he has written 30 books on religion, disability, normality, success, and tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Vanier: Philosopher who dislikes the 'religion' of success wins £1.2m Templeton Prize for promoting spiritual awareness |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/jean-vanier-philosopher-who-dislikes-the-religion-of-success-wins-12m-templeton-prize-for-promoting-spiritual-awareness-10101621.html |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the honours he has received are the [[Companion of the Order of Canada]] (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Order of Canada: Jean Vanier, C.C., G.O.Q., D.Ph. |work=The Governor General of Canada website |url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=1708&amp;t=12&amp;ln=Vanier |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jean-vanier.org/en/press/press_toolkit/honors_and_awards|title=Grand Officer, National Order of Quebec|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[Legion of Honour]] (2003), [[Community of Christ International Peace Award]] (2003), the [[Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award]] (2013), and the [[Templeton Prize]] (2015).

==Early years and background==
Vanier is the son of Major-General [[Georges Vanier]], who became the 19th [[Governor General of Canada]] (1959–1967), and his wife [[Pauline Vanier]]. He was born in [[Geneva]] while his father was on diplomatic service in [[Switzerland]]. Fourth of five siblings, in his youth Vanier received a broad education in English and French first in Canada and then in England and France. He joined the Royal Navy at the [[Dartmouth Naval College]] (later renamed Britannia Royal Naval College) in England at age 13. During [[World War II]], Vanier and his family fled to Paris just before the [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi occupation]]. He spent much of the War at an English naval academy, preparing for a career as a naval officer.&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jean-vanier/ |title=Jean Vanier |last=Freeman |first=Mac |date=February 3, 2008 |encyclopedia=|publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |access-date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brief Chronology"/&gt;

In early 1945, Vanier was visiting [[Paris]] where his father was Canadian Ambassador; he and his mother went to assist survivors of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Seeing the emaciated victims, their faces twisted with fear and anguish, was a profoundly moving encounter for him, which he never forgot. Shortly thereafter,  he served in World War II with the [[Royal Navy]] and then with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. In 1947 as a midshipman, Vanier accompanied the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]] on their tour of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] aboard [[HMS Vanguard (23)|HMS ''Vanguard'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templetonprize.org/pdfs/2015/20150311-vanier-fact.pdf|title=Templeton Prize bio of Varnier|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, he joined the Royal Canadian Navy, at the carrier ''[[HMCS Magnificent (CVL 21)|HMCS Magnificent]]''. However, in 1950, feeling a strong inner spiritual calling to do "something else," he resigned his naval commission. Vanier travelled to [[Paris]] to study as an undergraduate. He eventually went on to complete a PhD in philosophy from the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]], with a doctoral thesis on [[Aristotle]] which was published in 1966 as ''Happiness as Principle and End of Aristotelian Ethics''; this was his first published work. He went on to write several books during his career and taught philosophy at the [[University of St. Michael's College]], [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Brief Chronology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jean-vanier.org/en/the_man/brief_chronology |title=Brief Chronology |last= |first= |date= |website=Jean Vanier - Becoming Human] |publisher= |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left academia in 1964, seeking a more spiritual ministry.

==Foundation of L'Arche==
{{Main|L'Arche}}
In 1964, through Vanier's friendship with a priest named Father Thomas Philippe, he became aware of the plight of thousands of people institutionalised with developmental disabilities. Vanier invited two men, Raphael Simi and Philippe Seux, to leave the institutions where they resided and live with him in [[Trosly-Breuil]], [[France]]. Their time together led to the establishment of L'Arche at Trosly-Breuil, a community where people with disabilities live with those who care for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pensamientosdejeanvanier.blogspot.com/p/jean-vanier-y-el-arca.html|title=Pensamientos de Jean Vanier: JEAN VANIER y El Arca|website=Pensamientos de Jean Vanier|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arche-france.org/notre-histoire|title=Notre histoire {{!}} L'Arche en France|website=www.arche-france.org|language=fr|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time L'Arche communities have been established in countries around the world. A governing philosophy of the communities is Vanier's belief that people with disabilities are teachers, rather than burdens bestowed upon families.&lt;ref name=Scrivener/&gt;

Until the late 1990s, Jean Vanier carried the responsibility for L'Arche in Trosly-Breuil in France, and for the International Federation of L'Arche. He then stepped down to spend more time counseling, encouraging, and accompanying the people who come to live in L'Arche as assistants to those with disabilities. Vanier has established 147 L'Arche communities in 37 countries around the world which have become places of pilgrimage for those involved.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rLSYBSAfMnVOA8t6Fkc32SpfDYk&amp;hl=en_US&amp;ll=19.584484823672366,11.048218499999962&amp;z=1|title="L'Arche - Worldwide"|website=www.google.com|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templetonprize.org/pdfs/2015/20150311-vanier-fact-unabridged.pdf|title=Templeton Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

[[File:Emblème de Foi et Lumière.jpg|thumb|left|Faith and Light emblem]]
In 1968, Jean Vanier gave a Faith and Sharing retreat in [[Mary Lake (Ontario)|Mary Lake]], Ontario, the first in his movement of retreats where people from many walks of life are welcome.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faithandsharing.net/pdf/the%20grace%20of%20faith%20and%20sharing.pdf |title=The Grace of Faith and Sharing |date=July 1988 |website=Faith and Sharing Federation |publisher= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retreats continue today as part of the Faith and Sharing Federation.&lt;ref name="FSsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faithandsharing.net/index.html |title=Faith and Sharing Federation |date= |website=Faith and Sharing Federation |publisher= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, there are 13 communities in North America that organize annual retreats and days of prayer.&lt;ref name="FSbrochure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faithandsharing.net/pdf/L%27Arche,%20Faith%20and%20Sharing,%20Faith%20and%20Light.pdf |title=L'Arche, Faith and Sharing, Faith and Light |date= |website=Faith and Sharing Federation |publisher= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith and Sharing member Bill Clark, SJ, explains: "There is then a two-fold movement in Faith and Sharing: an inward movement towards God hidden in the depths of our own vulnerability, and an outward movement towards our brothers and sisters, especially those who are more poor and in need." &lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; The organization's records are housed at the John M. Kelly Library, [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|University of St. Michael's College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmikes.utoronto.ca/kelly/special-collections/faith/default.asp |title=Faith and Sharing Federation fonds |date= |website=John M.

In 1971, Vanier co-founded [[Faith and Light]] with [[Marie-Hélène Mathieu]]. This is an international movement of forums for people with developmental disabilities, their family and friends. Today there are over 1,500 Faith and Light communities in 81 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faithandlight.org/rubriques/haut/about-us/overview|title=Overview, Faith and Light|last=|first=|date=|website=www.faithandlight.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanier still makes his home in the original L'Arche community of Trosly-Breuil, France. He travels widely, visiting other L'Arche communities, encouraging projects for new communities, and giving lectures and retreats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmN5an552ULRH5B0S2lrtklGIo5HBRHf0|title=Entering into Silent Prayer, Jean Vanier &amp; Laurence Freeman - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Saint Vincent College|title=On Retreat with Jean Vanier|date=2009-01-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUXEASKgFY|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 1998 [[Massey Lectures|Massey lecturer]] focusing on the theme of "Becoming Human".&lt;ref name=Massey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-1998-cbc-massey-lectures-becoming-human-1.2946860 |title=The 1998 CBC Massey Lectures, "Becoming Human" |first=Elizabeth |last=Nagy |date= |publisher=CBC |access-date=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During one of his lectures he touched on his distaste for barriers around people with intellectual disabilities, a motivating philosophy behind L'Arche: "We must do what we can to diminish walls, to meet each other. Why do we put people with disabilities behind walls?"&lt;ref name=Scrivener&gt;{{cite news |first=Leslie |last=Scrivener |title=Canada's disciple to the disabled |work= |page= |date= |accessdate=28 July 2015 |quote="He is wary of institutions. The theme in last night's lecture was his fear of the walls that separate people. "We must do what we can to diminish walls, to meet each other. Why do we put people with disabilities behind walls?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

'''June Etta Downey''' (July 13, 1875 – October 11, 1932) was an American psychologist who studied personality and [[handwriting]]. Downey was born and raised in Laramie, Wyoming, where she received her degree in Greek and Latin from the [[University of Wyoming]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = June Etta Downey {{!}} biography - American psychologist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/June-Etta-Downey|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her life Downey wrote seven books and over seventy articles. Included in this work, Downey developed the Individual Will-Temperament Test, which was one of the first tests to evaluate character traits separately from intellectual capacity and the first to use [[psychographic]] methods for interpretation.&lt;ref name=apadivisions&gt;[http://www.apadivisions.org/division-35/about/heritage/june-downey-biography.aspx "June Etta Downey (1875–1932)"]. Society for the Psychology of Women.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her many published works, Downey held several prestigious positions. She chaired the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Wyoming and in doing so became the first woman to hold a head position at a state university. She was appointed to the American Psychological Association Council and became a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, and a [[Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
June Downey was born in [[Laramie, Wyoming]] to [[Stephen Wheeler Downey]] and Evangeline (Owen) Downey as the second child in a family of nine. Her father was a [[colonel]] in the [[Union Army]] and one of the founders of the [[University of Wyoming]] and her younger brother, [[Sheridan Downey]], served as US Senator from California between 1938 and 1950.&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gPGZJ_YuMwgC&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=june%20downey&amp;pg=PA351#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 351 |title= American Women of Science Since 1900 |volume= 1 |authors= Tiffany K. Wayne |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2011 |accessdate= April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following education in Laramie public schools and the University of Wyoming preparatory school she entered the university to major in Greek and Latin.&lt;ref name="notable"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;lpg=PA515&amp;dq=june%20downey&amp;pg=PA514#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 514–515 |title= Notable American Women, 1607–1950 |author1=Edward T. James |author2=Janet Wilson James |author3=Paul S. Boyer |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1971 |accessdate= April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
After graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1895, Downey taught in an elementary school for a year before attending the [[University of Chicago]] to work in philosophy and psychology where she completed her [[master's degree]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt; In 1901, Downey gained interest in experimental psychology, while attending a summer course taught by Edward Bradford Titchener at Cornell University. Returning to the University of Wyoming, Downey taught English and psychology whilst also conducting some laboratory work for a few years, under the supervision of [[James Rowland Angell]].&lt;ref name="apadivisions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portraits"/&gt;  Downey continued her education of experimental psychology under Edward B. Titchener at Cornell University. She returned to the University of Wyoming in 1905, as a Professor of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="apadivisions"/&gt; In 1906 she took leave from her work in order to complete her [[doctorate]]; submitting her thesis in 1908, titled 'Control Processes in Modified Handwriting', on the topic of handwriting as a measure of personality.&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt;

Following her graduate work, Downey was made head of her department; the first woman to be given such a position in a state university.&lt;ref name="portraits"/&gt; She published a number of academic papers as well as writing and occasionally publishing short stories, poems, plays, and popular articles, including a volume of poetry titled ''The Heavenly Dykes''.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!297411~!0#focus |title= June Etta Downey (1875–1932) |work= Smithsonian Institution Archives |accessdate= April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downey's studies focused on themes of imagery and aesthetics and were concentrated in experimental studies rather than theory.&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt; She was one of the first psychologists to study personality scientifically and became an expert in handwriting and handedness.&lt;ref name="portraits"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w7LwgIKuSMkC&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=june%20downey&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20downey&amp;f=false |title= Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology, Volume 5 |publisher= Psychology Press |volume= 5 |authors= Gregory A. Kimble, Michael Wertheimer |year= 2003 |accessdate= April 21, 2014 |isbn= 113570533X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
As Downey grew older she concentrated on her teaching. She published her last book, 'Creative Imagination', in 1929 tying together her interests in psychology and the arts.&lt;ref name="portraits"/&gt; Downey gained membership to the council of the [[American Psychological Association]] between 1923 and 1925 and was one of the first two women admitted to membership in the [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]] in 1929, along with [[Margaret Washburn]].&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="portraits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt; Downey never married and had no children.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591302514.html |title= Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia |year= 2002 |accessdate= April 28, 2014 |publisher= via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} |author= Barbara Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downey died at her sister's home in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in 1932 after being taken ill with [[stomach cancer]].&lt;ref name="notable"/&gt; Shortly after her death, Downey's family presented her private library to the University of Wyoming. The University held a memorial service for her and in 1999 she was named a finalist of 'Wyoming Citizen of the Century'.&lt;ref name="portraits"/&gt; [[James Rowland Angell]], whom Downey worked under for her doctorate, described her as "endowed with an unusually alert and discerning mind and with a maturity of judgment extremely infrequent in students of her age."&lt;ref name="portraits"/&gt;

== Major contributions ==
Downey primarily did research on [[handwriting]], but included some research on motor processes such as involuntary muscle movement and its connection to the mind and personality.&lt;ref name="apadivisions" /&gt; Downey had studied the practice of [[muscle reading]] from a psychological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Roeckelein, Jon E. (2004). ''Imagery in Psychology: A Reference Guide''. Praeger. p. 238. {{ISBN|0-313-32197-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Downey developed the '''Downey Individual Will-Temperament Test'''. This test was one of her biggest contributions to personality psychology and was one of the first personality inventories.&lt;ref name="apadivisions" /&gt;  The test measured personality based on handwriting. It contained 10 smaller tests that when combined could be calculated into a total score that represented one's "will-capacity". The Downey Individual Will-Temperament Test was arranged to represent three personality types. The three personality types are ''hairtrigger'', which is impulsive and quick, the ''witful'' type, succinct and decisive, and the ''accurate'' type, which is slow and thoughtful.&lt;ref name="apadivisions" /&gt;

=== Other interests ===
Similar to William James and other eminent psychologists, Downey was greatly interested in the creative arts.  She wrote poems, plays, and stories throughout her life.  She even wrote the school song, "Alma Mater", for the University of Wyoming. In 1911, she published The Imaginal Reaction to Poetry, one of her most important experiments involving the arts. This study examined the images people had in response to reading poetry, she believed that variation in such images revealed differences in character.&lt;ref name="apadivisions" /&gt;

{{Culture of Korea}}
'''Korean flower arrangement''' is being revived as an indoor art, and most often uses simple Joseon dynasty whiteware to highlight Korean flowers and tree branches in elegant and unforced natural arrangements. [[Im Wha-Kong]] of Ewha Woman's University in Seoul, who also makes her own ceramic wares, is the greatest living exponent of this art, and hosts quarterly displays of flower arrangements keeping this tradition alive. There are at least a dozen schools of traditional flower arrangements.

==Introduction==
Formal flower arrangements were closely allied to the development of the [[Korean tea ceremony]], and suggestions have been made that these were often corner-of-the-room arrangements on small tables using a central vessel with most often a small branch and a small group of local flowers. Sprigs of pear blossoms were particularly well known, and during the winters ever-green sprigs that would have enhanced celadonware, or given a cool elegance to whiteware.

Leaves, blossoms, ferns, and grasses were also used. 

Arrangements were primarily done by women in tea-houses, and in the greater houses, Confucian male masters may have done this as well.

==History==
This [[floral art]] was not documented before the 14th century as a distinct art. Votive altar arrangements of flowers for Buddhist temples  were precursors. But it was under Confucian hands, in [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] Yi dynasty times, that arrangements can be said definitely to have begun and were known, and included in illustrations by artists of that time. 

==Major schools of Korean flower arranging==
* Catherine Muller CASA school
* Jane Packer Seoul
* Atelier FleurHeesoo (Gangnam, Seoul)- flower arrangement school of traditional french style(www.fleurheesoo.com)
* Jeju Island school
* Seoul schools
* Pusan (Busan) schools
* Mountain schools
* Palace school
* ''Jeonju Tea ceremony school'' - based in Jeonju with a frequent use of pine, and flowering blossoms of pear;
* ''Wha-Kong Hoe school'' - based in Seoul, and representing the work of Madame Wha-Kong and her natural approach to the art, with ceramics by her own hand in traditional Confucian patterns;
* ''Pyong-yang schools'' - traditional flower arrangements are an important part of northern Korean culture.

'''Nicolai Hartmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaɐ̯tman|lang}}; 20 February 1882 – 9 October 1950) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. He is regarded as a key representative of [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]]&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831-1933'', Cambridge UP, 1984, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the most important twentieth century [[metaphysicians]].

==Biography==
Hartmann was born of German descent in [[Riga]], which was then the capital of the [[Governorate of Livonia]] in the [[Russian Empire]], and which is now in [[Latvia]]. He was the son of the engineer Carl August Hartmann and his wife Helene, born Hackmann. He attended from 1897, the German-language high school in Saint Petersburg. In the years 1902–1903 he studied [[Medicine]] at the [[University of Tartu]] (then Jurjev), and 1903–1905 classical philology and [[philosophy]] at the [[Saint Petersburg Imperial University]] with his friend [[Vasily Seseman]]n. In 1905 he went to the [[University of Marburg]], where he studied with the [[neo-Kantian]]s [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Paul Natorp]]. In Marburg began a lifelong friendship with [[Heinz Heimsoeth]]. In 1907 he received his doctorate with the thesis ''Das Seinsproblem in der griechischen Philosophie vor Plato'' (''The Problem of Being in Greek Philosophy Before Plato''). In 1909 he published the book ''Platos Logik des Seins'' (''The Logic of Being in Plato''). The same year he completed his habilitation on Proclus: ''Des Proklus Diadochus philosophische Anfangsgründe der Mathematik'' (''Proclus Diadochus' Philosophical Elements of Mathematics'').

In 1911, Hartmann married Alice Stepanitz, with whom he had a daughter, Dagmar, in 1912. In 1912 he published ''Die philosophischen Grundfragen der Biologie'' (''The Philosophical Foundations of Biologie''). From 1914 to 1918 he did military service as an interpreter, letter censor, and intelligence officer. In 1919, i.e., after the war, he received a position as ''Privatdozent'' in Marburg. Around this time he met [[Martin Heidegger]]. In 1920 he became Associate Professor (''außerordentlicher Professor'') and in 1921 appeared the work that established him as an independent philosophical thinker, ''Grundzüge einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis'' (''Foundation of a Metaphysics of Knowledge''). The following year he became Full Professor (''ordentlicher Professor'') as successor of the Chair held by Natorp. In 1925, he moved to Cologne, where he came into contact with [[Max Scheler]]. In 1926 he published his second major work—''Ethik''—in which he develops a material value ethics akin to that of Scheler. The same year he divorced from his wife.

In 1929 Hartmann married Frida Rosenfeld, with whom he had a son, Olaf (1930), and a daughter, Lise (1932). In 1931 he became Professor of Theoretical Philosophy in Berlin. He held the Chair until 1945. During this time he successively published many pieces of his ontology: ''Das Problem des geistigen Seins'' (''The Problem of Spiritual Being'') (1933), ''Zur Grundlegung der Ontologie'' (''On the Foundation of Ontology'') (1935), ''Möglichkeit und Wirklichkeit'' (''Possibility and Actuality'') (1938) and ''Der Aufbau der realen Welt. Grundriß der allgemeinen Kategorienlehre'' (''The Structure of the Real World. Outline of the General Theory of Categories'') (1940). The unrest of the National Socialist period seems to have left Hartmann relatively undisturbed in his task of developing a new ontology. In the "''SD-Dossiers über Philosophie-Professoren"'' (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SS Security Service (SD)]] Nicolai Hartmann was classified from an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-point of view in the following way: "has always been a nationalist. Loyal to National Socialism, too, without political activity, but a social attitude has to be acknowledged. (cf. donations to the [[National Socialist People's Welfare|NSV]] and hosting children during school vacations)".&lt;ref&gt;Georg Leaman, Gerd Simon: Deutsche Philosophen aus der Sicht des Sicherheitsdienstes des Reichsführers SS. Jahrbuch für Soziologie-Geschichte 1992, pages 261-292. Original SD-file text: "von jeher national. Loyal auch gegenüber dem NS, ohne pol. Aktivität, aber durchaus sozial eingestellt. (Siehe Zuwendung für die NSV, Aufnahme von Ferienkindern usw.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Hartmann edited a volume entitled ''Systematische Philosophie'', in which he contributed the essay ''Neue Wege der Ontologie'' (''New Ways of Ontology''), which summarizes his work in ontology.

Between 1945 and 1950, Hartmann taught in Göttingen. He died of a stroke in 1950. In the year of his death, there appeared his ''Philosophie der Natur'' (''Philosophy of Nature''). His works ''Teleologisches Denken'' (''Teleological Thinking'') (1951) and ''Ästhetik'' (''Aesthetics'') (1953) were published posthumously.

He is regarded as an important representative of critical realism and as one of the major metaphysicians of the twentieth century. Among Hartmann's many students were [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Emil Cioran]], Jakob Klein, [[Delfim Santos]] and [[Max Wehrli]]. He is the modern discoverer of [[emergence]] — originally called by him ''categorial novum''. His encyclopedic work is basically forgotten today, although famous during his lifetime. His early work in the [[philosophy of biology]] has been cited in modern discussions of [[genomics]] and [[cloning]], and his views on consciousness and free will are currently in vogue among contributors to the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]''.

== Ontological theory ==
In Hartmann's ontological theory, the [[integrative level|levels of reality]] are: (1) the inorganic level (German: ''anorganische Schicht''), (2) the organic level (''organische Schicht''), (3) the psychical/emotional level (''seelische Schicht'') and (4) the intellectual/cultural level (''geistige Schicht''). In the ''Structure of the Real World'' (''Der Aufbau der realen Welt''), Hartmann postulates four laws that apply to the [[integrative level|levels of reality]].

# The law of recurrence: Lower categories recur in the higher levels as a subaspect of higher categories, but never vice versa.
# The law of modification: The categorial elements modify in their recurrence in the higher levels (they are shaped by the characteristics of the higher levels).
# The law of the ''novum'': The higher category is composed of a diversity of lower elements, but it is a specific ''novum'' that is not included in the lower levels.
# The law of distance between levels: Since the different levels do not develop continuously but in leaps, they can be clearly distinguished.

==Quotations==

"The tragedy of man is that of somebody who is starving and sitting at a richly laden table but does not reach out with his hand, because he cannot see what is right in front of him. For the real world has inexhaustible splendour, the real life is full of meaning and abundance, where we grasp it, it is full of miracles and glory."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolai Hartmann: ''Ethik''. 4. Aufl., de Gruyter, Berlin 1962, p. 11. Original in German: "Die Tragik des Menschen ist die des Verhungernden, der an der gedeckten Tafel sitzt und die Hand nicht ausstreckt, weil er nicht sieht, was vor ihm ist. Denn die wirkliche Welt ist unerschöpflich an Fülle, das wirkliche Leben ist wertgetränkt und überströmend, und wo wir es fassen, da ist es voller Wunder und Herrlichkeit."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13400">{{About|the concept of objectivity as it is used in science||Objectivity (disambiguation)}}
'''Objectivity''' in science is an attempt to uncover truths about the natural world by eliminating personal [[bias]]es, emotions, and false beliefs.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.zonebooks.org/titles/DAST_OBJ.html|title=Objectivity|publisher=Zone Books|author1=Daston, Lorraine|author2=Galison, Peter|year=2010|isbn=9781890951795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often linked to [[Observation#Observation_in_science|observation]] as part of the [[scientific method]]. It is thus intimately related to the aim of [[testability]] and [[reproducibility]]. To be considered objective, the results of measurement must be communicated from person to person, and then {{em|demonstrated}} for third parties, as an advance in a [[consensus reality|collective understanding]] of the world. Such demonstrable knowledge has ordinarily conferred demonstrable powers of prediction or technology.

The problem of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|philosophical objectivity]] is contrasted with personal [[subjectivity]], sometimes exacerbated by the [[scientific consensus|overgeneralization]] of a hypothesis to the whole. ''E.g.'' [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] appears to be the norm for the attraction between [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]], but it was later superseded by the more general [[theory of relativity]].

==History==
The [[scientific method]] was argued for by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], rose to popularity with the discoveries of [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers, and continued into later eras. In the early eighteenth century, there existed an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] virtue in science which has been called ''truth-to-nature''.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|55–58}} This ideal was practiced by Enlightenment [[Natural history|naturalists]] and scientific atlas-makers, and involved active attempts to eliminate any idiosyncrasies in their representations of nature in order to create images thought best to represent "what truly is."&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|59–60}}&lt;ref name="Representations"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/methods/daston.pdf | title=The Image of Objectivity |author1=Daston, Lorraine |author2=Galison, Peter | journal=Representations |date=Autumn 1992  | volume=0 | issue=40 | pages=81–128 | doi=10.2307/2928741}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84–85}} Judgment and skill were deemed necessary in order to determine the "typical", "characteristic", "ideal", or "average."&lt;ref name="Representations" /&gt;{{rp|87}} In practicing truth-to-nature naturalists did not seek to depict exactly what was seen; rather, they sought a reasoned image.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|98}}

In the latter half of the nineteenth century objectivity in science was born when a new practice of ''mechanical objectivity'' appeared.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|121}} {{"'}}Let nature speak for itself' became the watchword of a new brand of scientific objectivity."&lt;ref name="Representations" /&gt;{{rp|81}} It was at this time that idealized representations of nature, which were previously seen as a virtue, were now seen as a vice.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|120}} Scientists began to see it as their duty to actively restrain themselves from imposing their own projections onto nature.&lt;ref name="Representations" /&gt;{{rp|81}} The aim was to liberate representations of nature from subjective, human interference and in order to achieve this [[scientists]] began using self-registering instruments, cameras, wax molds, and other technological devices.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

In the twentieth century ''trained judgment''&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|309}} supplemented mechanical objectivity as scientists began to recognize that, in order for images or data to be of any use, scientists needed to be able to see scientifically; that is, to interpret images or data and identify and group them according to particular professional training, rather than to simply depict them mechanically.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|311–314}} Since the latter half of the nineteenth century, objectivity has come to involve a combination of trained judgment and mechanical objectivity.

==Objectivity in measurement==
Another methodological aspect is the avoidance of bias, which can involve [[cognitive bias]], [[cultural bias]], or [[sampling bias]]. Methods for avoiding or overcoming such biases include [[random sampling]] and [[double-blind]] trials.&lt;ref name="O'Leary2004"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;id=ItKeqNfgNW0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=objectivity+in+sampling,+random+sampling&amp;ots=pLasfy8tgH&amp;sig=kenaqNz6_pIH98Ddmug1gNQQrfM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=objectivity%20in%20sampling,%20random%20sampling&amp;f=false|title=The Essential Guide to Doing Research|last=O'Leary|first=Zina|date=2004-06-09|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780761941996|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, objectivity in measurement can be unobtainable in certain circumstances. Even the most quantitative social sciences such as [[economics]] employ measures that are constructs (conventions, to employ the term coined by [[Pierre Duhem]]). For instance, one can use different weighting schemes when calculating [[inflation]] rates. Applying different conventions (such as the [[Paasche and Laspayres Indices]]) leads to obtaining diverging results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2018|title=Objectivity - a Pipe Dream?|url=http://www.ethicsinfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mariusz-Maziarz-Do-the-right-thing-incentivise-ethics.pdf|journal=Finance &amp; the common good|volume=44-45|pages=64-78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the scientific community==

{{attribution needed|text=Various scientific processes, such as [[peer review]]s, the discussions at [[scientific conference]]s, and other meetings where scientific results are presented, are part of a social process whose purpose is to strengthen the objective aspect of the scientific method.|date=January 2010|reason=This seems like original research or an opinion. Attribution is needed.}}

Next to unintentional and systematic error, there is always the possibility of deliberate misrepresentation of scientific results, whether for gain, fame, or ideological motives. {{according to whom|When such cases of scientific fraud come to light, they usually give rise to an [[academic scandal]], but it is unknown how much fraud goes undiscovered. For important results, other groups will try to repeat the experiment. If they consistently fail, they will bring these negative results into the scientific debate.|date=January 2010}}

==Critiques of scientific objectivity==
A critical argument on scientific objectivity and [[positivism]] is that all science has a degree of [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref name="History of Psychiatry"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |author1=Gach, John |author2=Wallace, Edwin R. | year=2010 | isbn=9780387347080}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} In the 1920s, Percy Bridgman's ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' and the [[operationalism]] presented was centered in such recognition.&lt;ref name="History of Psychiatry" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

===Thomas Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''===
Based on a historical review of the development of certain scientific theories in his book, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', scientist and historian [[Thomas Kuhn]] raised some philosophical objections to claims of the possibility of scientific understanding being truly objective. In Kuhn's analysis, scientists in different disciplines organise themselves into {{lang|la|de facto}} [[paradigm]]s within which scientific research is done, junior scientists are educated, and scientific problems are determined.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|year=1962|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When observational data arises which appears to contradict or [[Falsifiability|falsify]] a given [[scientific paradigm]], scientists within that paradigm historically have not immediately rejected it, as [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophical theory of falsificationism would have them do. Instead they have gone to considerable lengths to resolve the apparent conflict without rejecting the paradigm. Through [[ad hoc]] variations to the theory and sympathetic interpretation of the data, supporting scientists will resolve the apparent conundrum. In extreme cases, they may ignore the data altogether. Thus, the failure of a scientific paradigm will go into crisis when a significant portion of scientists working in the field lose confidence in it. The corollary of this observation is that a paradigm is contingent on the social order amongst scientists at the time it gains ascendancy.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;

{{citation needed span|text=Kuhn's theory has been criticised by scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Alan Sokal]] as presenting a [[Relativism|relativist]] view of scientific progress.|date=January 2010}} {{citation needed span|text=In a postscript to the third edition of his book, Kuhn denied being a relativist.|date=January 2010}}

===Donna Haraway's ''Situated Knowledges''===
{{further|Knowledge#Situated knowledge}}
In ''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective'' (1988), [[Donna Haraway]] argues that objectivity in science and philosophy is traditionally understood as a kind of disembodied and transcendent "conquering gaze from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Haraway,%20Situated%20Knowledges.pdf|title=Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective|author=Haraway, Donna|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Autumn 1988|volume=14|issue=3|pages=575–599|doi=10.2307/3178066|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|581}} She argues that this kind of objectivity, in which the subject is split apart and distanced from the object, is an impossible "illusion, a god trick."&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges"/&gt;{{rp|583–587}} She demands a re-thinking of objectivity in such a way that, while still striving for "faithful accounts of the real world,"&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges" /&gt;{{rp|579}} we must also acknowledge our perspective within the world. She calls this new kind of knowledge-making "situated knowledges." Objectivity, she argues, "turns out to be about particular and specific embodiment and ... not about the false vision promising transcendence of all limits and responsibility". This new objectivity, "allows us to become answerable for what we learn how to see."&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges"/&gt;{{rp|581–583}} Thus, Haraway is not only critiquing the idea that objectivity as we have long understood it is possible; she is also arguing that if we continue to approach knowledge-making in this way, then we wash our hands of any responsibility for our truth claims. In contrast, she argues, approaching knowledge-making from an embodied perspective forces us to take responsibility.

'''Open-mindedness''' is receptiveness to new ideas. Open-mindedness relates to the way in which people approach the views and knowledge of others, and in the words of [[Dean Tjosvold]] "incorporate the beliefs that others should be free to express their views and that the value of others’ knowledge should be recognized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dealing with scarce resources: openminded interaction for resolving budget conflicts | journal=[[Group &amp; Organization Management]] | date=September 1998 | last=Tjosvold | first=Dean | last2=Poon | first2=Margaret | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=237–58 | doi=10.1177/1059601198233003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Knowledge Creation in Groups: The Value of Cognitive Diversity, Transactive Memory and Open-mindedness Norms|author1=Rebecca Mitchell  |author2=Stephen Nicholas |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management|year=2006|url=http://www.ejkm.com/issue/download.html?idArticle=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Baehr]] defines an open-minded person as being one who "characteristically moves beyond or temporarily sets aside his own doxastic commitments in order to give a fair and impartial hearing to the intellectual opposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baehr|first=Jason|date=2011|title=The Structure of Open-Mindedness|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|volume=vol. 41 no. 2|issue=2|pages=191–213|doi=10.1353/cjp.2011.0010|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jack Kwong]]'s definition sees open-mindedness as the "willingness to take a novel viewpoint seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwong|first=Jack|date=2015|title=Open-Mindedness as a Critical Virtue|url=|journal=Topio|volume=35|issue=2|pages=403–411|doi=10.1007/s11245-015-9317-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Wayne Riggs, open-mindedness springs from an awareness of the inherent fallibility of one's beliefs; hence, open-minded individuals are more inclined to listen to, and seriously consider, alternative viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=Wayne|date=2010|title=Open-mindedness|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=41|pages=172–188|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2009.01625.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various scales for the measurement of open-mindedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A revised scale for the measurement of open‐mindedness|journal=Speech Monographs|author=Haiman, Franklyn S.|pages=97–102|volume=31|issue=2|date=2 June 2009|doi=10.1080/03637756409375396}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that schools should emphasize open-mindedness more than [[relativism]] in their science instruction, because the scientific community does not embrace a relativistic way of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Portraying Science Accurately in Classrooms: Emphasizing Open-Mindedness Rather Than Relativism|author=Patricia Harding, William Hare|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(200003)37:3&lt;225::AID-TEA1&gt;3.0.CO;2-G|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=37|issue=3|pages=225–236|date=March 2000|last2=Hare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bertrand Russell]], [[critical thinking]] presupposes open-mindedness.  Among other things, the critical attitude involves an open-minded outlook with respect to our beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/MainEduc.htm|title=Bertrand Russell on Critical Thinking (a paper given at Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy, in Boston, Massachusetts)|last=Hare|first=William|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open-mindedness  is generally considered an important personal attribute for effective participation in [[management team]]s and other groups. Open-mindedness is usually encouraged in group settings, within different cultures and new environments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[California Management Review]]|title =The Top Management Team: Key to Strategic Success |year=1987|volume=30|issue=1|pages=88–108|author=Hambrick, Donald C.|authorlink=Donald C. Hambrick|jstor=41165268}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David DiSalvo]], '''closed-mindedness''', or an unwillingness to consider new ideas, can result from the brain's natural dislike for ambiguity. According to this view, the brain has a "[[search and destroy]]" relationship with ambiguity and evidence contradictory to people's current beliefs tends to make them uncomfortable by introducing such ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Makes Your Brain Happy and Why You Should Do the Opposite|author=David DiSalvo|publisher=Prometheus Books|date=22 November 2011|isbn=978-1616144838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research confirms that belief-discrepant-closed-minded persons have less tolerance for [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive inconsistency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Open- and closed-mindedness, belief-discrepant communication behavior, and tolerance for cognitive inconsistency|author1=Hunt Jr., Martin F. |author2=Miller, Gerald R. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=8|issue=1|date=Jan 1968|pages=35–37|doi=10.1037/h0021238|pmid=5638020|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/8/1p1/35/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular beliefs are studied as a sub-field of [[social science]]s, like [[history]] and [[anthropology]], which examines spiritual beliefs that develop not independently from religion, but still outside of established religious institutions. Aspects of [[popular piety]], historical [[folklore]], and historical [[superstitions]] are some of the themes explored.

Social scientists who study popular belief offer explanations for behaviors and events that arose as a means of redress in times of adversity or from perceived practical or spiritual utility. The cause of the European witch craze, responsible for the death of many older women in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, is one such area of research. The attitudes to sanctity and relics in the central Middle Ages, which represent a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#State organization|bottom-up]] phenomenon (whereby relics became acceptable to the Roman Catholic Church as a result of their popularity among the masses), is another widely studied area of popular belief.

==History==

===European Middle Ages===
The population of pre-modern, Western Europe was exceedingly liable to pain, sickness, and premature death. [[Epidemic]]s such as the [[bubonic plague]] and [[famine]] plowed through European towns during the late [[Middle Ages]], at times cutting the population by half. People often turned to [[saints]] and their relics, as well as magic, making a [[Amulet|charm]] from the [[Eucharist]] wafer for example, for relief of both great and small problems.&lt;ref&gt;Shinners, John. Medieval Popular Religion, 1000-1500: A Reader. 1997. {{ISBN|1-55111-133-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Modern Europe===
[[Astrology]], [[witchcraft]], magical healing, [[divination]], [[prophecy|ancient prophecies]], [[ghosts]], and [[fairies]] were taken very seriously by people at all social and economic levels in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Helplessness in the face of disease and human disaster helped to perpetuate this belief in [[Magic and religion|magic]] and the [[supernatural]]. The early effects of the [[Little Ice Age]] kept the food supply at precarious levels. Social unrest and [[witch hunts]] abounded. Some forms of magic were challenged by the [[Protestant Reformation]].

===Modern Europe===
Only with the increased search for [[scientific method|scientific explanation]] of the universe did Western Europeans begin to abandon their recourse to the supernatural. [[Science]] and [[technology]] have made us less vulnerable to some of the hazards which confronted the people of the past.

Yet in many parts of the contemporary world, spirit beliefs and practices have continue to serve a pivotal role in addressing the discontinuities and uncertainties of modern life. The myriad ways in which devotees engage the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] shows the tremendous creative potential of these practices and their innate adaptability to changing times and circumstances.

===Modern Asia===
Anthropological case studies from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam investigate the role and impact of different social, political, and economic dynamics in the reconfiguration of local spirit worlds in modern Southeast Asia. Their findings contribute to the re-enchantment debate by revealing that the “spirited modernities” that have emerged in the process not only embody a distinct feature of the contemporary moment, but also invite a critical rethinking of the concept of modernity itself.

==Popular Piety==
Also known as [[folk religion]], '''Popular piety''' (or '''popular religion''', '''personal piety''') refers to religious practices that arose and occur outside of official religious institutions. Typically the term is used within the context of the [[Catholic church]] in Western Europe, and the practices are generally allowed, if not accepted. Forms of popular [[piety]] can be seen from the earliest Christian communities through the [[Middle Ages]] and into the present day.

Folk religions take two forms in Asia: as distinct religions (East Asia) and as popularized versions of world religions (South and Southeast Asia). Chinese Folk Religion, in its present form dating back to the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), includes elements traceable to prehistoric times ([[ancestor worship]], [[shamanism]], divination, a belief in ghosts, and sacrificial rituals to the spirits of sacred objects and places, like [[relics]] in the West) as well as aspects of [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Taoism]]. Buddhist elements include believing in [[karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], accepting [[Buddha]] and other bodhisattvas as gods, and using Buddhist [[meditation]]al techniques. The Confucian influence is the concept of [[filial piety]] and associated practices. The numerous gods are organized into a hierarchy headed by the [[Jade Emperor]], a deity borrowed from Taoism. Important annual rituals reflect their origin in an agrarian way of life (e.g., a harvesttime festival), but have been given new or additional meaning to accord with the ancestral cult or Buddhism. The religion is not centrally organized and lacks a formal canon. Rituals take place before home altars or at temples, which have no fixed congregations. Adherents vary considerably in belief and practice. Generally, folk religionists are fatalistic yet believe that one's luck can be affected by pleasing ancestors or gods, by locating graves and buildings in places where vital natural forces are located (geomancy), and by balancing opposing forces (yin, yang) within one's body.&lt;ref&gt;Wee 1977, Freedman 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Korea]], Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism have influenced the elite, while a folk religion has existed among the common people that resembles [[Culture of China|Chinese]] Folk Religion. However, unlike the Chinese case, most Korean spirit mediums are women, a vestige from a time when female deities dominated the folk religion. The [[Japan]]ese have been influenced by [[Shintoism]], Buddhism, and Confucianism. Buddhism and Shintoism have separate organizations, buildings, festivals, and religious specialists. Thus one can speak of Japanese religions that individuals blend in different ways but not of a distinct Japanese folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indonesia]] is an example of Asian countries where syncretic religions have been dominant. On [[Java]], nearly everyone identifies with [[Islam]], but most people practice Agama Jawa, Javanese religion, or Javanese Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz 1960&lt;/ref&gt; This form of religion is a mixture of [[animistic]], Islamic, and to a lesser extent [[Hindu]] elements (at one time, Java was under the control of local Hindu rulers). Those who practice Javanese religion call themselves [[Muslim]]s. In addition, Javanese religionists employ animistic rituals, such as ceremonial meals commemorating a person's transition to a new stage in the life cycle or important moments in the life of the village ([[slametan]], the rituals of which reflect animistic beliefs), consult [[dukun]] (magicians capable of controlling the impersonal force that exists in all things), and use their own [[numerology]] to ensure that actions are synchronized with natural processes. The counterpart to Javanese Islam in southern Asia is "popular Islam".&lt;ref&gt;Hassan 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In a somewhat similar manner, one can speak of [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese]], [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]], and [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai]] Buddhism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">A '''Qayyum''' (pronounced Qayyoom, Arabic/Urdu: {{Nastaliq|قیوم}}) is a special spiritual position in Sufism, especially in the [[Naqshbandi]] tradition. The term was first coined by [[Ahmed Sirhindi]], who was the first ''qayyum''. According to him, a ''qayyum'' is a dignitary upon whom the whole order of existence depends. The word is derived from ''Al-Qayyum'', a [[name of God in Islam]] that has the same meaning. According to the doctrine, only one ''qayyum'' is alive at any particular time.

==The first four qayyums==
The first ''qayyum'' was [[Ahmed Sirhindi]]  (d. 1656). The second was Ahmed Sirhindi's third son, Khwaja Muhammad Masum Faruqi (d.1721), who was followed by his son Khwaja Muhammad Hujjat-ullah Naqshband (d. 1737). The fourth ''qayyum'' was Khwaja Muhammad Zubair (d. 1774), the grandson of Khwaja Naqshband.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KuxMwCHBzK4C&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=qayyum+naqshbandi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cTQ-TICEDIiKOOOr2dIP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=qayyum%20naqshbandi&amp;f=false Sufism - Its Saints and Shrines, by John A. Subhan, chapter XIX: The Four Qayyums (p.285)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other claimed Qayyums==
Several other influential Sufis have claimed the title of ''qayyum''.

===Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan Shaheed===
{{Main|Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan}}
Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan (d. 1817) was an important saint of the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi order in the 18th century. He was also a renowned poet of modern Urdu. Shah Waliullah, an Islamic scholar contemporary with Mirza Mazhar, is quoted as saying, "As far as I can see, and I can see the seven continents, there is no saint today like Mirza Mazhar."

===Shah Muhammad Safiullah Faruqi (d.1844)===
Muhammad Safiullah Faruqi was the son of Ghulam Masoom Faruqi Mujaddidi. He died in [[Dhu al-Qi'da]] in 1844 on his return journey from the ''[[hajj]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sirhindi.info/books.html ''Nisb Naama'' ("Ancestry of the Sirhindi Family"), Sindhi, handwritten, by Abdul-Ghaffar Faruqi Sirhindi]&lt;/ref&gt; Makhdoomsafi ullah died in Hudaida, a coastal city of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Umdatul maqamat written by fazal allah page 672 published karachi, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the Provincial Master of the Franciscans in England|Richard Brinkley (16th century)}}

'''Richard Brinkley'''&lt;ref&gt;Richardus Brinkley, Richard Brinkel, Brinkelius&lt;/ref&gt; (died c.1379) was an [[English people|English]] [[Franciscan]] [[scholastic philosopher]] and theologian. He was at the [[University of Oxford]] in the mid-fourteenth century; he produced a ''Summa Logicae'' in a [[nominalist]] vein in the 1360s or early 1370s, and other works.

[[File:Historie und Leben der berühmtesten europäischen Mahler frontispiece 1710.jpg|thumb|
Roger de Piles, [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to ''History and life of the famous European Painters'', Hamburg, Benj. Schiller, 1710]]
'''Roger de Piles''' (7 October 1635 – 5 April 1709) was a French painter, engraver, art critic and diplomat.

==Life==
Born in [[Clamecy, Nievre|Clamecy]], Roger de Piles studied philosophy and theology, and devoted himself to painting.

In 1662 he became tutor to [[Michel Amelot de Gournay]],  whom he was to follow throughout his life, acting as secretary to his various missions as French ambassador to Venice, Portugal, Spain.

In [[Venice]] (1682–1685) he started a famous collection of prints, drawings and paintings of [[Giorgione]], [[Correggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Forest]].

He also acquired a taste for political intrigue using his travels ostensibly undertaken to study the European collections, as a buyer for [[Louis XIV]], as  cover for confidential missions - for example in Germany and Austria (1685) on behalf of Louis' minister, the [[marquis de Louvois]].

He was not always fortunate as a spy. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in [[the Hague]] carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years. He spent his time writing ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres ...avec un traité du peintre parfait''.&lt;ref&gt;"Epitome of the life of the painters... with a treaty on the perfect painter".&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1699 following his appointement as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]].

In 1705 he followed Amelot de Gournay to Spain but illness forced him to return to Paris, where he died in 1709.

==Art critic==
His important contribution to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] rests on his ''Dialogue sur le coloris'' ("Dialogue on colours"), in which he initiated his famous defence of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in the argument started in 1671 by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] on the relative merits of [[drawing]] and [[color]] in the work of [[Titian]] (in a lecture to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] on Titian's ''Virgin and Child with St John''.)

The argument is most fascinating as an early debate on classic vs modern in painting; in essence on the mathematics of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[drawing]]&amp;mdash;the classic approach&amp;mdash; as opposed to the colored [[brush]] stroke&amp;mdash;the approach of the moderns. In his detailed study of the argument, ''Roger de Piles et les débats sur le coloris au siècle de Louis XIV'' (1965), B. Teyssèdre gives a touching account of the ''bohème'' of the "modern" ''réfusés'' in seventeenth century Paris, a history that was to repeat itself with the [[Impressionists]].

In the course of the argument Roger de Piles introduced the term  "''clair-obscur''" ([[Chiaroscuro]]) to highlight the effect of color in accentuating the tension between light and dark in a painting.

The way Roger de Piles documented his argument with Venetian and northern European examples was of influence to [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], [[Nicolas de Largillière]] and [[François de Troy]].

==Balance of painters==
To his last published work: ''Cours de peinture par principes avec un balance de peintres'' (1708) de Piles appended a list of fifty-six major painters with whose work he had acquainted himself as a connoisseur during his travels.

To each painter in the list he gave marks from 0 to 18 for composition, drawing, color and expression. This gave an overview of aesthetic appreciation hinging on the balance between color and design. The highest marks went to [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with a slight bias on color for Rubens, a slight bias on drawing for Raphaël. Painters who scored very badly in anything but color were [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]] and remarkably [[Michelangelo Caravaggio]] with 16 on color and 0 (zero) on expression. Painters who fell far behind Rubens and Raphaël but whose balance between color and design was perfect were [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Sebastian Bourdon]], [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==List==

The complete list is transcribed here from Manlio Brusatin:''Histoire des couleurs'' (Paris: Flammarion, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–104), reproduced in Elisabeth G. Holt ''Literary Sources of Art History'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;415–416

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">'''SEXINT''' is the practice of monitoring and/or indexing the pornographic preferences of internet users in an effort to later use the information for [[blackmail]]. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of ''sex''ual ''int''elligence retrieved on an [[intelligence service]] target and was first used by [[Jennifer Granick]], Director of Civil Liberties at the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/11/nsa-sexint-abuse-you%E2%80%99ve-all-been-waiting|title=NSA SEXINT is the Abuse You’ve All Been Waiting For|last=Granick|first=Jennifer|date=November 29, 2013|work=Center for Internet and Society|access-date=May 7, 2014|publisher=Stanford Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/3918/nsa-sexint-abuse-youve-waiting/|title=NSA SEXINT is the Abuse You’ve All Been Waiting For|last=Granick|first=Jennifer|date=November 29, 2013|work=Just Security|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Uses ==

The term was first used specifically in reference to the practice by [[Five Eyes]] member, the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States of America. It is unclear how often these programs and methods are used in comparison to other Five Eyes initiatives such as [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)]], [[MUSCULAR]], and [[XKEYSCORE]].

The extent to which SEXINT itself is used is unknown. Targets who have come forward are few and far between. While first-hand accounts are rare it is confirmed that 6 people, all followers of [[Islam|Muslim]]s not involved in any terror plots, were demonstrated as potential targets of this method for their influence on the popular video hosting site [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and other social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/nsa-porn-muslims_n_4346128.html|title=Top-Secret Document Reveals NSA Spied On Porn Habits As Part Of Plan To Discredit ‘Radicalizers’|last=Greenwald|first=Glen|date=November 26, 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 7, 2014|last2=Grim|first2=Ryan|last3=Gallagher|first3=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related abuses ==

The National Security Agency has been able to keep most specific instances of abuse of intel such as SEXINT under [[secret]]. A few reports have slipped through, including an employee able to use the related tactic of gathering [[LOVEINT]] to search for his ex-girlfriend on his first day of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/loveint-on-his-first-day-of-work-nsa-employee-spied-on-ex-girlfriend/|title=LOVEINT: On his first day of work, NSA employee spied on ex-girlfriend|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=September 27, 2013|work=Ars Technica|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much controversy over whether or not agencies such as the National Security Agency have been spying on American citizens. In early May 2014 [[Edward Snowden]] stated that American citizens are watched more closely than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/58451/edward-snowden-nsa-spies-most-americans|title=Edward Snowden: NSA Spies Most on Americans|last=Volz|first=Dustin|date=April 30, 2014|work=National Journal|access-date=May 7, 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Question of Scruples''''' is a [[card game]] based on [[ethical dilemma]]s. The game was invented by [[Henry Makow]] in 1984 and developed by High Game Enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rockingham |first=Graham |date=September 25, 1985 |title=Game Gauges Players' Scruples By Putting Them To The Test |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/91720125.html |quote=Scruples was born last summer when Henry Makow sold his house for $35,000, using the money to produce an initial 5,000 copies of Scruples for Canadian distribution. |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |page=E.3 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players are given five yellow cards apiece, each yellow card with a moral dilemma such as, "You accidentally damage a car in a parking lot. Do you leave a note with your name and phone number?"  Each player also has a single red card, with either "YES", "NO", or "DEPENDS" printed upon it.  The player must ask the question on a yellow card of the person who the holder of the yellow card believes most likely to reply with the answer on the questioner's red card.  (The game thus tests how well players know each other.)

If the answer matches that on the red card, the questioner discards both yellow card and red card, then takes another red card.  The game is won by the player who first discards all five of his yellow cards.

==Release history==

The game was originally designed and marketed by Henry Makow in Canada in 1984, who licensed the game to Maruca Industries&amp;ndash;Carl Eisenberg.  The game took off in the United States due to marketing program by Maruca that resulted in the game being played twice on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and featured in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' along with other publications and newspapers.  Carl Eisenberg negotiated a deal with Steven Hassenfeld of Hasbro, through licensing agent Douglas Polumbaum, to sell the US rights to Hasbro, which resulted in Hasbro also licensing other rights directly from Henry Makow in 1986.

Maruca initially sold 500,000 copies and, being a small company, could not produce the product fast enough. [[Hasbro]] was so excited by the potential of the game that they gave Maruca the ultimatum of licensing to them, or being knocked off and advertised out of business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Maruca licensed the game for a sum of $1,500,000, and Makow was paid $1,000,000 plus a royalty.

The game sold to Hasbro, who marketed the game (partly through [[Parker Brothers]]) for several years. The game has since sold over seven million copies worldwide and has been translated into five languages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  Hasbro later returned the rights to Henry Makow of High Game Enterprises.

Due to the cultural aspect of the moral dilemma questions, Scruples was updated every five years, until the Millennium edition, which is the latest version. It contains 150 questions from four previous versions and 100 new questions.&lt;ref name=gamesite&gt;http://www.scruplesgame.com/main.html Scruples game website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
Popularity of the game led to several computer versions developed by [[Leisure Genius]] in 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11303">'''Systematic ideology''' is a study of [[ideology|ideologies]] founded in the late 1930s in and around [[London]], [[England]] by Harold Walsby, George Walford and others. It seeks to understand the origin and development of ideologies, how ideologies and ideological groups work together, and the possibilities of guiding the development of ideologies on a global scale. The basic premise of systematic ideology is that ideology is the central [[motivation|motivator]] in human affairs; that the characteristics that make up the major ideologies come in sets; that those sets of characteristics form a series; and that the ideological series forms a system.

==History==
[[Image:Social Science Association - The Intellectual and the People.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the Social Science Association pamphlet ''The Intellectual and the People'']]
The group that formed around Harold Walsby and his ideas was a breakaway from the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]]. During the [[Second World War]] this group developed a fascination with
perceived impediments to mass [[class consciousness|socialist consciousness]] among the [[working class]]. The theory they developed was expressed by Walsby himself in his 1947 book ''The Domain of Ideologies'' and those involved in the group set up an organisation to propagate their views called the '''Social Science Association''', which existed from 1944 until 1956, attracting a number of new recruits during the ‘[[Turner Controversy]]’. It was later succeeded by the
[[Walsby Society]] and the journal which emerged from it called ''Ideological Commentary''.

From the 1980s onwards, George Walford, editor of ''Ideological Commentary'' and former secretary of the SSA, watered down some of the theory’s more obviously [[elitist]] elements and even left the SPGB money at the time of his death. He did this on the grounds that although in his view the Party would never help achieve [[socialism]] it did perform a valuable function by
demonstrating through its application of critical analysis, logical thought and theory the limitations of other political groups that valued these less highly (a perspective which had informed Harold Walsby’s decision in 1950 to surreptitiously rejoin the Party through its postal branch
and write articles for the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'' under the pseudonym "H.W.S.Bee").

''Ideological Commentary'' survived until the death of Walford in 1994. {{As of|2007}}, barely a handful of systematic ideology's exponents remain.

Walsby, Walford and their group produced a large number of leaflets, pamphlets and other literature over time, a fair chunk of it dealing with the SPGB. The most readable expressions of systematic ideology are Walford’s book ''Beyond Politics'', published in 1990, and the pamphlet ''Socialist Understanding'', published ten years earlier.

==Theory==
The theory of the group developed over time and was re-christened ‘systematic ideology’ by Walford in 1976.  Its basic premise was that people’s assumptions and identifications (the factors making up their ‘ideology’) are not explicable in terms of [[materialism|material conditions]] in general and their relationship to the [[means of production]] in particular—and are never likely to be. Instead, there are persistent and distinct ideological groups in society, cutting across [[social class]]es and forming a series, with the largest groups being most typically guided in their thoughts and
actions by a preference for family, authority, familiarity and tradition. Politically, these preferences find predominant expression in the ideas of the large number of so-called
‘non-politicals’ in society, and in [[Conservatism]] and then [[Liberalism]] (the strength of these preferences gradually weakening through the series).

As the series progresses further, the next, progressively smaller, ideological groups seek to repress these identifications and preferences in favor of dynamism, social change, logical thought and the pursuit of theory as a guide to decision-making, these being expressed politically in [[Labourism]], more overtly still in [[Communism]] and then, in an ultimate and extreme form, in [[Anarchism]] (or ‘[[Libertarian socialism|Anarchosocialism]]’, the purist variety of it allegedly expounded by the Socialist Party of Great Britain). The more an ideology represses the preferences for family, tradition, etc. in favour of social change, dynamism and the pursuit of theory as a guide to action, the fewer in
number its adherents are likely to be, with anarchists (or ‘anarcho-socialists’) being the smallest of all. Those seeking radical social change, so the theory contends, will always be hampered and restrained by the enduring preferences of the largest ideological groups.

=== Walford ===

In his book, ''Beyond Politics'', George Walford seeks to analyse ideologies on the basis of its adherents' surface behaviors, their underlying sentiments and assumptions ("ethos"), and underlying cognitions ("eidos"). Of particular interest to him are a single group, ''the non-politicals'', and five major political ideologies, ''conservatism, liberalism, socialism, communism, and anarchism'', which can be listed as a series, with each seeking to "repress" its predecessor. He forms a series of hypotheses about the nature of those six ideologies, observing that they may be gauged upon different dimensions: according to ''relative size and political influence'' of its adherents, their relative ''reliance upon theory over practice'', and the ''degree to which they sought change''. He postulates that the non-politicals have the greatest influence and least interest in theory, while anarchists exhibit the least influence and greatest interest in theory, with the rest having mixed degrees of those properties.

He also formulates that each is relative to certain ideological ''ethos'': ''a) (short-term) expediency, b) (traditional) principles, c) precision, d) (fundamental) reform, e) revolution, and e) repudiation''. By his formulations, historical change, development of technology, and development of more complicated social relations can be explained as occurring in stages along this series. 
#For Walford, all societies historically begin in a state where a mass of individuals engage in ''expediency'' at the hunter-gatherer level. This state of affairs is characterized by short-term individual economic behavior and collective political action.
#Societies grow to have more advanced and secure political systems at the same time that they make better use of agricultural technology with more long-term goals in mind. In the process, economic behavior becomes more and more collectivistic. From then on, the societies engage in wars, and conquer. Empires grow, and create obedience with the mask of ''traditional principles''.
#Finally, societies enter a stage where principles espoused actually begin to be followed, enacted, and made more ''precise''. Similarly, economic production becomes more bureaucratic and rationally goal-oriented.
#The remaining three forms of ethos -- ''reform, revolution, and repudiation''—are, when taken together, seen to compose the envisioned fourth stage in historical development.

While some other philosophers have expressed the opinion that political liberalism is the peak or end-stage of historical development (see [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s "End of History" thesis), Walford claims the opposite. "More than ever before, our world is a boiling, bounding, bubbling ferment of ideological novelty, and the rate of change is accelerating. If the ideological system has reached completion it is only in the sense that a newborn child is complete." (Beyond Politics)

==Criticism==
Historically, systematic ideology has been unable to produce a [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and causal model for what it is that influences some people and not others to gravitate towards a particular ideology.

Walsby’s early version of the theory was clearly [[hierarchical]] (with those understanding the theory being the smallest group of all, metaphorically positioned at the apex of a pyramid, just above the SPGB) and it lent itself to criticism on the grounds that it was merely a particularly
convoluted type of ‘[[human nature]]’ argument. This was essentially the response outlined in the ''Socialist Standard''’s April 1949 review of Walsby’s book, called ''The Domain of Sterilities''.

Twin studies have shown that genetics have a strong effect on both attitude formation, and receptivity to ideological affiliation.  This may provide some answer to the criticism that systematic ideology lacks a causal model. According to one study:
:We found that political attitudes are influenced much more heavily by genetics than by parental socialization. For the overall index of political conservatism, genetics accounts for approximately half the variance in ideology while shared environment (including parental socialization) accounts for only 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Tergar Meditation Community''' is a Buddhist meditation community led by Tibetan meditation master and best-selling author [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]].&lt;ref name="About TMC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tergar.org/about/ | title=About the Tergar Meditation Community | publisher=Tergar.org | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Bodian|title=Meditation For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMCofuTFafoC&amp;pg=PT456|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=31 July 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-33179-8|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tergar means "encampment of the treasure revealer".&lt;ref name="Dorje"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Je Tukyi Dorje|author2=Surmang Tendzin (Rinpoche.)|title=Chariot of the Fortunate: The Life of the First Yongey Mingyur Dorje|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0ptU6GKqlUC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=May 30, 2013|date=November 2006|publisher=KTD Publications|isbn=978-0-9741092-7-5|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
The Tergar largely descends from the Tibetan Buddhist [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage, and to a lesser extent the [[Nyingma]] lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tergar.org/about/tergar-lineage/ | title=Tergar Lineage | publisher=Tergar.org | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lineage history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tergar.org/about/tergar-lineage/lineage-history/ | title=Lineage history | publisher=Tergar.org | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ter" means treasure in the Tibetan language - meaning the practices and wisdom to obtain our greatest potential, alleviate suffering and attain enlightenment. "Gar" means gathering. "Tergar" then is the place where people assemble to enable transformation.&lt;ref name="Lineage history" /&gt;

The Karma Kagyu lineage was passed down through [[Karmapa]]s, [[Tai Situ Rinpoche]]s and incarnations of Mingyur Rinpoche. The Nyingma lineage was transmitted through the treasure teachings ([[terma (religion)|terma]]) of Kagyu and Nyingma masters.&lt;ref name="Lineage history" /&gt;

The first school of the Tergar lineage began in the late 1600s by the 1st Mingyur Rinpoche, a wandering yogi, and his two sons who were [[tulku]]s. They first gathered in a tent in a camp (gar) and then in a monastery they built, Tergar Rigdzin Kacholing in eastern Tibet near [[Derge]]. His sons ran the monastery and the 1st Mingyur Rinpoche traveled and taught the Kagyu termas Pema Benza, Dorje Drolo, and the Union of Wisdom and Method Longevity Practice. These termas have been held and passed down by incarnations of Tai Situ Rinpoche and Karmapa. Tibetan texts have been destroyed by the Chinese government, so that the early Tergar lineage and history has been lost in the process.&lt;ref name="Lineage history" /&gt;

The Tergar Rigdzin Kacholing monastery grew in the 18th and 19th centuries to include a nunnery, a small [[shedra]], and 2 retreat centers. Another monastery, Namlong Gompa was established. The 6th Mingyur Rinpoche oversaw the studies of more than 100 monks and 60 nuns at the Tergar monasteries before he left Tibet and went into exile with the 16th Karmapa. The Chinese government looted the monastery buildings and jailed Gase Rinpoche, the reincarnation of the eldest son of the 1st Mingyur Rinpoche, who had remained at Tergar. He was released from jail in 1982 and with Pema Karpo Rinpoche, began rebuilding the monastery, with a retreat center and shrine room.&lt;ref name="Lineage history" /&gt;

[[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]] continued the teachings of the Tergar tradition, including Dzogchen Desum and [[Chokgyur Lingpa]]'s termas, with masters, lamas and major regents of the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions. His family line was the main holder of the [[Kagyu|Barom Kagyu]] lineage and was also linked to the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage. He held the teachings of three great Nyingma masters [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye]], [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] and Terchen Chokgyur Lingpa.

The 7th [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche|Mingyur Rinpoche]] (b. 1975) received Nyingma transmissions through his father [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]] and [[Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche]] and Kagyu teachings from [[Tai Situ Rinpoche]] and Saljey Rinpoche. He also integrated modern ways of presenting Buddhist philosophy and practices of mindfulness, compassion and loving-kindness to people from a wide range of beliefs and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Lineage history" /&gt;

==Mission==
The [[Tibetan Buddhist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarina Singh|title=Lonely Planet India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vK88ktao7pIC&amp;pg=PA578|accessdate=May 30, 2013|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-347-8|page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Bennett-Goleman|title=Mind Whispering: A New Map to Freedom from Self-Defeating Emotional Habits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gaungj-VFm0C&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=May 30, 2013|date=23 April 2013|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-213089-1|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; community's mission is "to make the ancient practice of meditation accessible to the modern world," leveraging meditation practices that have been used for centuries to "transform suffering into joy and confusion into wisdom."&lt;ref name="About TMC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACIM" /&gt;

==Meditation and study programs==
Programs are offered to Buddhists and non-Buddhists in Tergar practice groups and meditation centers. The foundational study begins with three seminars on the "Joy of Living", which teaches how meditation "can be used to calm the mind, open the heart, and develop insight." Next is the "Path of Liberation" which is "designed to strip away the causes of suffering and uncover the radiant awareness that underlies all experience."&lt;ref name="About TMC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACIM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/file/7530.pdf?id=7530 | title=Healing the Heart &amp; Mind event with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche open to the public | publisher=Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine | date=March 2010 | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

===Programs, seminars and practice groups===

'''The Christian Community''' ({{lang-de|Die Christengemeinschaft}}) is a [[Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]. It was founded in 1922 in Switzerland by a group of mainly [[Lutheran]] theologians and ministers led by [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]],&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Becker, ''Attempts of religious renewal in the modern trend by the example of the evangelic theologian Friedrich Rittelmeyer (1872–1938)'', Ph.D. dissertation, Freie Universität Berlin, 2000.

There are approximately 350 worldwide. The international headquarters are in Berlin, Germany.

The Christian Community is led by the "circle of priests," with leaders known as coordinators appointed within the circle. A first coordinator (Erzoberlenker) is consulted by two second coordinators (Oberlenkers). There are also third coordinators (Lenkers) on the regional level and a synod of priests. There is no additional ordination for the leadership. The priesthood of the Christian Community has always been open to [[Ordination of women|women]].

==Practice==
The Christian Community does not require its members to conform to any specific teaching or behaviour.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Ravetz: ''Free From Dogma. Theological Reflections in The Christian Community.'' Edinburgh 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; Seven sacraments are celebrated within the Community: the [[Eucharist]], generally called the ''Act of Consecration of Man'', and six other sacraments: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Marriage]], The Last [[Anointing]], Sacramental Consultation (replacing [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), and [[Ordination]]. There is also a special Sunday service for children of school age.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Francis Capel and Tom Ravetz, ''Seven Sacraments in the Christian Community'', Floris Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Rituals and sacraments are the same wherever they are celebrated. Services are generally celebrated in the language of the country in which they celebrated. The Act of Consecration of Man lasts approximately one hour. Sunday services are longer than weekday services because they contain a sermon in addition to holy communion. For the sacramental wine used in communion non-fermented grape juice is used rather than alcoholic wine. Three Christmas services are celebrated, one on December 24 (at midnight) and two on December 25. There are also added prayers for different liturgical seasons of the year.

Some chapels have an organ, and occasionally the organ has quarter tones in addition to the conventional (equal temperament) tuning.

==Tenets==
The Christian Community practices a complete freedom of teaching. The Priests may exert this freedom of teaching, provided that they do not contradict the sacraments which they celebrate. There is no official theology, nor articles of belief. Whatever is taught or written is a personal view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antroposofi.org/ks/michaeltapp.htm The Christian Community – An Introduction] by Michael Tapp, retired priest in The Christian Community&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic tenets of some priests of the Christian Community are 1) free will, 2) [[reincarnation]] and 3) focus on Christ. For example, Jesus of Nazareth is seen as merely a physical vessel that enabled the spiritual being called Christ to influence the world.

The ideology of some priests of the Christian Community could be summarized with the following points:
* Modern man requires modern religion (movement)
* The [[Soul]] is immortal via re-incarnation
* Jesus and Christ are separate entities, focus is on [[Christ]]
* Christ is both, external and internal reality (Christ is not only 'out there' but at the same time 'in here')
* The [[New Testament]] should have priority over other documents in Christianity
* No missionary work or public marketing should be done because finding this religion should be based on free will.

'''''The Demands of Liberal Education''''' is a 1999 [[political philosophy]] book by Meira Levinson that establishes a [[liberalism|liberal political theory]] of [[education|children's education]] that fits the mutual needs of the state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the [[autonomy]] of individual children through increasing their capacity for [[liberty]]. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by [[Oxford University Press]], aims to address a lacuna between [[educational policy]] and liberal political theory.

Levinson advocates for a weak [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]] state that can promote [[thick concept|thick]] autonomy while accepting citizens who do not agree. She argues for public schools "common" to all citizens and "detached" from individual citizen or community values, and argues for a [[mandate (politics)|constitutional mandate]] to this end.

Reviewers recommended the book for public educators as an important contribution to liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.

== Overview ==

In ''The Demands of Liberal Education'', Meira Levinson sets out to write a "coherent [[liberalism|liberal political theory]] of [[education|children's education]]" that establishes how education can mutually satisfy the conflicting interests of the state and its diverse citizenry.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=211}} "Liberal education" is defined as the type of education that follows from a liberal society's values.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=154}}{{efn|This definition is different from a traditional definition, where "[[liberal education]]" denoted a self-contained approach to education that disregarded external societal conditions.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=154}}}} Levinson writes that the intent of liberal education is to maximize individual [[autonomy]] in successive generations, particularly by "cultivating the 'capacity' to exercise [[liberty]]".{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=83}} Autonomy and its cultivation is the primary moral aim of liberal education.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|p=36}} Levinson argues from a liberal political philosophy rather than from a [[philosophy of education]],{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}} and contends that a broad liberal education best equips for individual autonomy and thus creates the best [[republic]].{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=83}}

Meira Levinson published ''The Demands of Liberal Education'' in 1999 with [[Oxford University Press]]. She was a [[secondary school]]teacher at the time, having completed her [[D. Phil]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1997. Her thesis is titled "Autonomy, Schooling, and the Reconstruction of the Liberal Educational Ideal".{{sfn|Levinson [no date]}} The book was published in paperback in April 2002.{{sfn|Oxford University Press}} The work aimed to address a lack of literature between educational policy and liberal political theory, with the intent to serve both constituencies.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|McGough|2003}}

== Summary ==

{{Quote box|quote=The aim of liberal education is to teach children the skills, habits, knowledge, and dispositions for them to be thoughtful, mature, self-assured individuals who map their path in the world with care and confidence, take responsibility for their actions, fulfill their duties as citizens, question themselves and others when appropriate, listen to and learn from others, and ultimately lead their lives with dignity, integrity, and self-respect—i.e. to be autonomous in the fullest sense of the word ... |source=''The Demands of Liberal Education'', p. 164{{sfn|McGough|2003}} |width=30em |quoted=1}}

The first chapter assumes the importance of liberalism.{{sfn|McGough|2003}} Levinson writes about the foundations of liberalism and asserts that the political liberalism of [[John Rawls]] is untenable for its lack of interest in values of autonomy. She concludes that liberal states must adopt a "weakly [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]] stance towards autonomy", or a stance that promotes [[Thick concept|thick]] autonomy while accepting citizens who do not share that value.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}} Levinson acknowledges the influence of non-formal education but focuses on public schools as the ideal institution for training citizens.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|p=32}} She advocates for public schools that are "common" to all members of a community and "detached" from the internal values of the community (or parents).{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}}

Levinson proposes that [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] can provide the "cultural coherence" that may be missing from a "detached" school{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}}—which would be a diverse community that prioritizes "[[critical thinking]], tolerance, and reflectiveness".{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=216}} She argues for a [[mandate (politics)|constitutional mandate]] to establish the "autonomy-promoting aim of education" regardless of public support, and asks for a "culture change".{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=156}} Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist for parents who do not act in their children's best interests. She adds that children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness in the interests of children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own "limited and restrictive" worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=84}} Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from "excessive [[paternalism]]" consequently stunt children's ability to develop adult autonomy or make rational decisions.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=84}} Thus, state and parental paternalism should be limited where it will hurt individual "capacity for autonomy".{{sfn|Alexander|2003|pp=84–85}}

Towards her "weak perfectionist" liberalism, Levinson requires three traits of a liberal society: (1) an agreeable, transparent, and equally accessible "legitimation process" for government, (2) pluralism, and (3) "substantive liberal institutions" such as "individual liberties and ... governmental duties".{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=212}} She pairs this view of liberalism with thick autonomy as "the only defensible interpretation of liberalism".{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=212}} Levinson develops an idea of autonomy that would be agreeable to most citizens while sufficient to guarantee liberalism's "substantive liberal institutions", and defines it as "higher-order preference formation" that minds one's personal values while allowing for openness to criticism and a developed personality.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=212}} She argues that capacity for autonomy is a right to children, that the state is obligated to facilitate it, and that children are obligated to receive it.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=213}} In this way, Levinson's stance is that the state must make education compulsory. Children require paternalistic decisions of some sort, and the state is best suited to promote consent and operate in the best interests of children. The state has a right to override lack of child and parental interest in such an autonomy-promoting education, since such an override lets children decide their values later in life, as adults, as opposed to never having that opportunity. Levinson contends that parents, on the other hand, must provide for the well-being, identity development, and "cultural coherence" sense of their children.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=214}}

Another chapter compares how the American, English, and French educational systems foster private and public identities.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}} She writes that the French public school system is best for its neutral secularity and disregard of "parentally inspired discriminations", which are not allowed to influence the common nature of the school.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=85}} This is contrasted with the American public school system's trends of increased [[privatization]] and non-neutrality. American [[school voucher]] programs use public school money towards private schools, departing from the mission of the common public school and further compounding school inequality and [[ethnic segregation]].{{sfn|Alexander|2003|pp=85-86}} Levinson concludes that [[school choice|parental choice]] limits capacity for autonomy and, consequently, individual liberty.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=86}}

== Reception ==

In his ''Philosophical Books'' review, Graham Haydon wrote that the book was part of a trend of political philosopher interest in how education works within liberal-democratic societies. He noted issues of compatibility between a society's self-described "liberal" values and the values of their educational practice, or between a society's educational practice and the wishes of its citizens.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=154}} Haydon wrote critics of the common and detached public school would ask how the students would be raised without "some cultural coherence".{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}} Writing in 2001, he said that her criticism of England's civics education already appeared outdated in view of England's then-new [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] citizenship curriculum, which he felt Levinson would find the "best model ... consistent with her own argument".{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}} He added that the "radical pluralist" societies used as examples do not accommodate citizens that hold other values over "autonomy", and do not answer how citizens can be convinced to believe in "autonomy-promoting" schools.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=155}} Haydon considered her book "an important contribution" to liberal theory and wrote that "it would be a loss to political philosophy" if she continued her work as a schoolteacher in lieu of an academic career.{{sfn|Haydon|2001|p=156}}

[[Kern Alexander]] of the ''Journal of Education Finance'' compared Levinson's view of parental and child rights to [[Michael Walzer]]'s 1984 ''[[Spheres of Justice]]'', where he writes that children confined to parental teachings alone when without compulsory public schools.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=84}} Alexander linked Walzer and Levinson's views on parental school choice as more about "choosing 'schoolmates than schoolbooks'", to the detriment of "cultural cohesion" and for reasons unrelated to educational quality.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=85}} Alexander recommended the book for "all public educators" for its thoughts on the role of school privatization, [[homeschooling]], and voucher programs.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=86}}

Writing for ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', Doret de Ruyter approved of Levinson's emphasis on autonomy and concurred that Levinson's definition of autonomy would be agreeable to citizens of Western liberal countries.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=212}} De Ruyter was unsure about edge cases of autonomy, such as whether being closed-minded to the prospect of a pierced belly button would make her a less autonomous person in Levinson's view.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|pp=212–213}} She also disagreed with Levinson's position of parental "privilege" (rather than right) over their children, and invoked [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]] to argue that parents instead have the opposite of a privilege, a "duty", to their children's interests and require the liberty to fulfill it, including through education.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|pp=214–215}} To defend this parental duty to children and freedom from society in fulfillment of the duty, de Ruyter cited [[John Eekelaar]]'s parental duty-right to educate children: a [[Negative and positive rights|positive right]] to educate as they see fit and a [[Negative and positive rights|negative right]] that prevents others from impeding. She concluded that the state's duty conflicts with the duty of parents and thus the state's duty is "primarily ... against children".{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=215}}

De Ruyter also disagreed that "detached" schools were the only means of inculcating capacity for autonomy,{{efn|De Ruyter quotes Levinson conceding that it is "hardly tenable" to consider schools the most influential educational source of children, and that home life constitutes a greater influence.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|pp=216–217}}}} and argued for "autonomy enhancing education" over "autonomy imposing education".{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|p=215}} In her criticism, de Ruyter wrote that Levinson lacked critical distance from her idea of a "detached" school, which were presented in "[[utopian]] character", with no concrete examples of such a school in existence, and as inexplicably immune from "capitalist-dominated education".{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|pp=216–217}} She added that "detachment" was vague in definition, that more important was detachment from absolutist or divisive stances of "the good life", and that curriculum and school management were better correlative factors towards liberal schools.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|pp=218–219}} De Ruyter concluded that "autonomy imposing schools" would be more harmful than respectful and "autonomy-friendly ... reduced plural environments", as a child would be better off in an imperfect pluralist than a homogenous fundamentalist classroom.{{sfn|de Ruyter|2004|pp=219–220}} Levinson responded to de Ruyter's points in a later issue of the journal.{{sfn|Levinson|2004}}

In ''[[Educational Researcher]]'', Luis Mirón and Pradeep Dhillon wrote that theorists of education and liberal political philosophy could not "afford to ignore" the book.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|p=32}} They wrote that the state would have to be "benign" and "hermetically sealed" from external influence for her theory to hold—that such a state would be weak against the interests of illiberal parties.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|p=33}} They added that her evaluation of public education across several countries did not account for supranational influence and that she did not engage the potential issues endemic to integrating heteronymous illiberals.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|p=33}} Additionally, they felt that the book lacked in its practical proposals for public school civics education, particularly in how a weak perfectionist, "activist" state can intervene on behalf of marginalized group interests in a public school setting.{{sfn|Mirón|Dhillon|2004|p=36}}

The book was discussed in a group session at the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s 2002 annual meeting. The panel, led by James Dwyer, included [[William Galston]], Fran Schrag, [[Yuli Tamir]], and a response from the author.{{sfn|American Philosophical Association|2002|p=72}}

'''''The Light of the East''''' was a monthly review founded in 1922&lt;ref name="jos"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joseph Mattam SJ|title=Interpreting Christ to India Today: The Calcutta School|journal=Biblical Studies|url=http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ijt/23_3-4_191.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Calcutta]] by [[Georges Dandoy|Georges Dandoy, SJ]] (1882-1962) and [[Pierre Johanns|Pierre Johanns, SJ]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Doyle, ''Synthesizing the Vedanta: The Theology of Pierre Johanns, S.J.'' (Oxford: Peter Lang, 2006) 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dandoy was the chief editor.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly ceased publication in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin Ganeri|title=Knowledge and Love of God in Ramanuja and Aquinas|journal=Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies|date=2007|volume=20|issue=6|url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1381&amp;context=jhcs|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and objective==
Dandoy and Johanns were young Jesuits, newly arrived in India, when they met Brahmachari Animananda, disciple of [[Brahmabandhab Upadhyay|Brahmobandhav Upadhyay]]. Animananda encouraged them in their desire to begin a journal that would carry on the spirit of inquiry initiated by Upadhyay.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt; P. Turmes reports that Animananda’s face brightened up when the two Jesuits laid before him the proposal for a journal that would present Christ to India in a way adapted to her mentality and culture.&lt;ref&gt;P. Turmes, ''A Teacher of Genius: B. Animananda'' (Calcutta: Xavier Publications, 1963) 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Dandoy and Johanns contributed regularly to the review. Several of Johanns' contributions were later published in book form under the title ''To Christ to the Vedanta.''&lt;ref&gt;''To Christ through the Vedānta: The Writings of Reverend P. Johanns, S.J.'' 2 vols. Ed. Theo de Greeff. Bangalore: The United Theological College, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors included members of the so-called [[Calcutta School of Indology]].

'''''The Wine of Astonishment''''' is a 1982 novel written by [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] author [[Earl Lovelace]]. The story depicts the struggles of a [[Spiritual Baptist]] community from the passing of the Prohibition Ordinance to repealing of the ban, portraying a 20-year struggle from 1932 to 1951. Themes such as [[racism]], women in society, [[religion]], change, [[oppression]], power and authority are featured throughout the book.

== Plot summary ==
This story is narrated by Eva Dorcas. She and her husband, Bee Dorcas are a religious couple who are both members of the Spiritual Baptist Church in a small Trinidadian community known as [https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1957616&amp;fid=6033&amp;c=trinidad_and_tobago Bonasse].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bonasse Village, Trinidad and Tobago|url=https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1957616&amp;fid=6033&amp;c=trinidad_and_tobago|website=Geographical Names|publisher=ITA}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all share their experiences about being persecuted due to their direct affiliation with their religion. They also share how they were betrayed by someone to whom they entrusted their faith for a change. Trust became an issue for the fellow characters since Ivan Morton betrayed them when he entered into the political life and evacuated the house his father built on his own to live in a colonial home, located on top of the Bonasse hill, that was once occupied by an English family known as the Richardsons. The community praised Bolo for his masculinity in defending his fellow neighbours until he was taken to prison. After his release he was no longer the person he once was, of which the community now fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas- Samuels|first1=Leisa|title=The Wine of Astonishment- Literature Notes|url=http://www.bulbsoup.com/lt-the-wine-of-astonishment.html|website=Bulbsoup|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovelace|first1=Earl|title=The Wine of Astonishment|date=2010|publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishers|location=Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main characters ==
* Bee Dorcas: Eva Dorcas' husband, a father to five children, installed as Shouter Baptist church's pastor and believed to be a strong Christian. The entire community admired Bee, and considered him as the pillar of the community due to his being wise and patient. He loved being appreciated and knew how manage his responsibilities in a professionalized manner without converting it into a burden. Bee eventually becomes aware of that repression occurring upon losing the respect of his children and the disintegration of the church. Bee shows his anger when he breaks the law and deals with the consequences.
* Eva Dorcas: Bee's wife and mother of his five children. Eva is characterized as an emotional supporter for her husband and believed to be a strong Christian follower just as her husband. Known to be the narrator and explained every aspect of everyone’s life in details.
* Ivan Morton: once a teacher before he became affiliated with politics. He was known as the new individual within the country's legislative council, but brought disappointment when he broke his promise to help lift the ban. He was known to be the "bright" person in the community even though he had failed his college examination not only once but twice.
* Bolo: known as the best of all [http://citizensforconservationtt.org/main/index.php/culherit/culheritcarnival/142-stick-fighting stick fighters]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacLean|first1=Geoffrey|title=Stick Fighting|url=http://citizensforconservationtt.org/main/index.php/culherit/culheritcarnival/142-stick-fighting|website=Citizens for Conservation: Trinidad and Tobago|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the community and was crowned as champion. With such emphasis, the community viewed him as a hero and a warrior figure. He was later imprisoned for defending both his mother and the church. The imprisonment had changed his well being from the most loved individual to the terror of the community after a year.

== Major themes and symbolism ==
Shouter Baptists or Spiritual Baptists observe a combination of Christianity and African traditional practices. Conflict arose between the English government and citizens of Trinidad because Christianity has a direct link with English authorities and Shouter Baptist was a form of rivalry in the eyes of the colonial authorities, since Trinidad was still a colony under the British Empire. This conflict resulted in the passing of Shouter Prohibition Ordinance in 1917, portraying religious oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Patrick|title=Colonialism and Cultural Identity: Crises of Tradition in the Anglophone Literature of India, and the Caribbean.|date=2000|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=137-161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The betrayal of Ivan Morton results in a dramatic change within the lives and faith of the community, emphasizing the toll that power and authority takes on someone's personality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Ivan Morton became the main disappointment when he decided not to support the Shouter Baptist religion and followed the colonizers' orders. Politics in this community is a depiction of the various characteristics of Caribbean political leadership. Members of the community connected their faith with their daily lives by reciting Bible verses throughout the novel depicting religion as a major theme.

The Shouter Baptist Church symbolizes unity and a form of identity. Members of the community adore the church and claim it is the foundation of their tradition, a connection with their ancestors who were slaves.

'''Yi Eonjeok''' (1491–1553), sometimes known by his pen name '''Hoejae''', was a public official and intellectual of the middle [[Joseon Dynasty]] of Korea. He was born and died in [[Gyeongju]], then the capital of [[Gyeongsang]] province. Like most intellectuals from Gyeongsang in this period, he was a member of the [[Sarim]] faction. He contributed to the polarity-nonpolarity (''mugeuk''-''taegeuk'') debate in classical [[Korean Confucianism]].&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?i=279101 이언적 李彦迪 (Yi Eonjeok)], [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]],&lt;/ref&gt;

A scion of the [[Yeoju]] [[Lee (Korean name)|Yi]] clan, he passed the literary section of the [[gwageo]] in 1514 and entered government service. He was twice expelled from service and then re-hired due to factional strife. He was exiled after [[Korean literati purges|Fourth Literati Purge of 1545]]. He spent the intervening periods teaching on [[Jaok Mountain]] in Gyeongju. After his death, the [[Oksan Seowon, Gyeongju|Oksan Seowon]] was erected on Jaok Mountain to venerate his memory. It still stands today in Angang-eup, Gyeongju City, [[North Gyeongsang]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

It was excoriated in Uijeongbu YeonguI Pavilion in 1568 and was established in Jongmyo Shrine in 1569 (King Seonjo 2), and was engaged in Mungmyeong in 1610 (Gwanghagun 2). In addition, the ancestral tablets were enshrined in 17 Seowon schools across the country, including Oksan Seowon in Gyeongju. Yi's main work is titled " Yi Eon-jeong's Old Baseon", and is designated as Treasure No. 586. Other writings are kept at Dok-rak and Oksan Seowon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000893959 Doopedia : Yi Eonjeok]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Želju Mitev Želev''' ({{lang-bg|Желю Митев Желев}}; 3 March 1935 – 30 January 2015) was a [[Bulgaria]]n politician and former [[dissident]] who served as the first non-Communist [[List of heads of state of Bulgaria|President of Bulgaria]] from 1990 to 1997. A member of the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]], he was elected as President by the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)#Grand National Assembly|7th Grand National Assembly]], and was then elected directly by the people in [[Bulgarian presidential election, 1992]] as the first democratically elected [[President of Bulgaria]]. He lost his party's nomination for his 1996 reelection campaign after losing a tough primary race to [[Petar Stoyanov]].

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Zhelyu Zhelev was born on 3 March 1935 in Veselinovo village, [[Shumen Province|Shumen]]. He graduated with a degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[Sofia University|Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"]] in 1958, and later earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="Lentz2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M. Lentz|title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6HKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|date=4 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-26490-2|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissident ===
Zhelev was a member of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], but was expelled from it for political reasons in 1965. He was unemployed for six years since all employment in Bulgaria was state-regulated.&lt;ref name="Lentz2014"/&gt;

In 1982, he published his controversial work, "The Fascism" (Фашизмът). Three weeks after the volume's publication in 1982, it was banned and removed from the bookstores and libraries throughout the nation, as it likened the Soviet style socialist state to the fascist states of Italy, Germany and Spain before, during, and after World War II.&lt;ref name="KaidHoltz-Bacha2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynda Lee Kaid|author2=Christina Holtz-Bacha|title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCd1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1015|date=21 December 2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6562-9|page=1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SDS ===
In 1988, just before the [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall of Communism]], Zhelev founded the Ruse Committee, and in 1989 he became a founding member and chairman of the Club for Support of Openness and the Reform (a time when many such democratic clubs were formed), which helped him to achieve the position of Chairman of the Coordinating Council of the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (Bulgarian: СДС, SDS) party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Профил на Желю Желев в "omda|url=http://www.omda.bg/page.php?IDMenu=364&amp;IDLang=1|publisher=omda.bg|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/UDF_Coordinating_Council_1990 Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces.] ''Demokratsiya Newspaper'', 27 April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MP and President ===
Zhelev was elected MP in [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|June 1990]] for the 7th Grand National Assembly; the Assembly's main goal was to create a new democratic [[Constitution of Bulgaria]]. After the resignation of President [[Petar Mladenov]], the assembly elected Zhelev his successor on 1 August 1990.&lt;ref name="KaidHoltz-Bacha2007"/&gt; He thus became the first head of state in 44 years who was not either a Communist or [[fellow traveler]].

=== 1992 presidential election ===
Under the new constitution adopted in July 1991, the president was to be elected directly by voters, for a maximum of two terms. The first such election was held in [[Bulgarian presidential election, 1992|January 1992]]. Zhelev won in the runoff against [[Velko Valkanov]] (who was endorsed by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|Socialists]]) with 52.8% of the votes. He immediately suspended his membership in the UDF; the new constitution did not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term.

Zhelev served his full five-year term, which ran until January 1997.

=== 1996 presidential election ===
Zhelev lost the UDF nomination for the 1996 presidential race to [[Petar Stoyanov]] who went on to win the next [[Bulgarian presidential election, 1996|presidential elections]].

=== Later political career ===
After his defeat in the 1996 UDF primaries and after the end of his presidency in 1997, Zhelev remained in politics, but on a much smaller scale. He became Honorary Chair of the [[Liberal Democratic Union (Albania)|Liberal Democratic Union]] and Honorary Chair of the [[Liberal International]] and in 1997 went on to establish and preside over a foundation named after him. Zhelev was the initiator and president of the [[Balkan Political Club]], a union of former political leaders from [[Southeast Europe]]. As part of the club he voiced his support for Turkey's accession to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgaria Ex-President Zhelev: Turkey Should Be in EU Already|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/108748/Bulgaria+Ex-President+Zhelev%3A+Turkey+Should+Be+in+EU+Already|work=Novinite.com|publisher=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Zhelev also voiced his opinion that Bulgaria should adopt a [[presidential system]] based upon the French model: "The country should have both prime minister and president, but the latter should be vested in far-reaching powers so that he may control the executive power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calls for Electing Prime Minister Borisov for Bulgaria's President Gain Momentum|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/106342/Calls+for+Electing+Prime+Minister+Borisov+for+Bulgaria%27s+President+Gain+Momentum|work=Novinite.com|publisher=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhelev died in Sofia at the age of 79 on 30 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novinite.com/articles/166247/Bulgaria%27s+Former+President+Zhelyu+Zhelev+Dies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/zhelev-bulgaria-s-first-post-communist-president-dies-at-79 | work=Bloomberg | first=Slav | last=Okov | title=Zhelyu Zhelev, Bulgarian Post-Communist Leader, Dies at 79 | date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Justice Project===
Zhelyu Zhelev served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the [[World Justice Project]] ([[American Bar Association|ABA]]).&lt;ref name=wjp&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Chairs|url=http://worldjusticeproject.org/honorary-chairs|publisher=[[World Justice Project]]|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and accolades===
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
On 15 January 2010, Zhelev received the Macedonian state [[Order 8-September]] for his contribution to the recognition of the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] from the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macedonia President: Bulgaria Leader in Recognizing Our Independence|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/112010/Macedonia+President%3A+Bulgaria+Leader+in+Recognizing+Our+Independence|work=Novinite.com|publisher=Sofia News Agency|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhelev Peak]] on [[Loubet Coast]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Zhelyu Zhelev for his support for the Bulgarian Antarctic programme.

== Family ==
He was married to Maria Zheleva and has two daughters Yordanka (1963–1993) and Stanka (born 1966).
Zhelev has two grandchildren from his daughter Stanka.{{citationneeded|date=February 2017}}
