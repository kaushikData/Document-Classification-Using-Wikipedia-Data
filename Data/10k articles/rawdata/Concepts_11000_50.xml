      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30851">The '''Akaike information criterion''' ('''AIC''') is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].

AIC is founded on [[information theory]]. When a statistical model is used to represent the process that generated the data, the model will almost never be exact; so some information will be lost by using the model to represent the process. AIC estimates the relative information lost by a given model: the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. (In making an estimate of the information lost, AIC deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

The Akaike information criterion  is named after the statistician [[Hirotugu Akaike]], who formulated it. It now forms the basis of a paradigm for the [[foundations of statistics]]; as well, it is widely used for [[statistical inference]].

==Definition==
Suppose that we have a [[statistical model]] of some data. Let {{math|''k''}} be the number of estimated [[Statistical parameter|parameters]] in the model. Let &lt;math&gt;\hat L&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum value of the [[likelihood function]] for the model. Then the AIC value of the model is the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akaiki1974" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AIC} \, = \, 2k - 2\ln(\hat L)&lt;/math&gt;

Given a set of candidate models for the data, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value. Thus, AIC rewards [[goodness of fit]] (as assessed by the likelihood function), but it also includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages [[overfitting]], because increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always improves the goodness of the fit.

AIC is founded in [[information theory]]. Suppose that the data is generated by some unknown process ''f''. We consider two candidate models to represent ''f'': ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If we knew ''f'', then we could find the information lost from using ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''f'' by calculating the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], {{Nowrap|''D''&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&amp;thinsp;‖&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}; similarly, the information lost from using ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''f'' could be found by calculating {{Nowrap|''D''&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&amp;thinsp;‖&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. We would then choose the candidate model that minimized the information loss.

We cannot choose with certainty, because we do not know ''f''. {{Harvtxt|Akaike|1974}} showed, however, that we can estimate, via AIC, how much more (or less) information is lost by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; than by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The estimate, though, is only valid [[Asymptotic theory (statistics)|asymptotically]]; if the number of data points is small, then some correction is often necessary (see AICc, below).

Note that AIC does not provide a test of a model in the sense of testing a [[null hypothesis]]. It tells nothing about the absolute quality of a model, only the quality relative to other models. Thus, if all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that.

==How to apply AIC in practice==
To apply AIC in practice, we start with a set of candidate models, and then find the models' corresponding AIC values. There will almost always be information lost due to using a candidate model to represent the "true model" (i.e. the process that generated the data). We wish to select, from among the candidate models, the model that minimizes the information loss. We cannot choose with certainty, but we can minimize the estimated information loss.

Suppose that there are ''R'' candidate models. Denote the AIC values of those models by AIC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, AIC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AIC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, AIC&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; be the minimum of those values. Then the quantity exp((AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;AIC&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2) can be interpreted  as being proportional to the probability that the ''i''th model minimizes the (estimated) information loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.9.1, §6.4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, suppose that there are three candidate models, whose AIC values are 100, 102, and 110. Then the second model is exp((100&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;102)/2) = 0.368 times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss. Similarly, the third model is exp((100&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;110)/2) = 0.007 times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss.

In this example, we would omit the third model from further consideration. We then have three options: (1) gather more data, in the hope that this will allow clearly distinguishing between the first two models; (2) simply conclude that the data is insufficient to support selecting one model from among the first two; (3) take a weighted average of the first two models, with weights proportional to 1 and 0.368, respectively, and then do [[statistical inference]] based on the weighted multimodel.&lt;ref name="Burnham 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity exp((AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;AIC&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2) is known as the ''[[Likelihood function#Relative likelihood|relative likelihood]]'' of model ''i''. It is closely related to the likelihood ratio used in the [[likelihood-ratio test]]. Indeed, if all the models in the candidate set have the same number of parameters, then using AIC might at first appear to be very similar to using the likelihood-ratio test. There are, however, important distinctions. In particular, the likelihood-ratio test is valid only for [[Statistical model#Nested models|nested models]], whereas AIC (and AICc) has no such restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.12.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murtaugh|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AICc==
When the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] size is small, there is a substantial probability that AIC will select models that have too many parameters, i.e. that AIC will overfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McQuarrie|Tsai|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claeskens|Hjort|2008|loc= §8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giraud|2015|loc= §2.9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address such potential overfitting, AICc was developed: AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample sizes.

The formula for AICc depends upon the statistical model. Assuming that the model is [[univariate]], is linear in its parameters, and has normally-distributed [[Errors and residuals|residuals]] (conditional upon regressors), then the formula for AICc is as follows.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavanaugh|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AICc} \, = \, \mathrm{AIC} + \frac{2k^2 + 2k}{n - k - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

—where {{math|''n''}} denotes the sample size and {{math|''k''}} denotes the number of parameters. Thus, AICc is essentially AIC with an extra penalty term for the number of parameters. Note that as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}, the extra penalty term converges to 0, and thus AICc converges to AIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the assumption that the model is univariate and linear with normal residuals does not hold, then the formula for AICc will generally be different from the formula above. For some models, the formula can be difficult to determine. For every model that has AICc available, though, the formula for AICc is given by AIC plus terms that includes both {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In comparison, the formula for AIC includes {{math|''k''}} but not {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, AIC is a [[First order approximation|first-order estimate]] (of the information loss), whereas AICc is a [[Second order approximation|second-order estimate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §7.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further discussion of the formula, with examples of other assumptions, is given by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= ch. 7}} and by {{Harvtxt|Konishi|Kitagawa|2008|loc= ch. 7–8}}. In particular, with other assumptions, [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap estimation]] of the formula is often feasible.

To summarize, AICc has the advantage of tending to be more accurate than AIC (especially for small samples), but AICc also has the disadvantage of sometimes being much more difficult to compute than AIC. Note that if all the candidate models have the same {{math|''k''}} and the same formula for AICc, then AICc and AIC will give identical (relative) valuations; hence, there will be no disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc. Furthermore, if {{math|''n''}} is many times larger than {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the extra penalty term will be negligible; hence, the disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc, will be negligible.

==History==
[[File:Akaike.jpg|thumb|[[Hirotugu Akaike]]]]
The Akaike information criterion was formulated by the statistician [[Hirotugu Akaike]]; it was originally named "an information criterion". It was first announced by Akaike at a 1971 symposium, the proceedings of which were published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akaike|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1973 publication, though, was only an informal presentation of the concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|deLeeuw|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first formal publication was a 1974 paper by Akaike.&lt;ref name="Akaiki1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Akaike|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2014|October}}, the 1974 paper had received more than 14000 citations in the [[Web of Science]]: making it the 73rd most-cited research paper of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Van Noordon R., Maher B., Nuzzo R. (2014), "[http://www.nature.com/top100 The top 100 papers]", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, AIC has become common enough that it is often used without citing Akaike's 1974 paper. Indeed, there are over 150,000 scholarly articles/books that use AIC (as assessed by [[Google Scholar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=0&amp;q=Akaike+AIC&amp;as_sdt=1,5 Sources containing both "Akaike" and "AIC"]—at [[Google Scholar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial derivation of AIC relied upon some strong assumptions. {{Harvtxt|Takeuchi|1976}} showed that the assumptions could be made much weaker. Takeuchi's work, however, was in Japanese and was not widely known outside Japan for many years.

AICc was originally proposed for [[linear regression]] (only) by {{Harvtxt|Sugiura|1978}}. That instigated the work of {{Harvtxt|Hurvich|Tsai|1989}}, and several further papers by the same authors, which extended the situations in which AICc could be applied.

The first general exposition of the information-theoretic approach was the volume by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002}}. It includes an English presentation of the work of Takeuchi. The volume led to far greater use of AIC, and it now has more than 42000 citations on [[Google Scholar]].

Akaike called his approach an "entropy maximization principle", because the approach is founded on the concept of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy in information theory]]. Indeed, minimizing AIC in a statistical model is effectively equivalent to maximizing entropy in a thermodynamic system; in other words, the information-theoretic approach in statistics is essentially applying the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. As such, AIC has roots in the work of  [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] on [[entropy]]. For more on these issues, see {{Harvtxt|Akaike|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;2}}.

==Usage tips==

===Counting parameters===
A [[statistical model]] must fit all the data points. Thus, a straight line, on its own, is not a model of the data, unless all the data points lie exactly on the line. We can, however, choose a model that is "a straight line plus noise"; such a model might be formally described thus:
''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] from the straight line fit. If the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are assumed to be [[i.i.d.]] [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] (with zero mean), then the model has three parameters:
''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the variance of the Gaussian distributions.
Thus, when calculating the AIC value of this model, we should use ''k''=3. More generally, for any [[least squares]] model with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals, the variance of the residuals' distributions should be counted as one of the parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, consider a first-order [[autoregressive model]], defined by
''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''c''&amp;nbsp;+ ''φx''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; being i.i.d. Gaussian (with zero mean). For this model, there are three parameters: ''c'', ''φ'', and the variance of the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally, a ''p''th-order autoregressive model has ''p''&amp;#8239;+&amp;thinsp;2 parameters. (If, however, ''c'' is not estimated from the data, but instead given in advance, then there are only ''p''&amp;#8239;+&amp;thinsp;1 parameters.)

===Transforming data===
The AIC values of the candidate models must all be computed with the same data set. Sometimes, though, we might want to compare a model of the [[Dependent and independent variables|response variable]], {{math|''y''}}, with a model of the logarithm of the response variable, {{math|log(''y'')}}. More generally, we might want to compare a model of the data with a model of transformed data. Following is an illustration of how to deal with data transforms (adapted from {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §2.11.3}}: "Investigators should be sure that all hypotheses are modeled using the same response variable").

Suppose that we want to compare two models: one with a [[normal distribution]] of {{math|''y''}} and one with a normal distribution of {{math|log(''y'')}}. We should ''not'' directly compare the AIC values of the two models. Instead, we should transform the normal [[cumulative distribution function]] to first take the logarithm of {{math|''y''}}. To do that, we need to perform the relevant [[integration by substitution]]: thus, we need to multiply by the derivative of the [[Natural logarithm|(natural) logarithm]] function, which is {{math|1/''y''}}. Hence, the transformed distribution has the following [[probability density function]]:
: &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \, \frac{1}{y} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\,\exp \left(-\frac{\left(\ln y-\mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
—which is the probability density function for the [[log-normal distribution]]. We then compare the AIC value of the normal model against the AIC value of the log-normal model.

===Software unreliability===
Some statistical software will report the value of AIC or the maximum value of the log-likelihood function, but the reported values are not always correct.
Typically, any incorrectness is due to a constant in the log-likelihood function being omitted. For example,
the log-likelihood function for {{math|''n''}} [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] identical [[normal distribution]]s is
: &lt;math&gt;
   \ln\mathcal{L}(\mu,\sigma^2)
    \, = \, -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln\sigma^2 - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\mu)^2
  &lt;/math&gt;
—this is the function that is maximized, when obtaining the value of AIC. Some software, however, omits the constant term {{math|(''n''/2){{resize|20%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(2''π'')}}, and so reports erroneous values for the log-likelihood maximum—and thus for AIC. Such errors do not matter for AIC-based comparisons, ''if'' all the models have their [[Errors and residuals|residuals]] as normally-distributed: because then the errors cancel out. In general, however, the constant term needs to be included in the log-likelihood function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= p. 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, before using software to calculate AIC, it is generally good practice to run some simple tests on the software, to ensure that the function values are correct.

==Comparisons with other model selection methods==

===Comparison with BIC===

The formula for the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC) is similar to the formula for AIC, but with a different penalty for the number of parameters. With AIC the penalty is {{math|2''k''}}, whereas with BIC the penalty is {{math|ln(''n''){{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}''k''}}.

A comparison of AIC/AICc and BIC is given by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§6.3-6.4}}, with follow-up remarks by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2004}}. The authors show that AIC/AICc can be derived in the same Bayesian framework as BIC, just by using different [[Prior probability|prior probabilities]]. In the Bayesian derivation of BIC, though, each candidate model has a prior probability of 1/''R'' (where ''R'' is the number of candidate models); such a derivation is "not sensible", because the prior should be a decreasing function of {{math|''k''}}. Additionally, the authors present a few simulation studies that suggest AICc tends to have practical/performance advantages over BIC.

A point made by several researchers is that AIC and BIC are appropriate for different tasks. In particular, BIC is argued to be appropriate for selecting the "true model" (i.e. the process that generated the data) from the set of candidate models, whereas AIC is not appropriate. To be specific, if the "true model" is in the set of candidates, then BIC will select the "true model" with probability 1, as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}; in contrast, when selection is done via AIC, the probability can be less than 1.&lt;ref name="BA6364"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§6.3-6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vrieze"&gt;{{Harvnb| Vrieze|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahoetal"&gt;{{Harvnb| Aho| Derryberry |Peterson| |2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of AIC argue that this issue is negligible, because the "true model" is virtually never in the candidate set. Indeed, it is a common aphorism in statistics that "[[all models are wrong]]"; hence the "true model" (i.e. reality) cannot be in the candidate set.

Another comparison of AIC and BIC is given by {{Harvtxt| Vrieze|2012}}. Vrieze presents a simulation study—which allows the "true model" to be in the candidate set (unlike with virtually all real data). The simulation study demonstrates, in particular, that AIC sometimes selects a much better model than BIC even when the "true model" is in the candidate set. The reason is that, for finite {{math|''n''}}, BIC can have a substantial risk of selecting a very bad model from the candidate set. This reason can arise even when {{math|''n''}} is much larger than {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With AIC, the risk of selecting a very bad model is minimized.

If the "true model" is not in the candidate set, then the most that we can hope to do is select the model that best approximates the "true model". AIC is appropriate for finding the best approximating model, under certain assumptions.&lt;ref name="BA6364" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vrieze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahoetal" /&gt;  (Those assumptions include, in particular, that the approximating is done with regard to information loss.)

Comparison of AIC and BIC in the context of [[regression analysis|regression]] is given by {{Harvtxt|Yang|2005}}. In regression, AIC is asymptotically optimal for selecting the model with the least [[mean squared error]], under the assumption that the "true model" is not in the candidate set. BIC is not asymptotically optimal under the assumption. Yang additionally shows that the rate at which AIC converges to the optimum is, in a certain sense, the best possible.

===Comparison with cross-validation===
Leave-one-out [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] is asymptotically equivalent to AIC, for ordinary linear regression models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotic equivalence to AIC also holds for [[Mixed model|mixed-effects models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fang|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with least squares===

Sometimes, each candidate model assumes that the residuals are distributed according to independent identical normal distributions (with zero mean). That gives rise to [[least squares]] model fitting.

With least squares fitting, the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood estimate]] for the variance of a model's residuals distributions is &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2 = \mathrm{RSS}/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RSS}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[residual sum of squares]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathrm{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-f(x_i;\hat{\theta}))^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the maximum value of a model's log-likelihood function is 
: &lt;math&gt;
 -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln(\hat\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\hat\sigma^2}\mathrm{RSS}  
\, = \, - \frac{n}{2}\ln(\mathrm{RSS}/n) + C_1
  &lt;/math&gt;
—where {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant independent of the model, and dependent only on the particular data points, i.e. it does not change if the data does not change.

That gives AIC&amp;nbsp;= {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS/''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; 2''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}} 2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS)&amp;nbsp;+ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only differences in AIC are meaningful, the constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be ignored, which allows us to conveniently take AIC&amp;nbsp;= {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS)}} for model comparisons. Note that if all the models have the same {{math|''k''}}, then selecting the model with minimum AIC is equivalent to selecting the model with minimum {{math|RSS}}—which is the usual objective of model selection based on least squares.

'''Atmatusti''' is translated into English as being “what is pleasing to one's self” &lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. ''The Law Code of Manu''. 2.6.&lt;/ref&gt; – it is important to recognize "what is pleasing to one's self, oneself is not equal one's self", for without knowing one's self one cannot know what is pleasing to self. For instance, editing this Wikipedia line is pleasing to me, I'm self, re-editing it and leaving it to the prior state is also pleasing to me, thus only one who knows one's self must edit, all others are not following Atmatusti, thus Atmatusti is not meant for those who do not know one's self, taking oneself to be one's self is the root of all misery. Other scholars have also used different terms to describe atmatusti.  For example, Derrett’s translation from French to English of Lingat’s ‘‘The Classical Law of India’’ has coined the term “inner contentment” in reference to atmatusti. Lingat states that inner contentment can be best understood as "the approval of one's conscious".&lt;ref name="Lingat, Robert 1973. pp. 6"&gt;Lingat, Robert. 1973. Ch. 1, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only Manu and Yājñavalkya refer to atmatusti as the fourth source of [[dharma]] within the [[Hindu Law]] tradition. Scholars reject atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma because of this.  Textual accounts of Manu's and Yajnavalkya's placement of atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma can be found in The Law Code of Manu 2.6 and The Law Code of Yajnavalkya 1.7.  Also, atmatusti does not share the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara.  Atmatusti differs significantly from the other three sources of dharma in that it is not based on an "authority exterior to man"; in other words, an individual is able to create their own authority for any issue not covered under sruti, smriti, and acara.&lt;ref name="Lingat, Robert 1973. pp. 6" /&gt;  The first three sources of law are rooted in the vedas whereas atmatusti is not.  It is because of this that atmatusti, as a fourth source, is not recognized by most scholars due to the lack of legitimacy.

==Sources of Dharma==

#Veda ([[śruti]])
#Tradition ([[smṛti]])
#Good Custom ([[ācāra]])
#Inner Contentment (ātmatuṣṭi)

==Textual Accounts==

There are only two instances where Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source of dharma within the [[dharmasastras]].

The first instance comes from The Law Code of Manu or Manava Dharmasastra (MDh).  The [[Laws of Manu]] are commentaries on the dharmasastras by a sage named Manu and therefore is considered apart of [[smriti]].  Because of this, The Law Code of Manu has a great amount of authority.  However, Manu’s view of Atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma seemingly was not shared universally with other sages; except a sage named Yajnavalkya.  This is understood through the lack of other smriti texts or dharmasastra commentaries in which Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source.  Manu lists atmatusti along with sruti, smriti, and acara as being “the four visible marks of the law”.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. ''The Law Code of Manu''. 2.12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manu's use of the phrase "the four visible marks of law", however, is not explained in relation to atmatusti legitimately being a fourth source of dharma.  The significance here is therefore based interpretation.  The first textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma is as follows:

:"The root of the Law is the entire Veda; the tradition and practice of those who know the Veda; the conduct of good people; and what is pleasing to oneself." (MDh 2.6)&lt;ref name="Davis pp. 6"&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. ''The Spirit of Hindu Law''. Ch. 1, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second instance comes from The Law Code of Yajnavalkya (YDh).  Here Yajnavalkya, in addition to listing Atmatusti as a fourth source, also lists a fifth source of dharma: "the desire born of proper intention".  However, Yajnavalkya is the only person to list this fifth source; therefore, its recognition among scholars is almost non-existent.  The lack of support within the dharmasastras as a whole shows that the Hindu community, for the most part, did not find Yajnavalkya's fifth source of dharma correctly listed or legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. ''The Spirit of Hindu Law''. Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma along with the listing of a fifth source is as follows:

:"The Veda, tradition, the standards of the good, what is pleasant to one’s own self, [and] the desire born of proper intention—these are the roots of dharma." (YDh 1.7)&lt;ref name="Davis pp. 6" /&gt;

==Role of Atmatusti within Hindu Law==

The appointment of atmatusti as a fourth source can be understood by looking at the hierarchy of the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Lingat, Robert. 1973. Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authority of each source is outlined along with the authoritative relationship the sources have on one another.  Sruti, the first source, is superior and has more authority than Smriti and Acara.  Smriti, the second source, in turn has authority over Acara, the third source.  This is understandable in that the vedic texts are superior to tradition.  Hence, it is only when the vedic texts do not provide the necessary dharma needed; will tradition or the secondary vedic texts be sought out.  And, only when tradition does not provide the dharma on a specific topic should customary laws be looked into.  Therefore, Manu appoints atmatusti as a last resort and fourth source of dharma for instances where the vedas, tradition, and customs all do not provide the necessary dharma or law.

Atmatusti creates a guide in which a person does not obey laws because it is what they were told to do, but because the person has reverence for the law. It can be used to do what is a right in the context of legal manners, but it is generally not viewed as a moral compass that believers should follow. However, the legal aims of atmatusti are usually consistent with the Veda, seeing as the person's inner-self is partly built on by the individual's education. Therefore, the atmatusti is closely connected with a more highly acknowledged source of [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Donald R. 2007. “On Atmatusti as a Source of Dharma.” Journal of the American Oriental Society: 294-295. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials, EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mimamsa vs. Atmatusti==

“When the Mimamsa method came to be applied to the texts of the smrti it left very little room for atmatusti. ([Lingat] 1973:6)”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jr. Donald R. 2007. pp. 51-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mouth of Truth''' ({{lang-it|Bocca della Verità}} {{IPA-it|ˈbokka della veriˈta|}}) is a marble mask in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], which stands against the left wall of the portico of the [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] church, at the Piazza della Bocca della Verità, the site of the ancient [[Forum Boarium]] (the ancient cattle market). It attracts visitors who audaciously stick their hand in the mouth.

The massive marble mask weighs about 1300&amp;nbsp;kg and probably depicts the face of the sea god [[Oceanus]]. The eyes, nostrils and mouth are open.  Historians aren't quite certain what the original purpose of the disc was. It was possibly used as a drain cover in the nearby [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], which had an oculus—a round open space in the middle of the roof, similar to that of the Pantheon. Hence, it could rain inside. It is also thought that cattle merchants used it to drain the blood of cattle sacrificed to the god Hercules. In the thirteenth century the disc was probably removed from the temple and placed against the wall of the Santa Maria in Cosmedin. In the seventeenth century it eventually moved to its current location inside the portico of the church.

The Mouth of Truth is now known mostly from its appearance in the 1953 film ''[[Roman Holiday]]''. The film also uses the Mouth of Truth as a storytelling device since both Hepburn's and Peck's characters are not initially truthful with each other.
In ''Het geheim van de afgebeten vingers'' by Dutch writer [[Rindert Kromhout]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boekblad.nl/de-eerste-beursdag-in-turijn.114466.lynkx|title=De eerste beursdag in Turijn|last=Telkers|first=Anne|date=18 May 2001|work=Boekblad|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fingers of lying children are cut off by a skeleton with a scythe who lives in the [[Capuchin Crypt]] in the [[Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini]].

There are a number of ''Bocca della Verità'' replicas and derivative works. A full-size reproduction sits in the [[Alta Vista Gardens]] in California and one of [[Jules Blanchard]]'s sculptures in the [[Luxembourg Garden]] in Paris depicts a woman with her hand in the sculpture's mouth. Coin-operated [[fortune teller machine]]s have been developed and installed in different parts of the world, including one on display in the [[Musee Mecanique]].&lt;ref name=dps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpsusa.com/bocca_verita_history.shtml#deity |title=BOCCA DELLA VERITA' facts and history |publisher=Dpsusa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Old and in the way / The Musee Mecanique will soon be history|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Old-and-in-the-way-The-Musee-Mecanique-will-2868971.php#photo-2233497|date=27 February 2002|last=Nolte|first=Carl|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mouth of Truth has also been featured as a theme in historical European art. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a German painter during the Renaissance period, created two paintings depicting a woman placing her hand in the mouth of a statue of a lion while onlookers watched, a subject which was drawn by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and made into a woodcut by the Dutch printmaker [[Lucas van Leyden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property From An Important European Private Collection - Lucas Cranach the Elder|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/old-master-british-paintings-evening-sale-l15033/lot.8.html|website=sothebys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mouth of Truth is referenced in one chapter of [[Devil Lady|Devilman Lady]], by a Devil Beast known as Mita, who utters its Italian name alongside an illustration of the Mouth, before transforming into a spider-like creature with a mouth full of fangs on its back, which rapidly descends and bites off the top of the head of its victims before they can react.

The Mouth of Truth is depicted as a teacher in the japanese manga Shishunki Renaissance David-kun, the teacher uses his mouth to verify if students are telling the truth or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5636">The '''Clausius–Mossotti relation''' expresses the [[dielectric constant]] (relative [[permittivity]], ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) of a material in terms of the atomic polarizibility, α, of the material's constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is named after [[Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]]. It is equivalent to the  [[Lorentz–Lorenz equation]]. It may be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rysselberghe|first=P. V.|title=Remarks concerning the Clausius–Mossotti Law|journal=J. Phys. Chem.|date=January 1932|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1152–1155|doi=10.1021/j150334a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;{{cite book|title=Atkins' Physical Chemistry|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-954337-3|pages=622–629|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter|last2=de Paula|first2=Julio|chapter=Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} - 1}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} + 2}   = \frac{N \alpha}{3\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r = \epsilon/\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dielectric constant]] of the material
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]]
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of the molecules (number per cubic meter), and
*&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electric susceptibility#Molecular polarizability|molecular polarizability]] in SI-units (C·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V).

In the case that the material consists of a mixture of two or more species, the right hand side of the above equation would consist of the sum of the molecular polarizability contribution from each species,  indexed by ''i'' in the following form: (see Lorrain and Corson - Electromagnetic Field and Waves, 1962, 2nd Edition, page 116)

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} - 1}{\epsilon_\mathrm{r} + 2}   = \sum_i \frac{N_i \alpha_i}{3\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]] the Clausius–Mossotti relation is typically rewritten to show the [[Polarizability#Definition|molecular polarizability ''volume'']] &lt;math&gt;\alpha' = \alpha/(4\pi\varepsilon_0)&lt;/math&gt; which has units of volume (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt; Confusion may arise from the practice of using the shorter name "molecular polarizability" for both &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; within literature intended for the respective unit system.

==Lorentz–Lorenz equation==
The '''Lorentz–Lorenz equation''' is similar to the Clausius–Mossotti relation, except that it relates the [[refractive index]] (rather than the [[dielectric constant]]) of a substance to its [[polarizability]]. The Lorentz–Lorenz equation is named after the Danish mathematician and scientist [[Ludvig Lorenz]], who published it in 1869, and the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], who discovered it independently in 1878.

The most general form of the Lorentz–Lorenz equation is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} = \frac{4 \pi}{3} N \alpha_\mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]], &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules per unit volume, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean [[polarizability]]. 
This equation is approximately valid for homogeneous solids as well as liquids and gases.

When the square of the refractive index is &lt;math&gt; n^2 \approx 1 &lt;/math&gt;, as it is for many gases, the equation reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt; n^2 - 1 \approx 4 \pi N \alpha_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;
or simply
:&lt;math&gt; n - 1 \approx 2 \pi N \alpha_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

This applies to gases at ordinary pressures. The refractive index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the gas can then be expressed in terms of the [[molar refractivity]]  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;  n \approx \sqrt{1 + \frac{3 A p}{R T}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure of the gas, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the (absolute) temperature, which together determine the number density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

'''David Held''' (born 1951) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political scientist]] specialising in [[political theory]] and [[international relations]]. He currently holds a joint appointment as Professor of Politics and International Relations, and Master of [[University College, Durham|University College]], at [[Durham University]]. He is also a visiting Professor of Political Science at [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]]. Previously he was the [[Graham Wallas]] chair of Political Science and the co-director of the Centre for the Study of Global Governance at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Vasagar"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/oct/31/saif-gaddafi-lse-academic | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jeevan | last=Vasagar | title=Academic linked to Gaddafi's fugitive son leaves LSE | date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Daniele Archibugi]], Held has been prominent in the development of [[cosmopolitanism]], and of [[cosmopolitan democracy]] in particular. He has been an active scholar on issues of [[globalisation]], [[global governance]] and is joint editor-in-chief of the academic journal ''[[Global Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Editorial Board | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291758-5899/homepage/EditorialBoard.html | website = onlinelibrary.wiley.com | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | access-date = 20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
David Held was born in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] where he spent most of his childhood. He was educated in Britain, [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Upon completing his doctoral studies at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] he conducted post-doctoral research at [[Cambridge University]]. He has held numerous Visiting Appointments in the United States, [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], among other places.

David Held co-founded [[Polity (publisher)|Polity press]] in 1984, which has become a leading publisher in the social sciences and humanities across the world. He is also the General Editor for ''[[Global Policy]]'', an academic journal started in 2008 that focuses on bridging the gap between academics and practitioners on issues of global significance.

In January 2012, he succeeded Professor [[Maurice Tucker]] as Master of [[University College, Durham]], alongside his chair in the School of Government and International Affairs at [[Durham University]].&lt;ref name="palatinate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=16306|work=Palatinate|last=Jonhson|first=Daniel|date=2 November 2011|title=Former LSE academic linked to Gaddafi’s son made new Castle Master}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research== 
Since his first book was published in 1980 (''Introduction to Critical Theory''), David Held has been pursuing a multilevel inquiry into the nature and changing form of national and international politics. This approach has involved three kinds of work. First, it has involved extensive empirical enquiry into the dynamic character, structural elements and governance failures of contemporary society. The empirical dimensions of his work have included books such as ''Global Transformations'' (1999), ''Globalization/Anti-globalization'' (2007), ''Global Inequality'' (2007) and ''Gridlock: Why Global Cooperation is Failing When We Need it Most'' (2013). These books map the changing global context of politics, how the world has become increasingly interconnected, and how failures of leadership and negotiation at the global level are creating a breakdown of multilateralism and global governance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Second, he has been investigating the changing nature and form of the modern state and the locus of the political good. Held examines the question of whether the nation state alone, as typically assumed by political theory, can be the sole home of democracy, accountability and the rule of law. This has entailed a critical evaluation of the concepts of democracy, sovereignty, governance and cosmopolitanism, among other concepts. Books that have explored these themes include: ''Democracy in the Global Order'' (1999), ''Models of Democracy'' (2006), ''Cosmopolitanism: ideals and realities'' (2010). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The third element of Prof. Held’s current work is to explore how and in what ways one can move beyond the crises and dilemmas of politics and governance in the contemporary world. Books such as ''Global Covenant'' (2004), ''Debating Globalization'' (2005) and a wide range of academic articles set out the contours of a multiactor, multilevel democratic politics framed by the fundamental principles of democracy, justice and sustainability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Accordingly, Held’s work explores, on the one hand, the shift in politics from nation states to what he calls a world of ‘overlapping communities of fate' (where the fortunes of countries are increasingly enmeshed) and, on the other hand, how democratic standards and cosmopolitan values can be entrenched in the global order. In pursuing this multilevel approach Prof. Held sees himself working within the classic tradition of political theory which has always been concerned with how to characterize the world in which we live, how to develop and reach normative goals such as liberty, democracy and social justice, and how to move from where we are to where we might like to be. Prof. Held’s response to this challenge is to explore the way globalization has altered the landscape of politics{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, how cosmopolitanism provides ideals that enable one to rethink politics and the political good, and to pursue political stepping stones that could help embed this agenda. He offers a contribution to a pressing dialogue of our times: how to resolve collective action problems, nationally and globally, through institutions and governance arrangements that enhance democracy, social justice and the participation of all citizens in a democratic public life.

According to [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his 2008 book ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', "The runaway would be beaten, and salt pickle, lime juice, and [[bird pepper]] would be rubbed into his or her open wounds. Another slave would defecate into the mouth of the miscreant, who would then be gagged for four to five hours."&lt;ref name=Gladwell&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Gladwell |year=2008 |title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]] |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=282 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-316-01792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment was invented by [[Thomas Thistlewood]], a slave overseer and named for the slave, Derby, who was made to undergo this punishment when he was caught eating young sugar cane stalks in the field on 25 May 1756.

{{Violence against women}}
'''Dowry deaths''' are deaths of  women who are [[murder]]ed or driven to [[suicide]] by continuous harassment and torture by husbands and in-laws in an effort to extort an increased [[dowry]].

Dowry deaths are found predominantly in India,&lt;ref name=india/&gt; Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-003-2014 PAKISTAN: The social injustice behind the practice of dowry-when greed dictates society] Asian Human Rights Commission (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=UNBangladeshDowry/&gt; and Iran.&lt;ref name=iranpbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/selected-headlines-202.html Isfahan man kills daughter over inability to pay dowry] Public Broadcasting Service, Washington DC (August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiani 2014"&gt;Kiani et al.

Adjusted for population, Pakistan, with 2,000 reported such deaths per year, has the highest rate of dowry death at 2.45 per 100,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;Subhani, D., Imtiaz, M., &amp; Afza, S.

Dowry death is considered one of the many categories of [[violence against women]], alongside [[rape]], [[bride burning]], [[eve teasing]], and [[acid throwing]].

==India==
{{Further|Dowry system in India}}Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting her on fire by her husband or inlaws ; this is known as "[[bride burning]]", and sometimes disguised as suicide or accident. Death by burning of Indian women have been more frequently attributed to dowry conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Virendra|title=Burnt wives|journal=Burns|date=Feb 2003|volume=29|issue=1|pages=31–36|doi=10.1016/s0305-4179(02)00235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dowry deaths, the groom's family is the perpetrator of murder or suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenburg, V. T. (2002). Dowry murder: The imperial origins of a cultural crime. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

India has by far the highest number of dowry related deaths in the world according to Indian National Crime Record Bureau. In 2012, 18,233 dowry death cases were reported across India.&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite web

Dowry deaths in India is not limited to any specific religion. The ratio of dowry deaths are about the same as the ratio of population in India by religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Waheed | first = Abdul | title = Dowry among Indian muslims: ideals and practices | journal =  [[Indian Journal of Gender Studies]] | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/097152150801600103 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/097152150801600103 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, A.

===Prohibition===
The ''[[Dowry Prohibition Act]]'' of 1961 prohibits the request, payment or acceptance of a dowry, "as consideration for the marriage", where "dowry" is defined as a gift demanded or given as a precondition for a marriage. Gifts given without a precondition are not considered dowry, and are legal. Asking or giving of dowry can be punished by an imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine of up to {{INRConvert|5000|to=USD GBP AUD}}. It replaced several pieces of anti-dowry legislation that had been enacted by various Indian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/rsPaging.asp?tfnm=196128&amp;Page=1|title=Section 1-4, Dowry Act|author=|date=|website=indiacode.nic.in|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder and suicide under compulsion are addressed by India's criminal penal code.

Indian women's rights activists campaigned for more than 40 years for laws to contain dowry deaths, such as the ''Dowry Prohibition Act'' 1961 and the more stringent [[Dowry law in India#IPC Section 498A|Section 498a of Indian Penal Code]] (enacted in 1983). Under the ''[[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005]]'' (PWDVA), a woman can put a stop to the dowry harassment by approaching a domestic violence protection officer.

Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Practical Steps towards Eliminating Dowry and Bride-Burning in India|last = Manchandia|first = Purna|journal = Tul.

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan, the giving and expectation of a dowry (called ''Jahez'') is part of the culture, with over 95% of marriages in every region of Pakistan involving transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to a groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al.

There is some controversy on the dowry death rates in Pakistan. Some publications suggest Pakistan officials do not record dowry deaths, the death rates are culturally under-reported and may be significantly higher. For example, Nasrullah reports total average annual stove burn rates of 33 per 100,000 women in Pakistan, of which 49% were intentional, or an average annual rate of about 16 per 100,000 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nasrullah | first1 =  | last2 = Muazzam | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = Newspaper reports: a source of surveillance for burns among women in Pakistan | url = | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 245–249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/021027/pakistans-fiery-shame-women-die-stove-deaths#.UiTpaeC5N5g Juliette Terzieff (October 27, 2002) "Pakistan's Fiery Shame: Women Die in Stove Deaths"] ''[[WeNews]]'', New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = B.

Pakistan's ''Dowry and Marriage Gifts (Restriction) Bill'', 2008, restricts dowry to PKR 30,000 (~US$300) while the total value of bridal gifts is limited to PKR 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/09-Jun-2013/done-to-a-daughter-over-dowry  Ashraf Javed (June 9, 2013) "Done to a daughter over dowry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901083633/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/09-Jun-2013/done-to-a-daughter-over-dowry |date=2013-09-01 }}, ''The Nation'' (Pakistan)&lt;/ref&gt; The law made demands for a dowry by the groom's family illegal, as well as public display of dowry before or during the wedding. However, this and similar anti-dowry laws of 1967, 1976 and 1998, as well as ''Family Court Act'' of 1964 have proven to be unenforceable. Activists such as SACHET, Pakistan claim the police refuse to register and prosecute allegations of dowry-related domestic violence and fatal injuries.&lt;ref name=sachet/&gt;

Various military and democratically elected civil governments in Pakistan have tried to outlaw traditional display of dowry and expensive parties (''walima''). One such attempt was the Act of 1997, Ordinance (XV) of 1998 and Ordinance (III) of 1999. These were challenged in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The petitioner cited a number of [[hadith]]s under religious [[Sharia]] laws to demonstrate that Islam encouraged ''walima'' and related customary practices. The petitioner claimed that the Pakistan government's effort to enact these laws are against the injunctions of Islam. The Supreme Court ruled these laws and ordinances unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=sachet&gt;[http://www.sachet.org.pk/web/page.asp?id=293 (2006) Fight Against Dowry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108002609/http://www.sachet.org.pk/web/page.asp?id=293 |date=November 8, 2014 }}, SACHET (Pakistan); also see Dr. A.Q. Khan's July 2003 foreword on widespread Dowry problems to the Prime Minister of Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladesh==

In Bangladesh, dowry is called joutuk, and a significant cause of deaths as well. Between 0.6 and 2.8 brides per year per 100,000 women are reported to die because of dowry-related violence in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Shahnaz Huda (2006), [http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short Dowry in Bangladesh: Compromizing Women’s Rights], South Asia Research, November vol. 26 no. 3, pages 249-268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 Women’s Safety: Ghosts on the Prowl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109202405/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 |date=November 9, 2014 }} Mahfuzur Rahman, Dhaka Courier, January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of death include suicides, fire and other forms of domestic violence. In 2013, Bangladesh reported 4,470 women were victims of dowry-related violence over a 10-month period, or dowry violence victimized about 7.2 brides per year per 100,000 women in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=UNBangladeshDowry&gt;UN Women, [http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/Headquarters/Attachments/Sections/CSW/59/National_reviews/Bangladesh_review_Beijing20.pdf Bangladesh Report 2014 - Annexes] United Nations (May 2014), Table 6 page xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
Dowry is an ancient custom of Persia, and locally called ''jahâz'' (sometimes spelled ''jahiziyeh'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.steingass.125920 Steingass Persian-English], University of Chicago, See explanation for Jahiz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanpour.com/ Persian English Dictionary] see Dowry&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry-related violence and deaths in Iran are reported in Iranian newspapers, some of which appear in English media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6TxY3lsAL?url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/selected-headlines-202.html Isfahan man kills daughter over inability to pay dowry] Public Broadcasting Service, Washington DC (August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Kiani et al., in a 2014 study, report dowry deaths in Iran.&lt;ref name="Kiani 2014"/&gt;

==International efforts at eradication==
Reports of incidents of dowry deaths have attracted public interest and sparked a global activist movement seeking to end the practice. Of this activist community, the [[United Nations]] (UN) has played a pivotal role in combating violence against women, including dowry deaths.

===United Nations===
The United Nations has been an advocate for women's rights since its inception in 1945, explicitly stating so in its Charter's Preamble,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the United Nations: Preamble |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005192604/http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.html|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-09-04}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted in 1966), the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights |accessdate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114220/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also adopted in 1966) (these three documents are known collectively as the [[International Bill of Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Law|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012).

The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), though predominately focused on improving the quality of education available to children globally, has also taken a proactive stance against dowry death. On March 9 ([[International Women's Day]]), 2009, at a press conference in Washington D.C., UNICEF's Executive Director, Ann M. Veneman, publicly condemned dowry deaths and the legislative systems which allow the culprits to go unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of UNICEF Executive Director Ann M. Veneman on International Women's Day|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_35134.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, UNICEF launched its first Strategic Priority Action Plan for Gender Equality, which was followed by a second Action Plan in 2010. The aim of these plans has been to make gender equality a higher priority within all international UNICEF programs and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF Strategic Priority Action Plan for Gender Equality: 2010-2012|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private organizations===
[[Amnesty International]], in an effort to educate the public, has cited dowry deaths as a major contributor to global violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence Against Women Information|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in their annual human rights evaluations, Amnesty International criticizes India for the occurrences of dowry deaths as well as the impunity provided to its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/india|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] has also criticized the Indian government for its inability to make any progress towards eliminating dowry deaths and its lackluster performance for bringing its perpetrators to justice in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India: Disappointing Year for Human Rights|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/23/india-disappoint-year-human-rights|work=2012-09-04|publisher=Human Rights Watch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108100328/http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/23/india-disappoint-year-human-rights|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Global Fund for Women launched its "Now or Never" funding project. This campaign hopes to raise funds domestically and consequently finance the efforts of feminist organizations across the globe - including Indian women's rights activists. {{as of|2007}} the Now or Never fund has raised and distributed about $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Majesty Queen Noor and Nancy Pelosi Join GFW to Announce Endowment for the World's Women|url=http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/impact/media-center/news-releases/45/157|publisher=Global Fund For Women|accessdate=2012-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108092436/http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/impact/media-center/news-releases/45/157|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively smaller organization, V-Day, has dedicated itself to ending violence against women. By arranging events such as plays, art shows, and workshops in communities and college campuses across the United States, V-Day raises funds and educates the public on topics of gender-based violence including dowry death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dowry Deaths &amp; Bride Burning|url=http://www.vday.org/bride+death|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2012-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603074440/http://www.vday.org/bride+death|archivedate=2013-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-length plays on dowry deaths include 'The Bride Who Would Not Burn'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRejbq8dbs|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Felix Adler was born in [[Alzey]], [[Rhenish Hesse]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], the son of a rabbi, [[Samuel Adler (rabbi)|Samuel Adler]], a leading figure in European [[Reform Judaism]]. The family immigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Germany]] when Felix was six years old so that his father could accept the appointment as head [[rabbi]] at [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanu-El]] in New York.&lt;ref name=Radest&gt;{{cite book |first= Howard B. |last= Radest |year= 1969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2e8ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Felix+Adler%22+%22Toward+Common+Ground%3A+The+Story+of+the+Ethical+Societies%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Felix+Adler |title= Toward Common Ground: The Story of the Ethical Societies in the United States |series= Milestones of Thought in the History of Ideas |pages=14 &amp;c. |location= New York |publisher= [[Frederick Ungar Publishing Company|Fredrick Unger Pub. Co.]] |ref= {{SfnRef|Radest|1969}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler attended [[Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School|Columbia Grammar School]] and graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1870 with honors.  He continued at [[Heidelberg University]] where he studied as part of his training to become a rabbi. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from Heidelberg in 1873.&lt;ref name= "Credo"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Routledge]] | isbn = 9780415936729 | title = Encyclopedia of Ethics | chapter = Adler, Felix (1851-1933) | date = 2001 |via= [[Credo Reference]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Germany, he was strongly influenced by [[neo-Kantianism]], especially the notions that one cannot prove or disprove the existence of a deity or immortality, and that [[morality]] can be established independently of [[theology]].

== Academic career ==
When Adler returned to New York at the age of twenty-three, he was asked to give a sermon at Temple Emanu-El, where he was meant to follow in his father's footsteps as rabbi of the congregation. His sermon, "The Judaism of the Future", shocked the congregation, as he did not once mention [[God]].  Adler introduced his concept of Judaism as a universal religion of morality for all of mankind.  The sermon was his first and last at Temple Emanu-El.&lt;ref name=Radest/&gt;

In 1874, after it had become clear that he would not become a rabbi, members of his father's congregation helped Adler gain a teaching position at [[Cornell University]] as a nonresident Professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature.  He was popular with his students, with whom he discussed his novel religious ideas while illuminating contemporary labor struggles and power politics. He was attacked as an atheist for his views, and in 1876 Cornell declined to accept the grant that had paid Adler's salary.&lt;ref name=Radest/&gt; In 1902 Adler was given the chair of political and social ethics at Columbia University, where he taught until his death in 1933.

== New York Society of Ethical Culture ==
In 1876, Adler at age 26 was invited to give a lecture expanding upon his themes first presented in the sermon at Temple Emanu-El. On May 15, 1876 he reiterated the need for a religion, without the trappings of ritual or creed, that united all of mankind in moral social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This day, Mar 15, in Jewish history |url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/cjnconnect/blogs/article_057a78b4-3f44-5375-a20d-a850a62b2194.html |publisher=Cleveland Jewish News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519165352/http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/cjnconnect/blogs/article_057a78b4-3f44-5375-a20d-a850a62b2194.html |archivedate=May 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do away with theology and to unite [[theists]], [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and [[deists]], all in the same religious cause, was a revolutionary idea at the time.  A few weeks after the sermon, Adler started a series of weekly Sunday lectures. In February 1877, aided by  Joseph Seligman, president of Temple Emanu-El, Adler incorporated the Society of Ethical Culture.&lt;ref name=Radest/&gt;

Adler talked about "deed, not creed"; his belief was that good works were the basis of ethical culture. In 1877 the Society founded the District Nursing Department, which organized a team of nurses who visited the homebound sick in poor districts.&lt;ref name=Radest/&gt;  A year later, in 1878, the Society established a Free Kindergarten for working people's children.  Because it served the working poor, the kindergarten provided basic necessities for the children when needed, such as clothing and hot meals.&lt;ref name=Wollons&gt;{{cite book |first= Roberta |last= Wollons |year= 1990 |chapter= Women Educating Women: The Child Study Association as Women's Culture |title= Changing Education: Women as Radicals and Conservators |series= Suny Series in Constructive Postmodern Thought |editor-first1= Joyce |editor-last1= Antler |editor-first2= Sari Knopp |editor-last2= Biklen |location= Albany |publisher= [[State University of New York Press]] |pages= 51–68 |isbn= 9780791402337}}&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved over time into the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]].

Well known as a lecturer and writer, Adler served as rector for the Ethical Culture School until his death in 1933. Throughout his life, he always looked beyond the immediate concerns of family, labor, and race to the long-term challenge of reconstructing institutions, such as schools and government, to promote greater justice in human relations. Cooperation rather than competition was the higher social value. He gave a series of six lectures on "The Ethics of Marriage" for the [[Lowell Institute]]'s 1896–97 season.

Adler was the founding chairman of the [[National Child Labor Committee]] in 1904.  [[Lewis Hine]] was hired as the committee's photographer in 1908.  In 1917 Adler served on the Civil Liberties Bureau, which later became the American Civil Liberties Bureau and then the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU).  In 1928 he became president of the Eastern division of the [[American Philosophical Association]].  He served on the first Executive Board of the [[National Urban League]].

== Tenement house reform ==
As a member of the New York State Tenement House Commission, Adler was concerned not only with overcrowding but also by the increase in contagious disease caused by overcrowding. Though not a proponent of free public housing, Adler spoke out about [[tenement]] reform and the rents, which he considered exorbitant. [[Jacob Riis]] wrote that Adler had "clear incisive questions that went through all subterfuges to the root of things."

In 1885 Adler and others created the Tenement House Building Company in order to build "model" affordable tenements; they rented for $8–$14/month. By 1887 the company had completed six model buildings on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] for the sum of $155,000. Critics favored legislation and regulations to improve tenement conditions, but the model tenement was a progressive step.

== American foreign policy ==
By the late 1890s, with the increase in international conflicts, Adler switched his concern from domestic issues to the question of American foreign policy. While some contemporaries viewed the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]] as an act to liberate the [[Cuba]]ns from [[Spain|Spanish]] rule, others perceived the U.S. victories in the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Philippines]] as the beginning of an expansionist [[empire]]. Adler at first supported the war but later expressed concern about American sovereignty over the Philippines and [[Puerto Rico]].  He believed that an [[imperialism|imperialistic]] rather than a [[democracy|democratic]] goal was guiding [[Foreign relations of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]]. Ethical Culture affirms "the supreme worth of the person", and Adler superimposed this tenet on international relations, believing that no single group could lay claim to superior institutions and lifestyle.

Unlike many of his contemporaries during [[World War I]], Adler did not believe that the defeat of the [[German Empire]] would make the world safe for democracy. He thought peace depended on representative democratic governments being non-imperialistic and their curbing the [[arms race]]. He opposed the [[Versailles Treaty]] and the [[League of Nations]]. As an alternative, Adler proposed a "Parliament of Parliaments", elected by the legislative bodies of the different nations and representing  different classes of people, rather than special interests, so that common and not national differences would prevail.

== Philosophy ==

Adler developed an original philosophy with a foundation in those of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] that developed and transformed these roots. He considered philosophy not just a guide of life but key to improving society and the human condition appropriate to a respect for essential human dignity. Rejecting Kant's metaphysics he embraced his stress on the intrinsic worth and dignity of the person. Combining a supreme moral principle similar to Kant's with his own detailed ideas of self-realization, he emphasized free development of the individual in relation to societal concerns and fellowship. He preceded [[John Dewey]] in a concern for the "problems of men" instead of philosophical technicalities. While his ideas shared some aspects of [[pragmatism]] he was better described as "an ethical idealist with great practical reforming zeal" he promoted an idealist version of [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|moral perfectionism]]. He was however realistic and not sentimental acknowledging that man has done evil knowingly and deliberately.&lt;ref name= "Credo"/&gt;

Adler's ethics combined an appeal to universal principles with [[moral particularism]], which holds that the unique circumstances of a particular case must be carefully considered to determine the moral choice in that case. Adler believed that moral laws could not be applied in the same way to varied and unique individuals but that moral principles applied to all. He saw a need to balance essential general principles with consideration of the particular specific circumstances. He developed his own version of what he called Kant's "formula" which was, "Treat every [person] as a spiritual means to thine own spiritual end and conversely."&lt;ref name= "Credo"/&gt;

He proposed a "supreme ethical rule" which he stated as follows: "So act as to elicit the unique personality in others, and thereby in thyself", or "Act so as to elicit the best in others and thereby in thyself." He thought by doing so one would transcend both [[Egotism|egoism]] and [[altruism]]. His position was that virtue is and must be its own reward or else it is not really virtue. He characterized a virtuous act as one, "in which the ends of self and of the other are respected and promoted jointly", coordinating Kantian universalistic imperative ethics with a type of perfectionism. He took ethics seriously and felt it "must run like a golden thread through the whole of a [person's] life". He felt [[consequentialism]] particularly [[utilitarianism]] was inappropriate in ethics as it attempts to apply quantitative measures to something of a qualitative nature.&lt;ref name= "Credo"/&gt;

Adler's social philosophy opposed [[commercialism]]. He claimed, "The root disease that afflicts the world at the present day is the supremacy of the commercial point of view."&lt;ref name= "Credo"/&gt; His thought prized public works and the use of reason to develop ultimate ethical standards. Adler published such works as ''Creed and Deed'' (1878), ''Moral Instruction of Children'' (1892), ''Life and Destiny'' (1905), ''The Religion of Duty'' (1906), ''Essentials of Spirituality'' (1908), ''An Ethical Philosophy of Life'' (1918), ''The Reconstruction of the Spiritual Ideal'' (1925), and ''Our Part in this World.'' He made use of ideas from Judaism, as well as the philosophies of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], mixed with certain [[socialist]] ideas of his time. He believed that the concept of a "personal god" was unnecessary and thought that the human personality was the central force of religion.  He believed that different people's interpretations of religions were to be respected as religious in themselves. The [[Ethical Culture]] movement was open to people of diverse beliefs. Ethical Culture societies were formed in the late nineteenth century in numerous cities in the United States, for instance, Philadelphia and St. Louis.

It has been awarded consultative status with [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|ECOSOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/quienes-somos.html|title=Women in Equality Foundation|website=|publisher=Women in Equality Foundation|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation sets out to combat gender based violence and discrimination against women by promoting welfare, participation and empowerment in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/nuestros-temas.html|title=Mujeres en Igualdad. Nuestros Temas.|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception Women in Equality promoted the use of the [[Information and communications technology|new technologies]] intensively, being the first women´s NGO in Argentina to have a website.

{{quote|I had the privilege to accompany her in the creation of Mujeres en Igualdad in 1990, when the women´s movement set out to enact an electoral quota law: a tough goal to attain but which would ensure critical changes for women in the political field. Since then, we shared eight years of feminism, friendship and hard work, as well as the discovery of the digital world into which we dived with a passion, seeing how the networks that Zita had built from within the public sphere, grew, tied together, were enriched both in the way we communicated as well as on the issues we discussed.| Monique Thiteux-Altschul&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zita Montes de Oca: la funcionaria y la feminista=|url=http://www.apdh-argentina.org.ar/sites/default/files/Las%20conquistas%20de%20las%20mujeres.pdf|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Gender violence: "Seven voices against gender based violence" Project, coordinated by MEI and executed with the Office of Domestic Violence, the Office of Women in the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice, and the Women Judges Association of Argentina, with the Office of Victims against Violence of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, Vital Voices of Argentina and the Avon Foundation. With the support of International Avon Foundation and Vital Voices Partnership.

* Gender and sports: Mujeres en Igualdad has developed a team specially devoted to reverse cases of discrimination in sports. In 2012 the Foundation presented a draft for a law at the Women´s Parliament of the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires dealing with a compulsion for non profit civil associations, sports clubs and sports federations to include equality of gender considerations in the Ruling Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenigualdad.org.ar/litigios-contra-la-discriminacion.html|title=Género y deportes|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “Empowering Young women in the frontiers: Gender violence and human trafficking” project, financed by UN Women 2010-11 focused on young women in borderland regions (Jujuy/La Quiaca; Posadas/Encarnación) for them to become familiar with and exercise their rights and organize to prevent gender violence and human trafficking. They were qualified to carry out basic strategies in participative democracy with an emphasis on gender equality: requests for valid information (access to information), advocacy campaigns and claims and grievances were presented to accountable office holders in the light of non compliance with their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/notas/238953-alertan-sujeto-que-busca-chicas-una-red-trata|title=Trata de personas en Argentina|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gift''' or a '''present''' is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or anything in return. An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging [[money]], [[property|goods]], etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the [[economics]] of gift-giving into the notion of a [[gift economy]]. By extension the term ''gift'' can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other [[happiness|happier]] or less sad, especially as a favor, including [[forgiveness]] and [[kindness]]. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.

== Presentation ==
In many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in [[wrapping paper]] and accompanied by a [[gift note]] which may note the occasion, the recipient's name and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brigham|first1=John Carl|title=Social Psychology|date=1986|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotional Gifts ==
Promotional gifts vary from the normal gifts. The recipients of the gifts may be either employee of a company or the clients. Promotional gifts are mainly used for advertising purposes. They are used to promote the brand name and increase its awareness among the people. In promotional gifting procedures, the quality and presentation of the gifts hold more value than the gifts itself since it will act as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates.

== As reinforcement and manipulation ==
Giving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocates]] in a particular way. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]] as a [[Reward system|reward]] for [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unwanted gifts==

A significant fraction of gifts are unwanted, or the giver pays more for the item than the recipient values it, resulting in a misallocation of economic resources known as a [[deadweight loss]].  Unwanted gifts are often [[regifted]], donated to charity, or thrown away.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/12/21/14032662/christmas-gift-giving-wasteful|title=The economic case against Christmas presents |work=Vox |access-date=December 5, 2017 |date=December 21, 2016 |last=Lee |first=Timothy B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gift that actually imposes a burden on the recipient, either due to maintenance or storage or disposal costs, is known as a [[white elephant]].  

One means of reducing the mismatch between the buyer and receivers' tastes is advance coordination, often undertaken in the form of a [[wedding registry]] or [[Christmas list]]. Wedding registries in particular are often kept at a single store, which can designate the exact items to be purchased (resulting in matching housewares), and to coordinate purchases so the same gift is not purchased by different guests. One study found that wedding guests who departed from the registry typically did so because they wished to signal a closer relationship to the couple by personalizing a gift, and also found that as a result of not abiding by the recipients' preferences, their gifts were appreciated less often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483426485/new-study-explores-psychology-of-giving-wedding-gifts |title=New Study Explores Psychology Of Giving Wedding Gifts |last=Mendoza |first=Nohely |date=December 26, 2017 |location=Waco, Texas |newspaper= Nexstar Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated $3.4 billion was spent on unwanted Christmas gifts in the United States in 2017.&lt;ref name="cent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.centexproud.com/news/local/biggest-return-day-of-the-year/888734842 |title=Biggest return day of the year |last=Mendoza |first=Nohely |location=Waco, Texas |access-date=September 19, 2018 |newspaper=Nexstar Broadcasting }}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Christmas is typically the busiest day for returns in countries with large Christmas gift giving traditions.&lt;ref name="cent" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/unwanted-christmas-presents-returns-busiest-day-year-working-retail-a8138181.html |title=Unwanted Christmas presents set to rise on busiest day of the year for returns |newspaper=The Independent |date=January 2, 2018 |access-date=September 19, 2018 |last=Musaddique |first=Shafi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total unredeemed value of [[gift cards]] purchased in the U.S. each year is estimated to be about a billion dollars.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

== Legal aspects ==
{{Main|Gift (law)|Gift tax}}

At [[common law]], for a gift to have legal effect, it was required that there be (1) intent by the donor to give a gift, and (2) delivery to the recipient of the item to be given as a gift.

In some countries, certain types of gifts above a certain monetary amount are subject to taxation.  For the United States, see [[Gift tax in the United States]].

In some contexts, gift giving can be construed as [[bribery]].  This tends to occur in situations where the gift is given with an implicit or explicit agreement between the giver of the gift and its receiver that some type of service will be rendered (often outside of normal legitimate methods) because of the gift. Some groups, such as government workers, may have strict rules concerning gift giving and receiving so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Gifts%20and%20Payments |title=Gifts and Payments |publisher=United States Office of Government Ethics |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
[[Lewis Hyde]] remarks in ''The Gift'' that [[Christianity]] considers the [[Incarnation]] and subsequent death of [[Jesus]] to be the greatest gift to humankind, and that the [[Jataka]] contains a tale of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in his incarnation as the Wise Hare giving the ultimate [[alms]] by offering himself up as a meal for [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]]. (Hyde, 1983, 58-60)

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the bread and wine that are [[consecrated]] during the [[Divine Liturgy]] are referred to as "the Gifts." They are first of all the gifts of the community (both individually and corporately) to God, and then, after the [[epiklesis]], the Gifts of the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ|Blood]] of [[Christ]] to the Church.

Ritual [[sacrifice]]s can be seen as return gifts to a [[deity]].

[[File:Gold Diggers of Broadway lobby card.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lobby card for ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929), an example of a film which helped create the American public association of chorus girls with gold diggers.]]
'''Gold digging''' is a type of [[Transactional sex|transactional]] relationship&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger pp. 60&lt;/ref&gt; in which people, especially women, engage in relationships for money rather than love. When it turns into marriage, it is a type of [[marriage of convenience]]. 

[[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]] was in the 1920s considered the perfect example of a gold digger,&lt;ref&gt;Sharot p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; with some claims existing that the term was even coined to describe her.&lt;ref&gt;"Some people even claimed the term has been coined by a Hearst newspaperman to describe Peggy and her behavior." Robenblum pp. unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular association between [[Chorus line|chorus girls]] and gold diggers was established in 1919 by "The Gold Diggers" play, association which was also present in the subsequent film four years later, ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920s and 1930s American cinema the "gold digger" was the type of ''[[femme fatale]]'' that gradually replaced the [[Femme fatale#20th-century film and theatre|"vamp"]].&lt;ref&gt;"The gold digger came to replace the vamp as the most prominent type of femme fatale." Sharot pp. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt; The character type would be featured, for example, in ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', a 1953 film starring [[Marilyn Monroe]], alongside Schatze Page and Loco Dempsey. 

In the analysis of rap music it has been theorized that the "gold digger script" is one of a few prevalent [[sexual script theory|sexual scripts]] present for young African American women.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Kanye West]]'s "[[Gold Digger (Kanye West song)|Gold Digger]]" references gold digging.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22315">In [[mathematics]], the '''Grothendieck group''' construction in [[abstract algebra]] constructs an [[abelian group]] from a [[commutative monoid]] ''M'' in the most universal way in the sense that any abelian group containing a [[group homomorphism|homomorphic]] image of ''M'' will also contain a homomorphic image of the Grothendieck group of ''M''. The Grothendieck group construction takes its name from the more general construction in [[category theory]], introduced by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] in his fundamental work of the mid-1950s that resulted in the development of [[K-theory]], which led to his proof of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]]. This article treats both constructions.

==Grothendieck group of a commutative monoid==

===Motivation===
Given a commutative monoid ''M'', we want to construct "the most general" abelian group ''K'' that arises from ''M'' by introducing additive inverses. Such an abelian group ''K'' always exists; it is called the Grothendieck group of ''M''. It is characterized by a certain [[universal property]] and can also be concretely constructed from ''M''.

===Universal property===
Let ''M'' be a commutative monoid. Its Grothendieck group ''K'' is an abelian group with the following universal property: There exists a monoid homomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;i : M \to K&lt;/math&gt;

such that for any monoid homomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;f : M \to A&lt;/math&gt;

from the commutative monoid ''M'' to an abelian group ''A'', there is a unique group homomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;g : K \to A&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;f = g \circ i.&lt;/math&gt;

This expresses the fact that any abelian group ''A'' that contains a homomorphic image of ''M'' will also contain a homomorphic image of ''K'', ''K'' being the "most general" abelian group containing a homomorphic image of ''M''.

===Explicit constructions===
To construct the Grothendieck group ''K'' of a commutative monoid ''M'', one forms the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;M \times M.&lt;/math&gt; The two coordinates are meant to represent a positive part and a negative part, so (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''K''.

Addition on ''M'' × ''M'' is defined coordinate-wise:

:(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Next we define an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'' × ''M''. We say that (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is equivalent to (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if, for some element ''k'' of ''M'', ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''k'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''k'' (the element ''k'' is necessary because the [[cancellation law]] does not hold in all monoids). The [[equivalence class]] of the element (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is denoted by [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. We define ''K'' to be the set of equivalence classes. Since the addition operation on ''M'' × ''M'' is compatible with our equivalence relation, we obtain an addition on ''K'', and ''K'' becomes an abelian group. The identity element of ''K'' is [(0, 0)], and the inverse of [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] is [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]. The homomorphism &lt;math&gt;i:M\to K&lt;/math&gt; sends the element ''m'' to [(''m'', 0)].

Alternatively, the Grothendieck group ''K'' of ''M'' can also be constructed using [[presentation of a group|generators and relations]]: denoting by &lt;math&gt;(Z(M), +')&lt;/math&gt; the [[free abelian group]] generated by the set ''M'', the Grothendieck group ''K'' is the [[quotient group|quotient]] of &lt;math&gt;Z(M)&lt;/math&gt; by the subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;\{(x+'y)-'(x+y)\mid x,y\in M\}&lt;/math&gt;. (Here +′ and −′ denote the addition and subtraction in the free abelian group &lt;math&gt;Z(M)&lt;/math&gt; while + denotes the addition in the monoid ''M''.) This construction has the advantage that it can be performed for any [[semigroup]] ''M'' and yields a group which satisfies the corresponding universal properties for semigroups, i.e. the "most general and smallest group containing a homomorphic image of ''M''". This is known as the "group completion of a semigroup" or "group of fractions of a semigroup".

===Properties===
In the language of [[category theory]], any universal construction gives rise to a [[functor]]; we thus obtain a functor from the category of commutative monoids to the [[category of abelian groups]] which sends the commutative monoid ''M'' to its Grothendieck group ''K''. This functor is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from the category of abelian groups to the category of commutative monoids.

For a commutative monoid ''M'', the map ''i''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;rarr;''K'' is injective if and only if ''M'' has the [[cancellation property]], and it is bijective if and only if ''M'' is already a group.

===Examples: the integers, the Grothendieck group of a manifold and of a ring===
The easiest example of a Grothendieck group is the construction of the [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; from the [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\N.&lt;/math&gt; First one observes that the natural numbers (including 0) together with the usual addition indeed form a commutative monoid &lt;math&gt;(\N, +).&lt;/math&gt; Now when we use the Grothendieck group construction we obtain the formal differences between natural numbers as elements ''n'' − ''m'' and we have the equivalence relation

:&lt;math&gt;n - m \sim n' - m' \Leftrightarrow n + m' = n'+ m&lt;/math&gt;.

Now define

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \N: \qquad \begin{cases} n := [n - 0] \\ -n := [0 - n] \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This defines the integers &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; Indeed, this is the usual construction to obtain the integers from the natural numbers. See [[Integers#Construction|"Construction" under Integers]] for a more detailed explanation.

The Grothendieck group is the fundamental construction of [[K-theory]]. The group &lt;math&gt;K_0(M)&lt;/math&gt; of a compact [[manifold]] ''M'' is defined to be the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of all isomorphism classes of [[vector bundle]]s of finite rank on ''M'' with the monoid operation given by direct sum. This gives a [[contravariant functor]] from manifolds to abelian groups. This functor is studied and extended in [[topological K-theory]].

The zeroth algebraic K group &lt;math&gt;K_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; of a (not necessarily commutative) ring ''R'' is the Grothendieck group of the monoid consisting of isomorphism classes of finitely generated [[projective modules]] over ''R'', with the monoid operation given by the direct sum. Then &lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt; is a covariant functor from rings to abelian groups.

The two previous examples are related: consider the case where ''R'' is the ring &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt; of complex-valued [[smooth function]]s on a compact manifold ''M''. In this case the projective ''R''-modules are [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to vector bundles over ''M'' (by the [[Serre-Swan theorem]]). Thus &lt;math&gt;K_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_0(M)&lt;/math&gt; are the same group.

==Grothendieck group and extensions&lt;!-- Ext functor links here --&gt;==

===Definition===

Another construction that carries the name '''Grothendieck group''' is the following: Let ''R'' be a finite-dimensional algebra over some field ''k'' or more generally an [[artinian ring]]. Then define the Grothendieck group &lt;math&gt;G_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; as the abelian group generated by the set &lt;math&gt;\{[X] | X \in R\mathrm{-Mod}\}&lt;/math&gt; of isomorphism classes of finitely generated ''R''-modules and the following relations: For every [[short exact sequence]]

:&lt;math&gt;0\to A\to B\to C\to 0&lt;/math&gt;

of ''R''-modules add the relation

:&lt;math&gt;[A] - [B] + [C] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the proposed definition of Grothendieck group &lt;math&gt;G_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. Let ''R'' be an Artinian ring, and suppose &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; are isomorphic finitely generated ''R''-modules. Then there exists the following short exact sequence

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to 0 \to M \to M' \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The exact sequence hence implies that &lt;math&gt;[0] - [M] + [M'] = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;[0] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt; [M] = [M']&lt;/math&gt;. The proposed definition also implies that for any two finitely generated ''R''-modules ''M'' and ''N'', &lt;math&gt;[M \oplus N] = [M] + [N]&lt;/math&gt;. This follows from the given split short exact sequence.

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to M \to M \oplus N \to N \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===

Let ''K'' be a field. Then the Grothendieck group &lt;math&gt;G_0(K)&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group generated by symbols &lt;math&gt;[V]&lt;/math&gt; for any finite dimensional ''K''-vector space ''V''. In fact, &lt;math&gt;G_0(K)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Z &lt;/math&gt; whose generator is the element &lt;math&gt;[K]&lt;/math&gt;. Here, the symbol &lt;math&gt;[V]&lt;/math&gt; for a finite ''K''-vector space ''V'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;[V] = \dim_K V&lt;/math&gt;, the dimension of the vector space ''V''. Suppose we have the following short exact sequence of ''K''-vector spaces.

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to V \to T \to W \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since any short exact sequence of vector spaces splits, it holds that &lt;math&gt;T \cong V \oplus W &lt;/math&gt;. In fact, for any two finite dimensional vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' the following holds.

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_K(V \oplus W) = \dim_K(V) + \dim_K(W)&lt;/math&gt;

The above equality hence satisfies the condition of the symbol &lt;math&gt;[V]&lt;/math&gt; in the Grothendieck group.

:&lt;math&gt; [T] = [V \oplus W] = [V] + [W] &lt;/math&gt;

Note that any two isomorphic finite dimensional ''K''-vector space has the same dimension. Also, any two finite dimensional ''K''-vector space ''V'' and ''W'' of same dimension are isomorphic to each other. In fact, every finite ''n''-dimensional ''K''-vector space ''V'' is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;K^{\oplus n}&lt;/math&gt;. The observation from the previous paragraph hence proves the following equation. 

:&lt;math&gt;[V] = \left [K^{\oplus n} \right ] = n[K]&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, every symbol &lt;math&gt;[V]&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the element &lt;math&gt;[K]&lt;/math&gt; with integer coefficients, which implies that &lt;math&gt;G_0(K)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; with the generator &lt;math&gt;[K]&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, let &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; be the set of integers. The Grothendieck group &lt;math&gt;G_0(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group generated by symbols &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; for any finitely generated abelian groups ''A''. We first note that any finite abelian group ''G'' satisfies that &lt;math&gt;[G] = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The following short exact sequence holds, where the map &lt;math&gt;\Z \to \Z&lt;/math&gt; is multiplication by ''n''.

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to \Z \to \Z \to \Z /n\Z \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

The exact sequence implies that &lt;math&gt;[\Z /n\Z] = [\Z] - [\Z] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so every cyclic group has its symbol equal to 0. This in turn implies that every finite abelian group ''G'' satisfies &lt;math&gt;[G] = 0&lt;/math&gt; by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian groups. 

Observe that by the [[Finitely generated abelian group#Classification|Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]], every abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of a torsion subgroup and a torsion-free abelian group isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Z^r&lt;/math&gt; for some non-negative integer ''r''. Note that the integer ''r'' is defined as the [[Rank of an abelian group|rank of the abelian group]] ''A''. Define the symbol &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;[A] = Rank(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the Grothendieck group &lt;math&gt;G_0(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; with generator &lt;math&gt;[\Z].&lt;/math&gt; Indeed, the observation made from the previous paragraph shows that every abelian group ''A'' has its symbol &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; the same to the symbol &lt;math&gt;[\Z^r] = r[\Z]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r = Rank(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, the rank of the abelian group satisfies the conditions of the symbol &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; of the Grothendieck group. Suppose we have the following short exact sequence of abelian groups.

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Then tensoring with the rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; implies the following equation.

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to A \otimes_\Z \Q \to B \otimes_\Z \Q \to C \otimes_\Z \Q \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the above is a short exact sequence of &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;-vector spaces, the sequence splits. Therefore, we have the following equation.

:&lt;math&gt; \dim_\Q (B \otimes_\Z \Q ) = \dim_\Q (A \otimes_\Z \Q) + \dim_\Q (C \otimes_\Z \Q ) &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, we also have the following relation. For more information, see: [[Rank_of_an_abelian_group|Rank of Abelian Group]].

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(A) = \dim_\Q (A \otimes_\Z \Q ) &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the following equation holds.

:&lt;math&gt;[B] = \operatorname{rank}(B) = \operatorname{rank}(A) + \operatorname{rank}(C) = [A] + [C]&lt;/math&gt;

Hence we have shown that &lt;math&gt;G_0(\Z)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; with generator &lt;math&gt;[\Z].&lt;/math&gt;

===Universal Property===

Grothendieck group satisfies a universal property. We make a preliminary definition: A function &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; from the set of isomorphism classes to an abelian group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called ''additive'' if, for each exact sequence &lt;math&gt;0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\chi(A)-\chi(B)+\chi(C)= 0.&lt;/math&gt; Then, for any additive function &lt;math&gt;\chi: R\text{-mod} \to X&lt;/math&gt;, there is a ''unique'' group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f:G_0(R) \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; factors through ''f'' and the map that takes each object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; to the element representing its isomorphism class in &lt;math&gt;G_0(R).&lt;/math&gt; Concretely this means that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;f([V])=\chi(V)&lt;/math&gt; for every finitely generated &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the only group homomorphism that does that.

Examples of additive functions are the [[Character theory|character function]] from [[representation theory]]: If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a finite-dimensional &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-algebra, then we can associate the character &lt;math&gt;\chi_V: R \to k&lt;/math&gt; to every finite-dimensional &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;V: \chi_V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-linear map that is given by multiplication with the element &lt;math&gt;x \in R&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

By choosing a suitable basis and writing the corresponding matrices in block triangular form one easily sees that character functions are additive in the above sense. By the universal property this gives us a "universal character" &lt;math&gt;\chi: G_0(R)\to \mathrm{Hom}_K(R,K)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\chi([V]) = \chi_V&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;k=\C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[group ring]] &lt;math&gt;\C[G]&lt;/math&gt; of a [[finite group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then this character map even gives a [[natural transformation|natural]] isomorphism of &lt;math&gt;G_0(\C[G])&lt;/math&gt; and the character ring &lt;math&gt;Ch(G)&lt;/math&gt;. In the [[modular representation theory]] of finite groups &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; can be a field &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{F}_p},&lt;/math&gt; the [[algebraic closure]] of the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements. In this case the analogously defined map that associates to each &lt;math&gt;k[G]&lt;/math&gt;-module its [[Brauer character]] is also a natural isomorphism &lt;math&gt;G_0(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}[G])\to \mathrm{BCh}(G)&lt;/math&gt; onto the ring of Brauer characters. In this way Grothendieck groups show up in representation theory.

This universal property also makes &lt;math&gt;G_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; the 'universal receiver' of generalized [[Euler characteristic]]s. In particular, for every [[bounded complex]] of objects in &lt;math&gt;R\text{-mod}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cdots \to 0 \to 0 \to A^n \to A^{n+1} \to \cdots \to A^{m-1} \to A^m \to 0 \to 0 \to \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

we have a canonical element

:&lt;math&gt; [A^*] = \sum_i (-1)^i [A^i] = \sum_i (-1)^i [H^i (A^*)] \in G_0(R). &lt;/math&gt;

In fact the Grothendieck group was originally introduced for the study of Euler characteristics.

==Grothendieck groups of exact categories==
A common generalization of these two concepts is given by the Grothendieck group of an [[exact category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Simply put, an exact category is an additive category together with a class of distinguished short sequences ''A'' → ''B'' → ''C''. The distinguished sequences are called "exact sequences", hence the name. The precise axioms for this distinguished class do not matter for the construction of the Grothendieck group.

The Grothendieck group is defined in the same way as before as the abelian group with one generator [''M''] for each (isomorphism class of) object(s) of the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and one relation

:&lt;math&gt;[A]-[B]+[C] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for each exact sequence

:&lt;math&gt;A\hookrightarrow B\twoheadrightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively one can define the Grothendieck group using a similar universal property: An abelian group ''G'' together with a mapping &lt;math&gt;\phi: \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{A})\to G&lt;/math&gt; is called the Grothendieck group of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; iff every "additive" map &lt;math&gt;\chi: \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{A})\to X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; into an abelian group ''X'' ("additive" in the above sense, i.e. for every exact sequence &lt;math&gt;A\hookrightarrow B\twoheadrightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\chi(A)-\chi(B)+\chi(C)=0&lt;/math&gt;) factors uniquely through φ.

Every [[abelian category]] is an exact category if we just use the standard interpretation of "exact". This gives the notion of a Grothendieck group in the previous section if we choose &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}:=R&lt;/math&gt;-'''mod''' the category of finitely generated ''R''-modules as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. This is really abelian because ''R'' was assumed to be artinian and (hence noetherian) in the previous section.

On the other hand, every [[additive category]] is also exact if we declare those and only those sequences to be exact that have the form &lt;math&gt;A\hookrightarrow A\oplus B\twoheadrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; with the canonical inclusion and projection morphisms. This procedure produces the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Iso}(\mathcal{A}),\oplus)&lt;/math&gt; in the first sense (here &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Iso}(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; means the "set" [ignoring all foundational issues] of isomorphism classes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.)

== Grothendieck groups of triangulated categories==
Generalizing even further it is also possible to define the Grothendieck group for [[triangulated category|triangulated categories]]. The construction is essentially similar but uses the relations [''X''] - [''Y''] + [''Z''] = 0 whenever there is a distinguished triangle ''X'' → ''Y'' → ''Z'' → ''X''[1].

==Further examples==
* In the abelian category of finite-dimensional [[vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', two vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. Thus, for a vector space ''V'' 

::&lt;math&gt;[V] = \left [k^{\dim(V)} \right ] \in K_0 (\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{fin}}).&lt;/math&gt; 

:Moreover, for an exact sequence

::&lt;math&gt; 0 \to k^l \to k^m \to k^n \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:''m'' = ''l'' + ''n'', so

::&lt;math&gt; \left [k^{l+n} \right ] = \left [k^l \right ] + \left [k^n \right ] = (l+n)[k]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Thus 

::&lt;math&gt;[V] = \dim(V)[k],&lt;/math&gt;

:and &lt;math&gt;K_0(\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{fin}})&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; and is generated by &lt;math&gt;[k].&lt;/math&gt; Finally for a bounded complex of finite-dimensional vector spaces ''V''*,

::&lt;math&gt; [V^*] = \chi(V^*)[k] &lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is the standard Euler characteristic defined by

::&lt;math&gt; \chi(V^*)= \sum_i (-1)^i \dim V = \sum_i (-1)^i \dim H^i(V^*). &lt;/math&gt;

* For a [[ringed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt;, one can consider the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of all [[locally free sheaf|locally free sheaves]] over ''X''. &lt;math&gt;K_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; is then defined as the Grothendieck group of this exact category and again this gives a functor.

* For a ringed space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt;, one can also define the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; to be the category of all [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] on ''X''. This includes the special case (if the ringed space is an [[affine scheme]]) of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; being the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian ring ''R''. In both cases &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian category and a fortiori an exact category so the construction above applies.

* In the case where ''R'' is a finite-dimensional algebra over some field, the Grothendieck groups &lt;math&gt;G_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; (defined via short exact sequences of finitely generated modules) and &lt;math&gt;K_0(R)&lt;/math&gt; (defined via direct sum of finitely generated projective modules) coincide. In fact, both groups are isomorphic to the free abelian group generated by the isomorphism classes of [[simple module|simple]] ''R''-modules.

* There is another Grothendieck group &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; of a ring or a ringed space which is sometimes useful. The category in the case is chosen to be the category of all [[coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] on the ringed space which reduces to the category of all modules over some ring ''R'' in case of affine schemes. &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' a functor, but nevertheless it carries important information.

* Since the (bounded) derived category is triangulated, there is a Grothendieck group for derived categories too. This has applications in representation theory for example. For the unbounded category the Grothendieck group however vanishes. For a derived category of some complex finite-dimensional positively graded algebra there is a subcategory in the unbounded derived category containing the abelian category A of finite-dimensional graded modules whose Grothendieck group is the ''q''-adic completion of the Grothendieck group of A.

{{emotion}}

'''Hatred''' or '''hate''' is a [[human]] [[emotion]]. Hatred could invoke feelings of [[wikt:animosity|animosity]], [[anger]] or [[resentment]], which can be directed against certain individuals, [[Social group|group]]s, [[entity|entities]], objects, [[behavior]]s, [[concept]]s, or [[idea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, A.S., &amp; Reber, E. (2002). ''The Penguin dictionary of psychology''. New York: [[Penguin Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatred is often associated with feelings of [[anger]], [[disgust]] and a [[disposition]] towards the source of [[hostility]].

== As emotion ==
As an emotion, hatred can be short-lived or long-lasting.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; It can be of low intensity - 'I hate broccoli' - or high intensity: 'I hate the whole world'.&lt;ref&gt;S Kucuk, ''Brand Hate'' (2016) p. 12-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Steinberg]] saw three main elements in hatred: 
# a negation of intimacy, by creating distance when closeness had become threatening; 
# an infusion of passion, such as fear or anger; 
# a decision to devalue a previously valued object.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;
The important self-protective function, to be found in hatred,&lt;ref&gt;I Craib, ''Psychoanalysis'' (Cambridge 2001) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; can be illustrated by Steinberg's analysis of 'mutinous' hatred, whereby a dependent relationship is repudiated in a quest for autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Y Ito ed., ''Encyclopedia of Emotion'' (2010) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Psychoanalytic views ==
[[Dr. Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud]] defined hate as an ego state that wishes to destroy the source of its unhappiness, stressing that it was linked to the question of self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, 'The instincts and their vicissitudes' (1915) in ''On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 135-5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Winnicott]] highlighted the developmental step involved in hatred, with its recognition of an outside object: "As compared to magical destruction, aggressive ideas and behaviour take on a positive value, and hate becomes a sign of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;D W Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

In his wake, [[Object relations theory]] has emphasised the importance of recognising hate in the analytic setting: the analyst acknowledges his own hate (as revealed in the strict time-limits and the fee charged),&lt;ref&gt;J Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis'' (London 1988) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn may make it possible for the patient to acknowledge and contain ''their'' previously concealed hate for the analyst.&lt;ref&gt;I Craib, ''Psychoanalysis'' (Cambridge 2001) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]] went so far as to suggest that true kindness is impossible in a relationship without hating and being hated, so that an unsentimental acknowledgement of interpersonal frustrations and their associated hostilities can allow real fellow-feeling to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;A Phillips/B Taylor, ''On Kindness'' (London 2004) p. 93-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the English language, a [[hate crime]] (also known as a "bias-motivated crime") generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by hate. Those who commit hate crimes target victims because of their perceived membership in a certain [[social group]], usually defined by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[mental disorder]], [[disability]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender identity]], or [[political affiliation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.: [http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents may involve [[physical assault]], [[destruction of property]], [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insults]], or offensive graffiti or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref name="ovrbwx"&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ Hate crime] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126000000/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ |date=November 26, 2005 }}, [[Home Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hate speech]] is speech perceived to disparage a person or group of people based on their social or ethnic group,&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com: Hate speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hate%20speech |title=Dictionary.com: Hate speech |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[Ageing|age]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[mental disorder]], [[disability]], [[language]] ability, [[ideology]], [[social class]], occupation, appearance (height, weight, skin color, etc.), mental capacity, and any other distinction that might be considered a liability. The term covers written as well as oral communication and some forms of behaviors in a public setting. It is also sometimes called [[antilocution]] and is the first point on [[Allport's scale]] which measures [[prejudice]] in a society. In many countries, deliberate use of hate speech is a [[criminal offence]] prohibited under ''incitement to hatred'' legislation.  It is often alleged that the criminalization of hate speech is sometimes used to discourage legitimate discussion of negative aspects of voluntary behavior (such as political persuasion, religious adherence and philosophical allegiance). There is also some question as to whether or not hate speech falls under the protection of freedom of speech in some countries.

Both of these classifications have sparked debate, with counter-arguments such as, but not limited to, a difficulty in distinguishing motive and intent for crimes, as well as philosophical debate on the validity of valuing targeted hatred as a greater crime than general [[misanthropy]] and contempt for humanity being a potentially equal crime in and of itself.

== Neurological research ==
The neural correlates of hate have been investigated with an [[fMRI]] procedure. In this experiment, people had their brains scanned while viewing pictures of people they hated. The results showed increased activity in the [[middle frontal gyrus]], right [[putamen]], bilaterally in the [[premotor cortex]], in the [[frontal pole]], and bilaterally in the medial [[insular cortex]] of the [[human brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Zeki, S. |author2=Romaya, J.P. |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003556;jsessionid=0C68BB34FD6B6212E02B082F9B250990 |title=Neural Correlates of Hate |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=e3556 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003556 |pmid=18958169 |pmc=2569212 |authorlink1=Semir Zeki |editor1-last=Lauwereyns |editor1-first=Jan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103151609/http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003556;jsessionid=0C68BB34FD6B6212E02B082F9B250990 |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnolinguistics==
Hate, like love, takes different shapes and forms in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; While it may be fair to say that one single emotion exists in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] (haine), and [[German language|German]] (Hass), hate is historically situated and culturally constructed: it varies in the forms in which it is manifested. Thus a certain relationless hatred is expressed in the French expression ''J'ai la haine'', which has no precise equivalent in English; while for English-speakers, loving and hating invariably involve an object, or a person, and therefore, a relationship with something or someone, ''J'ai la haine'' (literally, I have hate) precludes the idea of an emotion directed at a person.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 161-2&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of frustration, apathy and animosity which churns within the subject but establishes no relationship with the world, other than an aimless desire for destruction. 

French forms of [[anti-Americanism]] have been seen as a specific form of cultural resentment, registering joy-in-hate.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Underhill, ''[[Ethnolinguistics]] and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war'', (2012) p. 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious perspectives==

===Old Testament===
The Hebrew word describing David's "perfect hatred" (KJV) means that it "brings a process to completion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=R Laird|title=Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament|date=10/01/2003|publisher=Moody Publishers; New Edition|isbn=0802486495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary explications==
*[[W B Yeats]] had his (imaginary) hermit Ribh proclaim:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I study hatred with great diligence,
For that's a passion in my own control,
A sort of besom that can clear the soul
Of everything that is not mind or sense."&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Doris Lessing]] considered there was a hate-region of the mind that could be tapped rather like a radio: "you discover hatred is a kind of wavelength you can tune into...''plugged into Hater''."&lt;ref&gt;D Lessing, ''The Four-Gated City'' (London 1993) p. 69 and p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Летний лагерь Альтаир. Шенкурск (1).JPG|right|thumb|300px|Summer camps for children are often associated with homesickness, particularly for children who are away from their parents for the first time.]]

'''Homesickness''' is the distress caused by being away from [[home]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Kerns, Brumariu, Abraham. Kathryn A., Laura E., Michelle M.(2009/04/13). Homesickness at summer camp. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2007"&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Walton, E.A. (2007). Preventing and treating homesickness. ''Pediatrics, 119'', 843–858.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers typically report a combination of [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] and [[Anxiety|anxious]] symptoms, withdrawn behavior and difficulty focusing on topics unrelated to home.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1999"&gt;Thurber, C.A., Sigman, M.D., Weisz, J.R., &amp; Schmidt, C.K. (1999). Homesickness in preadolescent and adolescent girls: Risk factors, behavioral correlates, and sequelae.

In its mild form, homesickness prompts the development of coping skills and motivates healthy attachment behaviors, such as renewing contact with loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Weisz, J.R. (1997). "You Can Try or You Can Just Give Up": The impact of perceived control and coping style on childhood homesickness.

(Eds.) (1997). ''Acculturation stress and homesickness''. Tilburg, The Netherlands: Tilburg University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, intense homesickness can be painful and debilitating.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2012"&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Walton, E.A.

== Historical references ==
Homesickness is an ancient phenomenon, mentioned in both the [[Old Testament]] books of ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' and ''[[Book of Psalms|Psalm]]'' 137:1 ("By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion") as well as Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', whose opening scene features [[Athena]] arguing with [[Zeus]] to bring [[Odysseus]] home because he is homesick ("...longing for his wife and his homecoming..."). The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460–377 BC) believed that homesickness—also called "heimveh" (old German word for "[[German language|Heimweh]]") or a "nostalgic reaction"—was caused by a surfeit of black bile in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Zwingmann, C. (1959). "Heimveh" or "nostalgic reaction": A conceptual analysis and interpretation of a medico-psychological phenomenon [dissertation]. Stanford (CA): Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent history homesickness is first mentioned specifically with [[Swiss people|Swiss]] people being abroad in [[Europe]] ("Heimweh") for a longer period of time in a document dating back to 1691.&lt;ref&gt;''Schweizerisches Idiotikon'' Bd. XV Sp. 42&amp;nbsp;f., Artikel [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register/faksimile.php?band=15&amp;spalte=42 ''Heimwē'']&lt;/ref&gt; A normal phenomenon amongst the many common [[Swiss mercenaries]] serving in different countries and many rulers across [[Europe]] at that time. It was not uncommon for them staying many years away from home and, if lucky enough, return home if still alive. This phenomenon at that time was first only thought to affect Swiss people until this was revised, probably caused by big migration streams across [[Europe]] suggesting the same symptoms and thus homesickness found its way into general [[Germany|German]] medical literature in the 19th century. American contemporary histories, such as Susan J. Matt's ''Homesickness: An American History'' eloquently describe experiences of homesickness in colonists, immigrants, gold miners, soldiers, explorers and others spending time away from home. First understood as a brain lesion, homesickness is now known to be a form of normative psychopathology that reflects the strength of a person's attachment to home, native culture and loved ones, as well as their ability to regulate their emotions and adjust to novelty. Cross-cultural research, with populations as diverse as refugees and [[boarding school]] students, suggests considerable agreement on the definition of homesickness.&lt;ref name="Tilburg, M.A.A. 1997"&gt;van Tilburg, M.A.A. &amp; Vingerhoets, A. (Eds.). (1997). Acculturation Stress and Homesickness. Tilburg, The Netherlands. Tilburg University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional historical perspectives on homesickness and place attachment can be found in books by van Tilburg &amp; Vingerhoets,&lt;ref name="Tilburg, M.A.A. 1997" /&gt; Matt,&lt;ref&gt;Matt, S.J. (2011). Homesickness: An American History. USA: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A. (Ed.). (1999). Therapeutic Landscapes: The Dynamic Between Place and Wellness. New York: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis and epidemiology ==
Whereas [[separation anxiety disorder]] is characterized by "inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached" &lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders." 5th ed. Washington, DC: Author: 2013&lt;/ref&gt; symptoms of homesickness are most prominent ''after ''a separation and include ''both ''depression ''and'' anxiety. In DSM terms, homesickness may be related to Separation Anxiety Disorder, but it is perhaps best categorized as either an Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (309.28) or, for immigrants and foreign students as a V62.4, Acculturation Difficulty. As noted above, researchers use the following definition: "Homesickness is the distress or impairment caused by an actual or anticipated separation from home. Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects." Recent pathogenic models support the possibility that homesickness reflects both insecure attachment and a variety of emotional and cognitive vulnerabilities, such as little previous experience away from home and negative attitudes about the novel environment.

The prevalence of homesickness varies greatly, depending on the population studied and the way homesickness is measured.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1995"&gt;Thurber, C.A. (1995). The experience and expression of homesickness in preadolescent and adolescent boys. "Child Development, 66", 1162–1178.&lt;/ref&gt; One way to conceptualize homesickness prevalence is as a function of severity. Nearly all people miss something about home when they are away, so the absolute prevalence of homesickness is close to 100%, mostly in a mild form. Roughly 20% of university students and children at summer camp rate themselves at or above the midpoint on numerical rating scales of homesickness severity. And only 5–7% of students and campers report intense homesickness associated with severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, in adverse or painful environments, such as the hospital or the battlefield, intense homesickness is far more prevalent. In one study,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Thurber, C.A., Patterson, D., &amp; Mount, K.K. (2007). Homesickness and children's adjustment to hospitalization: Toward a preliminary model. "Children's Healthcare, 36", 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; 50% of children scored themselves at or above the midpoint on a numerical homesickness intensity scale (compared to 20% of children at summer camp). Soldiers report even more intense homesickness, sometimes to the point of suicidal misery. Naturally, aversive environmental elements, such as the trauma associated with war, exacerbate homesickness and other mental health problems.

In sum, homesickness is a normative pathology that can take on clinical relevance in its moderate and severe forms.

== Risk and protective factors ==
[[File:US Army 52421 CAMP TAJI, Iraq - Forty-one Soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, raise their right hands during a re-enlistment ceremony held at.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Newly enlisted soldiers sometimes experience homesickness when they are staying in an army [[Recruit training|boot camp]].]]

Risk factors (constructs which increase the likelihood or intensity of homesickness) and protective factors (constructs that decrease the likelihood or intensity of homesickness) vary by population. For example, a seafarers on board, the environmental stressors associated with a hospital, a military [[Recruit training|boot camp]] or a foreign country may exacerbate homesickness and complicate treatment. Generally speaking, however, risk and protective factors transcend age and environment.

=== Risk factors ===
The risk factors for homesickness fall into five categories: experience, personality, family, attitude and environment.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2007" /&gt; More is known about some of these factors in adults—especially personality factors—because more homesickness research has been performed with older populations.&lt;ref&gt;Verschuur, M.J., Eurelings-Bontekoe, E.H.M., Spinhoven, P., &amp; Duijsens, I.J. (2003). Homesickness, temperament and character. "Journal of Personality and Individual Differences, 35", 757–770.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a growing body of research is elucidating the etiology of homesickness in younger populations, including children at summer camp,&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; hospitalized children&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; and students.&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 2012" /&gt;

* Experience factors: Younger age; little previous experience away from home (for which age can be a proxy); little or no previous experience in the novel environment; little or no previous experience venturing out without primary caregivers.
* Attitude factors: The belief that homesickness will be strong; negative first impressions and low expectations for the new environment; perceived absence of social support; high perceived demands (e.g., on academic, vocational or sports performance); great perceived distance from home
* Personality factors: Insecure attachment relationship with primary caregivers; low perceived control over the timing and nature of the separation from home; anxious or depressed feelings in the months prior to the separation; low self-directedness; high harm avoidance; rigidity; a wishful-thinking coping style.
* Family factors: decision control (e.g., caregivers forcing young children to spend time away from home against their wishes);

=== Protective factors ===
Factors which mitigate the prevalence or intensity of homesickness are essentially the inverse of the risk factors cited above. Effective coping (reviewed in the following section) also diminishes the intensity of homesickness over time. Prior to a separation, however, key protective factors can be identified. Positive adjustment to separation from home is generally associated with the following factors:

* Experience factors: Older age; substantial previous experience away from home (for which age can be a proxy); previous experience in the novel environment; previous experience venturing out without primary caregivers.
* Attitude factors: The belief that homesickness will be mild; positive first impressions and high expectations for the new environment; perceptions of social support; low perceived demands (e.g., on academic or vocational performance); short perceived distance from home
* Personality factors: Secure attachment relationship with primary caregivers; high perceived control over the timing and nature of the separation from home; good [[mental health]] in the months prior to the separation; high self-directedness; adventure-seeking; flexibility; an instrumental coping style.
* Family factors: High decision control (e.g., caregivers including a young person in the decision to spend time away from home); individuals making their own choice about military service; supportive caregiving; caregivers who express confidence and optimism about the separation (e.g., "Have a great time away. I know you'll do great.")
* Environmental factors: Low cultural contrast (e.g., same language, similar customs, familiar food in the new environment); physical and emotional safety; few changes to familiar daily schedule; plenty of information about the new place prior to relocation; feeling welcome and accepted in the new place.

== Theories of coping ==
How people—especially young people—cope with homesickness deserves careful study for at least three reasons. First, homesickness is experienced by millions of people who spend time away from home (see McCann, 1941, for an early review&lt;ref&gt;McCann, W.H. (1941). Nostalgia: A review of the literature. "Psychological Bulletin, 38", 165–182.&lt;/ref&gt;) including children at boarding schools,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S., Elder, L., &amp; Peacock, G. (1990). Homesickness in a school in the Australian Bush. "Children's Environments Quarterly, 7", 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt; residential summer camps&lt;ref name="Thurber, C.A. 1995" /&gt; and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J.V. Recreational therapy program alleviates homesickness. "Hospital Topics, 44", 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, severe homesickness is associated with significant distress and impairment. There is evidence that homesick persons present with non-traumatic physical ailments significantly more than their non-homesick peers.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S., Frazer, N., &amp; Murray., K. (1986). Homesickness and health in boarding school children. "Journal of Environmental Psychology, 6", 35–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Homesick boys and girls complain about somatic problems and exhibit more internalizing and externalizing behaviors problems than their nonhomesick peers. First-year college students are three times more likely to drop out of school than their nonhomesick peers.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, C. (1993). Concentration and academic ability following the transition to university: An investigation of the effects of homesickness. "Journal of Environmental Psychology, 13", 333–342.&lt;/ref&gt; Other data have pointed to concentration and academic problems in homesick students. And maladjustment to separation from home has been documented in hospitalized young people and is generally associated with slower recovery. See Thurber &amp; Walton (2012) for a review.

Third, learning more about how people cope with homesickness is a helpful guide to designing treatment programs. By complementing existing theories of depression, anxiety and attachment, a better theoretical understanding of homesickness can shape applied interventions. Among the most relevant theories that could shape interventions are those concerned with Learned Helplessness&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, L.Y., Seligman, M.E.P., &amp; Teasdale, J.D. (1978). Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformation. "Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 87", 49–74.&lt;/ref&gt; and Control Beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Weisz, J.R., (1990). Development of control-related beliefs, goals, and styles in childhood and adolescence: A clinical perspective. In K.W. Schaie, J. Rodin, &amp; C. Scholler (Eds.), "Self-directedness and efficacy: Causes and effects throughout the life course (pp. 103–145). New York: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Learned helplessness predicts that persons who develop a belief that they cannot influence or adjust to their circumstance of separation from home will become depressed and make fewer attempts to change that circumstance. Control beliefs theory predicts that negative affect is most likely in persons who perceive personal incompetence in the separation environment (e.g., poor social skills at a summer camp or university) and who perceive contingency uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty about whether friendly behavior will garner friends). Although these are not the only broad etiologic theories that inform homesickness, note that both theories hinge on control, the perception of which "reflects the fundamental human need for competence" (Skinner, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;8). This is particularly relevant to coping, because people's choice of ''how'' to respond to a stressor hinges partly on their perception of a stressor's controllability.

An equally important coping factor is social connection, which for many people is the antidote to homesickness. As the results of several studies have suggested, social connection is a powerful mediator of homesickness intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, B., Rosen, D., &amp; Aune, R.K., (2010). An analysis of friendship networks, social connectedness, homesickness and satisfaction levels of international students. "International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 35", 281–295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerns, K.A., Brumariu., L.E., &amp; Abraham, M.M., (2008). Homesickness at summer camp: associations with the mother-child relationship, social self-concept, and peer relationships in middle childhood. "Journal of Developmental Psychology, 54", 473–498.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways of coping ===
The most effective way of coping with homesickness is mixed and layered. Mixed coping is that which involves both primary goals (changing circumstances) and secondary goals (adjusting to circumstances). Layered coping is that which involves more than one method. This kind of sophisticated coping is learned through experience, such as brief periods away from home without parents. As an example of mixed and layered coping, one study&lt;ref&gt;Thurber, C.A. &amp; Weisz, J.R., (1997). "You can try or you can just give up": The impact of perceived control and coping style on childhood homesickness." ''Developmental Psychology, 33'', 508–517.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the following method-goal combinations to be the most frequent and effective ways for boys and girls:

* Doing something fun (observable method) to forget about being homesick (secondary goal)
* Thinking positively and feel grateful (unobservable method) to feel better (secondary goal)
* Simply changing feelings and attitudes (unobservable method) to be happy (secondary goal)
* Reframing time (unobservable method) in order to perceive the time away as shorter (secondary goal)
* Renewing a connection with home, through letter writing (observable method) to feel closer to home (secondary goal)
* Talking with someone (observable method) who could provide support and help them make new friends (primary goal)

Sometimes, people will engage in wishful thinking, attempt to arrange a shorter stay or (rarely) break rules or act violently in order to be sent home. These ways of coping are rarely effective and can produce unintended negative side effects.

== Popular culture ==
Homesickness is a major theme of the film [[Brooklyn (film)|''Brooklyn'']] (2015). One critic said that the [[protagonist]]'s depiction of homesickness "as a physical, implacable reality is acute, and it's backed up by what we see around her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/brooklyn-an-irish-twist-on-the-agonies-and-ecstasy-of-a-migrants-story-20160211-gmq32f.html|title = Brooklyn: An Irish twist on the agonies and ecstasy of a migrant's story|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 13 February 2016|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 20 February 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hope''' ([[Latin|lat]]. ''spes'') is one of the [[three theological virtues]] in Christian tradition.  Hope being a combination of the desire for something and expectation of receiving it, the virtue is hoping for Divine union and so eternal happiness. While faith is a function of the intellect, hope is an act of the will.

==Overview==
Aquinas defines hope as ""...a future good, difficult but possible to attain...by means of the Divine Assistance...on Whose help it leans".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas. ST II-II, 17.1&lt;/ref&gt; Hope is, by its very nature, always concerned with something in the future. Like the theological virtues of faith and charity, hope finds its "origin, motive, and object" in God.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1812&lt;/ref&gt; In Hebrews 10:23, [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] says, "Let us hold unwaveringly to our confession that gives us hope, for he who made the promise is trustworthy." Like the other theological virtues, hope is an infused virtue. It is not, like good habits in general, the outcome of repeated acts or the product of our own industry.&lt;ref name=Delany&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07465b.htm Delany, Joseph. "Hope." ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Hope is bestowed by God at baptism.&lt;ref name=LaCrosse&gt;[http://diolc.org/catechesis/hope/ "Hope", Diocese of La Crosse]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Christian tradition, ''hope in Christ'' and faith in Christ are closely linked, with hope having a connotation that means the one with hope has a firm assurance, through the witness of the Holy Spirit, that Christ has promised a better world to those who are His. The Christian sees death not just as the end of a passing life, but as the gateway to a future life without end and in all fullness. Pope [[Benedict XVI]] states: "Whoever believes in Christ has a future. For God has no desire for what is withered, dead, ersatz, and finally discarded: he wants what is fruitful and alive, he wants life in its fullness and he gives us life in its fullness"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20110922_olympiastadion-berlin_en.html Homily, Berlin, September 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope can thus sustain one through trials of faith, human tragedies or difficulties that may otherwise seem overwhelming.  Hope is seen as "an anchor of the soul" as referenced in the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] of the [[New Testament]]. Hebrews 7:19 also describes the "better hope" of the [[New Covenant]] in [[Christ]] rather than the [[Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]].

Hope is opposed to the sins of [[wikt:Despair|despair]] and presumption; refraining from them is adhering to the ''negative precept'' of hope.  The ''positive precept'' is required when exercising some duties, as in [[prayer]] or penance.&lt;ref name=Delany/&gt;

Some forms of [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]] have denied that a human being should desire anything whatsoever to such an extent that they denied that hope was a virtue. Quietism was condemned as heresy by [[Pope Innocent XI]] in 1687 in the papal bull ''[[Coelestis Pastor]]''.&lt;ref name=Delany/&gt;

==Quotes==
* "For in hope we were saved. Now hope that sees for itself is not hope. For who hopes for what one sees?" (Romans 8:24)

*"The Christian who hopes seeks God for himself or herself. In technical language, the formal object of theological hope is God-as-possessed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cessario|first= Romanus|authorlink= |title= The Virtues, or the Examined Life|url= |accessdate= 22 February 2013|year=  2002|publisher= Continuum|location= London|isbn= |page= 38|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ". " (Peter, 1:13)

* “I know well the plans I have in mind for you says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for woe so as to give you a future of hope” (Jeremiah 29:11).

The '''International System of Units''' ('''SI''', abbreviated from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Système international (d'unités)}}'') is the modern form of the [[metric system]], and is the most widely used [[system of measurement]]. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] built on seven [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, which are the [[ampere]], [[kelvin]], [[second]], [[metre]], [[kilogram]], [[candela]], [[Mole (unit)|mole]], and a set of twenty [[Metric prefix|prefix]]es to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies names for 22 [[SI derived unit|derived units]], such as lumen and watt, for other common physical quantities.

The base units are derived from invariant constants of nature, such as the [[speed of light]] in vacuum and the [[triple point of water]], which can be observed and measured with great accuracy, and one physical artefact. The artefact is the [[international prototype kilogram]], certified in 1889, and consisting of a cylinder of [[Platinum-iridium alloy|platinum-iridium]], which nominally has the same mass as one litre of water at the freezing point. Its stability has been a matter of significant concern, culminating in a [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|proposed revision of the definition of the base units]] entirely in terms of constants of nature, scheduled to be put into effect on 20 May 2019.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;!-- unsuitable ref for this claim:&lt;ref name="25th CGPM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/25th-CGPM-Convocation.pdf#page=32 |title=Convocation of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (25th meeting) |page=32 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Derived units may be defined in terms of base units or other derived units. They are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI is intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The most recent derived unit, the [[katal]], was defined in 1999.

The reliability of the SI depends not only on the precise measurement of standards for the base units in terms of various physical constants of nature, but also on precise definition of those constants. The set of underlying constants is modified as more stable constants are found, or may be more precisely measured. For example, in 1983 the metre was redefined as the distance that light propagates in vacuum in a given fraction of a second, thus making the value of the speed of light in terms of the defined units exact.
 
The motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimetre–gram–second]] (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of [[electrostatic units]] and [[electromagnetic units]]) and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]s that used them. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (French: ''{{lang|fr|Conférence générale des poids et mesures}}'' – CGPM), which was established by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the [[MKS system of units|metre–kilogram–second system of units]] (MKS) rather than any variant of the CGS. Since then, the SI has been [[Metrication|adopted]] by all [[countries]] except the [[United States]], [[Liberia]] and [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name="CIA Factbook Appendix G"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook Appendix G |publisher=CIA |access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Coherent SI units}} Units and prefixes==
The International System of Units consists of a set of [[SI base unit|base unit]]s, [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as [[SI prefix|prefix]]es.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|103–106}} The units, excluding prefixed units,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For historical reasons, the kilogram rather than the gram is treated as the coherent unit, making an exception to this characterisation.&lt;/ref&gt; form a [[coherent system of units]], which is based on a system of quantities in such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in coherent units have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations between the quantities. For example, 1&amp;nbsp;N = 1&amp;nbsp;kg × 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; says that ''one'' newton is the force required to [[Acceleration|accelerate]] a mass of ''one'' kilogram at ''one'' [[metre per second squared]], as related through the principle of coherence to the equation relating the corresponding quantities: {{math|1=''F'' = ''m'' × ''a''}}.

Derived units apply to derived quantities, which may by definition be expressed in terms of base quantities, and thus are not independent; for example, [[electrical conductance]] is the inverse of [[electrical resistance]], with the consequence that the siemens is the inverse of the ohm, and similarly, the ohm and siemens can be replaced with a ratio of an ampere and a volt, because those quantities bear a defined relationship to each other.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Ohm's law: {{nowrap|1=1 Ω = 1 V/A}} from the relationship {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''I'' × ''R''}}, where ''E'' is electromotive force or voltage (unit: volt), ''I'' is current (unit: ampere), and ''R'' is resistance (unit: ohm).&lt;/ref&gt; Other useful derived quantities can be specified in terms of the SI base and derived units that have no named units in the SI system, such as acceleration, which is defined in SI units as m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Base units===
{{main|SI base units}}
The SI base units are the building blocks of the system and all the other units are derived from them. When [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity) were added later.

The early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]], {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''m'' × ''a''}}: force equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1&amp;nbsp;N (newton) applied to a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg will accelerate it at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1&amp;nbsp;kg mass at the Earth's surface is {{nowrap|''m'' × ''g''}}; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81&amp;nbsp;newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5&amp;nbsp;newtons at the surface of Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.

===Derived units===
{{main|SI derived unit}}
The derived units in the SI are formed by powers, products or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|103}}&lt;ref name="NIST330"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Derived units are associated with derived quantities; for example, [[velocity]] is a quantity that is derived from the base quantities of time and length, and thus the SI derived unit is metre per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.

Combinations of base and derived units may be used to express other derived units. For example, the SI unit of [[force]] is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the SI unit of [[pressure]] is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa)—and the pascal can be defined as one newton per square metre (N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Units &amp; Symbols for Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineers |url=http://www.theiet.org/students/resources/units-symbols.cfm |publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology |date=1996 |pages=8–11 |access-date=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefixes===
{{main|Metric prefix}}
Prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiples and sub-multiples of the original unit. All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a ''milligram'', not a microkilogram.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|122}}&lt;ref name="NIST811"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Ambler |author-last1=Thompson |author-first2=Barry N. |author-last2=Taylor |date=2008 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf |title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 811) |location=Gaithersburg, MD |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} When prefixes are used to form multiples and submultiples of SI base and derived units, the resulting units are no longer coherent.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

===Non-SI units accepted for use with SI===
{{Main|non-SI units accepted for use with SI}}
Many non-SI units continue to be used in the scientific, technical, and commercial literature. Some units are deeply embedded in history and culture, and their use has not been entirely replaced by their SI alternatives. The CIPM recognised and acknowledged such traditions by compiling a list of [[non-SI units accepted for use with SI]], which are grouped as follows:&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|123–129}}&lt;ref name="NIST811"/&gt;{{rp|7–11}}&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This grouping reflects the 2014 revision of the 8th Edition of the SI Brochure (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CubeLitre.svg|right|thumb|The litre is classed as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI.&lt;br /&gt;The litre differs from the SI coherent unit m{{sup|3}} by a factor 0.001 and is therefore not a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent unit]] of measure with respect to SI.]]
*'''Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI''' (Table 6):
*:Certain units of time, angle, and legacy non-SI units have a long history of consistent use. Most societies have used the solar day and its non-decimal subdivisions as a basis of time and, unlike the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], these were the same regardless of where they were being measured. The [[radian]], being {{sfrac|2π}} of a revolution, has mathematical advantages but it is cumbersome for navigation{{fact|date=June 2018}}, and, as with time, the units used in navigation are largely consistent around the world. The [[tonne]], [[litre]], and [[hectare]] were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols. The catalogued units are
*::[[minute]], [[hour]], [[day]], [[Degree (angle)|degree of arc]], [[minute of arc]], [[second of arc]], [[hectare]], [[litre]], [[tonne]], [[astronomical unit]]
*:Some of the units listed in Table 7 and Table 8 are also accepted for use with the SI.
* '''Non-SI units whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally''' (Table 7):
*:Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena, particularly when the quantities associated with these phenomena are many orders of magnitude greater than or less than the equivalent SI unit. The most common ones have been catalogued in the SI Brochure together with consistent symbols and accepted values, but with the caveat that their values in SI units need to be measured.
*::[[electronvolt]] (symbol eV), and [[Atomic mass unit|dalton/unified atomic mass unit]] (Da or u)
[[File:Clinical Mercury Manometer.jpg|thumb|[[Sphygmomanometer]] – the traditional device that measures blood pressure using [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in a manometer. Pressures are recorded in "[[Pressure measurement#Liquid column (manometer)|millimetres of mercury]]" – a non-SI unit]]
* '''Other non-SI units''' (Table 8):
*:A number of non-SI units that had never been formally sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including [[health care]] and [[navigation]]. As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used.
*::[[Bar (unit)|bar]], [[millimetre of mercury]], [[ångström]], [[nautical mile]], [[Barn (unit)|barn]], [[knot (unit)|knot]], [[neper]], bel and [[decibel]]
*:The neper, bel and decibel have been accepted for use with the SI by the CIPM.
*:In the interests of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the [[curie]] (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|152}} the [[#Derived units|SI derived units]] becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the [[millimetre of mercury]] (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|127}}
* '''Non-SI units associated with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units''' (Table 9):
*:The SI manual also catalogues a number of legacy units of measure that are used in specific fields such as [[geodesy]] and [[geophysics]] or are found in the literature, particularly in [[Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field#Curved spacetime|classical and relativistic electrodynamics]] where they have certain advantages. The units that are catalogued are:
*::[[erg]], [[dyne]], [[Poise (unit)|poise]], [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]], [[Stilb (unit)|stilb]], [[phot]], [[Gal (unit)|gal]], [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]], [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], and [[oersted]].

===Common notions of the metric units===
The basic units of the metric system, as originally defined, represented common quantities or relationships in nature. They still do – the modern precisely defined quantities are refinements of definition and methodology, but still with the same magnitudes. In cases where laboratory precision may not be required or available, or where approximations are good enough, the original definitions may suffice.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;While the second is readily determined from the Earth's rotation period, the metre, originally defined in terms of the Earth's size and shape, is less amenable; however, that the Earth's circumference is very close to 40,000&amp;nbsp;km may be a useful mnemonic.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A second is 1/60 of a minute, which is 1/60 of an hour, which is 1/24 of a day, so a second is 1/86400 of a day; a second is the time it takes a dense object to freely fall 4.9 metres from rest.
*The metre is close to the length of a pendulum that has a period of 2 seconds; most dining tabletops are about 0.75 metre high; a very tall human (basketball forward) is about 2 metres tall.
*The kilogram is the mass of a litre of cold water; a cubic centimetre or millilitre of water has a mass of one gram; a 1-euro coin, 7.5&amp;nbsp;g; a Sacagawea US 1-dollar coin, 8.1&amp;nbsp;g; a UK 50-pence coin, 8.0&amp;nbsp;g.
*A candela is about the luminous intensity of a moderately bright candle, or 1 candle power; a 60&amp;nbsp;W tungsten-filament incandescent light bulb has a luminous intensity of about 64 candela.
*A mole of a substance has a mass that is its [[molecular mass]] expressed in units of grams; the mass of a mole of table salt is 58.4&amp;nbsp;g.
*A temperature difference of one kelvin is the same as one degree Celsius: 1/100 of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level; the absolute temperature in kelvins is the temperature in degrees Celsius plus about 273; human body temperature is about 37&amp;nbsp;°C or 310&amp;nbsp;K.
*A 60&amp;nbsp;W incandescent light bulb consumes 0.5 amperes at 120&amp;nbsp;V (US mains voltage) and about 0.26 amperes at 230&amp;nbsp;V (European mains voltage).

==Lexicographic conventions==
===Unit names===
The symbols for the SI units are intended to be identical, regardless of the language used,&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|130–135}} but unit names are ordinary nouns and use the character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned. Names of units follow the grammatical rules associated with [[common noun]]s: in English and in French they start with a lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal), even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter. This also applies to "degrees Celsius", since "degree" is the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/symbol.html |title=Using Abbreviations or Symbols |date=2004-07-14 |access-date=2013-12-11 |author-first=Russ |author-last=Rowlett |publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/measurement-units/si-conventions/ |title=SI Conventions |access-date=2013-12-11 |publisher=National Physical Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official British and American spellings for certain SI units differ – [[British English]], as well as Australian, Canadian and New Zealand English, uses the spelling ''deca-'', ''metre'', and ''litre'' whereas [[American English]] uses the spelling ''deka-'', ''meter'', and ''liter'', respectively.&lt;ref name="NIST330"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Unit symbols and the values of quantities {{anchor|SI_writing_style}}===
Although the writing of unit names is language-specific, the writing of unit symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|130–135}} The guideline produced by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)&lt;ref name="nist style"&gt;
{{Cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html |title=NIST Guide to SI Units&amp;nbsp;– Rules and Style Conventions |access-date=2009-12-29 |author-last1=Thompson |author-first1=A. |date=July 2008 |author-last2=Taylor |author-first2=B.

====General rules====
General rules&lt;ref name="generalrules" group="Note"&gt;Except where specifically noted, these rules are common to both the SI Brochure and the NIST brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; for writing SI units and quantities apply to text that is either handwritten or produced using an automated process:
* The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21&amp;nbsp;kg, {{val|7.3|e=2|u=m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, 22&amp;nbsp;K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C).&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°,&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;, and&amp;nbsp;&amp;Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.
* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.
* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, μ in μg). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in expressions (e.g., km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to (km)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (⋅) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N⋅m or N&amp;nbsp;m.
* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the "metre per second" can be written m/s, m&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. A solidus must not be used more than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove ambiguities; e.g., kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; are acceptable, but kg/m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is ambiguous and unacceptable.
[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|Acceleration due to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;The lowercase letters (neither "metres" nor "seconds" were named after people), the space between the value and the units, and the superscript "2" to denote "squared".]]
* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written "Pa", but the symbol for mole is written "mol". Thus, "T" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and "t" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase "L" or a lowercase "l", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter "l" to the numeral "1", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States "L" be used rather than "l".
* A plural of a symbol must not be used; e.g., 25&amp;nbsp;kg, not 25&amp;nbsp;{{Not a typo|kgs}}.
* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&amp;nbsp;mW and 1&amp;nbsp;MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt and megawatt).
* The symbol for the [[decimal marker]] is either a [[full stop|point]] or [[comma]] on the line. In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March–April 2008 |title=Period or Comma? Decimal Styles over Time and Place |url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf |journal=Science Editor |volume=31 |issue=2 |page=42 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228062258/http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-28 |author-first=Amelia A. |author-last=Williamson |access-date=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spaces should be used as a [[thousands separator]] ({{val|1000000}}) in contrast to commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries.
* Any line-break inside a number, inside a compound unit, or between number and unit should be avoided. Where this is not possible, line breaks should coincide with thousands separators.
* Since the value of "billion" and "trillion" can [[Long and short scales|vary from language to language]], the dimensionless terms "ppb" (parts per [[Billion (word)|billion]]) and "ppt" (parts per [[long and short scales|trillion]]) should be avoided. No alternative is suggested in the SI Brochure.

====Printing SI symbols====
The rules covering printing of quantities and units are part of ISO 80000-1:2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:80000:-1:ed-1:v1:en |title=ISO 80000-1:2009(en) Quantities and Units—Past 1:General |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |date=2009 |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further rules&lt;ref name="generalrules" group="Note"/&gt; are specified in respect of production of text using [[printing press]]es, [[word processor]]s, [[typewriter]]s and the like.

====Examples of the variety of symbols in use around the world for kilometres per hour====

[[File:SI Brochure Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of brochure ''[http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/ The International System of Units]'']]
The CGPM publishes a brochure that defines and presents the SI.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official version is in French, in line with the [[Metre Convention]].&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|102}} It leaves some scope for local interpretation, particularly regarding names and terms in different languages.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, the United States' [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has produced a version of the CGPM document (NIST SP 330) which clarifies local interpretation for English-language publications that use [[American English]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST330"&gt;{{Cite book |author-first1=Barry N. |author-last1=Taylor |author-first2=Ambler |author-last2=Thompson |title=The International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 330) |url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/07/sp330.pdf |access-date=2017-08-04 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |location=Gaithersburg, MD |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing and maintenance of the CGPM brochure is carried out by one of the committees of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM).
The definitions of the terms "quantity", "unit", "dimension" etc. that are used in the ''SI Brochure'' are those given in the [[International vocabulary of metrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/vim.html |title=The International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|International System of Quantities}}
The quantities and equations that provide the context in which the SI units are defined are now referred to as the ''[[International System of Quantities]]'' (ISQ).
The system is based on the [[Quantity#Quantity in physical science|quantities]] underlying each of the seven base units of the SI. Other quantities, such as [[area]], [[pressure]], and [[electrical resistance]], are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) |date=2012 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM): Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology |edition=3rd |chapter-url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |access-date=2015-03-28 |chapter=1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISQ is defined in the international standard [[ISO/IEC 80000]], and was finalised in 2009 with the publication of [[ISO 80000-1]].&lt;ref&gt;S.

==Realisation of units==
{{main|Realisation (metrology)}}
[[File:Silicon sphere for Avogadro project.jpg|thumb|upright|Silicon sphere for the [[Avogadro project]] used for measuring the Avogadro constant to a relative standard uncertainty of {{val|2|e=−8}} or less, held by [[Achim Leistner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Avogadro Project |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/mass-and-force/research/avogadro-project |publisher=National Physical Laboratory |access-date=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the ''mise en pratique''&lt;ref group="Note" name="Translation"&gt;This term is a [[#Metre Convention|translation]] of the official [French] text of the SI Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/new_si/mise-en-pratique.html |title=What is a mise en pratique? |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |access-date=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|168–169}}

The published ''mise en pratique'' is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined: the SI Brochure states that "any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any SI unit."&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|111}} In the current (2016) exercise to [[New SI definitions|overhaul the definitions of the base units]], various consultative committees of the CIPM have required that more than one ''mise en pratique'' shall be developed for determining the value of each unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In particular:
* At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative standard uncertainty in the determination of the [[kilogram]] of no more than {{val|5|e=-8}} and at least one of these values should be better than {{val|2|e=-8}}. Both the [[Kibble balance]] and the [[Avogadro project]] should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCM12.pdf#page=23 |title=Recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities to the International Committee for Weights and Measures |website=12th Meeting of the CCM |date=2010-03-26 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |location=Sèvres |access-date=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCQM16.pdf#page=40 |title=Recommendations of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance – Metrology in Chemistry to the International Committee for Weights and Measures |website=16th Meeting of the CCQM

==Evolution of the SI==
===Changes to the SI===
The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) has described SI as "the modern metric system".&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|95}} Changing technology has led to an evolution of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands – changes to SI itself, and clarification of how to use units of measure that are not part of SI but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis.

Since 1960 the CGPM has made a number of changes to the SI to meet the needs of specific fields, notably chemistry and radiometry. These are mostly additions to the list of named derived units, and include the ''[[Mole (unit)|mole]]'' (symbol mol) for an amount of substance, the ''[[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]'' (symbol Pa) for [[pressure]], the ''[[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]'' (symbol S) for electrical conductance, the ''[[becquerel]]'' (symbol Bq) for "[[Radioactive decay|activity]] referred to a [[radionuclide]]", the ''[[Gray (unit)|gray]]'' (symbol Gy) for ionising radiation, the ''[[sievert]]'' (symbol Sv) as the unit of dose equivalent radiation, and the ''[[katal]]'' (symbol kat) for [[catalytic activity]].&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|156}}&lt;ref&gt;p. 221 – McGreevy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|156}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|158}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|159}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Acknowledging the advancement of precision science at both large and small scales, the range of defined prefixes pico- (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) to tera- (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) was extended to 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|152}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|158}}&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|164}}

The 1960 definition of the standard metre in terms of wavelengths of a specific emission of the krypton 86 atom was replaced with the distance that light travels in a vacuum in exactly {{sfrac|{{val|299792458}}}} second, so that the speed of light is now an exactly specified constant of nature.

A few changes to notation conventions have also been made to alleviate lexicographic ambiguities. An analysis under the aegis of [[CSIRO]], published in 2009 by the [[Royal Society]], has pointed out the opportunities to finish the realisation of that goal, to the point of universal zero-ambiguity machine readability.&lt;ref name="Foster_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Foster |first=Marcus P. |year=2009 |title=Disambiguating the SI notation would guarantee its correct parsing |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society A|Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=465 |issue= 2104|pages=1227–1229 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/465/2104/1227.full.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0343 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[History of the metre|metre was redefined]] in 1960, the kilogram remained the only SI base unit directly based on a specific physical artefact, the [[international prototype of the kilogram]] (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK.&lt;ref name="NPL kg"&gt;{{cite web |title=Redefining the kilogram |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/redefining-the-kilogram/|publisher=UK National Physical Laboratory |access-date=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2nd and 3rd Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram, a significant divergence had occurred between the mass of the IPK and all of its official copies stored around the world: the copies had all noticeably increased in mass with respect to the IPK. During ''extraordinary verifications'' carried out in 2014 preparatory to redefinition of metric standards, continuing divergence was not confirmed. Nonetheless, the residual and irreducible instability of a physical IPK undermined the reliability of the entire metric system to precision measurement from small (atomic) to large (astrophysical) scales.

A proposal was made that:
*In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature – the [[Planck constant]], an [[elementary charge]], the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the [[Avogadro number]] – be defined to have exact values
*The International Prototype Kilogram be retired
*The current definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole be revised
*The wording of base unit definitions should change emphasis from explicit unit to explicit constant definitions.

The redefinitions were adopted at the 26th CGPM in November 2018, and will come into effect in May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/TGFC/Allowed/Minutes/CODATA_Minutes_14-BIPM-public.pdf |title=Report on the Meeting of the CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants |date=3–4 November 2014 |place=[[BIPM]] |author-first=B. |author-last=Wood |page=7 |quote=[BIPM director Martin] Milton responded to a question about what would happen if ... the CIPM or the CGPM voted not to move forward with the redefinition of the SI.

{{main|History of the metric system}}

===The improvisation of units===
The units and unit magnitudes of the metric system which became the SI were improvised piecemeal from everyday physical quantities starting in the mid-18th century. Only later were they moulded into an orthogonal coherent decimal system of measurement.

The degree centigrade as a unit of temperature resulted from the scale devised by Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] in 1742. His scale counter-intuitively designated 100 as the freezing point of water and 0 as the boiling point. Independently, in 1743, the French physicist [[Jean-Pierre Christin]] described a scale with 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point. The scale became known as the centi-grade, or 100 gradations of temperature, scale.

The metric system was developed from 1791 onwards by a committee of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], commissioned to create a unified and rational system of measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/name_kg.html |title=The name 'kilogram' |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |access-date=2006-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110300/http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/name_kg.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, which included preeminent French men of science,&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Measure of all Things—The Seven-Year-Odyssey that Transformed the World |author-last=Alder |author-first=Ken |date=2002 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11507-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89}} used the same principles for relating length, volume, and mass that had been proposed by the English clergyman [[John Wilkins]] in 1668&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/from-artefacts-to-atoms-the-bipm-and-the-search-for-ultimate-measurement-standards/oclc/705716998/viewport |title=From artefacts to atoms: the BIPM and the search for ultimate measurement standards |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2012 |page=xxvii |author-first=Terry |author-last=Quinn |quote=he [Wilkins] proposed essentially what became ... the French decimal metric system |isbn=978-0-19-530786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=John Wilkins |author-first=John |author-last=Wilkins |date=1668 |title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language |chapter=VII |pages=190–194 |publisher=The Royal Society}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf |title=Reproduction (33 MB) |access-date=2011-03-06}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf |access-date=2011-03-06 |title=Transcription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of using the Earth's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] as the basis of the definition of length, originally proposed in 1670 by the French abbot [[Gabriel Mouton|Mouton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830903071.html |title=Mouton, Gabriel |website=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |date=2008 |publisher=[[encyclopedia.com]] |access-date=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mouton"&gt;{{MacTutor |title=Gabriel Mouton |id=Mouton |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1791, the Assembly adopted the committee's proposed principles for the new decimal system of measure including the metre defined to be 1/10,000,000th of the length of the quadrant of earth's meridian passing through Paris, and authorised a survey to precisely establish the length of the meridian. In July 1792, the committee proposed the names ''[[metre]]'', ''[[are (unit)|are]]'', ''[[litre]]'' and ''[[grave (unit)|grave]]'' for the units of length, area, capacity, and mass, respectively. The committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal-based prefixes such as ''centi'' for a hundredth and ''kilo'' for a thousand.&lt;ref name="Tavernor"&gt;{{cite book |title=Smoot's Ear: The Measure of Humanity |author-first=Robert |author-last=Tavernor |date=2007 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=978-0-300-12492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

Later, during the process of adoption of the metric system, the Latin ''[[gram]]me'' and ''[[kilogram]]me'', replaced the former provincial terms ''gravet'' (1/1000 ''grave'') and ''grave''. In June 1799, based on the results of the meridian survey, the standard ''[[mètre des Archives]]'' and ''[[kilogramme des Archives]]'' were deposited in the [[Archives nationales (France)|French National Archives]]. Subsequently, that year, the metric system was adopted by law in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Bigourdan |author-first=Guillaume |author-link=Guillaume Bigourdan |title=Le Système Métrique Des Poids Et Mesures: Son Établissement Et Sa Propagation Graduelle, Avec L'histoire Des Opérations Qui Ont Servi À Déterminer Le Mètre Et Le Kilogramme (facsimile edition) |language=French |trans-title=The Metric System of Weights and Measures: Its Establishment and its Successive Introduction, with the History of the Operations Used to Determine the Metre and the Kilogram |orig-year=1901 |date=2012 |publisher=Ulan Press |asin=B009JT8UZU |asin-tld=co.uk |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon ridiculed it, and in 1812, introduced a replacement system, the ''mesures usuelles'' or "customary measures" which restored many of the old units, but redefined in terms of the metric system.

During the first half of the 19th century there was little consistency in the choice of preferred multiples of the base units: typically the myriametre ({{val|10000}}&amp;nbsp;metres) was in widespread use in both France and parts of Germany, while the kilogram ({{val|1000}} grams) rather than the myriagram was used for mass.&lt;ref name="Europa1842"/&gt;

In 1832, the German [[mathematician]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], assisted by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the Earth's magnetic field in terms of millimetres, grams, and seconds.&lt;ref name="SIHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/ |title=Brief history of the SI |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the strength of the Earth's magnetic field had only been described in [[Relative change and difference|relative term]]s. The technique used by Gauss was to equate the [[torque]] induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the Earth's magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity. The resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass, length and time to the magnetic field.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The strength of the earth's magnetic field was designated 1&amp;nbsp;G (gauss) at the surface ({{nowrap|1== 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅g&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf |title=The intensity of the Earth's magnetic force reduced to absolute measurement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A candlepower as a unit of illuminance was originally defined by an 1860 English law as the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing {{frac|1|6}} pound (76 grams) and burning at a specified rate. Spermaceti, a waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales, was once used to make high-quality candles. At this time the French standard of light was based upon the illumination from a [[Carcel lamp|Carcel oil lamp]]. The unit was defined as that illumination emanating from a lamp burning pure [[rapeseed oil]] at a defined rate. It was accepted that ten standard candles were about equal to one Carcel lamp.

{{main|Metre Convention}}
A French-inspired initiative for international cooperation in [[metrology]] led to the signing in 1875 of the [[Metre Convention]], also called Treaty of the Metre, by 17 nations.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, German Empire, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Ottoman Empire, United States and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt;{{rp|353–354}} Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram. In 1921, the Metre Convention was extended to include all physical units, including the ampere and others thereby enabling the CGPM to address inconsistencies in the way that the metric system had been used.&lt;ref name="LordKelvin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lord Kelvin, His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units |author-first=Paul |author-last=Tunbridge |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bZUK624LZBMC&amp;pg=PR2 |pages=42–46 |isbn=978-0-86341-237-0 |publisher=Peter Pereginus Ltd |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|96}}

One of each was selected at random to become the [[International prototype metre]] and [[International prototype kilogram]] that replaced the ''[[mètre des Archives]]'' and ''[[kilogramme des Archives]]'' respectively. Each member state was entitled to one of each of the remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{Cite journal |author-first=Robert A. |author-last=Nelson |title=Foundations of the international system of units (SI) |journal=Physics Teacher |date=1981 |page=597 |url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/lecdem/services/refs_scanned_WIP/1%20-%20Krishna's%20LECDEM/A101/GetPDFServlet.pdf}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) and others working under the auspices of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a coherent system of units with base units and derived units christened the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]] in 1874. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the CGS, including the [[erg]] for [[energy]], the [[dyne]] for [[force]], the [[barye]] for [[pressure]], the [[Poise (unit)|poise]] for [[dynamic viscosity]] and the [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]] for [[kinematic viscosity]].&lt;ref name="BIPMCentenary"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nOG0SxxEu64C&amp;pg=PA240 |page=12 |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875–1975: NBS Special Publication 420 |date=1975-05-20 |editor-last1=Page

In 1879, the CIPM published recommendations for writing the symbols for length, area, volume and mass, but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities. Beginning in about 1900, physicists who had been using the symbol "μ" (mu) for "micrometre" or "micron", "λ" (lambda) for "microlitre", and "γ" (gamma) for "microgram" started to use the symbols "μm", "μL" and "μg".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Thomas |author-last=McGreevy |editor-first1=Peter |editor-last1=Cunningham |title=The Basis of Measurement: Volume 2 – Metrication and Current Practice |pages=222–224 |isbn=978-0-948251-84-9 |date=1997 |publisher=Pitcon Publishing (Chippenham) Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 19th century three different systems of units of measure existed for electrical measurements: a [[CGS-based system for electrostatic units]], also known as the Gaussian or ESU system, a [[CGS-based system for electromechanical units]] (EMU) and an International system based on units defined by the Metre Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Weights, Measures and Units |author-first=Donald |author-last=Fenna |at=International unit |isbn=978-0-19-860522-5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; for electrical distribution systems. 
Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length, mass, and time using [[dimensional analysis]] was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems.&lt;ref name="Maxwell2"&gt;{{cite book |title=A treatise on electricity and magnetism |volume=2 |author-first=J. C. |author-last=Maxwell |author-link= |date=1873 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricandmag02maxwrich |pages=242–245 |access-date=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anomaly was resolved in 1901 when [[Giovanni Giorgi]] published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be [[electric current]], [[voltage]], or [[electrical resistance]].&lt;ref name="IECGiorgi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/beginning/giovanni_giorgi.htm |title=Historical figures: Giovanni Giorgi |date=2011 |publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] |access-date=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric current with named unit 'ampere' was chosen as the base unit, and the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of physics. This became the foundation of the MKS system of units.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of non-coherent units of measure based on the gram/kilogram, centimetre/metre and second, such as the ''[[Pferdestärke]]'' (metric horsepower) for [[Power (physics)|power]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/fileadmin/internet/Themenrundgaenge/hueterin_der_einheiten/einheiten_d.pdf |title=Die gesetzlichen Einheiten in Deutschland |language=German |page=6 |trans-title=List of units of measure in Germany |publisher=[[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) |access-date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;''Pferd'' is [[German language|German]] for "horse" and ''Stärke'' is German for "strength" or "power". The Pferdestärke is the power needed to raise 75&amp;nbsp;kg against gravity at the rate of one metre per second.

At the end of the [[Second World War]], a number of different systems of measurement were in use throughout the world. Some of these systems were metric system variations; others were based on [[Systems of measurement|customary system]]s of measure, like the U.S customary system and Imperial system of the UK and British Empire.

===The ''Practical system of units''===
{{missing info|section|changeover centigrade→Kelvin and candlepower→candela|date=December 2017}}
In 1948, the 9th CGPM commissioned a study to assess the measurement needs of the scientific, technical, and educational communities and "to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/6/|title=BIPM - Resolution 6 of the 9th CGPM|website=Bipm.org|accessdate=22 August 2017|date = 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; This working document was ''Practical system of units of measurement''. Based on this study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 defined an international system derived from six base units including units of temperature and optical radiation in addition to those for the MKS system mass, length, and time units and [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]]'s current unit. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin, and candela.

The 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known was laid down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/7/ |title=Resolution 7 of the 9th meeting of the CGPM (1948): Writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers |access-date=2012-11-06 |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be written and used and how the values of quantities should be expressed.&lt;ref name="SIBrochure"/&gt;{{rp|104,130}}

The '''job demands-resources model''' or '''JD-R model''' is an [[occupational stress]] model that suggests strain is a response to imbalance between demands on the individual and the resources he or she has to deal with those demands.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Bakker, A.B., &amp; Demerouti, E. (2007). The Job Demands-Resources model: State of the art. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 22, 309–328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2001a), "The job demands-resources model of burnout", Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 86, pp. 499–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JD-R was introduced as an alternative to other models of employee well-being, such as the [[Occupational health psychology#Demand-control model|demand-control model]] and the [[Occupational health psychology#Effort-reward imbalance model|effort-reward imbalance model]]. The authors of the JD-R model argue that these models "have been restricted to a given and limited set of predictor variables that may not be relevant for all job positions" (p.&amp;nbsp;309)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Therefore, the JD-R incorporates a wide range of working conditions into the analyses of organizations and employees. Furthermore, instead of focusing solely on negative outcome variables (e.g., burnout, ill health, and repetitive strain) the JD-R model includes both negative and positive indicators and outcomes of employee well-being.

== Basic assumptions ==
The JD-R model can be summarized with a short list of assumptions/premises:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., De Boer, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2003b), "Job demands and job resources as predictors of absence duration and frequency", Journal of Vocational Behavior, Vol. 62, pp. 341–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., Taris, T., Schaufeli, W.B. and Schreurs, P. (2003c), "A multi-group analysis of the Job Demands-Resources model in four home care organizations", International Journal of Stress Management, Vol. 10, pp. 16–38&lt;/ref&gt;

* Whereas every occupation may have its own specific risk factors associated with job stress, these factors can be classified in two general categories: job demands and job resources.
** '''Job demands''': physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job, that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills. Therefore, they are associated with certain physiological and/or psychological costs. Examples are, work pressure, emotional demands.
** '''Job resources:''' physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either or: functional in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological cost; stimulate personal growth, learning, and development. Examples are, career opportunities, supervisor coaching, role-clarity, and autonomy.
*** '''Workplace Resources vs. Personal Resources:''' The authors of the JD-R make a distinction between workplace resources and personal reources
* Two different underlying psychological processes play a role in the development of job strain and motivation.&lt;ref name="Huang 562–569"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jie|last2=Wang|first2=Yansong|last3=You|first3=Xuqun|date=2016-12-01|title=The Job Demands-Resources Model and Job Burnout: The Mediating Role of Personal Resources|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=562–569|doi=10.1007/s12144-015-9321-2|issn=1046-1310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first are physical and social resources available in the workplace setting. The latter, personal resources, are those the employee brings with them. These consist of specific personality traits: self-efficacy and optimism.&lt;ref name="Huang 562–569"/&gt; Both types of resources are powerful mediators of employee well-being (e.g. engagement).&lt;ref name="Huang 562–569"/&gt;
* '''Outcomes of Continued Job Strain'''
** Health impairment process: through this process, poorly designed jobs or chronic job demands exhaust employees' mental and physical resources. In turn, this might lead to the depletion of energy and to health problems.
* '''Outcomes of Abundant Job and Personal Resources'''
** Motivational process: through this process, job resources exert their motivating potential and lead to high work engagement, low cynicism, and excellent performance. Job resources may play either an intrinsic or an extrinsic motivational role.
* The interaction between job demands and job resources is important for the development of job strain and motivation as well. According to the JD-R model, job resources may buffer the effect of job demands on job strain, including burnout.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Which specific job resources buffer the effect of different job demands, depends on the particular work environment. Thus, different types of job demands and job resources may interact in predicting job strain. Good examples of job resources that have the potential of buffering job demands are performance feedback and social support (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;Haines, V.A., Hurlbert, J.S. and Zimmer, C. (1991), "Occupational stress, social support, and the buffer hypothesis", Work and Occupations, Vol. 18, pp. 212–35.&lt;/ref&gt;).
* Job resources particularly influence motivation or work engagement when job demands are high. This assumption is based on the premises of the conservation of resources (COR) theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hobfoll, S.E. (2001), "The influence of culture, community, and the nested-self in the stress process: advancing conservation of resources theory", Applied Psychology: An International Review, Vol. 50, pp. 337–70&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, people are motivated to obtain, retain and protect their resources, because they are valuable. Hobfoll (&lt;ref&gt;Hobfoll, S.E. (2002), "Social and psychological resources and adaptation", Review of General Psychology, Vol. 6, pp. 307–24.&lt;/ref&gt;) argues that resource gain acquires its saliency in the context of resource loss. This implies that job resources gain their motivational potential particularly when employees are confronted with high job demands. For example, when employees are faced with high emotional demands, the social support of colleagues might become more visible and more instrumental.

== Evidence ==

*Evidence for the dual process: a number of studies have supported the dual pathways to employee well being proposed by the JD-R model. It has been shown that the model can predict important organizational outcomes (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2003a), "Dual processes at work in a call centre: an application of the Job Demands-Resources model", European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, Vol. 12, pp. 393–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hakanen, J.J., Bakker, A.B. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2006), "Burnout and work engagement among teachers", Journal of School Psychology, Vol. 43, pp. 495–513&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Taken together, research findings support the JD-R model's claim that job demands and job resources initiate two different psychological processes, which eventually affect important organizational outcomes (see also,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaufeli, W.B. and Bakker, A.B. (2004), "Job demands, job resources, and their relationship with burnout and engagement: a multi-sample study", Journal of Organizational Behavior, Vol. 25, pp. 293–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaufeli, W.B., Bakker, A.B., &amp; Van Rhenen, W. (2009). How changes in job demands and resources predict burnout, work engagement, and sickness absenteeism. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 30, 893–917&lt;/ref&gt;). When both job demands and resources are high, high strain and motivation is to be expected. When both are low, absence of strain and motivation is to be expected. Consequently, the high demands-low resources condition should result in high strain and low motivation while the low demands-high resources condition should have as a consequence low strain and high motivation.
*Evidence for the buffer effect of job resources: some support has been obtained for the proposed interaction between job demands and job resources in their relationship with employee well being (see,&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Euwema, M.C. (2005), "Job resources buffer the effect of job demands on burnout", Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, Vol. 10, pp. 170–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xanthopoulou, D., Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2006), "The role of personal resources in the job demands-resources model", manuscript submitted for publication.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, most published studies on the model did either not examine or not report such interactions, whereas the practical relevance of this interaction – if present – is usually small. In a large-scale study, it was found that this interaction accounted for on average only 0.5% of the differences among workers in task enjoyment and work commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Van Veldhoven, M. &amp; Xanthopoulou, D. (2010), "Beyond the Demand-Control model: Thriving on high job demands and resources", Journal of Personnel Psychology, Vol. 9, pp. 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Evidence for the salience of job resources in the context of high job demands: one previous study outside the framework of the JD-R model has supported the hypothesis that resources gain their salience in the context of high demands (see.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, D.W., Folkman, S., Acree, M. and Moskowitz, J.T. (2000), "Coping and physical health during care-giving: the roles of positive and negative affect", Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 79, pp. 131–42.&lt;/ref&gt;) Studies using the JD-R model have shown that job resources particularly affect work engagement when job demands are high (see &lt;ref&gt;Hakanen, J.J., Bakker, A.B. and Demerouti, E. (2005), "How dentists cope with their job demands and stay engaged: the moderating role of job resources", European Journal of Oral Sciences, Vol. 113, pp. 479–87.&lt;/ref&gt;); and &lt;ref&gt;Bakker, A.B., Hakanen, J.J., Demerouti, E., &amp; Xanthopoulou, D. (2007). Job resources boost work engagement, particularly when job demands are high. Journal of Educational Psychology, 99, 274–284.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Practical implications ==
The JD-R model assumes that whereas every occupation may have its own specific working characteristics, these characteristics can be classified in two general categories (i.e. job demands and job resources), thus constituting an overarching model that may be applied to various occupational settings, irrespective of the particular demands and resources involved. The central assumption of the JD-R model is that job strain develops – irrespective of the type of job or occupation – when (certain) job demands are high and when (certain) job resources are limited. In contrast, work engagement is most likely when job resources are high (also in the face of high job demands). This implies that the JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Continuing Research ==
The most recent article written by the authors of the original JD-R paper proposes that the interactions of demands and resources are nuanced and not clearly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Arnold|date=10 October 2016|title=Job Demands–Resources Theory: Taking Stock and Looking Forward|url=http://ezproxy.neu.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy.neu.edu/docview/1826808940?accountid=12826|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Bakker and Demerouti suggest that demands may sometimes actually have a positive influence on the employee, by providing a challenge to be overcome rather than an insurmountable obstacle. In this same article, the authors describe a cumulative effect of demands and resources in their suggestion of gain and loss spirals. They conclude that these issues and that of workplace aggression may all be part of the JD-R framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1077">'''Mancuerda''' was a method of [[torture]].  A tight cord was wound around the [[arm]]s of the condemned. The executioner would then throw his entire weight backwards, or the pressure would be exerted by a lever.   

The cord cut through [[skin]] and [[muscle]] directly to the [[bone]].  Additional [[pain]] was produced by the fact that the body of the prisoner was stretched as in a rack, and the belt or girdle attached to the waist also contributed further to the suffering.

The procedure was repeated six or eight times, on different parts of the arms.  People subjected to such torture usually fainted from its effects.

[[Giovanni II Bentivoglio]], tyrant of [[Bologna]], is said to have subjected the astrologer [[Luca Gaurico]] to this method of torture after he was unhappy with a prediction that Gaurico had made.

'''Martin James McSorley''' (born May 18, 1963) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey|hockey]] player, who played in the [[National Hockey League]] from 1983 until 2000. A versatile player, he was able to play both the forward and defense positions.

A former [[head coach]] of the Springfield Falcons of the [[American Hockey League]] (2002–04), aside from his hockey career, McSorley has  worked as an actor, appearing in several film and television roles. McSorley was a valued teammate of [[Wayne Gretzky]] during their years playing together for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] and [[Los Angeles Kings]], where he served as an [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]]. In [[1999–2000 NHL season|2000]], his on-ice assault of [[Donald Brashear]] with his stick, in which Brashear suffered a severe concussion, led to McSorley's suspension and eventual retirement from the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and hockey career===
McSorley was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], but grew up near [[Cayuga, Ontario|Cayuga, Haldimand County, Ontario]]. He made his NHL debut in October 1983 with the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], but rose to fame after a trade in September 1985 brought him to the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. His arrival and physical presence soon made Edmonton's incumbent enforcer [[Dave Semenko]] expendable, and McSorley inherited the title of "[[Wayne Gretzky]]'s bodyguard".&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"/&gt;

This title would follow him to Los Angeles in 1988, when both he and Gretzky, along with [[Mike Krushelnyski]], were obtained by the [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]]. With the Kings, McSorley's bruising style made him a fan favorite; but he strove to improve his game beyond being primarily known as an enforcer, earning great respect around the league for his hard work ethic, his fine team play, and his articulate intelligence off the ice.&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakingslegends.blogspot.com/2008/06/marty-mcsorley.html|first=Joe|last=Pelletier|title=Los Angeles Kings legends: Marty McSorley|work=Greatest Hockey Legends.Com|date=5 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992–93 NHL regular season, McSorley led all defensemen in shorthanded goals with three.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1993_skaters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kings reached the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Montreal Canadiens]], but in Game 2 with the Kings up 2–1, McSorley was caught with an illegal stick, contributing to the Canadiens game-tying goal. Montreal ending up winning that game in overtime and ultimately took the series in five games. McSorley otherwise had ten points in the playoffs, and was the only King to score during the final game. Some suggested that he was the second most dominant King after Gretzky in the playoffs.&lt;ref name="lakingslegends.blogspot.com"/&gt;

McSorley remained with the Kings until an August 1993 trade sent him to [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]] in exchange for offensive forward [[Shawn McEachern]]; however, his stay in Pittsburgh would be brief (only 47 games). The Kings re-acquired him on February 16, 1994.&lt;ref name=melrose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/blogpost.htm?id=14845|title=O'Reilly situation is nothing new|author=Barry Melrose|publisher=nhl.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back with the Kings, he assisted on Gretzky's goal which broke [[Gordie Howe]]'s all-time goal-scoring record. On March 14, 1996, McSorley left the Kings' organization for good, traded to the [[New York Rangers]] as part of a multi-player deal.

After completing the [[1995-96 NHL season|1995–96 season]] with the Rangers, McSorley returned to the West Coast after being acquired by the [[San Jose Sharks]] in August 1996. He spent two injury-plagued seasons with the Sharks before returning to Edmonton as a free agent in October 1998. Confined to a part-time role in his second stint in Edmonton, he left after one season and signed with the [[Boston Bruins]] in December 1999.  As a Bruin, his NHL career would come to a sudden and infamous end in a game against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] on February 21, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/sports/hockey-mcsorley-s-stormy-career-makes-track-change-in-springfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assault conviction====
In a game between the Bruins and the [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]] in [[Vancouver]] on February 21, 2000, McSorley swung his stick and hit [[Donald Brashear]] in the head with 4.6 seconds left in the game. Brashear fell backwards and hit his head hard on the ice, losing consciousness and suffering a Grade III [[concussion]]. McSorley was charged with assault and suspended by the NHL for the remainder of the 1999–2000 season (including the playoffs) missing 23 games. On October 6, 2000, Judge William Kitchen of the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]] found him guilty of [[aggravated assault|assault with a weapon]] for his attack on Brashear. He was sentenced to 18 months probation. The trial was the first for an on-ice attack by an NHL player since [[Dino Ciccarelli]]'s 1988 trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&amp;page=1#.T81P58WuXh5|title=NHL Player Found Guilty of Assault|work=ESPN Sports |publisher=ABCNews.com|date=6 October 2000|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his assault conviction, his NHL suspension was extended to one full year through February 21, 2001.&lt;ref name='ABCNews-Nov-7-2000'&gt;{{cite news|title=McSorley Suspended From NHL Until Feb.|date=2000-11-07|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100192&amp;page=1#.T81KPMWuXh4|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   McSorley would never play in another NHL game.

During his suspension, he attempted to continue playing hockey in the United Kingdom with the [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]], where his elder brother Chris was coaching, but this move was blocked by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], in deference to the NHL suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/01/23/soice24.xml|title=Ice Hockey: McSorley foiled by ban|publisher=Telegraph|first=Paul|last=Newman|date=January 23, 2001|accessdate=February 23, 2015|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar intention to play in Germany for the [[Munich Barons]] also failed, but he then played for the [[Grand Rapids Griffins]] in their final [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]] season, dressing for 14 games.

In the autumn of 2001, following the completion of his suspension, McSorley again looked towards the other side of the Atlantic. He considered purchasing the then struggling [[Cardiff Devils]] team with his brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1644089.stm|title=Hardman McSorley dices with Devils|publisher=BBC News|date=8 November 2001|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to pursue a new player-coach role and to develop interest in the sport in the UK.

McSorley appeared as a guest player for both [[Great Britain national ice hockey team|Great Britain]] and the Cardiff Devils during a series of games in November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/1640600.stm|title=Ice fans snap up tickets|publisher=BBC News|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the business deal failed to materialise.

===Coaching career===
McSorley coached the [[American Hockey League]] team the [[Springfield Falcons]] between 2002 and 2004.

===Film and TV career===
From 1995 to 1997, McSorley also appeared in four movies in small roles: ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995), ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995), ''[[Con Air]]'' (1997) and ''[[Do Me A Favor (film)|Do Me A Favor]]'' (1997).

During the [[2005–06 NHL season]], McSorley worked for [[Fox Sports West]] in [[Los Angeles]], providing in-studio analysis of games involving the [[Los Angeles Kings]] or the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]. He provided color commentary for the [[San Jose Sharks]] games on FSN Bay Area during [[2006–07 NHL season]]. McSorley's time in that role ended mysteriously midway through the Sharks playoff series with Detroit, when the Sharks announced McSorley would not return for a Game 3 broadcast for personal reasons. No further explanation was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bayarearidersforum.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-213441.html|title=Popular Sharks TV analyst is back|work=San Jose Mercury News|first=David|last=Pollak|date=Aug 2, 2007|publisher=BARF-Bay Area Riders Forum-Community-Kitchen Sink blog|accessdate=2012-06-04}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in one episode of [[Urban Hellraisers (CSI Episode)|''CSI: Miami'']] in 2005 as rink manager Andrew Greven. On July 30, 2007, McSorley guest starred on [[ABC Family]]'s [[Greek (TV series)|''Greek'']] as himself playing a hockey goaltender. In February 2008, McSorley was featured as one of the pros on ''[[Pros vs Joes]]'' on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]].

Canadian singer-songwriter [[Kathleen Edwards]] referred to McSorley in her song "[[Asking for Flowers|I Make the Dough, You Get the Glory]]", with the lyric, "You're the [[Wayne Gretzky|Great One]], I'm Marty McSorley..., I make the dough, but you get the glory." McSorley appears in the song's [[music video]].&lt;ref name="nhl_ke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa singer Kathleen Edwards teams up with former NHL-ers for new video|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/ottawa-singer-kathleen-edwards-teams-up-with-former-nhl-ers-for-new-video/c-378371|website=NHL.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McSorley is currently a TV analyst for [[Sportsnet]] and occasionally ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. He is a regular at [[Staples Center]] during Kings hockey games.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/kings/story/2012-05-27/marty-mcsorley-illegal-stick-curse/55238940/1 McSorley profile], usatoday30.usatoday.com; accessed February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
McSorley currently resides in [[Hermosa Beach, CA|Hermosa Beach]], [[California]]. He married beach volleyball player [[Leanne Schuster]] in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvbinfo.com/player.asp?ID=1195 |title=Leanne Schuster: Career |work=Beach Volleyball Database |accessdate=February 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223190455/http://www.bvbinfo.com/player.asp?ID=1195 |archivedate=February 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">A '''Maucha diagram''', or '''Maucha symbol''', is a graphical representation of the major cations and anions in a chemical sample. R. Maucha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anon | first1 =  | year = 1960 | title = Prof. dr. r. maucha 75 jahr | doi = 10.1007/bf00047129 | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 287–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published the symbol in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Maucha, R., 1932. Hydrochemische Methoden in der Limnologie XII. Schweizerbart, Stuttgart, pp. 1-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maucha Key.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Maucha diagram|Maucha ionic diagram]]

It is mainly used by biologists and chemists for quickly recognising samples by their chemical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G. E., 1957. Inorganic ions of rain, lakes, rivers. Vol. I. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hassel | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Dooris | first2 = P. M. | last3 = Martin | first3 = D. F. | year = 1997 | title = Maucha diagrams and chemical analyses to diagnose changes in lake chemistry | url = | journal = Florida Scientist | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 75–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol is similar in concept to the [[Stiff diagram]]. It conveys similar ionic information to the [[Piper diagram]], though in a more compact format that is suitable as a map symbol or for showing changes with time. The Maucha diagram is a special case of the [[Radar chart]] and overcomes some of the limitations of the [[Pie chart]] by having equal angles for all variables and consistently showing each variable in the same position.

The star shape comprises eight kite-shaped polygons, the area of each of which is proportional to the concentration of an ion in milliequivalents per litre. The anions carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride and sulphate are on the left, while the cations potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are on the right. The total ionic concentration adds up to the area of the background circle, the total anion concentration adds up to the left semicircle and the total cation concentration adds up to the right semicircle. A method for drawing the diagram in R is available on GitHub &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/fkeck/oviz&lt;/ref&gt;.

Broch and Yake modified Maucha's original fixed-size diagram by scaling for concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broch | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Yake | first2 = W. | year = 1969 | title = A modification of Maucha's ionic diagram to include ionic concentrations | doi = 10.4319/lo.1969.14.6.0933 | journal = Limnology and Oceanography | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 933–935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further scaling using the logarithm of the ionic concentration enables the plotting of a wide range of concentrations on a single map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = J.

M. | year = 1995 | title = Geographical patterns, and their origins, in the dominance of major ions in South African rivers | url = | journal = South African Journal of Science | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 299–306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31645">{{About|the mathematical concept|the computer science data structure|Multiset (abstract data type)}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''multiset''' (aka '''bag''' or '''mset''') is a modification of the concept of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that, unlike a set, allows for multiple instances for each of its [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s. The positive integer number of instances, given for each element is called the '''multiplicity''' of this element in the multiset. As a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist, which contain only elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, but vary by the multiplicity of their elements:
* The set {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b''}}}} contains only elements {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, each having multiplicity 1, when {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b''}}}} is seen as a multiset.
* In multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}}}}, the element {{math|''a''}} has multiplicity 2, and {{math|''b''}} has multiplicity 1.
* In multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''b'', ''b'', ''b''}}}}, {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} both have multiplicity 3.

These objects are all different, when viewed as  multisets, although they are the same [[set theory|set]], since they all consist of the same elements. As with sets, and in contrast to [[tuple]]s, order does not matter in discriminating multisets,  so {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}}}} and {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b'', ''a''}}}} denote the same multiset.  To distinguish between sets and multisets, a notation that incorporates square brackets is sometimes used: the multiset {{math|{{mset|a, a, b}}}} can be denoted as {{math|[a, a, b]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discrete mathematics|first=James L.|last=Hein|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year=2003|isbn=0-7637-2210-3|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cardinality]] of a multiset is constructed by summing up the multiplicities of all its elements. For example, in the multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b'', ''b'', ''b'', ''c''}}}} the multiplicities of the members {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are respectively 2, 3, and 1, and therefore the cardinality of this multiset is 6.

[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] coined the word ''multiset'' in the 1970s, according to [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref name="Knuth1998"&gt;{{cite book

However, the use of the concept for multisets predates the coinage of word ''multiset'' by many centuries. Knuth himself attributes the first study of multisets to the Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II|Bhāskarāchārya]], who described permutations of multisets around 1150. Knuth also lists other names that were proposed or used for this concept, including ''list'', ''bunch'', ''bag'', ''heap'', ''sample'', ''weighted set'', ''collection'', and ''suite''.&lt;ref name="Knuth1998"/&gt;{{rp|694}}

==History==
Wayne Blizard traced multisets back to the very origin of numbers, arguing that “in ancient times, the number ''n'' was often represented by a collection of ''n'' strokes, tally marks, or units.”&lt;ref name="Blizard1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D|year=1989|title=Multiset theory|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=30|issue=1|pages=36–66|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1093634995|doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093634995}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and similar collections of objects are multisets, because strokes, tally marks, or units are considered indistinguishable. This shows that people implicitly used multisets even before mathematics emerged.

Practical needs for this structure have caused multisets to be rediscovered several times, appearing in literature under different names.&lt;ref name="Blizard1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D.|year=1991|title=The Development of Multiset Theory|journal=Modern Logic|volume=1|issue=4|pages=319–352|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rml/1204834739}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323}} For instance, they were important in early AI languages, such as QA4, where they were referred to as ''bags,'' a term attributed to Peter Deutsch.&lt;ref name="Rulifson1972"&gt;{{cite techreport|last1=Rulifson|first1=J.

Although multisets were used implicitly from ancient times, their explicit exploration happened much later. The first known study of multisets is attributed to the Indian mathematician [[Bhāskara II|Bhāskarāchārya]] circa 1150, who described permutations of multisets.&lt;ref name="Knuth1998"/&gt;{{rp|694}} The work of [[Marius Nizolius]] (1498–1576) contains another early reference to the concept of multisets.&lt;ref name="Angelelli1965"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angelelli|first=I.|year=1965|title=Leibniz's misunderstanding of Nizolius' notion of 'multitudo'|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|issue=6|pages=319–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius Kircher]] found the number of multiset permutations when one element can be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|authorlink=Athanasius Kircher|year=1650|title=Musurgia Universalis|publisher=Corbelletti|location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Prestet]] published a general rule for multiset permutations in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prestet|first=Jean|year=1675|title=Elemens des Mathematiques|publisher=André Pralard|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wallis]] explained this rule in more detail in 1685.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=John|authorlink=John Wallis|year=1685|title=A treatise of algebra|publisher=John Playford|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multisets appeared explicitly in the work of [[Richard Dedekind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dedekind|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dedekind|year=1888|title=Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?|publisher=Vieweg|location=Braunschweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syropoulos|first=Apostolos|year=2001|chapter=Mathematics of Multisets|editor-first=C. S.|editor-last=Calude|title=Multiset processing: Mathematical, computer science, and molecular computing points of view|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=347&amp;ndash;358|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mathematicians formalized multisets and began to study them as precise mathematical structures in the 20th century.  For example, Whitney (1933) described ''generalized sets'' ("sets" whose [[characteristic function]]s may take any integer  value -  positive, negative or zero).&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|326}}&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitney |first1=H. |title=Characteristic  Functions  and  the  Algebra  of  Logic |journal=Annals of Mathematics |date=1933 |volume=34 |pages=405-414}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|405}}  Monro (1987) investigated the [[category theory|category]] '''Mul''' of multisets and their morphisms, defining a ''multiset'' as a set with an equivalence relation between elements "of the same ''sort''", and a ''morphism'' between multisets as a function which respects ''sorts''.  He also introduced a ''multinumber'': a function ''f(x)'' from a multiset to the natural numbers, giving the ''multiplicity'' of element ''x'' in the multiset.  Monro argued that the concepts of multiset and multinumber are often mixed indiscriminately, though both are useful.&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|327-328}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monro |first1=G. P. |title=The Concept of Multiset |journal=Zeitschrift für Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik |date=1987 |volume=33 |pages=171-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the simplest and most natural examples is the multiset of [[prime number|prime]] factors of a number {{math|''n''}}. Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime [[divisor]]s of {{math|''n''}}. For example, the number [[120 (number)|120]] has the [[prime factorization]]
:&lt;math&gt;120 = 2^3 3^1 5^1&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the multiset {{math|{{mset|2, 2, 2, 3, 5}}}}.

A related example is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation. A [[quadratic equation]], for example, has two solutions. However, in some cases they are both the same number.  Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be {{math|{{mset|3, 5}}}}, or it could be {{math|{{mset|4, 4}}}}.  In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2. More generally, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the [[complex number|complex]] solutions of a [[polynomial equation]] of degree {{mvar|d}} always form a multiset of cardinality {{mvar|d}}.

A special case of the above are the [[eigenvalue]]s of a matrix, if these are defined as the multiset of roots of its [[characteristic polynomial]]. However a choice is made here: the (usual) definition of eigenvalues does not refer to the characteristic polynomial, and this give rise to another notion of multiplicity, and therefore to another multiset. The [[geometric multiplicity]] of an eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}} of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is the [[dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of the kernel of {{math|''A'' – ''λI''}}; the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is not larger and often smaller than its ''algebraic multiplicity'', which is the multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial. The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of {{math|''A''}}. Therefore, the multiset of eigenvalues with geometric multiplicities is the multiset of roots of the minimal polynomial.

==Definition==
A '''multiset''' may be formally defined as a 2-[[tuple]] {{math|(''A'', ''m'')}} where {{math|''A''}} is the ''underlying set'' of the multiset, formed from its distinct elements, and &lt;math&gt;m\colon A \to \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''A''}} to the set of the [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s, giving the ''multiplicity'', that is, the number of occurrences, of the element {{math|''a''}} in the multiset as the number {{math|''m''(''a'')}}.

Representing the function {{math|''m''}} by its [[graph (function)|graph]], that is the set of [[ordered pair]]s &lt;math&gt;\left\{\left(a, m\left(a\right)\right) : a \in A\right\},&lt;/math&gt; allows for writing the multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}}}} as {{math|({''a'', ''b''}, {(''a'', 2), (''b'', 1)})}}, and the multiset {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''b''}}}} as {{math|({''a'', ''b''}, {(''a'', 1), (''b'', 1)})}}. This notation is however not commonly used and more compact notations are employed.

If &lt;math&gt;A=\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finite set]], the multiset {{math|(''A'', ''m'')}} is often represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{a_1^{m(a_1)}, \ldots,a_n^{m(a_n)}  \right\},\quad&lt;/math&gt; sometimes simplified to &lt;math&gt;\quad a_1^{m(a_1)} \cdots a_n^{m(a_n)},&lt;/math&gt;

where upper indices equal to 1 are omitted. For example, the multiset {{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''b''}} may be written &lt;math&gt;\{a^2,b\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a^2b.&lt;/math&gt; If the elements of the multiset are numbers, a confusion is possible with ordinary [[arithmetic operations]], those  normally can be excluded from the context. On the other hand, the latter notation is coherent with the fact that the [[prime factorization]] of a positive integer is a uniquely defined multiset, as asserted by the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. Also, a [[monomial]] is a multiset of [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s.{{explain|date=March 2018}}

A multiset corresponds to an ordinary set if the multiplicity of every element is one (as opposed to some larger natural number). An [[indexed family]], {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;i∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}},  where {{math|''i''}} varies over some index-set ''I'', may define a multiset, sometimes written {{math|{{mset|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. In this view the underlying set of the multiset is given by the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the family, and the multiplicity of any element {{math|''x''}} is the number of index values {{math|''i''}} such that &lt;math&gt;a_i = x&lt;/math&gt;. In this article the multiplicities are considered to be finite, i.e. no element occurs infinitely many times in the family: even in an infinite multiset, the multiplicities are finite numbers.

It is possible to extend the definition of a multiset by allowing multiplicities of individual elements to be infinite cardinals instead of natural numbers, but not all properties carry over to this generalization.

==Basic properties and operations==
Elements of a multiset are generally taken in a fixed set {{mvar|U}}, sometimes called a ''universe'', which is typically the set of [[natural number]]s. An element of {{mvar|U}} that does not belong to a given multiset is said to have a multiplicity 0 in this multiset. This extends the multiplicity function of the multiset to a function from {{mvar|U}} to the set &lt;math&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; of [[nonnegative integer]]s. This defines a one to one correspondence between these functions and the multisets that have their elements in {{mvar|U}}.

This extended multiplicity function is commonly called simply the '''multiplicity function''', and suffices for defining multisets, when the universe containing the elements has been fixed. This multiplicity function is a generalization of the [[indicator function]] of a subset, and shares some properties with it.

The '''support''' of a multiset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in a universe {{mvar|U}} is the underlying set of the multiset. Using the multiplicity function &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, it is characterized as 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Supp}(A) := \left\{x \in U \mid m_{A}(x) &gt; 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A multiset is ''finite'' if its support is finite, or, equivalently, if its cardinality
:&lt;math&gt;|A| = \sum_{x\in \operatorname{Supp}(A)}m_A(x)= \sum_{x\in U}m_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. The ''empty multiset'' is the unique multiset with an empty support (underlying set), and thus a cardinality 0.

The usual operations of sets may be extended to multisets by using the multiplicity function, in a similar way as using the indicator function for subsets. In the following, {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are multisets in a given universe {{mvar|U}}, with multiplicity functions &lt;math&gt;m_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_B.&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Inclusion:''' {{mvar|A}} is included in {{mvar|B}}, denoted {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}}, if
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in U, m_A(x) \le  m_B(x).&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Intersection:''' the ''intersection'' (called, in some contexts, the ''infimum'' or ''greatest common divisor'') of {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is the multiset {{mvar|C}} with multiplicity function
::&lt;math&gt;m_C(x) = \min(m_A(x),m_B(x))\quad\forall x\in U.&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Union:''' the ''union'' (called, in some contexts, the ''maximum'' or ''lowest common multiple'') of {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} is the multiset {{mvar|C}} with multiplicity function
::&lt;math&gt;m_C(x) = \max(m_A(x),m_B(x))\quad\forall x\in U.&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
*'''Sum:''' the sum of multisets may be viewed as a generalization of the [[disjoint union]] of sets, and is defined by 
::&lt;math&gt;m_C(x) = m_A(x) + m_B(x)\quad\forall x\in U.&lt;/math&gt;
:The sum defines a [[commutative monoid]] structure on the finite multisets in a given universe. This monoid is a [[free commutative monoid]], with the universe as a basis.

Two multisets are ''disjoint'' if their supports are [[disjoint sets]]. This is equivalent to saying that their intersection is the empty multiset or that their sum equals their union.

{{See also|Stars and bars (combinatorics)}}
The number of multisets of cardinality {{math|''k''}}, with elements taken from a finite set of cardinality {{math|''n''}}, is called the '''multiset coefficient''' or '''multiset number'''. This number is written by some authors as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt;, a notation that is meant to resemble that of [[binomial coefficient]]s; it is used for instance in (Stanley, 1997), and could be pronounced "{{math|''n''}} multichoose {{math|''k''}}" to resemble "{{math|''n''}} choose {{math|''k''}}" for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike for binomial coefficients, there is no "multiset theorem" in which multiset coefficients would occur, and they should not be confused with the unrelated [[multinomial coefficient]]s that occur in the [[multinomial theorem]].

The value of multiset coefficients can be given explicitly as
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = {n+k-1 \choose k} = \frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!\,(n-1)!} = {n(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+k-1)\over k!},&lt;/math&gt;
where the second expression is as a binomial coefficient; many authors in fact avoid separate notation and just write binomial coefficients. So, the number of such multisets is the same as the number of subsets of cardinality {{math|''k''}} in a set of cardinality {{math|''n'' + ''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}. The analogy with binomial coefficients can be stressed by writing the numerator in the above expression as a [[rising factorial power]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = {n^{\overline{k}}\over k!},&lt;/math&gt;
to match the expression of binomial coefficients using a falling factorial power:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k} = {n^{\underline{k}}\over k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

There are for example 4 '''multisets''' of cardinality 3 with elements taken from the set {{math|{{mset|1, 2}}}} of cardinality 2 ({{math|''n''}} = 2, {{math|''k''}} = 3), namely {{math|{{mset|1, 1, 1}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 1, 2}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 2}}}}, {{math|{{mset|2, 2, 2}}}}. There are also 4 '''subsets''' of cardinality 3 in the set {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 3, 4}}}} of cardinality 4 ({{math|''n'' + ''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}), namely {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 3}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 4}}}}, {{math|{{mset|1, 3, 4}}}}, {{math|{{mset|2, 3, 4}}}}.

One simple way to prove the equality of multiset coefficients and binomial coefficients given above, involves representing multisets in the following way.  First, consider the notation for multisets that would represent {{math|{{mset|''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''a'', ''b'', ''b'', ''c'', ''c'', ''c'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d'', ''d''}}}} (6 {{math|''a''}}s, 2 {{math|''b''}}s, 3 {{math|''c''}}s, 7 {{math|''d''}}s) in this form:

:&lt;math&gt;{\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet} \mid {\bullet \bullet} \mid {\bullet \bullet \bullet} \mid {\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet} &lt;/math&gt;

This is a multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}} = 18 made of elements of a set of cardinality {{math|''n''}} = 4.  The number of characters including both dots and vertical lines used in this notation is 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  The number of vertical lines is 4 &amp;minus; 1.  The number of multisets of cardinality 18 is then the number of ways to arrange the 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 vertical lines among the 18 + 4 &amp;minus; 1 characters, and is thus the number of subsets of cardinality 4 &amp;minus; 1 in a set of cardinality 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  Equivalently, it is the number of ways to arrange the 18 dots among the 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 characters, which is the number of subsets of cardinality 18 of a set of cardinality 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. This is
:&lt;math&gt;{4+18-1 \choose 4-1}={4+18-1 \choose 18} = 1330,&lt;/math&gt;
thus is the value of the multiset coefficient and its equivalencies:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{4\choose18}\!\!\right)={21\choose18}=\frac{21!}{18!\,3!}={21\choose3}=\left(\!\!{19\choose3}\!\!\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{{\color{red}{\mathfrak{
4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10\cdot11\cdot12\cdot13\cdot14\cdot15\cdot16\cdot17\cdot18}}}
\cdot
\mathbf{19\cdot20\cdot21}}{\mathbf{1\cdot2\cdot3}
\cdot
{\color{red}{\mathfrak{
4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10\cdot11\cdot12\cdot13\cdot14\cdot15\cdot16\cdot17\cdot18}}}},&lt;/math&gt;
:
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{
1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdots16\cdot17\cdot18\;\mathbf{\cdot\;19\cdot20\cdot21}}
{\,1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdots
16\cdot17\cdot18\,\times\,\mathbf{1\cdot2\cdot3\quad}},&lt;/math&gt;
:
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{19\cdot20\cdot21}{1\cdot2\cdot3}.&lt;/math&gt;

One may define a generalized binomial coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}={n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1) \over k!}&lt;/math&gt;
in which {{math|''n''}} is not required to be a nonnegative integer, but may be negative or a non-integer, or a non-real [[complex number]].  (If {{math|''k''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then the value of this coefficient is 1 because it is the [[empty product]].)  Then the number of multisets of cardinality {{math|''k''}} in a set of cardinality {{math|''n''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right)=(-1)^k{-n \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Recurrence relation ===
A [[recurrence relation]] for multiset coefficients may be given as
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = \left(\!\!{n\choose k - 1}\!\!\right) + \left(\!\!{n-1\choose k}\!\!\right) \quad \mbox{for } n,k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n \choose 0}\!\!\right) = 1,\quad n\in\N, \quad\mbox{and}\quad \left(\!\!{0 \choose k}\!\!\right) = 0,\quad k&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above recurrence may be interpreted as follows.
Let {{math|[''n'']}}&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\{1,\cdots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; be the source set. There is always exactly one (empty) multiset of size 0, and if {{math|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 there are no larger multisets, which gives the initial conditions.

Now, consider the case in which {{math|''n'',''k''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. A multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}} with elements from {{math|[''n'']}} might or might not contain any instance of the final element {{math|''n''}}. If it does appear, then by removing {{math|''n''}} once, one is left with a multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 of elements from {{math|[''n'']}}, and every such multiset can arise, which gives a total of
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k - 1}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; possibilities.

If {{math|''n''}} does not appear, then our original multiset is equal to a multiset of cardinality {{math|''k''}} with elements from {{math|[''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1]}}, of which there are
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n-1\choose k}\!\!\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose k}\!\!\right) = \left(\!\!{n\choose k - 1}\!\!\right) + \left(\!\!{n-1\choose k}\!\!\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Generating series===
The [[generating function]] of the multiset coefficients is very simple, being
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d=0}^\infty \left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)t^d=\frac{1}{(1-t)^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
As multisets are in one to one correspondence with monomials, &lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; is also the number of [[monomial]]s of degree {{mvar|d}} in {{mvar|n}} indeterminates. Thus, above series is also the [[Hilbert series]] of the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[x_1, \ldots, x_n].&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in {{mvar|n}}, it is defined for any [[complex number|complex]] value of {{mvar|n}}.

=== Generalization and connection to the negative binomial series ===
The multiplicative formula allows the definition of multiset coefficients to be extended by replacing ''n'' by an arbitrary number ''α'' (negative, real, complex):
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{\alpha\choose k}\!\!\right) = \frac{\alpha^{\overline k}}{k!} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha+1)(\alpha+2)\cdots(\alpha+k-1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}
  \quad\text{for } k\in\N \text{ and arbitrary } \alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;

With this definition one has a generalization of the negative binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies calling the &lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!{\alpha\choose k}\!\!\right)&lt;/math&gt; negative binomial coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt; (1-X)^{-\alpha} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\!\!{\alpha\choose k}\!\!\right) X^k.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[Taylor series]] formula is valid for all complex numbers ''α'' and ''X'' with {{abs|''X''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1. It can also be interpreted as an identity of [[formal power series]] in ''X'', where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of series with constant coefficient equal to&amp;nbsp;1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for [[exponentiation]], notably

:&lt;math&gt;(1-X)^{-\alpha}(1-X)^{-\beta}=(1-X)^{-(\alpha+\beta)} \quad\text{and}\quad ((1-X)^{-\alpha})^{-\beta}=(1-X)^{-(-\alpha\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;,
and formulas such as these can be used to prove identities for the multiset coefficients.

If ''α'' is a nonpositive integer ''n'', then all terms with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;−''n'' are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum. However, for other values of ''α'', including positive integers and rational numbers, the series is infinite.

==Applications==
Multisets have various applications.&lt;ref name="Singh2007" /&gt; They are becoming fundamental in [[combinatorics]].&lt;ref name="Aigner1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aigner|first=M.|year=1979|title=Combinatorial Theory|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=New York/Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=I.|year=1987|title=Combinatorics of Finite Sets|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Richard P.|authorlink=Richard P.

Multisets also play an important role in computer science.&lt;ref name="Knuth1998" /&gt;

There are also other applications. For instance, [[Richard Rado]] used multisets as a device to investigate the properties of families of sets. He wrote, "The notion of a set takes no account of multiple occurrence of any one of its members, and yet it is just this kind of information which is frequently of importance. We need only think of the set of roots of a polynomial f(x) or the spectrum of a linear operator."&lt;ref name="Blizard1991" /&gt;{{rp|328-329}}

==Generalizations==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}

Different generalizations of multisets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems.
* Real-valued multisets (in which multiplicity of an element can be any real number)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D.|year=1989|title=Real-valued Multisets and Fuzzy Sets|journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems|volume=33|pages=77–97|doi=10.1016/0165-0114(89)90218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blizard1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blizard|first=Wayne D.|year=1990|title=Negative Membership|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=31|issue=1|pages=346–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:This seems straightforward, as many definitions for fuzzy sets and multisets are very similar and can be taken over for real-valued multisets by just replacing the value range of the characteristic function ([0, 1] or ℕ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} respectively) by ℝ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = [0, ∞[. However, this approach cannot be easily extended for generalized fuzzy sets which use a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]] instead of a simple degree of membership. Several other approaches for fuzzy multisets have been developed that don't have this restriction.

[[File:Tongass national forest juneau img 7501.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] is managed by the [[United States Forest Service]]]]

'''Natural resource management''' refers to the management of [[natural resource]]s such as [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, with a particular focus on how management affects the [[quality of life]] for both present and future generations ([[stewardship]]).

Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural [[landscapes]] interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, [[Conservation biology|biodiversity conservation]], and the future sustainability of industries like [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Resilient landscapes and communities  managing natural resources in New South Wales|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173746/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and [[ecology]] and the life-supporting capacity of those resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Massey University|url=http://study.massey.ac.nz/massey/students/studymassey/programme.cfm?major_code=2261&amp;prog_code=93013|title=Bachelor of Applied Science (Natural Resource Management)|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental management]] is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the [[Rural sociology|sociology of natural resources]] is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.

==History==
[[File:US-DOI-BureauOfLandManagement-Logo.svg|thumb|right|135px|The [[Bureau of Land Management]] in the United States manages America's [[public land]]s, totaling approximately 264 million acres (1,070,000 km2) or one-eighth of the landmass of the country.]]

The emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of [[North America]]n [[rangeland]]s in the late 19th century, and the [[Conservation movement|resource conservation]] movement of the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley University of California: Geography: [http://geography.berkeley.edu/programcourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf Geog 175: Topics in the History of Natural Resource Management: Spring 2006: Rangelands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611112307/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Department of Geography: GEOG 657/ENVS 657:  Natural Resource Management:  Biotic Resources: [http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf Natural Resource Management and Environmental History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217101744/http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources. A more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social, cultural, economic and political aspects of resource management.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thakadu |first=O. T. |year=2005 |title=Success factors in community based natural resources management in northern Botswana: Lessons from practice |journal=Natural Resources Forum |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=199–212 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-8947.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the [[Brundtland Commission]] and the advocacy of [[sustainable development]].

In 2005 the government of [[New South Wales]], established a ''Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NSW Government 2005, Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management, NSW Natural Resources Commission, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the consistency of practice, based on an [[adaptive management]] approach.

In the [[United States]], the most active areas of natural resource management are [[wildlife management]] often associated with [[ecotourism]] and [[rangeland management]]. In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.

==Ownership regimes==

Natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:

* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.

* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.

* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.

* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that "Everybody's property is nobody's property". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.

* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholder analysis==

[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity. Stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Dandy"&gt;Dandy, N. et al. (2009) ‘Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management,’ Journal of Environmental Management, vol. 90, pp. 1933–1949&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below. Especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder.&lt;ref name="Billgrena"&gt;Billgrena, C., Holme, H. (2008) ‘Approaching reality: Comparing stakeholder analysis and cultural theory in the context of natural resource management,’ Land Use Policy, vol. 25, pp. 550–562&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised.

Billgrena and Holme&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt; identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:

*Identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence
*Develop an understanding of why changes occur
*Establish who can make changes happen
*How to best manage natural resources

This gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimble, R|date=1998|title=Stakeholder methodologies in natural resource management, Socioeconomic Methodologies|publisher=Chatham: Natural Resources Institute|pages=1–12|url=http://www.nri.org/old/publications/bpg/bpg02.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous stakeholder theories such as Mitchell et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell, R. K.|date=1997|title=TOWARD A THEORY OF STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION AND SALIENCE: DEFINING THE PRINCIPLE OF WHO AND WHAT REALLY COUNTS|publisher=Academy of Management Review|volume=22|number=4|pages=853–886|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt; created a framework of stages for a Stakeholder Analysis in natural resource management. Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;  designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management.

'''Stages in Stakeholder analysis:'''&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;
#        Clarify objectives of the analysis
#       Place issues in a systems context
#        Identify decision-makers and stakeholders
#         Investigate stakeholder interests and agendas
#           Investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence  (e.g. conflicts and compatibilities, trade-offs and synergies)

'''Application:'''

Grimble and Wellard&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt; established that Stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as;

*	Cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests
*	Multiple uses and users of the resource.
*	[[Market failure]]
*	[[Subtractability]] and temporal trade-offs
*	Unclear or [[open-access]] [[property rights]]
*	Untraded products and services
*	[[Poverty]] and under-representation&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

'''Case studies:'''

In the case of the [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]], a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the Batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people's livelihoods and loss of life.&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

Nepal, Indonesia and Koreas' [[community forestry#5Best Practices|community forestry]] are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources. This allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests.

'''Criticisms:'''

*	Natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by Clarkson. ‘‘Stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the world's misery.’’&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, M.B.E. (1994) A risk based model of stakeholder theory. Toronto: Working Paper, University of Toronto, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Starik&lt;ref&gt;Starik, M. (1995) ‘Should trees have managerial standing? Toward stakeholder status for non-human nature,’ Journal of Business Ethics, vol. 14, pp. 207–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder. However this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;
*	Stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Dandy" /&gt;
*	Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Prell"&gt;Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;
*	On-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions.&lt;ref name="Prell" /&gt;

'''Alternatives/ Complementary forms of analysis:'''

*	[[Social network analysis]]
*	[[Common pool resource]]

==Management of the resources==

Natural resource management issues are inherently complex. They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.

After the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.

The various approaches applied to natural resource management include:

* Top-down (command and control)
* Community-based natural resource management
* [[Adaptive]] management
* Precautionary approach
* Integrated natural resource management

=== Community-based natural resource management ===

The community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005" /&gt; When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993. Institutional incentives and sustainable development: infrastructure policies in perspective. Westview Press. Oxford, UK. 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

The United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification.

A problem of CBNRM is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kellert, S|author2=Mehta, J|author3=Ebbin, S|author4=Litchtenfeld, L.|date=2000|title=Community natural resource management: promise, rhetoric, and reality|publisher=Society and Natural Resources, 13:705-715|url=http://biologicalcapital.com/art/Article-%20Community%20Natural%20Resource%20Management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and conflicting interests of CBNRM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brosius, J.|author2=Peter Tsing|author3=Anna Lowenhaupt|author4=Zerner, Charles|date=1998 |title=Representing communities: Histories and politics of community-based natural resource management |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|publisher=Society &amp; Natural Resources: An International Journal |volume=11 |issue=2|pages=157–168|url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/08941929809381069|accessdate=27 October 2014|doi=10.1080/08941929809381069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, C 2000.

Understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based NRM. Locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits.

CBNRM is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities, on the one hand, and national and transnational organizations, on the other, to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shackleton, S|author2=Campbell, B|author3=Wollenberg, E|author4=Edmunds, D.|date=March 2002|title=Devolution and community-based natural resource management: creating space for local people to participate and benefit? |publisher=ODI, Natural Resource Perspectives|number=76|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3646/76-devolution-community-based-natural-resource-management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues, employment, diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity.

Caring for our Country is an Australian Government initiative jointly administered by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. These Departments share responsibility for delivery of the Australian Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs, which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of ‘natural resource management’. These programs have been delivered regionally, through 56 State government bodies, successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|title=PROGRESS TOWARDS HEALTHY RESILIENT LANDSCAPES IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARD, TARGETS AND CATCHMENT ACTION PLANS|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217095859/http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|archivedate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, a research study based in Tanzania and the Pacific researched what motivates communities to adopt CBNRM's and found that aspects of the specific CBNRM program, of the community that has adopted the program, and of the broader social-ecological context together shape the why CBNRM's are adopted&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management. In the State of NSW, the 13 [[Catchment Management Authority of (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) are overseen by the [http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/ Natural Resources Commission] (NRC), responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+102+2003+cd+0+N/?autoquery=%28Content%3D%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29%20AND%20%28%28Type%3D%22act%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%20OR%20%28Type%3D%22subordleg%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%29&amp;dq=Document%20Types%3D%22Acts,%20Regs%22,%20Any%20Words%3D%22natural%20resources%20commission%22,%20Search%20In%3D%22Text%22&amp;fullquery=%28%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29|title=NSW Legislation|publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive management===
The primary methodological approach adopted by [[Catchment Management Authority (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) for regional natural resource management in Australia is [[adaptive management]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of ‘plan-do-review-act’. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice:
*	Determination of scale
*	Collection and use of knowledge
*	[[Information management]]
*	Monitoring and evaluation
*	[[Risk management]]
*	[[Community engagement]]
*	Opportunities for [[collaboration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Integrated natural resource management ===
Integrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. The conceptual basis of INRM has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use, participatory planning, integrated watershed management, and adaptive management.&lt;ref name="Conservation Ecology 52: 25"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lovell, C.|author2=Mandondo A.|author3=Moriarty P.|date=2002|title=The question of scale in integrated natural resource management|publisher=Conservation Ecology 5(2): 25|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol5/iss2/art25/|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling C.S pages 328"&gt;Holling C.S. and Meffe, G.

==Frameworks and modelling==
There are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management.

'''Geographic Information Systems (GIS)'''

[[GIS]] is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links. A bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall, cleared land and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Harding R., 1998, Environmental Decision-Making: The Role of Scientists, Engineers and the Public, Federation Press, Leichhardt. pp366.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Metadata Directories such as NDAR provide data on Australian natural resources such as vegetation, fisheries, soils and water.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, C and Attwater, R (1996) Usage of, and demand for Environmental Statistics in Australia, in Tracking Progress: Linking Environment and Economy Through Indicators and Accounting Systems Conference Papers, 1996 Australian Academy of Science Fenner Conference on the Environment, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW, Sydney, 30 September to 3 October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation.

'''Natural Resources Management Audit Frameworks'''

The NSW Government in Australia has published an audit framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|format=PDF|title=Framework for Auditing the  Implementation of Catchment Action Plans|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621122515/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for natural resource management, to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management. This audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies, including [[performance audit]], [[environmental audit]] and [[internal audit]]. Audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders, identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|format=PDF|title=MURRAY CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY : Audit Report|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621120858/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riskaudit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nature-audit-NZ-Accountants-Journal-March-2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nature Audit|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements.

The Australian Government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management, focussing on the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.

==Other elements==
;Biodiversity Conservation

The issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, KJ &amp; Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is "the variety of life" and relate to different kinds of "biodiversity organization". According to Gray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.

;Precautionary Biodiversity Management

The "threats" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of "alien species" and "climate change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;( p.&amp;nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.

;Concrete "policy tools"

Cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on "evidences", relating to "high standard of proof", the forbidding of special "activities" and "information and monitoring requirements". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of "activities" is regarded as a critical and "irreversible" endangerment, these "activities" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to "catch fish" by using explosives and toxicants.

;Administration and guidelines

According to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;

# "[[Ecosystem-based management]]" including "more risk-averse and precautionary management", where "given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management".
# "[[Adaptive management]]" is "a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems".
# "[[Environmental impact assessment]]" and exposure ratings decrease the "uncertainties" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and
# "Protectionist approaches", which "most frequently links to" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.

;Land management

In order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young&lt;ref&gt;Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises some important points of land management:

* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils
* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations
* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills

Dale et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dale, VH, Brown, S, Hawuber, RA, Hobbs, NT, Huntly, Nj Naiman, RJ, Riebsame, WE, Turner, MG &amp; Valone, TJ 2000, ‘Ecological guidelines for land use and management’, in Dale, VH &amp; Hawuber, RA (eds), Applying ecological principles to land management, Springer-Verlag, NY&lt;/ref&gt; study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them. The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways.It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:

* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.
* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.
* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.
* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.
* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.
* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.
* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.
* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.

In [[mathematics]], a '''near-field''' is an [[algebraic structure]] similar to a [[division ring]], except that it has only one of the two distributive laws. Alternatively, a near-field is a [[near-ring]] in which there is a [[multiplicative identity]], and every non-zero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]].

== Definition ==

A near-field is a set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, together with two [[binary operations]], &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; (addition) and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (multiplication), satisfying the following axioms:
:A1: &lt;math&gt;(Q, +)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abelian group]].
:A2: &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; for all elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (The [[associative law]] for multiplication).
:A3: &lt;math&gt;(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c  +  b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;  for all elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (The right [[distributive law]]).
:A4: &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; contains an element 1 such that &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt;  for every element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; ([[Multiplicative identity]]).
:A5: For every non-zero element a of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; there exists an element &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 = a^{-1} \cdot a &lt;/math&gt; ([[Multiplicative inverse]]).

=== Notes on the definition ===
# The above is strictly a definition of a ''right'' near-field. By replacing A3 by the left distributive law &lt;math&gt; c \cdot (a + b) = c \cdot  a  +  c\cdot b &lt;/math&gt; we get a left near-field instead. Most commonly, "near-field" is taken as meaning "right near-field", but this is not a universal convention.
# A (right) near-field is called "planar" if it is also a right [[quasifield]]. Every finite near-field is planar, but infinite near-fields need not be.  
# It is not necessary to specify that the additive group is abelian, as this follows from the other axioms, as proved by B.H. Neumann and J.L. Zemmer.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Zemmer, "The additive group of an infinite near-field is abelian" in ''J. London Math. Soc.'' 44 (1969), 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zassenhaus"&gt;H Zassenhaus, Abh. Math. Sem. Hans. Univ. 11, pp 187-220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.H. Neumann, "On the commutativity of addition" in ''J. London Math. Soc.'' 15 (1940), 203-208.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proof is quite difficult, and it is more convenient to include this in the axioms so that progress with establishing the properties of near-fields can start more rapidly.
# Sometimes a list of axioms is given in which A4 and A5 are replaced by the following single statement:
#:A4*: The non-zero elements form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication.
#:However, this alternative definition includes one exceptional structure of order 2 which fails to satisfy various basic theorems (such as &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0  = 0&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;). Thus it is much more convenient, and more usual, to use the axioms in the form given above. The difference is that A4 requires 1 to be an identity for all elements, A4* only for non-zero elements.
#:The exceptional structure can be defined by taking an additive group of order 2, and defining multiplication by &lt;math&gt; x \cdot y  = x &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
# Any [[division ring]] (including any [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is a near-field.
# The following defines a (right) near-field of order 9. It is the smallest near-field which is not a field.
#:Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Finite field|Galois field]] of order 9. Denote multiplication in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; by ' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; '. Define a new binary operation ' '''·''' ' by:
#::If &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which is a square and &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a \cdot b = a*b&lt;/math&gt;.
#::If &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which is not a square and &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is any element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a \cdot b = a^3*b&lt;/math&gt;.
#:Then &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a near-field with this new multiplication and the same addition as before.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pilz, Near-Rings, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and applications ==
The concept of a near-field was first introduced by [[Leonard Dickson]] in 1905. He took division rings and modified their multiplication, while leaving addition as it was, and thus produced the first known examples of near-fields that were not division rings. The near-fields produced by this method are known as Dickson near-fields; the near-field of order 9 given above is a  Dickson near-field.
[[Hans Zassenhaus]] proved that all but 7 finite near-fields are either fields or  Dickson near-fields.&lt;ref name="Zassenhaus"/&gt;

The earliest application of the concept of near-field was in the study of geometries, such as [[projective geometry|projective geometries]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Veblen and J. H. Wedderburn "Non-desarguesian and non-pascalian geometrie" in ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 8 (1907), 379-388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Dembrowski "Finite geometries" Springer, Berlin, (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Many projective geometries can be defined in terms of a coordinate system over a division ring, but others can not. It was found that by allowing coordinates from any near-ring the range of geometries which could be coordinatized was extended. For example, [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall]] used the near-field of order 9 given above to produce a [[Hall plane]], the first of a sequence of such planes based on Dickson near-fields of order the square of a prime. In 1971 [[T. G. Room]] and P.B. Kirkpatrick provided an alternative development.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. G. Room]] &amp; P.B. Kirkpatrick (1971) ''Miniquaternion geometry'', §1.3 The Miniquaternion system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal(Q),&lt;/math&gt;pp 8&amp;ndash;20, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{isbn|0-521-07926-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous other applications, mostly to geometry.&lt;ref&gt;H. Wähling "Theorie der Fastkörper", Thales Verlag, Essen, (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent application of near-fields is in the construction of ciphers for data-encryption, such as [[Hill cipher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M. Farag, "Hill Ciphers over Near-Fields" in ''Mathematics and Computer Education'' v41 n1 (2007) 46-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description in terms of Frobenius groups and group automorphisms ==

Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a near field. Let &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt; be its multiplicative group and let &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; be its additive group. Let &lt;math&gt;c \in K_m&lt;/math&gt; act on &lt;math&gt;b \in K_a&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;b \mapsto b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;. The axioms of a near field show that this is a right group action by group automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt;, and the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;K_a&lt;/math&gt; form a single orbit with trivial stabilizer.

Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(A)&lt;/math&gt; which acts freely and transitively on the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then we can define a near field with additive group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and multiplicative group &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Choose an element in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to call &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\phi: M \to A \setminus \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; be the bijection &lt;math&gt;m \mapsto 1 \ast m&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define addition on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by the additive group structure on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and define multiplication by &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = 1 \ast \phi^{-1}(a) \phi^{-1}(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Frobenius group]] can be defined as a finite group of the form &lt;math&gt;A \rtimes M&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; acts without stabilizer on the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, near fields are in bijection with Frobenius groups where &lt;math&gt;|M| = |A|-1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Classification ==

As described above, Zassenhaus proved that all finite near fields either arise from a construction of Dickson or are one of seven exceptional examples. We will describe this classification by giving pairs &lt;math&gt;(A,M)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian group and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a group of automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which acts freely and transitively on the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

The construction of Dickson proceeds as follows.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hall, 20.7.2, ''The Theory of Groups'', Macmillan, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; be a prime power and choose a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that all prime factors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; divide &lt;math&gt;q-1&lt;/math&gt; and, if &lt;math&gt;q \equiv 3 \bmod 4&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the [[finite field]] of order &lt;math&gt;q^n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the additive group of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplicative group of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, together with the [[Finite field#Frobenius automorphism and Galois theory|Frobenius automorphism]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^q&lt;/math&gt; generate a group of automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;C_n \ltimes C_{q^n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; is the cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The divisibility conditions on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; allow us to find a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;C_n \ltimes C_{q^n-1}&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;q^n-1&lt;/math&gt; which acts freely and transitively on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; is the case of commutative finite fields; the nine element example above is &lt;math&gt;q=3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.

In the seven exceptional examples, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;C_p^2&lt;/math&gt;. This table, including the numbering by Roman numerals, is taken from Zassenhaus's paper.&lt;ref name="Zassenhaus"/&gt;

The binary tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral groups are central extensions of the rotational symmetry groups of the [[platonic solid]]s; these rotational symmetry groups are &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_5&lt;/math&gt; respectively. &lt;math&gt;2T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 I&lt;/math&gt; can also be described as &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{F}_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{F}_5)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Negative cutting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Dominic|title=Film Technology in Post Production|publisher=CRC Press, 2012|isbn= 9781136049774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''negative matching''' and '''negative conforming''') is the process of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the [[film editor]]. [[Original camera negative]] (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a [[film splicer]] and [[film cement]]. Negative cutting is part of the [[post-production]] process and occurs after editing and prior to striking [[internegative]]s and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process.  Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on [[keykode]].

Toward the late 1990s and early 2000s negative cutting changed due to the advent of [[digital cinema]] technologies such as [[digital intermediate]] (DI), digital projection and [[high-definition television]]. In some countries, due to the high cost of online suites, negative cutting is still used for commercials by reducing footage. Increasingly feature films are bypassing the negative cutting process altogether and are being scanned directly from the uncut [[Dailies|rushes]].

The existence of [[digital intermediate]]s (DI) has created a new demand for negative cutters to extract [[selected takes]] which are cut from the [[Dailies|rushes]] and re-spliced into new rolls (in edit order) to reduce the volume of footage for scanning.

== Basic ==
After a film shoot, the [[original camera negative]] (OCN) is sent to a film laboratory for processing. Two or three {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} camera rolls are spliced together to create a lab roll approximately {{convert|1200|-|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. After developing the lab roll, it is put through a [[telecine]] to create a [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape. This [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape is of lower quality than film and is used for editing purposes only.

The [[Dailies|rushes]] tape is sent to the Editor who loads it into an offline edit suite. The lab rolls are sent to the negative cutter for logging and storage.

After the Editor finishes the Edit it is exported to an offline [[edit decision list|EDL list]] and the EDL list is sent to the negative cutter. The negative cutter will translate the Timecode in the EDL list to edge numbers ([[keykode]]) using specially designed negative cutting software to find which shot is needed from the [[Juncaceae|rushes]] negative.

Traditionally a negative cutter would then fine cut the negative to match the Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative would be spliced together to create rolls less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} which would then be sent to the film laboratory to print release prints.

Today most feature films are extracted full takes (as [[selected takes]]) and scanned digitally as a [[digital intermediate]]. Television series and commercials shot on film follow the same extraction process but are sent for [[telecine]]. Each required shot is extracted from the lab roll as a full take and [[Film splicer|respliced]] together to create a new selected roll of negative. This reduces the negative required by up to 1/10 of the footage shot, saving considerable time during scanning or telecine. The negative cutter will create a new Online EDL list replacing the [[Dailies|rushes]] roll timecode with the new selected roll timecode.

In the case of feature films the selected roll and Online EDL are sent to a post production facility for scanning as a [[digital intermediate]]. For television commercials or series the selected takes and EDL are sent to a post production facility for re-telecine and compiled in an Online Suite for final grading.

== Software ==

There have been a number of dedicated software systems that have been developed for and by negative cutters to manage the process of cutting motion picture negative. A number of individual proprietary software systems have been developed starting in the early 1980s. Stan Sztaba developed a system for World Cinevision Services Inc (New York) in 1983 using Apple II DOS and then [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], this system is still used today. Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using [[MS-DOS]]. Computamatch was one of the first [[MS-DOS]]-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.

The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain. Film Fusion is one of the most recent developments and is a Windows XP and Vista based system developed in Sydney, Australia by Popsoft IT.

== Hardware ==

Negative cutters use various hardware tools such as film [[Synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizers]], re-winders, [[film splicer]]s, scissors, [[film cement]] and film keykode readers. [[DigiSync]], a purpose built keykode reader is used by most negative cutters in conjunction with software for logging the keykode from film. [[DigiSync]] was developed by [[Research In Motion]] and in 1998 it won a Technical Achievement Academy Award for the design and development of the [[DigiSync]] Film Keykode Reader. [[Research In Motion]] later moved on to bigger things and invented the [[BlackBerry]] Wireless Email Phone and is now a publicly listed company. Other brands of  barcode scanners are also in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12773">In mathematics, a '''numerical semigroup''' is a special kind of a [[semigroup]]. Its underlying [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is the set of all nonnegative [[integer]]s except a [[finite set|finite]] number  and the [[binary operation]] is the operation of  [[addition]] of integers. Also, the integer [[0 (number)|0]] must be an element of the semigroup. For example, while the set {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...} is a numerical semigroup, the set {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, ...} is not because 1 is in the set and 1 + 1 = 2 is not in the set. Numerical semigroups are [[commutative]] [[monoids]] and are also known as '''numerical monoids'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia-Sanchez|first=P.A.|title=Numerical semigroups minicourse|url=http://cmup.fc.up.pt/cmup/v2/include/filedb.php?id=117&amp;table=publicacoes&amp;field=file|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finch|first=Steven|title=Monoids of Natural Numbers|url=http://algo.inria.fr/csolve/mnd.pdf|publisher=INRIA Algorithms Project|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The definition of numerical semigroup is intimately related to the problem of determining nonnegative integers that can be expressed in the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; for a given set {''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;} of positive integers and for arbitrary nonnegative integers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;. This problem had been considered by several mathematicians like [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] (1849 – 1917) and [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1814 – 1897) at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Rosales&gt;{{cite book|last=J.C.

== Definition and examples==
===Definition===

Let ''N'' be the set of nonnegative integers. A subset ''S'' of ''N'' is called a numerical semigroup if the following conditions are satisfied.

#0 is an element of ''S''
#''N'' &amp;minus; ''S'', the complement of ''S'' in ''N'', is finite.
#If ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''S'' then ''x + y'' is also in ''S''.

There is a simple method to construct numerical semigroups. Let ''A'' = {''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;} be a nonempty set of positive integers. The set of all integers of the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the subset of ''N'' generated by ''A'' and is denoted by &amp;lang; ''A'' &amp;rang;. The following theorem fully characterizes numerical semigroups.

===Theorem===

Let ''S'' be the subsemigroup of ''N'' generated by ''A''. Then ''S'' is a numerical semigroup if and only if [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]] (''A'') = 1. Moreover, every numerical semigroup arises in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=García-Sánchez|first1=J.C. Rosales, P.A.|title=Numerical semigroups|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-0160-6|pages=7|edition=First.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

The following subsets of ''N'' are numerical semigroups.
#&amp;lang; 1 &amp;rang; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
#&amp;lang; 1, 2 &amp;rang; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
#&amp;lang; 2, 3 &amp;rang; = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}
#Let ''a'' be a positive integer. &amp;lang; ''a'', ''a'' + 1, ''a'' + 2, ... , 2''a'' - 1  &amp;rang; = {0, ''a'', ''a'' + 1, ''a'' + 2, ''a'' + 3, ...}.
#Let ''b'' be an odd integer greater than 1. Then &amp;lang; 2, ''b'' &amp;rang; = {0, 2, 4, . . . , ''b'' − 3 , ''b'' − 1, ''b'', ''b'' + 1, ''b'' + 2, ''b'' + 3 , ...}.

==Embedding dimension, multiplicity==

The set ''A'' is a set of generators of the numerical semigroup &amp;lang; ''A'' &amp;rang;. A set of generators of a numerical semigroup is a minimal system
of generators if none of its proper subsets generates the numerical semigroup. It is known that 
every numerical semigroup ''S'' has a unique minimal system of generators and also that this minimal system of generators is finite. The cardinality of the minimal set of generators is called the ''[[embedding dimension]]'' of the numerical semigroup ''S'' and is denoted by ''e''(''S''). The smallest member in the minimal system of generators is called the ''multiplicity'' of the numerical semigroup ''S'' and is denoted by ''m''(''S'').

==Frobenius number and genus==
There are several notable numbers associated with a numerical semigroup ''S''.
# The set ''N'' &amp;minus; ''S'' is called the set of gaps in ''S'' and is denoted by ''G''(''S'').
# The number of elements in the set of gaps ''G''(''S'') is called the genus of ''S'' (or, the degree of singularity of ''S'') and is denoted by ''g''(''S'').
# The greatest element in ''G''(''S'') is called the [[Frobenius number]] of ''S'' and is denoted by ''F''(''S'').
===Examples===

Let ''S'' =  &amp;lang; 5, 7, 9 &amp;rang;. Then we have:
* The set of elements in ''S'' :  ''S'' = {0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, ...}.
* The minimal set of generators of ''S'' : {5, 7, 9}.
* The embedding dimension of ''S'' : ''e''(''S'') = 3.
* The multiplicity of ''S'' : ''m''(''S'') = 5.
* The set of gaps in ''S'' : ''G''(''S'') = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13}. 
* The Frobenius number of ''S'' : ''F''(''S'') = 13.
* The genus of ''S'' : ''g''(''S'') = 8.

==Computation of Frobenius number==

===Numerical semigroups with embedding dimension two===


The following general results were known to Sylvester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J. J. Sylvester|title=Mathematical questions with their solutions|journal=Educational Times|year=1884|volume=41|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{badref|date=June 2016}}  Let ''a'' and ''b'' be positive integers such that [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]] (''a'', ''b'') = 1. Then 
*''F''(&amp;lang; ''a'', ''b'' &amp;rang;) = (''a'' &amp;minus; 1) (''b'' &amp;minus; 1) − 1 = ''ab'' &amp;minus; (''a'' + ''b'').
*''g''(&amp;lang; ''a'', ''b'' &amp;rang;) =  (''a'' &amp;minus; 1)(''b'' &amp;minus; 1) / 2.

===Numerical semigroups with embedding dimension three===


There is no known general formula to compute the Frobenius number of numerical semigroups having embedding dimension three or more. No polynomial formula can be found to compute the Frobenius number or genus of a numerical semigroup with embedding dimension three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=F.

===Rödseth's algorithm===


The following algorithm, known as Rödseth's algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J.L. Ramírez Alfonsín|title=The Diophantine Frobenius Problem|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856820-9|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0,
:where ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 2, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 for all i.
*Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = (''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Let ''v'' be the unique integer number such that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''v''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0 &lt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, or equivalently, the unique integer such

==Special classes of numerical semigroups==
An ''irreducible numerical semigroup'' is a numerical semigroup  such that it cannot be written as the intersection of two numerical semigroups properly containing it. A numerical semigroup ''S'' is irreducible if and only if ''S'' is maximal, with respect to set inclusion,  in the collection of all numerical semigroups  with Frobenius number ''F''(''S''). 

A numerical semigroup ''S '' is ''symmetric'' if it is irreducible and its Frobenius number ''F''(''S'') is  odd.  We say that ''S'' is ''pseudo-symmetric'' provided that ''S'' is irreducible and F(S) is even. Such numerical semigroups have simple characterizations in terms of Frobenius number and genus:
*A numerical semigroup ''S'' is symmetric if and only if ''g''(''S'') = (''F''(''S'') + 1)/2.
*A numerical semigroup ''S'' is pseudo-symmetric if and only if ''g''(''S'') = (''F''(''S'') + 2)/2.

Certain aspects of these theories—though usually not the complete theory—are then used to determine both the static and dynamical properties of the nucleus.

'''Praise''' is a form of [[social interaction]] expressing recognition, reassurance or [[admiration]].
Praise is expressed verbally as well as by [[body language]] ([[facial expression]] and [[gesture]]s).

Verbal praise consists of a positive evaluations  of another's attributes or actions, where the evaluator presumes the validity of the standards on which the evaluation is based.{{huh|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name="Kanouse et al 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanouse|first1=D. E.|last2=Gumpert|first2=P.|last3=Canavan-Gumpert|first3=D.|title=The semantics of praise|journal=New directions in attribution research|date=1981|volume=3|pages=97–115.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--how is this NOT tautological? The speaker implies that he endorses the thing which he is saying he is endorsing?--&gt; 

As a form of [[Psychological manipulation|social manipulation]], praise is a form of reward and furthers behavioral [[reinforcement]] by [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]].
The [[Social influence|influence]] of praise on an individual can depend on many factors, including the context, the meanings the praise may convey, and the characteristics and interpretations of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderlong|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lepper|first2=Mark R.|title=The effects of praise on children's intrinsic motivation: A review and synthesis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2002|volume=128|issue=5|pages=774–795|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.774}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While praise may share some predictive relationships (both positive and negative) with tangible (material) rewards, praise tends to be less salient and expected, conveys more information about competence, and is typically given more immediately after the desired behavior.&lt;ref name="Carton 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carton|first1=John|title=The differential effects of tangible rewards and praise on intrinsic motivation: A comparison of cognitive evaluation theory and operant theory|journal=Behavior Analyst|date=19 June 1989|volume=19|issue=2|pages=237–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Praise is distinct from acknowledgement or [[feedback]], which are more neutral forms of recognition, and encouragement, which is expressedly future oriented.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; 

Praise is given across [[social hierarchy|social hierarchy]], and both within the ingroup and towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]; it is an important aspect in the regulation of social hierarchy and the maintenance of group cohesion, influencing the potential for political action and social upheaval. When given by a dominant individual it takes the form of recognition and reassurance, reducing the potential of political action aiming for 
when given by a submissive to a dominant individual it takes the form of [[deference]], [[admiration|admiration or exultation]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Sweetman, Russell Spears, Andrew G. Livingstone, and Antony S.R. Manstead, "Admiration regulates social hierarchy: Antecedents, dispositions, and effects on intergroup behavior", ''J Exp Soc Psychol''. 2013 May; 49(3): 534–542.
doi:  10.1016/j.jesp.2012.10.007.
"We demonstrate that manipulating the legitimacy of status relations affects admiration for the dominant and that this emotion negatively predicts political action tendencies aimed at social change. In addition, we show that greater warmth and competence lead to greater admiration for an outgroup, which in turn positively predicts deferential behavior and intergroup learning. We also demonstrate that, for those with a disposition to feel admiration, increasing admiration for an outgroup decreases willingness to take political action against that outgroup. Finally, we show that when the object of admiration is a subversive “martyr,” admiration positively predicts political action tendencies and behavior aimed at challenging the status quo. These findings provide the first evidence for the important role of admiration in regulating social hierarchy."&lt;/ref&gt; or in the extreme case of [[deification]] ([[Hallel|prayer of praise]]).

==As behavioral reinforcement==
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement is rooted in [[B.F. Skinner]]'s model of [[operant conditioning]]. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of [[positive reinforcement]], wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan|title=History of behavior modification: Experimental foundations of contemporary research|date=1978|publisher=University Park Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain|first1=Phillip S.|last2=Lambert|first2=Deborah L.|last3=Kerr|first3=Mary Margaret|last4=Stagg|first4=Vaughan|last5=Lenkner|first5=Donna A.|title=Naturalistic assessment of children's compliance to teachers' requests and consequences for compliance|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1983|volume=16|issue=2|pages=243–249|doi=10.1901/jaba.1983.16-243|pmc=1307879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"/&gt; but also in the study of work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Charles R.|last2=Anderson|first2=D.

In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.&lt;ref name="Brophy, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=Jere|title=On praising effectively|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1981|volume=81|issue=5|jstor=1001606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols.&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsen|first1=Brandi|last2=Fairbanks|first2=Sarah|last3=Briesch|first3=Amy|last4=Myers|first4=Diane|last5=Sugai|first5=George|title=Evidence-based Practices in Classroom Management: Considerations for Research to Practice|journal=Education and Treatment of Children|date=2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=351–380|doi=10.1353/etc.0.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisz &amp; Kazdin, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisz|first1=John R.|last2=Kazdin|first2=Alan E.|title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents|date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008" /&gt; and parenting training interventions,&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garland|first1=Ann F.|last2=Hawley|first2=Kristin M.|last3=Brookman-Frazee|first3=Lauren|last4=Hurlburt|first4=Michael S.|title=Identifying Common Elements of Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatments for Children's Disruptive Behavior Problems|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=May 2008|volume=47|issue=5|pages=505–514|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

==Effects beyond behavior change==
Although the majority of early research on the influences of praise focused on behavior implications, more recent investigations have highlighted important implications in other domains.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DELIN|first1=CATHERINE R.|last2=BAUMEISTER|first2=ROY F.|title=Praise: More Than Just Social Reinforcement|journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour|date=September 1994|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–241|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5914.1994.tb00254.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise may have cognitive influences on an individual, by attracting attention to the self, or by conveying information about the values and expectations of the praiser to the recipient.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; Effective praise (i.e., praise that is welcomed or accepted by the recipient) may also have positive emotional effects by generating a positive affective state (e.g., happiness, joy, pride).&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; Praise is also thought to convey that one has surpassed a noteworthy evaluative standard, and if the recipient of the praise is likely to experience a sense of pleasure stemming from a positive self-perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wicklund|first1=R.A.|title=Objective self-awareness. In Advances in experimental social psychology.|date=1975|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=233–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrastingly, praise may create negative emotional consequences if it appears disingenuous or manipulative.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt;

Alternative views of the effects of praise on motivation exist. In one camp, praise is thought to decrease intrinsic motivation by increasing the presence of external control.&lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; However, praise has also been argued to define standards and expectations, which in turn may motivate an individual to exert effort to meet those standards.&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; Lastly, praise may serve to influence interpersonal relations. For example, strong pressures to reciprocate praise have been found.&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Wortman 1973"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=E.E.|last2=Wortman|first2=C.|title=Ingraktion: An attributional approach|date=1973|publisher=General Learning Press|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the mutual praise may serve to increase attraction and strengthen the interpersonal relationship,&lt;ref name="Delin &amp; Baumeister, 1994" /&gt; and this process may underlie the use of praise in [[ingratiation]].&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Wortman 1973" /&gt;

==Dimensions==

===Person versus process ===
Over the past several decades, researchers have distinguished between praise that is directed at a person's general abilities and qualities (e.g., "You're such a good drawer.") and praise that is directed at the process of performance (e.g., "You are working so hard at that drawing.").&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderlong Corpus|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lepper|first2=Mark R.|journal=Educational Psychology|date=2007|volume=27|issue=4|pages=487–508.|doi=10.1080/01443410601159852|title=The Effects of Person Versus Performance Praise on Children’s Motivation: Gender and age as moderating factors}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between person versus process praise is sometimes referred to as ability versus effort praise, though ability and effort statements can be seen as subcategories of person and process statements, respectively.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt;

Traditionally, person(trait)-oriented praise was thought to instill a child's belief that they have the capacity to succeed, and thus help motivate them to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=D. C.|title=You child's self-esteem: The key to life|date=1975|publisher=Random House LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, social-cognitive theorists have more recently suggested that person-oriented (as opposed to process-oriented) praise may have detrimental impacts on a child's self-perceptions, motivation and learning.&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007" /&gt; For example, praising children for their personal attributes, rather than specifics about their performance, may teach them to make interferences about their global worth,&lt;ref name="Kamins &amp; Dweck, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamins|first1=Melissa L.|last2=Dweck|first2=Carol S.|title=Person versus process praise and criticism: Implications for contingent self-worth and coping|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1999|volume=35|issue=3|pages=835–847|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may thus undermine their intrinsic motivation. In a study of person- versus process-oriented praise, Kamins and Dweck&lt;ref name="Kamins &amp; Dweck, 1999" /&gt; found that children who received person-oriented praise displayed more "helpless" responses following a failure including self-blame, than those in the process condition. Henderlong and Lepper&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; suggest that person-oriented praise may function like tangible rewards, in that they produce desired outcomes in the short-run, but may undermine intrinsic motivation and subsequent perseverance.  However, Skipper &amp; Douglas&lt;ref name="Skipper &amp; Douglas, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skipper|first1=Yvonne|last2=Douglas|first2=Karen|title=Is no praise good praise? Effects of positive feedback on children's and university students' responses to subsequent failures|journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology|date=June 2012|volume=82|issue=2|pages=327–339|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02028.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that although person- versus process-oriented praise (and an objective feedback control group) predicted more negative responses to the first failure, all three groups demonstrated similarly negative responses to the second failure. Thus, the long-term negative consequences of person-oriented praise are still unclear.

Person and process (or performance) praise may also foster different attributional styles &lt;ref name="Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Claudia M.|last2=Dweck|first2=Carol S.|title=Praise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=75|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.1.33|pmid=9686450}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that person-oriented praise may lead one to attribute success and failure to stable ability, which in turn may foster helplessness reactions in the face of setbacks. Contrastingly, process praise may foster attributions regarding effort or strategy, such that children attribute their success (or failure) to these variables, rather than their stable trait or ability. This attributional style can foster more adaptive reactions to both success and failure.  In support of this notion, Muller and Dweck&lt;ref name="Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998"/&gt; experimentally found praise for child intelligence to be more detrimental to 5th graders' achievement motivation than praise for effort. Following a failure, the person-praised students displayed less task persistence, task enjoyment, and displayed worse task performance than those praised for effort. These findings are in line with personal theories of achievement striving,&lt;ref name="Weiner, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiner|first1=B.|title=Integrating Social and Personal Theories of Achievement Striving|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1 January 1994|volume=64|issue=4|pages=557–573|doi=10.3102/00346543064004557}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which in the face of failure, performance tends to improve when individuals make attributions to a lack of effort, but worsen when they attribute their failure to a lack of ability.

In the studies mentioned above, person-oriented praise was found to be less beneficial than process-oriented praise, but this is not always found to be the case. Particularly, effort-oriented praise may be detrimental when given during tasks that are exceptionally easy.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt;  This may be especially apparent for older children as they see effort and ability to be inversely related&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Covington|first1=V.|title=The self-worth theory of achievement motivation: Findings and implications|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1984|pages=5–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus an overemphasis on effort may suggest a lack of ability.

===Controlling versus informational===
Proponents of [[cognitive evaluation theory]] (Deci &amp; Ryan &lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deci|first1=E. L.|last2=Ryan|first2=R. M.|title=Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behavior|date=1985|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York: Academic Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deci|first1=E. L.|last2=Ryan|first2=R. M.|chapter=The empirical exploration of intrinsic motivational processes|editor=L. Berkowitz|title=Advances in experimental social psychology|date=1980|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press|pages=39–80|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have focused on two aspects of praise thought to influence a child's self-determination: information and control. Taking this perspective, the informational aspect of praise is thought to promote a perceived internal [[locus of control]] (and thus greater self-determination) while the controlling aspects promote a perceived external locus of control and thus extrinsic compliance or defiance.&lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; Thus, Deci &amp; Ryan  &lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; suggest that the effect of praise is moderated by the salience of informational versus controlling aspects of praise.

The theory that informational praise enhances self-determination over controlling praise has been supported by several empirical studies. In a metanalysis including five studies distinguishing informational from controlling praise, Deci, Koestner &amp; Ryan&lt;ref name="Deci, Koestner &amp; Ryan, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=E. L.|last2=Koestner|first2=R.|last3=Ryan|first3=R. M.|title=Extrinsic Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation in Education: Reconsidered Once Again|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1 January 2001|volume=71|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.3102/00346543071001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that informational-based praise related to greater intrinsic motivation (as measured by free-choice behavior and self-reported interest) while controlling praise was associated with less intrinsic motivation. For example, Pittman and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittman|first1=T. S.|last2=Davey|first2=M. E.|last3=Alafat|first3=K. A.|last4=Wetherill|first4=K. V.|last5=Kramer|first5=N. A.|title=Informational versus Controlling Verbal Rewards|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 June 1980|volume=6|issue=2|pages=228–233|doi=10.1177/014616728062007}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that adults demonstrated more free-choice engagement with a task after receiving informational ("e.g., "Compared to most of my subjects, you're doing really well."), rather than controlling (e.g., "I haven't been able to use most of the data I've gotten so far, but you're doing really well, and if you keep it up I'll be able to use yours.") praise.

Several complexities of informational versus controlling praise have been acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; First, though the differences between information and controlling praise have been well-established, it is difficult to determine whether the net effects of these forms of praise will be positive, negative or neutral compared to a control condition. In addition, it is often difficult to determine the extent to which informational, controlling, or both, which may muddy interpretations of results.

===Social-comparison versus mastery ===
Social comparison is a psychological process that is widely prevalent, particularly so in educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=J. M.|title=Social Comparison and Education. In J.M. Levine &amp; Wang, M.C. Eds. Teacher and Student Perception: Implications for Learning|date=1983|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale: N.J.|pages=29–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Festinger's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=L.|title=A Theory of Social Comparison Processes|journal=Human Relations|date=1 May 1954|volume=7|issue=2|pages=117–140|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[social comparison theory]], he noted that people engage in social comparison as a means to reduce ambiguity and accurately evaluate their own qualities and abilities. However, controversy exists over whether providing children with social-comparison praise has beneficial impact on their motivation and performance.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; Some studies have demonstrated that students who received social-comparison praise (e.g., "you're doing better than most students" or "you're performance is amongst the best we've had") demonstrated greater motivation compared to no-praise or other control groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=Edward L.|title=Effects of externally mediated rewards on intrinsic motivation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1971|volume=18|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1037/h0030644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pretty|first1=Grace H.|last2=Seligman|first2=Clive|title=Affect and the overjustification effect.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1984|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1241–1253|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.6.1241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanck|first1=Peter D.|last2=Reis|first2=Harry T.|last3=Jackson|first3=Linda|title=The effects of verbal reinforcement of intrinsic motivation for sex-linked tasks|journal=Sex Roles|date=March 1984|volume=10|issue=5–6|pages=369–386|doi=10.1007/BF00287554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarafino, Russo, Barker, Consentino and Titus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarafino|first1=Edward P.|last2=Russo|first2=Alyce|last3=Barker|first3=Judy|last4=Consentino|first4=Annmarie|last5=Consentino|first5=Annmarie|title=The Effect of Rewards on Intrinsic Interest: Developmental Changes in the Underlying Processes|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|date=September 1982|volume=141|issue=1|pages=29–39|doi=10.1080/00221325.1982.10533454}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that students who received social-comparison voluntarily engaged in the task more so than those who received feedback that they performed similar to others. Though these studies demonstrate the possible positive influence of social-comparison praise, they have been criticized for inadequate control groups.&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corpus|first1=Jennifer Henderlong|last2=Ogle|first2=Christin M.|last3=Love-Geiger|first3=Kelly E.|title=The Effects of Social-Comparison Versus Mastery Praise on Children's Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=25 August 2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=333–343|doi=10.1007/s11031-006-9039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a control group given feedback that they are average may be seen as negative, rather than neutral. In addition, most social-comparison studies do not examine motivation or behavior following a subsequent unsuccessful task.&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006" /&gt;

Beyond methodology, the primary criticism to social-comparison praise is that it teaches children to evaluate themselves on the basis of the performance of others, and may therefore lead to maladaptive coping in situations in which one is outperformed by others individuals.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt; Social-comparison praise has been hypothesized to decrease intrinsic motivation for the praised children because they may then view their behaviors as externally controlled.&lt;ref name="Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985" /&gt; Contrastingly, it is suggested that praise that focused on a child's competence (mastery) rather than social comparison may be important for fostering motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=A.|title=By All Available Means: Cameron and Pierce's Defense of Extrinsic Motivators|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1 January 1996|volume=66|issue=1|pages=1–4|doi=10.3102/00346543066001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is relatively understudied, though some interesting findings have emerged. In a study of adults, Koestner, Zuckerman, and Olsson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koestner|first1=Richard|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Miron|last3=Olsson|first3=Jennifer|title=Attributional style, comparison focus of praise, and intrinsic motivation|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=March 1990|volume=24|issue=1|pages=87–100|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(90)90008-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that gender moderated the influence of social-comparison and mastery praise, where women were more intrinsically motivated following mastery praise, while men were more motivated following social-comparison praise. In a study of children, Henderlong Corpus, Ogle &amp; Love-Geiger&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006" /&gt; found that social-comparison praise lead to decreased motivation following ambiguous feedback for all children, and also decreased motivation following positive feedback for girls only. Thus, mastery praise may be more conducive than social-comparison to fostering intrinsic motivation, particularly for females,&lt;ref name="Henderlong, Ogle, Love-Geiger, 2006" /&gt; though more research is needed to tease apart these relationships.

==Factors that affect influence==

===Age===

The function of praise on child performance and motivation may likely vary as a function of age. Few studies have directly examined developmental differences in praise, though some evidence has been found. Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007" /&gt; found person praise (as opposed to process praise) to negatively influence motivation for older girls (4th/5th grade), while for preschool-age children, there were no differences in the effects of process, person and product praise, though all three forms of praise were associated with increased motivation as compared to neutral feedback. In a different study, Henderlong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderlong|first1=J.|title=Beneficial and detrimental effects of praise on children's motivation: Performance versus person feedback|type=Unpublished doctoral dissertation|publisher=Stanford University|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that for older children, process praise enhanced post-failure motivation more so than person praise, and person praise decreased motivation as compared to neutral feedback. Contrastingly, for preschool-age children process praise enhanced post-failure motivation more than person praise, but both were better than neutral feedback. Some posit that younger children do not experience the negative effects of certain types of praise because they do not yet make causal attributions in complex ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barker|first1=George P.|last2=Graham|first2=Sandra|title=Developmental study of praise and blame as attributional cues|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1987|volume=79|issue=1|pages=62–66|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are more literal in their interpretations of adult speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=Brian P.|title=Young children's understanding of a speaker's intentional use of a false utterance|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1981|volume=17|issue=4|pages=472–480|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.4.472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===

The function of praise on child behavior and motivation has also found to vary as a function of child gender. Some researchers have shown that females are more susceptible to the negative effects of certain types of praise (person-oriented praise, praise that limits autonomy). For example, Koestner, Zuckerman &amp; Koestner&lt;ref name="Koestner, Zuckerman &amp; Koestner, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koestner|first1=R.|last2=Zuckerman|first2=M.|last3=Koestner|first3=J.|title=Attributional Focus of Praise and Children's Intrinsic Motivation: The Moderating Role of Gender|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 March 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1177/0146167289151006}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that girls were more negatively influenced by praise that diminished perceived autonomy. Henderlong Corpus and Lepper&lt;ref name="Henderlong Corpus &amp; Lepper, 2007" /&gt; found that process praise was more beneficial to motivation than person praise, but only for girls. This difference was found for older children, but not preschool-aged children.

Others have found young girls to be more negatively influenced by the evaluations of adults more generally.&lt;ref name="Carol S 1649"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dweck|first1=Carol S.|last2=Davidson|first2=William|last3=Nelson|first3=Sharon|last4=Enna|first4=Bradley|title=Sex differences in learned helplessness: II. The contingencies of evaluative feedback in the classroom and III. An experimental analysis.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1978|volume=14|issue=3|pages=268–276|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.3.268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have posited that this gender difference is due to girls more often attributing failure to lack of ability rather than a lack of motivation or effort.&lt;ref name="Carol S 1649"/&gt; Gender differences may be attributable to normative socialization practices, in which people generally emphasize dependence and interpersonal relationships for girls, but achievement and independence for boys.&lt;ref name="New York: Academic Press"/&gt;

===Culture===

Culture has been referred to as a "blind spot" in the praise literature.&lt;ref name="Wang, Wiley &amp; Chiu, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y. Z.|last2=Wiley|first2=A. R.|last3=Chiu|first3=C.-Y.|title=Independence-supportive praise versus interdependence-promoting praise|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|date=1 January 2008|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–20|doi=10.1177/0165025407084047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there is reason to believe that cultural differences in the effects of praise exist. Much of the discussion on culture and praise has focused on differences between independent and interdependent cultures (e.g.&lt;ref name="Henderlong &amp; Lepper, 2002" /&gt;). Stated briefly, independent cultures, common in Western cultures, generally value and seek to promote individualism and autonomy, while interdependent cultures promote fundamental connectedness and harmony in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking through this cultural lens, clear differences in the use and impact of praise can be found. In comparison to the United States, praise is rarely in China and Japan (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C. C.|title=Educating hearts and minds: Reflections on Japanese preschool and elementary education|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salili 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salili|first1=F.|title=Learning and Motivation: An Asian Perspective|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=1 March 1996|volume=8|issue=1|pages=55–81|doi=10.1177/097133369600800104}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as praise may be thought to be harmful to a child's character.&lt;ref name="Salili 1996" /&gt; In interdependent cultures, individuals are generally motivated by self-improvement.&lt;ref name="Heine, Lehman, Markus, Kitayama, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heine|first1=Steven H.|last2=Lehman|first2=Darrin R.|last3=Markus|first3=Hazel Rose|last4=Kitayama|first4=Shinobu|title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|journal=Psychological Review|date=1999|volume=106|issue=4|pages=766–794|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.766|pmid=10560328}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cultural difference has also been found experimentally. Heine, Lehman, Markus &amp; Katayama&lt;ref name="Heine, Lehman, Markus, Kitayama, 1999" /&gt; found that Canadian students persisted longer after positive than negative performance feedback, while the opposite was true for Japanese students. Some posit that individuals from independent and interdependent cultures largely express different models of praise (independence-supportive and interdependence-supportive praise.&lt;ref name="Wang, Wiley &amp; Chiu, 2008" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4962">In the branch of abstract mathematics called [[category theory]], a '''projective cover''' of an object ''X'' is in a sense the best approximation of ''X'' by a [[projective object]] ''P''.  Projective covers are the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of [[injective envelope]]s.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] and ''X'' an object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  A '''projective cover''' is a pair (''P'',''p''), with ''P'' a [[projective object]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and ''p'' a superfluous epimorphism in Hom(''P'', ''X'').

If ''R'' is a ring, then in the category of ''R''-modules, a '''superfluous epimorphism''' is then an [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;p : P \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''p'' is a [[superfluous submodule]] of ''P''.

==Properties==
Projective covers and their superfluous epimorphisms, when they exist, are unique up to [[isomorphism]]. The isomorphism need not be unique, however, since the projective property is not a full fledged [[universal property]].

The main effect of ''p'' having a superfluous kernel is the following: if ''N'' is any proper submodule of ''P'', then &lt;math&gt;p(N) \ne M&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Proof:  Let ''N'' be proper in ''P'' and suppose ''p''(''N'')=''M''.  Since ker(''p'') is superfluous, ker(''p'')+''N''≠''P''.  Choose ''x'' in ''P'' outside of ker(''p'')+''N''.  By the surjectivity of ''p'', there exists ''x' '' in ''N'' such that ''p''(''x' '')=''p''(''x ''),, whence ''x''−''x' '' is in ker(''p'').  But then ''x'' is in ker(''p'')+''N'', a contradiction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally speaking, this shows the superfluous kernel causes ''P'' to cover ''M'' optimally, that is, no submodule of ''P'' would suffice. This does not depend upon the projectivity of ''P'': it is true of all superfluous epimorphisms.

If (''P'',''p'') is a projective cover of ''M'', and ''P' '' is another projective module with an epimorphism &lt;math&gt;p':P'\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a [[epimorphism#Related concepts|split epimorphism]] α from ''P' '' to ''P'' such that &lt;math&gt;p\alpha=p'&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike [[injective envelope]]s and [[flat cover]]s, which exist for every left (right) [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] regardless of the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'', left (right) ''R''-modules do not in general have projective covers.  A ring ''R'' is called left (right) [[perfect ring|perfect]] if every left (right) ''R''-module has a projective cover in ''R''-Mod (Mod-''R'').

A ring is called [[semiperfect ring|semiperfect]] if every [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] left (right) ''R''-module has a projective cover in ''R''-Mod (Mod-''R'').  "Semiperfect" is a left-right symmetric property.

A ring is called ''lift/rad'' if [[Idempotent (ring theory)#Category of R modules|idempotents lift]] from ''R''/''J'' to ''R'', where ''J'' is the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R''.  The property of being lift/rad can be characterized in terms of projective covers: ''R'' is lift/rad if and only if direct summands of the ''R'' module ''R''/''J'' (as a right or left module) have projective covers.{{sfn|Anderson|Fuller|1992|loc=p. 302}}

== Examples ==
In the category of ''R'' modules:
*If ''M'' is already a projective module, then the identity map from ''M'' to ''M'' is a superfluous epimorphism (its kernel being zero).  Hence, projective modules always have projective covers.
*If J(''R'')=0, then a module ''M'' has a projective cover if and only if ''M'' is already projective.
*In the case that a module ''M'' is [[simple module|simple]], then it is necessarily the [[top (mathematics)|top]] of its projective cover, if it exists.
*The injective envelope for a module always exists, however over certain rings modules may not have projective covers.  For example, the natural map from '''Z''' onto '''Z'''/2'''Z''' is not a projective cover of the '''Z'''-module '''Z'''/2'''Z''' (which in fact has no projective cover). The class of rings which provides all of its right modules with projective covers is the class of right [[perfect ring]]s.
*Any ''R''-module ''M'' has a [[flat cover]], which is equal to the projective cover if ''R'' has a projective cover.

A '''psychometric function''' is an inferential model applied in detection and discrimination tasks. It models the relationship between a given feature of a physical [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], e.g. velocity, duration, brightness, weight etc., and forced-choice responses of a human test subject. The psychometric function therefore is a specific application of the [[generalized linear model]] (GLM) to [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] data. The probability of response is related to a linear combination of predictors by means of a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] [[link function]] (e.g. [[probit]], [[logit]], etc.). 

== Design ==
Depending on the number of choices, the psychophysical experimental paradigms classify as simple forced choice (also known as yes-no task), [[two-alternative forced choice]] (2AFC), and n-alternative forced choice. The number of alternatives in the experiment determine the lower asymptote of the function. 

== Example ==
A common example is [[visual acuity]] testing with an [[eye chart]]. The person sees symbols of different sizes (the size is the relevant physical stimulus parameter) and has to decide which symbol it is. Usually, there is one line on the chart where a subject can identify some, but not all, symbols. This is equal to the transition range of the psychometric function and the sensory threshold corresponds to visual acuity. (Strictly speaking, a typical optometric measurement does not exactly yield the sensory threshold due to biases in the standard procedure.)

== Plotting ==
Two different types of psychometric plots are in common use: 
# Plot the percentage of correct responses (or a similar value) displayed on the [[y-axis]] and the physical parameter on the [[x-axis]]. If the stimulus parameter is very far towards one end of its possible range, the person will always be able to respond correctly. Towards the other end of the range, the person never perceives the stimulus properly and therefore the probability of correct responses is at chance level. In between, there is a transition range where the subject has an above-chance rate of correct responses, but does not always respond correctly. The [[inflection point]] of the sigmoid function or the point at which the function reaches the middle between the chance level and 100% is usually taken as [[sensory threshold]]. 
# Plot the proportion of "yes" responses on the y-axis, and therefore create a sigmoidal shape covering the range [0, 1], rather than merely [0.5, 1]. This moves from a subject being certain that the stimulus was not of the particular type requested to certainty that it was. 
The second way of plotting psychometric functions is often preferable, as it is more easily amenable to principled quantitative analysis using tools such as [[probit]] analysis (fitting of cumulative Gaussian distributions). However, it also has important drawbacks. First, the threshold estimation is based only on p(yes), namely on "Hit" in Signal Detection Theory terminology. Second, and consequently, it is not bias free or criterion free. Third, the threshold is identified with the p(yes) = .5, which is just a conventional and arbitrary choice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">In [[statistics]], '''rankits''' of a set of data are the expected values of the [[order statistic]]s of a sample from the standard [[normal distribution]] the same size as the data. They are primarily used in the [[normal probability plot]], a [[graphical technique]] for [[normality test]]ing.

[[File:Normal probability plot.gif|thumb|380px|Sample [[normal probability plot]]; horizontal axis coordinates are rankits.]]

==Example==

This is perhaps most readily understood by means of an example.  If an [[Independent identically-distributed random variables|i.i.d.]] sample of six items is taken from a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population with [[expected value]] 0 and [[variance]] 1 (the [[standard normal distribution]]) and then sorted into increasing order, the expected values of the resulting [[order statistic]]s are:

:&amp;minus;1.2672, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;0.6418, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;0.2016, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.2016, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.6418, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.2672.

Suppose the numbers in a data set are

: 65,  75,  16,  22,  43,  40.

Then one may sort these and line them up with the corresponding rankits; in order they are
: 16, 22, 40, 43, 65,  75,
which yields the points:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
! data point !! rankit
|-
| 16 || &amp;minus;1.2672
|-
| 22 || &amp;minus;0.6418
|-
| 40 || &amp;minus;0.2016
|-
| 43 || 0.2016
|-
| 65 || 0.6418
|-
| 75 || 1.2672
|}

These points are then plotted as the vertical and horizontal coordinates of a [[scatter plot]].

=== Alternative method ===
Alternatively, rather than ''sort'' the data points, one may ''rank'' them, and ''rearrange'' the rankits accordingly. This yields the same pairs of numbers, but in a different order.

For:
: 65,  75,  16,  22,  43,  40,
the corresponding ranks are:
: 5,  6,  1,  2,  4,  3,

i.e., the number appearing first is the 5th-smallest, the number appearing second is 6th-smallest, the number appearing third is smallest, the number appearing fourth is 2nd-smallest, etc.  One rearranges the expected normal order statistics accordingly, getting the '''rankits''' of this data set:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
! data point !! rank !! rankit
|-
| 65 || 5 || 0.6418
|-
| 75 || 6 || 1.2672
|-
| 16 || 1 || &amp;minus;1.2672
|-
| 22 || 2 || &amp;minus;0.6418
|-
| 43 || 4 || 0.2016
|-
| 40 || 3 || &amp;minus;0.2016
|}

==Rankit plot==
{{main|Normal probability plot}}
A graph plotting the rankits on the horizontal axis and the data points on the vertical axis is called a '''rankit plot''' or a '''[[normal probability plot]]'''.  Such a plot is necessarily nondecreasing.  In large samples from a normally distributed population, such a plot will approximate a straight line.  Substantial deviations from straightness are considered evidence against normality of the distribution.  

Rankit plots are usually used to visually demonstrate whether data are from a specified [[probability distribution]].

A rankit plot is a kind of [[Q-Q plot]] – it plots the order statistics (quantiles) of the sample against certain quantiles (the rankits) of the assumed normal distribution. Q-Q plots may use other quantiles for the normal distribution, however.

==History==
The rankit plot and the word '''''rankit''''' was introduced by the biologist and statistician [[Chester Ittner Bliss]] (1899&amp;ndash;1979).

{{Redirect|Bear arms}}{{See also|Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|Overview of gun laws by nation|Gun control}}

The '''right to keep and bear arms''' (often referred to as the '''right to bear arms''') is the people's right to possess [[weapons]] (arms) for their own defense.&lt;ref name=Halbrook1994p8&gt;{{cite book |last=Halbrook |first=Stephen P. |year=1994 |title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy) |url= |page=8 |publisher=The Independent Institute |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=0-945999-38-0 |oclc=30659789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only few countries recognize people's right to keep and bear arms and protect it on statutory level, and even fewer protect the right on constitutional level.

==Background==
In [[Old English]], ''beran'' (past tense ''bær'') means to bear, bring, bring forth, or produce; to endure or sustain; or to wear.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear (v.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] allowed [[Protestantism|Protestant]] citizens of [[England]] to "have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law" and restricted the ability of the [[English Crown]] to have a [[standing army]] or to interfere with Protestants' right to bear arms "when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law" and established that Parliament, not the Crown, could regulate the right to bear arms.&lt;ref name="c21WillMarSess2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2/introduction |title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar. Sess. 2 |publisher=The National Archives (UK) |accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCBoR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A727265 |title=BBC: Bill of Rights Act, 1689 – The Glorious Revolution |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2002 |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation" subject to suitability and allowance by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''arms'' as used in the 1600s, the term refers to the process of equipping for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas Harper|title=arm (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used as a synonym for weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arm|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arm|website=Thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. In 1875, 17 percent of constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, "the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |title=U.S. Gun Rights Are Truly American Exceptionalism |work=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2016 |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-03-07/u-s-gun-rights-truly-are-american-exceptionalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789,&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt; [[Tom Ginsburg]] and colleagues "identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms. Almost all of these constitutions have been in Latin America, and most were from the 19th century".&lt;ref name=Elkins&gt;{{cite news |author=Elkins, Zachary |title=Rewrite the Second Amendment |work=New York Times |date=4 April 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/opinion/rewrite-the-second-amendment.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, where modern constitutions refer to arms at all, the purpose is "to allow the government to regulate their use or to compel military service, not to provide a right to bear them".&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt; Constitutions which historically guaranteed a right to bear arms are those of [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Liberia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]] and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name=CCP&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |publisher=CCP: Comparative Constitutions Project |url=http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/arms-1200w-e1379117382415.png?6c8912 |title=Data Visualizations – Right to Bear Arms |date=2016 |accessdate=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of the Latin American examples were modelled on that of the United States.&lt;ref name=Elkins/&gt; At present, out of the world’s nearly 200 constitutions, three still include a right to bear arms: Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States; of these three, only the last does not include explicit restrictive conditions.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt;

Mexican constitution of 1857 first included right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 relativized the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.

Another change was included in 1971 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to [[Gun politics in Mexico|statutory authorization in Federal law]].

==Gun violence and the politics of the right to bear arms==
{{Weasel|section|date=September 2018}}
Legal restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms are usually put in place by legislators because they believe that they will reduce gun related violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/International/Story?id=3066193&amp;page=1 |title=U.K. Response to School Massacre: Ban Handguns |first=David |last=Wright |date=April 22, 2007 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/29/europe/union.php |title=EU legislators push tougher gun controls |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=November 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/world/europe/29iht-union.4.8532843.html |archivedate=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/01/us/clinton-calls-brady-law-a-success-and-backs-more-limits.html |title=President Clinton Calls Brady Law a Success and Backs More Limits |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their actions are frequently the result of grass roots pressure for such controls. The [[Brady Campaign|Brady]], [[Snowdrop Campaign]]s, and the [[Million Mom March]] are recent examples of campaigns calling for tighter restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms.

Accident statistics are hard to obtain, but much data is available on the issue of gun ownership and gun related deaths. The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A strong correlation is seen in both.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the 1989 and 1992 International Crime Surveys, data on gun ownership in eighteen countries have been collected on which WHO data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other means are also available. The results presented in a previous paper based on the fourteen countries surveyed during the first ICS and on rank correlations (Spearman's rho), suggested that gun ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other means. In the present analysis, four additional countries covered by the 1992 ICS only have been included, and Pearson's correlation coefficients r have been used. The results confirm those presented in the previous study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

UNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that "widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide." Speculating on possible causes the researchers concluded that "all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a—fatal—role in this".&lt;ref name="UNICRI"&gt;{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J.

The research reporter found that guns were the major cause of homicides in 3 of the 14 countries it studied; Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States. Although the data seem to indicate that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that "reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point", citing the American example.&lt;ref name="UNICRI"/&gt;

In contrast to the 1993 study however, a more recent study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. Significant correlations between household gun ownership and rates of gun suicides for both genders, and gun homicide rates involving female victims were found. There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Killias |first=M. |last2=van Kesteren |first2=J. |last3=Rindlisbacher |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=Guns, Violent Crime, and Suicide in 21 Countries |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Criminology]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=429–448 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/5263789/GunsKilliasvKesteren.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54392">Every day, people are presented with endless amounts of information, and in an effort to help keep track and organize this information, people must be able to recognize, differentiate and store information. One way to do that is to [[information organization|organize information]] as it pertains to the self.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9), 677-688. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677&lt;/ref&gt; The overall concept of [[self-reference]] suggests that people interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their [[self-concept]] as a background for new information.&lt;ref name = "source1" /&gt;  Examples include being able to attribute [[personality traits]] to oneself or to identify [[recollection|recollected]] episodes as being personal memories of the past.&lt;ref name="source6"&gt;Benoit, R.

''Neuroimage, 50''(3), 1340-1349. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.091&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the "[[cocktail party effect]]" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of [[implicit self-esteem]]). For example, people tend to prefer their [[Implicit self-esteem#Name.E2.80.93letter effect|own initials]] over other letters.&lt;ref name="source8"&gt;Heatherton, T. F., Macrae, C., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2004). What the social brain sciences can tell us about the self. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13''(5), 190-193. doi:10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00305.x&lt;/ref&gt; The [[self-reference effect]] (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of '''self-referential encoding''' and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential [[mnemonic]] properties of self-reference.&lt;ref name="source5"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56''(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.853&lt;/ref&gt;

Research includes investigations into [[self-schema]], [[self-concept]] and [[self-awareness]] as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in [[memory]]. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including [[#Simulation theory|simulation theory]] and the [[#Expansion of the SRE: group reference|group reference]] effect.
After researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with [[#Autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]]s or those experiencing [[#Depression|depression]].

==Self-concept and self-schema==
Self-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]]. A [[self-schema]] is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves.&lt;ref name="source14"&gt;Katz, A. N. (1987). Self-reference in the encoding of creative-relevant traits. ''Journal of Personality, 55''(1), 97-120. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1987.tb00430.x&lt;/ref&gt; For any given trait, an individual may or may not be "schematic"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered "schematic" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., Hamill, R., &amp; Sentis, K. P. (1987). Thinking fat: Self-schemas for body weight and the processing of weight relevant information. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', ''17''(1), 50-71. doi:10.1111/j.1559-1816.1987.tb00292.x&lt;/ref&gt; When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory.&lt;ref name = "source15"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.8533&lt;/ref&gt; Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema.&lt;ref name="source16"&gt;Mills, C. J. (1983). Sex-typing and self-schemata effects on memory and response latency. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45''(1), 163-172. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.163&lt;/ref&gt; Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.&lt;ref name = "source14"/&gt;

Self-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema.&lt;ref name = "source12"/&gt; When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and [[Recall (memory)|recalled]].  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.&lt;ref name = "source16"/&gt;

Self-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).&lt;ref name="source31"&gt;Johnson, C., Gadon, O., Carlson, D., Southwick, S., Faith, M., &amp; Chalfin, J. (2002). Self-reference and group membership: Evidence for a group-reference effect. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 32''(2), 261-274. doi:10.1002/ejsp.83&lt;/ref&gt; Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.

In order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="ego"&gt;Dunkel, C. S. (2005). Ego-identity and the Processing of Self-relevant Information . Self and Identity, 349-359&lt;/ref&gt; Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were "like me" or "not like me," they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.&lt;ref name="behavior"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Strube, M., Berry, J. M., Lott, C., Fogelman, R., Steinhart, G., Moergen, S., &amp; Davison, L. (1986). Self-schematic representation of the Type A and B behavior patterns. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''51''(1), 170-180. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.170&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive.&lt;ref name = "ego"/&gt; Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

In addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt; That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the "like me" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.

===Self-awareness and personality===
Two of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;Hull, J. G., &amp; Levy, A. S. (1979). The organizational functions of the self: An alternative to the Duval and Wicklund Model of self-awareness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37''(5), 756-768. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.37.5.756&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention &lt;ref&gt;Duval, S., &amp; Wicklund, R. A. (1972). ''A theory of objective self-awareness.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.

In later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Hull, J. G., Van Treuren, R. R., Ashford, S. J., Propsom, P., &amp; Andrus, B. W. (1988). Self-consciousness and the processing of self-relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54''(3), 452-465. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.452&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence "The robber took the money from the bank".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1983). ''The architecture of cognition.'' Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

Similar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A and Type B behavior patterns]], focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

==Theoretical background==
Influential psychologists [[Fergus Craik|Craik]] and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, F. I. M., &amp; Lockhart, R. S. (1972).'' ''Levels of processing: A framework for memory research. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11''(6), 671-684.

''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115''(1), 26-38. doi:10.1037/0096-3445.115.1.26&lt;/ref&gt; Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive [[adjectives]] on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an "incidental recall task". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and [[phonemic]] tasks lead only to "shallow" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to "deep" encoding and resulted in better recall.&lt;ref&gt;Craik F., &amp; Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104,'' 268-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Experts suggest that the call on [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field &lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 "revisited" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the "self" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive &lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt;

Researchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A [[meta-analysis]] by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.&lt;ref name="source4" /&gt;

Theorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndyke, P. W., &amp; Hayes-Roth, B. (1979). The use schemata in the acquisition and transfer of knowledge.'' Cognitive Psychology, 11''(1), 82-106. [[doi: 10.1016/0010-0285(79)90005-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.&lt;ref name="source16" /&gt;

==Types of self-referential encoding tasks==
As research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as "self-descriptive." Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.

In a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive.&lt;ref name="source12" /&gt;  The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt;

==Explanations for the self-reference effect==
While a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis.&lt;ref name="source3"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1988). The nature of self-referent encoding: The contributions of elaborative and organizational processes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55''(1), 5-11. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.&lt;ref name="source34"&gt;Bennett, M., Allan, S., Anderson, J., &amp; Asker, N. (2010). On the robustness of the group reference effect. European Journal of Social Psychology, 40(2), 349-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaboration===
Elaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace,&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Organization===
The organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt; This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Structural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior &lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Dual process===
Psychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, G. O., &amp; Hunt, R. R. (1980). Levels of processing and organization: Additive effects of individual item and relational processing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory'',''6'', 588-598.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.
 
Ultimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Overall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled.&lt;ref name="source4"&gt;Symons, C. S., &amp; Johnson, B. T. (1997). The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 121''(3), 371-394. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371&lt;/ref&gt; The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.&lt;ref name = "source4"/&gt;

==Social brain science==
The field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics.&lt;ref name="source7"&gt;Mitchell, J. P., Banaji, M. R., &amp; Macrae, C. (2005). The Link between social cognition and self-referential thought in the medial prefrontal cortex. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17''(8), 1306-1315. doi:10.1162/0898929055002418&lt;/ref&gt; Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt;

The research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source33"&gt;Moran, J. M., Macrae, C. N., Heatherton, T. F., Wyland, C. L., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2006). Neuroanatomical evidence for distinct cognitive and affective components of self. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18''(9), 1586-1594. doi:10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1586&lt;/ref&gt; When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The [[caudate nucleus]] has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, P., Hevenor, S. J., Lepage, M., Graham, S. J., Grady, C., Keightley, M. L., et al. (2004). Distributed self in episodic memory: Neural correlates of successful retrieval of self-encoded positive and negative personality traits. ''Neuroimage, 22''(4), 1596-1604. [[doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034|doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The ventral [[Cingulate cortex#Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex]] (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; There is also pCC ([[posterior cingulate cortex]]) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt;

===Depth of processing or cognitive structure===
Given all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Previous studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.

===Simulation theory===
While not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the [[simulation theory of empathy]]. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the [[false-consensus effect]].&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt;

==Expansion of the SRE: group reference==
In addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer M. B. ,&amp; Gardner, W. (1996). Who is this 'We'? Levels of collective identity and self representations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71'', 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Previous research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members &lt;ref&gt;Wright, S.C., Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., &amp; Ropp, S. A. (1997). The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73'', 73–90.&lt;/ref&gt; into the development of their self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other and self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60'', 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

In order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Despite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;
 
Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, T. J., Rule, G. R., &amp; Carlson, D. (1983). Memory for personally relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44'', 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, L., Sedikides, C., &amp; Graetz, K. (1999). In search of self-definition: Motivational primacy of the individual self, motivational primacy of the collective self, or contextual primacy? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76'', 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;

Ultimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

==Applications==
Once the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.

===Autism spectrum disorder===
Individuals diagnosed with [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms.  Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more "self-focused." That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Lombardo, M. V., Barnes, J. L., Wheelwright, S. J., Cohen-Baron, S. (2007). Self-referential cognition and empathy in autism. ''PLoS ONE, 2''(9), e883. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000883&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture &lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Noting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with [[self-awareness]], it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes.&lt;ref name="source9"&gt;Henderson, H. A., Zahka, N. E., Kojkowski, N. M., Inge, A. P., Schwartz, C. B., Hileman, C. M., &amp; ... Mundy, P. C. (2009). Self-referenced memory, social cognition, and symptom presentation in autism. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50''(7), 853-861. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02059.x&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: "the self," asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, "similar close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, "dissimilar non-close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Therefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals.&lt;ref name = "source9"/&gt; However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Lombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.

Ultimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can [[mentalization|mentalize]] with others.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

===Depression===
There are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  [[anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions.

'''Sensitization''' is a non-associative [[learning]] process in which repeated administration of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] results in the progressive amplification of a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shettleworth |first=S. J. |year=2010 |title=Cognition, Evolution and Behavior |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Oxford |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitization often is characterized by an enhancement of response to a whole class of stimuli in addition to the one that is repeated. For example, repetition of a painful stimulus may make one more responsive to a loud noise.
==History==
[[Eric Kandel]] was one of the first to study the neural basis of sensitization, conducting experiments in the 1960s and 1970s on the gill withdrawal reflex of the seaslug ''[[Aplysia]]''. Kandel and his colleagues first habituated the reflex, weakening the response by repeatedly touching the animal's siphon. They then paired noxious electrical stimulus to the tail with a touch to the siphon, causing the gill withdrawal response to reappear. After this sensitization, a light touch to the siphon alone produced a strong gill withdrawal response, and this sensitization effect lasted for several days. (After Squire and Kandel, 1999&lt;ref name=Squire&gt;Squire LR, Kandel ER (1999). ''Memory: From Mind to Molecules.'' New York: Scientific American Library; New York: W.H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-6037-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2000, Eric Kandel was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his research in neuronal learning processes.

==Neural substrates of sensitization==
{{addiction glossary|reverse citation order=yes}}
The neural basis of behavioral sensitization is often not known, but it typically seems to result from a cellular receptor becoming more likely to respond to a stimulus. Several examples of neural sensitization include:
* Electrical or chemical stimulation of the rat [[hippocampus]] causes strengthening of [[synaptic signal]]s, a process known as [[long-term potentiation]] or LTP.&lt;ref name=Collingridge&gt;Collingridge GL, Isaac JT, Wang YT (2004). "Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity". ''Nat Rev Neurosci'' 5(12): 952–962, {{PMID|15550950}}, {{DOI|10.1038/nrn1556}}.&lt;/ref&gt; LTP of [[AMPA receptor]]s is a potential mechanism underlying memory and learning in the brain.
* In "[[Kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling]]", repeated stimulation of hippocampal or [[amygdala|amygdaloid]] neurons in the [[limbic system]] eventually leads to [[seizure]]s in laboratory animals. After sensitization, very little stimulation may be required to produce seizures. Thus, kindling has been suggested as a model for [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in humans, where stimulation of a repetitive type (flickering lights for instance) can cause epileptic seizures.&lt;ref name=Morimoto&gt;Morimoto K, Fahnestock M, Racine RJ (2004). "Kindling and status epilepticus models of epilepsy: Rewiring the brain". ''Prog Neurobiol'' 73(1): 1–60, {{PMID|15193778}}, {{DOI|10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.03.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy report symptoms of negative effects such as anxiety and depression that might result from limbic dysfunction.&lt;ref name=Teicher&gt;Teicher MH, Glod CA, Surrey J, Swett C, Jr (1993). "Early childhood abuse and limbic system ratings in adult psychiatric outpatients". ''J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci'' 5(3): 301–306, {{PMID|8369640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "central sensitization," [[nociceptive neuron]]s in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]]s of the [[spinal cord]] become sensitized by peripheral tissue damage or inflammation.&lt;ref name=Ji&gt;Ji RR, Kohno T, Moore KA, Woolf CJ (2003). "Central sensitization and LTP: Do pain and memory share similar mechanisms?". ''Trends Neurosci'' 26(12): 696–705, {{PMID|14624855}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of sensitization has been suggested as a possible causal mechanism for chronic pain conditions.  The changes of central sensitization occur after repeated trials to pain.  Research from animals has consistently shown that when a trial is repeatedly exposed to a painful stimulus, the animal’s pain threshold will change and result in a stronger pain response.  Researchers believe that there are parallels that can be drawn between these animal trials and persistent pain in people.  For example, after a back surgery that removed a herniated disc from causing a pinched nerve, the patient may still continue to “feel” pain.  Also, newborns who are circumcised without anesthesia have shown tendencies to react more greatly to future injections, vaccinations, and other similar procedures.  The responses of these children are an increase in crying and a greater hemodynamic response (tachycardia and tachypnea).&lt;ref&gt;Gudin J. (2004). Medscape Neurobiology: Expanding Our Understanding of Central Sensitization. Medscape: Medscape Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drug sensitization]] occurs in [[drug addiction]], and is defined as an increased effect of drug following repeated doses (the opposite of [[drug tolerance]]). Such sensitization involves changes in brain [[mesolimbic]] [[dopamine]] transmission, as well as a protein inside mesolimbic neurons called [[FosB#Delta FosB|delta FosB]]. An associative process may contribute to addiction, for environmental stimuli associated with drug taking may increase craving. This process may increase the risk for relapse in addicts attempting to quit.&lt;ref name= Robinson&gt;Robinson TE, Berridge KC (1993). "The neural basis of drug craving: An incentive-sensitization theory of addiction". ''Brain Res Brain Res Rev'' 18(3): 247–291, {{PMID|8401595}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Allergic Sensitization – There is an acute response (early stages) and a late-phase response (later stages).  In the early stages, the Antigen-Presenting Cell causes a response in a TH2 lymphocyte which produce the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4).  The TH2 lymphocytes interact with B cells and together they produce IgE.  IgE circulates around and binds to receptors of cells leading to an acute inflammatory response.&lt;ref&gt;Janeway, Charles; Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik (2001). Immunobiology; Fifth Edition. New York and London: Garland Science. pp. e–book. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4101-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, sensitization is commonly referring to commencement of allergic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Janeway C, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik M, eds. (2001). Immunobiology 5: The Immune System in Health and Disease. New York: Garland Pub., {{ISBN|0-8153-3642-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allergic sensitization development varies with age, with younger children at the greatest risk of developing allergic sensitization.&lt;ref name="Croner1992"&gt;Croner S (1992). "Prediction and detection of allergy development: influence of genetic and environmental factors". J. Pediatr. 121 (5 Pt 2): S58–63. {{doi|10.1016/S0022-3476(05)81408-8}}. {{PMID|1447635}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a variety of tests to diagnose allergic conditions.  Tests that are commonly used place potential allergens on the skin of the patient and looking for a reaction to look for an allergen-specific IgE (Immunoglobulin E).  They have shown that IgE levels are at their greatest before 10 years of age and fall vastly until one reaches 30.&lt;ref name="Croner1992"/&gt;  There is a school of thought that believes that there are different genetic loci for different ethnicities for the same inflammatory disease.&lt;ref&gt;De Swert LF (1999). "Risk factors for allergy". Eur. J. Pediatr. 158 (2): 89–94. {{doi|10.1007/s004310051024}}. {{PMID|10048601}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By this thought, asthma has different chromosomal locations in people of European, Hispanic, Asian, and African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes KC, Grant AV, Hansel NN, Gao P, Dunston GM (2007). "African Americans with asthma: genetic insights". Proc Am Thorac Soc 4 (1): 58–68. {{doi|10.1513/pats.200607-146JG}}. {{PMC|2647616}}. {{PMID|17202293}}.

==Cross-sensitization==

'''Cross-sensitization'''&lt;!--term redirects here; bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt; is a phenomenon in which sensitization to a stimulus is generalized to a related stimulus, resulting in the amplification of a particular response to both the original stimulus and the related stimulus.&lt;ref name="pmid19679518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brumovsky PR, Gebhart GF | title = Visceral organ cross-sensitization - an integrated perspective | journal = Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic &amp; Clinical | volume = 153 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 106–15 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19679518 | pmc = 2818077 | doi = 10.1016/j.autneu.2009.07.006 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22378593"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malykhina AP, Wyndaele JJ, Andersson KE, De Wachter S, Dmochowski RR | title = Do the urinary bladder and large bowel interact, in sickness or in health? ICI-RS 2011 | journal = Neurourology and Urodynamics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 352–8 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22378593 | pmc = 3309116 | doi = 10.1002/nau.21228 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-sensitization to the neural and behavioral effects of [[addictive drug]]s are well characterized, such as sensitization to the locomotor response of a stimulant resulting in cross-sensitization to the motor-activating effects of other stimulants.  Similarly, [[reward sensitization]] to a particular addictive drug often results in [[reward cross-sensitization]], which entails sensitization to the [[reward system|rewarding property]] of other addictive drugs in the same [[drug class]] or even certain [[natural reward]]s.

In animals, ''cross-sensitization'' has been established between the consumption of many different types of [[Substance abuse|drugs of abuse]] - in line with the [[gateway drug theory]] - and also between [[sugar]] consumption and the [[self-administration]] of drugs of abuse.&lt;ref name="pmid17617461"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avena NM, Rada P, Hoebel BG | title = Evidence for sugar addiction: behavioral and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–39 | date = 2008 | pmid = 17617461 | pmc = 2235907 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a causal factor in pathology==
Sensitization has been implied as a causal or maintaining mechanism in a wide range of apparently unrelated pathologies including [[addiction]], allergies, asthma, [[overactive bladder]]&lt;ref name="pmid27245505"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reynolds WS, Dmochowski R, Wein A, Bruehl S | title = Does central sensitization help explain idiopathic overactive bladder? | journal = Nature Reviews.

Sensitization may also contribute to psychological disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[panic anxiety]] and [[mood disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen JB, Schulkin J (1998). "From normal fear to pathological anxiety". ''Psychol Rev'' 105(2): 325–350, {{DOI|10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325}} {{PMID|9577241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antelman&gt;Antelman SM (1988).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3506">Given a coupled DEVS model, simulation algorithms are methods to generate the model's ''legal'' behaviors, which are a set of trajectories not to reach illegal states. (see [[Behavior of Coupled DEVS|behavior of a Coupled DEVS]] model.)  [[Simulation_Algorithms_for_Coupled_DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]] originally introduced the algorithms that handle time variables related to ''lifespan'' &lt;math&gt;t_s \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; and ''elapsed time'' &lt;math&gt;t_e\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; by introducing two other time variables, ''last event time'', &lt;math&gt;t_l\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''next event time'' &lt;math&gt; t_n\in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; with the following relations: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \, t_e = t - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_s = t_n - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''current time''. And the ''remaining time'',

 &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\,t_r=t_s-t_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; is equivalently computed as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_r = t_n - t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;, apparently &lt;math&gt; t_r \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.
Based on these relationships, the algorithms to simulate the behavior of a given Coupled DEVS are written as follows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7589">'''Single-subject research''' is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]] with both human and non-human participants. Principal methods in this type of research are: A-B-A-B designs, Multi-element designs, Multiple Baseline designs, Repeated acquisition designs, Brief experimental designs and Combined designs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

These methods form the heart of the data collection and analytic code of behavior analysis. Behavior analysis is data driven, inductive, and disinclined to hypothetico-deductive methods.&lt;ref&gt;Chiese, Mecca. (2004). ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical methods have been largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael, J. |title=Statistical inference for individual organism research: mixed blessing or curse? |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=647–653 |pmid=16795486 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1974.7-647 |year=1974 |pmc=1311683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental questions ==
Experimental questions are decisive in determining the nature of the experimental design to be selected. There are four basic types of experimental questions: demonstration, comparison, parametric, and component.&lt;ref name=kennedy65-66&gt;Kennedy, 2005, pp 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; A demonstration is "Does A cause or influence B?". A comparison is "Does A1 or A2 cause or influence B more?". A parametric question is "How much of A will cause how much change or influence on B?". A component question is "Which part of A{1,2,3} - A1 or A2 or A3... - causes or influences B?" where A is composed of parts which can be separated and tested.&lt;ref name=kennedy65-66 /&gt;

The A-B-A-B design is useful for demonstration questions.

== A-B-A-B  ==

=== A-B ===
An AB design is a two part or phase design composed of a baseline ("A" phase) with no changes, and a treatment or intervention ("B") phase.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/user/sw/ssd/issd10b.htm "Introduction to Single Subject Designs: AB (Baseline And Intervention) Design"]. ''www.msu.edu'', 2000. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010731191638/http://www.msu.edu/user/sw/ssd/issd10b.htm |date=July 31, 2001|accessdate=March 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a change then the treatment may be said to have had an effect. However, it is subject to many possible competing hypotheses, making strong conclusions difficult. Variants on the AB design introduce ways to control for the competing hypotheses to allow for stronger conclusions.

=== Reversal or A-B-A ===
The reversal design is the most powerful of the single-subject research designs showing a strong reversal from baseline ("A") to treatment ("B") and back again. If the variable returns to baseline measure without a treatment then resumes its effects when reapplied, the researcher can have greater confidence in the efficacy of that treatment. However, many interventions cannot be reversed, some for ethical reasons (e.g., involving self-injurious behavior, smoking) and some for practical reasons (they cannot be unlearned, like a skill).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kazdin |first=Alan |title=Single-Case Research Designs |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1982 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ethics notes: It may be unethical to end an experiment on a baseline measure if the treatment is self-sustaining and highly beneficial and/or related to health. Control condition participants may also deserve the benefits of research once all data has been collected. It is a researcher's ethical duty to maximize benefits and to ensure that all participants have access to those benefits when possible.

=== A-B-C ===
The A-B-C design is a variant that allows for the extension of research questions around component, parametric and comparative questions.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multielement ==
Multi-element designs sometimes referred to as alternating-treatment designs are used in order to ascertain the comparative effect of two treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Two treatments are alternated in rapid succession and correlated changes are plotted on a graph to facilitate comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple baseline ==
The [[multiple baseline design]] was first reported in 1960 as used in basic operant research. It was applied in the late 1960s to human experiments in response to practical and ethical issues that arose in withdrawing apparently successful treatments from human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hersen, Michael &amp; Barlow, David H. (1976) ''Single-case Experimental Designs: Strategies for Studying Behavioral Change''. Pergamon, New York. {{ISBN|978-0205474554}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it two or more (often three) behaviors, people or settings are plotted in a staggered graph where a change is made to one, but not the other two, and then to the second, but not the third behavior, person or setting. Differential changes that occur to each behavior, person or in each setting help to strengthen what is essentially an AB design with its problematic competing hypotheses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

== Repeated Acquisition ==
In addition to multiple baseline designs, a way to deal with problematic reversibility is the use of repeated acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;Boren, J. J. (1963). "Repeated acquisition of new behavioral chains". ''American Psychologist'', '''18''', p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief ==
A designed favored by applied settings researchers where logistical challenges, time and other limits make research difficult are variants of multi-element and A-B-A-B type designs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Wacker, Sasso, Reimers, and Dunn (1990) "Using Parents as therapists to evaluate appropriate behavior of their children: application to a tertiary diagnostic clinic". ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', '''23''', pp. 285-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Combined ==
The combined design has arisen from a need to obtain answers to more complex research questions. Combining two or more single-case designs, such as A-B-A-B and multiple baseline, may produce such answers.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Wolf, Risley (1968) "Some still current dimensions of applied behavior analysis". ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', '''1''', 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multipleprobe ==
Popular in [[Verbal Behavior]] research, the multipleprobe research design has elements of the other research designs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

== Changing-Criterion ==
In a changing-criterion research design a criterion for reinforcement is changed across the experiment to demonstrate a functional relation between the reinforcement and the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dixon, M.R. |author2=Falcomata, T.S. |title=Preference for progressive delays and concurrent physical therapy exercise in an adult with acquired brain injury |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=101–105 |year=2004 |doi=10.1901/jaba.2004.37-101 |pmid=15154223 |pmc=1284485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space colonization''' (also called '''space settlement''', or '''extraterrestrial colonization''') is permanent human habitation off the planet [[Earth]].

Many arguments have been made for and against space colonization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.thespaceshow.com The Space Show], an online radio program, has had on average 16 shows per month going back to 2001, many of which discuss space settlement.&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human [[civilization]] and the [[biosphere]] in the event of a [[Global catastrophic risk|planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made)]], and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society. The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions, and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as [[war]]s, [[economic inequality]], and [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Dickens| first1=Peter|last2=Ormrod|first2=James| url=http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end/ |title=The Humanization of the Cosmos - to What End?|date=Nov 2010|publisher=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02&gt;Dickens, Peter (Feb 2008).

[https://monthlyreview.org/2017/03/01/astronauts-at-work/ Astronauts at Work: The Social Relations of Space Travel], ''[[Monthly Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

No space colonies have been built so far. Currently, the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|very hostile]] to human life. They would involve technologies, such as [[controlled ecological life support system]]s, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term. Because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the Earth into orbit (around $2,500 per-pound to orbit, expected to further decrease),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/?no-ist|title=Is SpaceX Changing the Rocket Equation?|author=Andrew Chaikin|work=Air &amp; Space Magazine|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.

There are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization, either government or private. However, many proposals, speculations, and designs for space settlements have been made through the years, and a considerable number of space colonization [[space advocacy|advocates]] and groups are active. Several famous scientists, such as [[Freeman Dyson]], have come out in favor of space settlement.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;{{cite web |author=Britt, Robert Roy |date=8 October 2001 |title=Archived copy |website=space.com |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |accessdate=2006-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083046/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/colonize_why_011008-1.html |archivedate=25 November 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the technological front, there is ongoing progress in making access to space cheaper ([[reusable launch system]]s could reach $10 per-pound to orbit),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a7446/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023/|title=Elon Musk on SpaceX's Reusable Rocket Plans|date=7 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in creating [[Space manufacturing|automated manufacturing and construction techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anthony|first=Sebastian |title=Space giants join forces to battle SpaceX: This is how cheap space travel begins |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/184434-space-giants-join-forces-to-battle-spacex-this-is-how-cheap-space-travel-begins |accessdate=2014-10-10 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==

===Survival of human civilization===
{{Main|Space and survival}}

The primary argument calling for space colonization is the long-term survival of human civilization. By developing alternative locations off Earth, the planet's species, including humans, could live on in the event of [[Global catastrophic risk|natural or man-made disasters on our own planet]].

On two occasions, theoretical physicist and cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] has argued for space colonization as a means of saving humanity. In 2001, Hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years, unless colonies could be established in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Highfield |first=Roger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359562/Colonies-in-space-may-be-only-hope-says-Hawking.html |title=Colonies in space may be only hope, says Hawking |work=The Telegraph |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he stated that humanity faces two options: either we colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets, or we will face the prospect of [[Human extinction|long-term extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mankind must colonize other planets to survive, says Hawking". Daily Mail(London). 2006-12-01. Retrieved March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, then [[NASA]] Administrator [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs, saying:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the goal isn't just scientific exploration&amp;nbsp;... it's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the solar system as we go forward in time&amp;nbsp;... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive&amp;nbsp;... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets. Now, today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable. We're in the infancy of it.&amp;nbsp;... I'm talking about that one day, I don't know when that day is, but there will be more human beings who live off the Earth than on it. We may well have people living on the Moon. We may have people living on the moons of Jupiter and other planets. We may have people making habitats on asteroids&amp;nbsp;... I know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301691.html| title=NASA's Griffin: 'Humans Will Colonize the Solar System'|date=September 25, 2005| publisher=Washington Post| pages=B07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Louis J. Halle]], formerly of the [[United States Department of State]], wrote in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' (Summer 1980) that the colonization of space will protect humanity in the event of global [[nuclear warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| title=A Hopeful Future for Mankind| first=Louis J.| last=Halle| journal=Foreign Affairs| date=Summer 1980| doi=10.2307/20040585| volume=58| issue=5| pages=1129| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013051342/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800601faessay8146/louis-j-halle/a-hopeful-future-for-mankind.html| archivedate=2004-10-13| df=| jstor=20040585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist [[Paul Davies]] also supports the view that if a planetary catastrophe threatens the survival of the human species on Earth, a self-sufficient colony could "reverse-colonize" Earth and restore [[Civilization|human civilization]]. The author and journalist [[William E. Burrows]] and the biochemist [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] proposed a private project, the [[Alliance to Rescue Civilization]], with the goal of establishing an off-Earth "[[backup]]" of human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/science/01arc.html | title = Life After Earth: Imagining Survival Beyond This Terra Firma | publisher = New York Times | first=Richard | last=Morgan | date=2006-08-01 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his [[Copernican principle]], [[J. Richard Gott]] has estimated that the human race could survive for another 7.8 million years, but it is not likely to ever colonize other planets. However, he expressed a hope to be proven wrong, because "colonizing other worlds is our best chance to hedge our bets and improve the survival prospects of our species".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tierney |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17tier.html?ex=1342324800&amp;en=ccf375ae9f268470&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=A Survival Imperative for Space Colonization |date=July 17, 2007 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vast resources in space===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space }}
Resources in space, both in materials and energy, are enormous. The [[Solar System]] alone has, according to different estimates, enough material and energy to support anywhere from several thousand to over a billion times that of the current Earth-based human population.&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 3000 times the land area of Earth. O'Neill, Gerard K. (1976, 2000). ''[[The High Frontier]]''. Apogee Books {{ISBN|1-896522-67-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 10 quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) people. Lewis, John S. (1997). ''[[Mining the Sky|Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets]].'' Helix Books/Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-32819-4}} version 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimated 5 quintillion (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) people. Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994). ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]].'' Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Solar System, several hundred billion other stars in the [[observable universe]] provide opportunities for both colonization and resource collection, though travel to any of them is impossible on any practical time-scale without [[interstellar travel]] by use of [[generation ship]]s or revolutionary new methods of travel, such as [[faster-than-light]] (FTL).

Asteroid mining will also be a key player in space colonization. Water and materials to make structures and shielding can be easily found in asteroids. Instead of resupplying on Earth, mining and fuel stations need to be established on asteroids to facilitate better space travel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2017_Phase_I_Phase_II/Sustainable_Human_Exploration Optical Mining of Asteroids, Moons, and Planets to Enable Sustainable Human Exploration and Space Industrialization]; April 6, 2017; NASA&lt;/ref&gt; Optical mining is the term NASA uses to describe extracting materials from asteroids. NASA believes by using propellant derived from asteroids for exploration to the moon, Mars, and beyond will save $100 billion. If funding and technology come sooner than estimated, asteroid mining might be possible within a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/05/24/how-to-optically-mine-water-from-an-asteroid/#37f0e05c389f Turning Near-Earth Asteroids Into Strategically-Placed Fuel Dumps]; May 24, 2016; Forbe&lt;/ref&gt;

All these planets and other bodies offer a virtually endless supply of resources providing limitless growth potential. Harnessing these resources can lead to much economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Economic Development. Paine, Thomas O. (1992). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252328678_Mars_Colonization_Technically_Feasible_Affordable_and_a_Universal_Human_Drive Mars Colonization: Technically Feasible, Affordable, and a Universal Human Drive].'' National Forum. 72.3. P24. Gale Document Number: GALE|A13330278 (can request a copy directly from the authors)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion with fewer negative consequences===
{{Further|Holocene extinction}}

Expansion of humans and technological progress has usually resulted in some form of environmental devastation, and destruction of [[ecosystem]]s and their accompanying [[wildlife]]. In the past, expansion has often come at the expense of displacing many [[indigenous peoples]], the resulting treatment of these peoples ranging anywhere from encroachment to genocide. Because space has no known life, this need not be a consequence, as some space settlement advocates have pointed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.space-settlement-institute.org/meaning.html| title=The Meaning of Space Settlement| publisher = Space Settlement Institute| accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Marshall (1992, 1994). ''[[The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]]''. Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-77163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleviating overpopulation and resource demand===
{{See also|Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement}}
Another argument for space colonization is to mitigate the negative effects of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1976-01-01|title=The impact of space colonization on world dynamics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040162576900196|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=361–399|doi=10.1016/0040-1625(76)90019-6|issn=0040-1625}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;!-- Is this to mitigate "negative effects" for some group of persons who settle off Earth, or to generally mitigate a perceived overpopulation problem on Earth? Looking for sources on the latter argument, if it is being made. --&gt;
If the resources of space were opened to use and viable life-supporting habitats were built, Earth would no longer define the limitations of growth. Although many of Earth's resources are non-renewable, off-planet colonies could satisfy the majority of the planet's resource requirements. With the availability of extraterrestrial resources, demand on terrestrial ones would decline.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Colonies in Space''; Pournelle, ''A Step Farther Out''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
Additional goals cite the innate human drive to explore and discover, a quality recognized at the core of progress and thriving civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Clarke, Arthur C. |title= Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible |year= 1962 |chapter= Rocket to the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03y.html | title= The Space Settlement Summit | author= McKnight, John Carter | publisher= Space Daily | date= 20 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that from a [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] perspective, space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live for a very long period of time (possibly billions of years), which would produce an enormous amount of utility (or happiness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html |title= Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development |journal= Utilitas |volume= 15 |number= 3 |date= November 2003 |pages= 308–314 |publisher= Cambridge University Press | doi= 10.1017/S0953820800004076|last1= Bostrom |first1= Nick }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that it is more important to reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner. In his paper, he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of [[suffering]].

In a 2001 interview with Freeman Dyson, J.&amp;nbsp;Richard Gott and Sid Goldstein, they were asked for reasons why some humans should live in space.&lt;ref name=dyson /&gt; Their answers were:
* Spread life and beauty throughout the universe
* Ensure the survival of our species
* Make money through new forms of [[Commercialization of space|space commercialization]] such as [[space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], [[asteroid mining]], and [[space manufacturing]]
* Save the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] of Earth by moving people and industry into space

==Goals==

Although some items of the infrastructure requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items (oxygen, water, base metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space. These would provide (over the long-term) a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_technical_and_economic_feasibility_of_mining_the_near_earth_asteriods.shtml The Technical and Economic Feasibility of Mining the Near-Earth Asteroids] Presented at 49th IAF Congress, Sept 28 - Oct 2, 1998, Melbourne, Australia by Mark J Sonter&amp;nbsp;— Space Future&lt;/ref&gt;

The mining and extraction of metals from a small asteroid the size of [[3554 Amun]] or [[(6178) 1986 DA]], both small near-Earth asteroids, would be 30 times as much metal as humans have mined throughout history. A metal asteroid this size would be worth approximately US$20 trillion at 2001 market prices.

Space colonization is seen as a long-term goal of some national [[space program]]s. Since the advent of the 21st-century commercialization of space, which saw greater cooperation between NASA and the private sector, several private companies have announced plans toward the [[colonization of Mars]]. Among entrepreneurs leading the call for space colonization are [[Elon Musk]], [[Dennis Tito]] and [[Bas Lansdorp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4729211/Billionaire-PayPal-founder-announces-Mars-city-bid.html Billionaire PayPal founder announces dramatic Mars city bid], by Jack Losh; The Sun, January 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/business/global/reality-tv-for-the-red-planet.html Reality TV for the Red Planet], by Nicola Clark; The New York Times, March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130222-manned-mission-mars-tito-space-science/ Businessman Dennis Tito Financing Manned Mission to Mars], by Jane J.

Major governments and well-funded corporations have announced plans for new categories of activities: space tourism and hotels, prototype space-based solar-power satellites, heavy-lift boosters and [[asteroid mining]]—that create needs and capabilities for humans to be present in space.&lt;ref name="VirginGalactic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.virgingalactic.com/booking/ | title = Virgin Galactic Booking Tickets to Space | accessdate = 2014-01-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140122180541/http://www.virgingalactic.com/booking | archivedate = 2014-01-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatSecSpaceOffice2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://spacesolarpower.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release__01.pdf | title = Space-Based Solar Power As an Opportunity for Strategic Security, Phase 0 Architecture Feasibility Study 10 October 2007 | publisher = United States National Security Space Office | accessdate = 2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FalconHeavy"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy | title = Falcon Heavy, The World's Most Powerful Rocket | accessdate = 2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
Building colonies in space would require access to water, food, space, people, construction materials, energy, transportation, [[communication]]s, [[life support system|life support]], [[simulated gravity]], [[radiation]] protection and capital investment. It is likely the colonies would be located near the necessary physical resources. The practice of [[space architecture]] seeks to transform spaceflight from a heroic test of human endurance to a normality within the bounds of comfortable experience. As is true of other frontier-opening endeavors, the capital investment necessary for space colonization would probably come from governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume4/space.htm |title=The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects |author=John Hickman |work=Journal of Evolution and Technology |publisher=Jetpress.org |volume=4 |date=November 1999 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |issn=1541-0099}}&lt;/ref&gt; an argument made by John Hickman&lt;ref&gt;John Hickman. 2010.

===Materials===
{{Further|Asteroid mining}}

Colonies on the Moon, Mars, or asteroids could extract local materials. The Moon is deficient in [[volatiles]] such as [[argon]], [[helium]] and compounds of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]]. The LCROSS impacter was targeted at the Cabeus crater which was chosen as having a high concentration of water for the Moon. A plume of material erupted in which some water was detected. Mission chief scientist Anthony Colaprete estimated that the Cabeus crater contains material with 1% water or possibly more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/NASA-s-moon-blast-called-a-smashing-success-3213973.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=David | last=Perlman | title=NASA's moon blast called a smashing success | date=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water [[ice]] should also be in other permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles. Although helium is present only in low concentrations on the Moon, where it is deposited into [[regolith]] by the solar wind, an estimated million tons of He-3 exists over all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151604/http://www.satnews.com/stories2007/4588/ |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has industrially significant [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], and metals such as [[iron]], [[aluminum]], and [[titanium]].

Launching materials from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies could come from the Moon, a [[near-Earth object]] (NEO), [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], or [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]] on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like [[oil shale]]), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and [[kerogen]] hydrocarbons, as well as some nitrogen compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/40177(207)107 |title=Discovery of Abundant, Accessible Hydrocarbons nearly Everywhere in the Solar System |last1= Zuppero|first1= Anthony |year= 1996 |publisher= [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |booktitle= Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Space '96 |doi= 10.1061/40177(207)107|isbn= 0-7844-0177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farther out, [[Colonization of the outer Solar System#Trojan asteroids|Jupiter's Trojan asteroids]] are thought to be rich in water ice and other volatiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sanders|first=Robert|title=Binary asteroid in Jupiter's orbit may be icy comet from solar system's infancy|date=1 February 2006|publisher=UC Berkeley|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/02/01_patroclus.shtml|accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recycling]] of some raw materials would almost certainly be necessary.

===Energy===
[[Solar energy]] in orbit is abundant, reliable, and is commonly used to power satellites today. There is no night in free space, and no clouds or atmosphere to block sunlight. Light intensity obeys an [[inverse-square law]]. So the solar energy available at distance ''d'' from the Sun is ''E'' = 1367/''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''d'' is measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) and 1367 watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the energy available at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, 1 AU.&lt;ref&gt;McGRAW-HILL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF Science &amp; Technology, 8th Edition (c)1997; vol. 16 page 654&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weightlessness and vacuum of space, high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in [[solar ovens]] with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures. Flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas (to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays, or to make the Sun's image appear to move across their "sky") or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.

Large solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hours]] per person per year.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm UNESCAP Electric Power in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213083253/http://www.unescap.org/esd/energy/information/ElectricPower/1999-2000/access.htm |date=February 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with [[wireless power transmission]].

A major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large [[solar power satellite]]s that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked [[microwave]] beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[nuclear waste]] from electricity generation.

Transmitting solar energy wirelessly from the Earth to the Moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources. Physicist Dr. David Criswell, who worked for NASA during the Apollo missions, came up with the idea of using power beams to transfer energy from space. These beams, microwaves with a wavelength of about 12&amp;nbsp;cm, will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere. They can also be aimed at more industrial areas to keep away from humans or animal activities.&lt;ref name="i2massociates.com"&gt;[http://www.i2massociates.com/downloads/AAPG_Memoir_101-July18-2012.pdf Nuclear Power and Associated Environmental Issues in the Transition of Exploration and Mining on Earth to the Development of Off-World Natural Resources in the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow for safer and more reliable methods of transferring solar energy.

In 2008, scientists were able to send a 20 watt microwave signal from a mountain in Maui to the island of Hawaii. Since then [[JAXA]] and Mitsubishi has teamed up on a $21 billion project in order to place satellites in orbit which could generate up to 1 gigawatt of energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-06/satellites-could-gather-energy-sun-and-beam-it-down-earth Space Based Solar Power],&lt;!--Author?--&gt; ''Popular Science'', June 2, 2011.{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the next advancements being done today in order to make energy be transmitted wirelessly for space-based solar energy.

However, the value of SPS power delivered wirelessly to other locations in space will typically be far higher than to Earth. Otherwise, the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of Earth launch costs. Therefore, other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to Earth,&lt;ref name="NatSecSpaceOffice2007"/&gt; the first priority for SPS electricity is likely to be locations in space, such as communications satellites, fuel depots or "orbital tugboat" boosters transferring cargo and passengers between [[low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) and other orbits such as [[geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO), [[lunar orbit]] or [[highly-eccentric Earth orbit]] (HEEO).&lt;ref name="Lewis1997"&gt;[[Mining the Sky]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}} The system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on Earth to convert the energy into electricity. Because of this energy can be transmitted easily from dayside to nightside meaning power is reliable 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/moon-solar-energy-power Beaming solar energy from the Moon could solve Earth's energy crisis]; March 29, 2017; WIRED]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] is sometimes proposed for colonies located on the Moon or on Mars, as the supply of solar energy is too discontinuous in these locations; the Moon has nights of two Earth weeks in duration. Mars has nights, relatively high gravity, and an atmosphere featuring [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|large dust storms]] to cover and degrade solar panels. Also, Mars' greater distance from the Sun (1.5 astronomical units, AU) translates into ''E/(1.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25)'' only ½-⅔ the solar energy of Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091004020806.htm 'Trash Can' Nuclear Reactors Could Power Human Outpost On Moon Or Mars]; October 4, 2009; ScienceDaily&lt;/ref&gt; Another method would be transmitting energy wirelessly to the lunar or Martian colonies from solar power satellites (SPSs) as described above; the difficulties of generating power in these locations make the relative advantages of SPSs much greater there than for power beamed to locations on Earth. In order to also be able to fulfill the requirements of a moon base and energy to supply life support, maintenance, communications, and research, a combination of both nuclear and solar energy will be used in the first colonies.&lt;ref name="i2massociates.com"/&gt;

For both solar thermal and nuclear power generation in airless environments, such as the Moon and space, and to a lesser extent the very thin Martian atmosphere, one of the main difficulties is dispersing the [[Carnot cycle|inevitable heat generated]]. This requires fairly large radiator areas.

===Life support===
{{Further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Space medicine|Space food}}

In space settlements, a life support system must recycle or import all the nutrients without "crashing." The closest terrestrial analogue to space life support is possibly that of a [[nuclear submarine]]. Nuclear submarines use mechanical life support systems to support humans for months without surfacing, and this same basic technology could presumably be employed for space use. However, nuclear submarines run "open loop"—extracting oxygen from seawater, and typically dumping [[carbon dioxide]] overboard, although they recycle existing oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airitilibrary.com.libproxy1.usc.edu/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=P20100106003-200911-201004190023-201004190023-1642-1650|title=A Novel Application of the SAWD-Sabatier-SPE Integrated System for CO2 Removal and O2 Regeneration in Submarine Cabins during Prolonged Voyages|last=Huang|first=Zhi|date=|website=Airiti Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling of the carbon dioxide has been approached in the literature using the [[Sabatier process]] or the [[Bosch reaction]].

Although a fully mechanistic life support system is conceivable, a [[closed ecological system]] is generally proposed for life support. The [[Biosphere 2]] project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.

The relationship between organisms, their habitat and the non-Earth environment can be:
* Organisms and their habitat fully isolated from the environment (examples include artificial [[biosphere]], Biosphere 2, [[life support system]])
* Changing the environment to become a life-friendly habitat, a process called [[terraforming]]
* Changing organisms to become more compatible with the environment (see [[genetic engineering]], [[transhumanism]], [[cyborg]])

A combination of the above technologies is also possible.

===Radiation protection===
{{see also|Health threat from cosmic rays}}

[[Cosmic rays]] and [[solar flare]]s create a lethal radiation environment in space. In Earth orbit, the [[Van Allen belts]] make living above the Earth's atmosphere difficult. To protect life, settlements must be surrounded by sufficient mass to absorb most incoming radiation, unless magnetic or plasma radiation shields were developed.&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding&gt;[http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~simon_g_shepherd/research/Shielding/ Spacecraft Shielding] engineering.dartmouth.edu. Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive mass shielding of four metric tons per square meter of surface area will reduce radiation dosage to several [[Sievert#Yearly dose examples|mSv]] or less annually, well below the rate of some populated [[Background radiation#Natural background radiation|high natural background areas]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;NASA SP-413 [http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/5appendE.html Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix E Mass Shielding] Retrieved 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be leftover material (slag) from processing lunar soil and asteroids into oxygen, metals, and other useful materials. However, it represents a significant obstacle to maneuvering vessels with such massive bulk (mobile spacecraft being particularly likely to use less massive active shielding).&lt;ref name = spacecraftshielding/&gt; Inertia would necessitate powerful thrusters to start or stop rotation, or electric motors to spin two massive portions of a vessel in opposite senses. Shielding material can be stationary around a rotating interior.

===Self-replication===
{{see also|von Neumann probe|clanking replicator|molecular nanotechnology}}

[[Space manufacturing]] could enable self-replication. Some think it's the ultimate goal because it allows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Crawford, "Where are they?," ''Scientific American'' 283, no. 1 (2000 July): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be argued that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of [[self-replication]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Margulis and Ricardo Guerrero, "Life as a planetary phenomenon: the colonization of Mars," ''Microbiología'' 11 (1995): 173-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as [[integrated circuit]]s, medicines, [[DNA|genetic material]] and tools.

===Psychological adjustment===
The monotony and loneliness that comes from a prolonged space mission can leave astronauts susceptible to cabin fever or having a psychotic break. Moreover, lack of sleep, fatigue, and work overload can affect an astronaut's ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.&lt;ref&gt;Clynes, Manfred E. and Nathan S. Kline, (1960) "Cyborgs and Space," Astronautics, September, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27 and 74-76;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population size===
In 2002, the [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[John H. Moore]] [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1936-magic-number-for-space-pioneers-calculated. estimated] that a population of 150–180 would permit a stable society to exist for 60 to 80 generations&amp;nbsp;— equivalent to 2000 years.

A much smaller initial population of as little as two women should be viable as long as human [[embryo]]s are available from Earth. Use of a [[sperm bank]] from Earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible [[inbreeding]].

Researchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the "50/500" rule of thumb initially advanced by Franklin and Soule. This rule says a short-term [[effective population size]] (''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of [[breed|inbreeding]], whereas a long‐term ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders. The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to [[genetic drift]].

Assuming a journey of 6,300 years, the astrophysicist Frédéric Marin and the particle physicist Camille Beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a [[generation ship]] to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission (then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1806.03856|last1=Marin|first1=F|title=Computing the minimal crew for a multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b|last2=Beluffi|first2=C|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611485/this-is-how-many-people-wed-have-to-send-to-proxima-centauri-to-make-sure-someone-actually/amp/ |publisher=''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' |title=This is how many people we’d have to send to Proxima Centauri to make sure someone actually arrives |date=June 22, 2018 |quote=“We can then conclude that, under the parameters used for those simulations, a minimum crew of 98 settlers is needed for a 6,300-year multi-generational space journey towards Proxima Centauri b,” say Marin and Beluffi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Mars mission.jpg|thumb|Artist Les Bossinas' 1989 concept of [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars mission]]]]
Location is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The location of colonization can be on a physical body [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], [[natural satellite]], or [[asteroid]] or orbiting one. For colonies not on a body see also [[space habitat]].

===Near-Earth space===

====The Moon====
{{Main|Colonization of the Moon}}
Due to its proximity and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed as a target for colonization. It has the benefits of proximity to Earth and lower [[escape velocity]], allowing for easier exchange of goods and services. A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Water-ice deposits that exist in some polar [[Impact crater|craters]] could serve as a source for these elements. An alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-Earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.

The Moon's low surface gravity is also a concern, as it is unknown whether 1/6[[g-force|g]] is enough to maintain human health for long periods.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} &lt;!--add, or link to, something about zero-gee bone decay and the like--&gt;

The Moon's lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids. The early Moon colonies may shelter in ancient [[Lunar lava tube]]s to gain protection. The two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.

====Lagrange points====
{{Main|Lagrange point colonization}}
[[File:Lagrange points.jpg|thumb|A contour plot of the [[gravitational potential]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]], showing the five Earth–Sun Lagrange points]]

Another near-Earth possibility are the five Earth–Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]]. Although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the Sun. However, the fact that the  Earth–Moon Lagrange points {{L4}} and {{L5}} tend to collect dust and debris, whereas {{L1}}-{{L3}} require active [[orbital stationkeeping|station-keeping]] measures to maintain a stable position, make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed. Additionally, the orbit of {{L2}}–{{L5}} takes them out of the protection of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] for approximately two-thirds of the time, exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.

The five Earth–Sun Lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses, but only {{L1}} and {{L2}} would be reachable in a few days' time. The other three Earth–Sun points would require months to reach.

===Other micro-g orbits===
See [[space habitat]]

===The inner planets===

====Mercury====
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
{{specific|section|date=August 2018}}
Colonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Geologist Stephen Gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make Mercury an ideal place to build and launch [[solar sail]] spacecraft, which could launch as folded up "chunks" by [[mass driver]] from Mercury's surface.  Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's [[solar constant]] is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Schmidt and [[Robert Zubrin]], eds., "Islands in the Sky: Bold New Ideas for Colonizing Space"; Wiley, 1996, p. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venus====
{{Main|Colonization of Venus}}
[[File:TerraformedVenus.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a terraformed Venus]]

====Mars====
{{Main|Colonization of Mars}}

===Asteroid belt===
{{Main|Colonization of the asteroids}}
{{See also|Asteroids#Exploration}}

Colonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The [[asteroid belt]] has significant overall material available, the largest object being [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous [[momentum]]. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.

===Moons of outer planets===

====Jovian moons&amp;nbsp;– Europa, Callisto and Ganymede====
{{Main|Colonization of Europa|Colonization of the outer Solar System}}

The [[Artemis Project]] designed a plan to colonize [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], one of [[Jupiter]]'s moons. Scientists were to inhabit [[igloo]]s and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. This plan discusses possible use of "air pockets" for human habitation. Europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.

NASA performed a study called ''HOPE'' (Revolutionary Concepts for '''H'''uman '''O'''uter '''P'''lanet '''E'''xploration) regarding the future exploration of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A. Troutman (NASA Langley Research Center) et al., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030063128.pdf Revolutionary Concepts for Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE)], accessed May 10, 2006 (.doc format)&lt;/ref&gt; The target chosen was [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] due to its distance from Jupiter, and thus the planet's harmful radiation. It could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.

Three of the [[Galilean moons]] (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) have an abundance of volatiles that may support colonization efforts.

====Moons of Saturn&amp;nbsp;– Titan, Enceladus, and others====
{{Main|Colonization of Titan}}

[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is suggested as a target for colonization,&lt;ref name="zoob2ttn"&gt;Robert Zubrin, ''Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization'', section: Titan, pp. 163–166, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-58542-036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is the only moon in the Solar System to have a dense atmosphere and is rich in carbon-bearing compounds. Titan has ice water and large methane oceans.&lt;ref name=NasaNews&gt;[https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan/] https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/titan/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Zubrin]] identified Titan as possessing an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life{{Where?|date=December 2016}}, making Titan perhaps the most advantageous locale in the outer Solar System for colonization, and saying "In certain ways, Titan is the most hospitable extraterrestrial world within our solar system for human colonization".

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, notable for its extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. If Enceladus has liquid water, it joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as one of the prime places in the Solar System to look for extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.

Other large satellites: [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], all have large quantities of volatiles, which can be used to support settlements.

===Trans-Neptunian region===
{{main|Colonization of trans-Neptunian objects}}

The [[Kuiper belt]] is estimated to have 70,000 bodies of 100&amp;nbsp;km or larger.

[[Freeman Dyson]] has suggested that within a few centuries human civilization will have relocated to the Kuiper belt.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''The Sun, The Genome, and The Internet'' (1999) Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oort cloud]] is estimated to have up to a trillion comets.

===Outside the Solar System===
[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|A [[star]] forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]
Looking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some percentage of the [[speed of light]]), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems can provide.

Many scientific papers have been published about [[interstellar travel]]. Given sufficient travel time and engineering work, both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible, though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time, particularly for manned probes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Space colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high, but sub-relativistic speeds, substantially less than the speed of light, ''c''.&amp;nbsp; An interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat, with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.

Hypothetical [[starship]] concepts proposed both by scientists and in [[hard science fiction]] include:
* A [[generation ship]] would travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many decades or centuries. The crew would go through generations before the journey is complete, so that none of the initial crew would be expected to survive to arrive at the destination, assuming current human lifespans.
* A [[sleeper ship]], in which most or all of the crew spend the journey in some form of [[hibernation]] or [[suspended animation]], allowing some or all who undertake the journey to survive to the end.
* An [[embryo space colonization|embryo-carrying interstellar starship]] (EIS), much smaller than a generation ship or sleeper ship, transporting human [[embryo]]s or DNA in a frozen or dormant state to the destination. (Obvious biological and psychological problems in birthing, raising, and educating such voyagers, neglected here, may not be fundamental.)
* A [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission|fission]] powered ship (e.g. [[ion drive]]) of some kind, achieving velocities of up to perhaps 10% ''c''&amp;nbsp; permitting one-way trips to nearby stars with durations comparable to a human lifetime.
* A [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]-ship, a nuclear-powered concept proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]] which would use [[nuclear bomb|nuclear explosions]] to propel a starship. A special case of the preceding nuclear rocket concepts, with similar potential velocity capability, but possibly easier technology.
* [[Solar sail|Laser propulsion]] concepts, using some form of beaming of power from the Solar System might allow a [[solar sail|light-sail]] or other ship to reach high speeds, comparable to those theoretically attainable by the fusion-powered electric rocket, above. These methods would need some means, such as supplementary nuclear propulsion, to stop at the destination, but a hybrid (light-sail for acceleration, fusion-electric for deceleration) system might be possible.

The above concepts all appear limited to high, but still sub-relativistic speeds, due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations, and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology, permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries. Yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1% of ''c''&amp;nbsp; would permit settlement of the entire Galaxy in less than one half of a galactic rotation period of ~250,000,000 years, which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes. Thus, even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible (which cannot be clearly determined at this time), the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the Solar System without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen. This could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales, given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.

If humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy, on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets, it may eventually become feasible to construct [[Alcubierre drive]]s. These are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics. However it is probable that such a device could never exist, due to the fundamental challenges posed. For more on this see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Difficulties of making and using an Alcubierre Drive]].

====Intergalactic travel====
{{Main article|Intergalactic travel}} 
Looking beyond the Milky Way, there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg, "Eternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox," ''Acta Astronautica'' 89 (2013): 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the [[Alcubierre drive]]. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that [[intergalactic travel]] is impossible in principle.

==Funding==
Space colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become [[Economic behavior|cheap enough]] (such as space access by cheaper launch systems) to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose.

Although there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/Basics/wwwwh.html Space Settlement Basics] by Al Globus, NASA Ames Research Center.

there is some prospect of a radical reduction to launch costs in the 2010s, which would consequently lessen the cost of any efforts in that direction.

The [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]] suggested that an [[Inducement prize contest|inducement prize]] should be established, perhaps by government, for the achievement of space colonization, for example by offering the prize to the first organization to place humans on the Moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover] - Report of the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrestrial analogues to space colonies==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The most famous attempt to build an analogue to a self-sufficient colony is [[Biosphere 2]], which attempted to duplicate Earth's biosphere. [[BIOS-3]] is another [[closed ecosystem]], completed in 1972 in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/the-worlds-largest-earth-science-experiment-biosphere-2-1882107636.html|title=The World's Largest Earth Science Experiment: Biosphere 2|date=2015-10-16|work=EcoWatch|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[space agency|space agencies]] build testbeds for advanced life support systems, but these are designed for long duration [[human spaceflight]], not permanent colonization.

==History==
The first known work on space colonization was ''[[The Brick Moon]]'', a work of fiction published in 1869 by [[Edward Everett Hale]], about an inhabited artificial satellite.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Hale. ''[[The Brick Moon]]''. Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 24, 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian schoolmaster and physicist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] foresaw elements of the space community in his book ''Beyond Planet Earth'' written about 1900. Tsiolkovsky had his space travelers building greenhouses and raising crops in space.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Tsiolkovsky. ''Beyond Planet Earth''. Trans. by Kenneth Syers. Oxford, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Tsiolkovsky believed that going into space would help perfect human beings, leading to immortality and peace.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html The life of Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky 1857–1935] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615044125/http://www.informatics.org/museum/tsiol.html |date=June 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have also written about space colonies as Lasswitz in 1897 and Bernal, Oberth, Von Pirquet and Noordung in the 1920s. [[Wernher von Braun]] contributed his ideas in a 1952 ''Colliers'' article. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Dandridge M. Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;Dandridge M. Cole and Donald W. Cox ''Islands in Space.'' Chilton, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; published his ideas.

Another seminal book on the subject was the book ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space'' by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]&lt;ref&gt;G. K. O'Neill. ''The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space''. Morrow, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977 which was followed the same year by ''Colonies in Space '' by [[T. A. Heppenheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Heppenheimer. ''Colonies in Space''. Stackpole Books, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

M. Dyson wrote ''Home on the Moon; Living on a Space Frontier'' in 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Marianne J. Dyson: Living on a Space Frontier. National Geographic, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Eckart wrote ''Lunar Base Handbook'' in 2006&lt;ref&gt;Peter Eckart. ''Lunar Base Handbook''. McGraw-Hill, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and then Harrison Schmitt's ''Return to the Moon'' written in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison H. Schmitt. '' Return to the Moon''. Springer, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level, as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion [[microorganism]]s of thousands of species of the [[human microbiome]], and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human.

A corollary to the [[Fermi paradox]]—"nobody else is doing it"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/06/26/no-we-cannot-know-whether-humans-are-alone-in-the-universe/|title=No, We Haven't Solved The Drake Equation, The Fermi Paradox, Or Whether Humans Are Alone|last=Siegel|first=Ethan|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is the argument that, because no evidence of [[Fermi paradox#Alien constructs|alien colonization technology]] exists, it is statistically unlikely to even be possible to use that same level of technology ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-aliens-have-not-contacted-humans-2015-9|title=The likeliest reasons why we haven’t contacted aliens are deeply unsettling|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonizing space would require massive amounts of financial, physical, and human capital devoted to research, development, production, and deployment. Earth's [[natural resource]]s do not increase to a noteworthy extent (which is in keeping with the "only one Earth" position of environmentalists). Thus, considerable efforts in colonizing places outside Earth would appear as a hazardous waste of the Earth's limited resources for an aim without a clear end.

The fundamental problem of public things, needed for survival, such as space programs, is the [[free rider problem]]. Convincing the public to fund such programs would require additional self-interest arguments: If the objective of space colonization is to provide a "backup" in case everyone on Earth is killed, then why should someone on Earth pay for something that is only useful after they are dead? This assumes that space colonization is not widely acknowledged as a sufficiently valuable social goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/free-rider/|title=Free Rider - Overview, Examples of Free Rider Problem in Society|work=Corporate Finance Institute|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seen as a relief to the problem of overpopulation even as early as 1758,&lt;ref name = tsr2009&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1296/1 Planetary demographics and space colonization]; Nader Elhefnawy, The Space Review, February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--would be best if the original article that Otto Diederich Lutken published were put here--&gt; and listed as one of Stephen Hawking's reasons for pursuing space exploration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/7935505/Stephen-Hawking-mankind-must-move-to-outer-space-within-a-century.html|title=Stephen Hawking: mankind must move to outer space within a century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to overpopulation is unwarranted. Indeed, the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate|birth rates]] of many developed countries, specifically [[spacefaring|spacefaring ones]], are at or below replacement rates, thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.&lt;ref name = tsr2009/&gt;

Other objections include concerns that the forthcoming colonization and [[commodification]] of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions e.g. the large financial institutions, the major aerospace companies and the [[military–industrial complex]], to lead to new [[war]]s, and to exacerbate pre-existing exploitation of [[Exploitation of labour|workers]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|resources]], [[economic inequality]], [[poverty]], social [[Social division|division]] and [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], environmental degradation, and other detrimental processes or institutions.&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2010-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2008-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03/&gt;

Additional concerns include creating a culture in which humans are no longer seen as human, but rather as material assets. The issues of [[human dignity]], [[morality]], [[philosophy]], [[culture]], [[bioethics]], and the threat of [[megalomaniac]] leaders in these new "societies" would all have to be addressed in order for space colonization to meet the [[psychology|psychological]] and [[Group (sociology)|social]] needs of people living in isolated colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/sociology.html Sociology and Space Development] B.J. Bluth, Sociology Department, California State University, Northridge, SPACE SOCIAL SCIENCE&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative or addendum for the future of the human race, many science fiction writers have focused on the realm of the 'inner-space', that is the computer-aided exploration of the [[human mind]] and human [[consciousness]]—possibly en route developmentally to a [[Matrioshka Brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/a-matrioshka-brain-is-a-computer-the-size-of-a-solar-system-curiosity/|title=A Matrioshka Brain Is A Computer The Size Of A Solar System|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unmanned space mission|Robotic exploration]] is proposed as an alternative to gain many of the same scientific advantages without the limited mission duration and high cost of life support and return transportation involved in manned missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/report/robotic-planetary-exploration/|title=Robotic Exploration of the Solar System|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is the potential to cause [[interplanetary contamination]] on planets that may harbor hypothetical [[extraterrestrial life]].

===Physical, mental and emotional health risks to colonizers===

An additional concern is the health of the humans who may participate in a colonization venture, including a range of physical, mental and emotional health risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''System of systems engineering''' ('''SoSE''') is a set of developing processes, tools, and methods for designing, re-designing and deploying solutions to [[System of systems|system-of-systems]] challenges.

== Overview ==
System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) methodology is heavily used in [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] applications, but is increasingly being applied to non-defense related problems such as architectural design of problems in air and auto transportation, healthcare, global communication networks, search and rescue, space exploration and many other System of Systems application domains.  SoSE is more than [[systems engineering]] of monolithic, [[complexity|complex systems]] because design for System-of-Systems problems is performed under some level of uncertainty in the requirements and the constituent systems, and it involves considerations in multiple levels and domains (as per &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, "Understanding Transportation as a System-of-Systems Design Problem," 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, January 10–13, 2005. AIAA-2005-0123.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;). Whereas systems engineering focuses on building the system right, SoSE focuses on choosing the right system(s) and their interactions to satisfy the requirements.

System-of-Systems Engineering and Systems Engineering are related but different fields of study. Whereas systems engineering addresses the development and operations of monolithic products, SoSE addresses the development and operations of evolving programs. In other words, traditional systems engineering seeks to optimize an individual system (i.e., the product), while SoSE seeks to optimize network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives of the program.  SoSE should enable the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time; thus, effective SoSE methodology should prepare decision-makers to design informed architectural solutions for [[System of systems|System-of-Systems]] problems.

Due to varied methodology and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering.  One of the proposed SoSE frameworks, by Dr. Daniel A. DeLaurentis, recommends a three-phase method where a SoS problem is defined (understood), abstracted, modeled and analyzed for behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  More information on this method and other proposed methods can be found in the listed SoSE focused organizations and SoSE literature in the subsequent sections.

The concept was devised by [[Sue Thomas (author)|Sue Thomas]] as an extrapolation of the [[Biophilia hypothesis]] introduced by biologist [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O.

Technobiophilic practices and artefacts have one or more of the following features. They

* contribute to well-being via a tech-nature balance
* support future biodiversity as technology and nature move closer together.

[[Timothy Beatley]], Teresa Heinz Professor of Sustainable Communities in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning at the [[University of Virginia School of Architecture]], has written of technobiophilia "We can look forward to the promise and potential of technobiophilic cities, that at once commit to restoring and enjoying actual nature, but acknowledge the realities of life in cities (much of it inside, and behind a screen), and the powerful ways in which our digital technologies could underpin and help to reinforce our nature-ful commitments and experiences and our biophilic tendencies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beatley|first=Timothy|title=The Technobiophilic City|year=2015|url=http://biophiliccities.org/the-technobiophilic-city/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''telos''' (from the Greek τέλος for "end", "purpose", or "goal") is an end or purpose, in a fairly constrained sense used by philosophers such as [[Aristotle]].  It is the root of the term "[[teleology]]", roughly the study of purposiveness, or the study of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions.  Teleology figures centrally in Aristotle's [[biology]] and in his theory of [[Four causes|causes]].  It is central to nearly all philosophical theories of history, such as those of [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]].  One running debate in modern [[philosophy of biology]] is to what extent teleological language (as in the "purposes" of various organs or life-processes) is unavoidable, or is simply a shorthand for ideas that can ultimately be spelled out non-teleologically. [[Philosophy of action]] also makes essential use of teleological vocabulary: on [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]'s account, an action is just something an agent does with an [[intention]]—that is, looking forward to some end to be achieved by the action.

In contrast to telos, [[techne]] is the rational method involved in producing an object or accomplishing a goal or objective; however, the two methods are not mutually exclusive in principle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36994">'''Transitional justice''' consists of judicial and non-judicial measures implemented in order to redress legacies of [[human rights]] abuses.  Such measures "include [[criminal prosecution]]s, [[truth commission]]s, [[reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] programs, and various kinds of [[institutional reform]]s".&lt;ref name=ictj&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Transitional Justice?|url=http://ictj.org/about/transitional-justice|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional justice is enacted at a point of political transition from violence and repression to societal stability and it is informed by a society’s desire to rebuild [[Trust (social sciences)|social trust]], repair a fractured justice system, and build a [[Democracy|democratic]] system of governance. The core value of transitional justice is the very notion of justice—which does not necessarily mean criminal justice. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict are thus linked toward a more peaceful, certain, and democratic future.

Transitional justice has recently received greater attention by both academics and policymakers. It has also generated interest in the fields of political and legal discourse, especially in transitional societies. In period of political transitions, from authoritarian, dictatorial regimes or from civil conflicts to democracy, transitional justice has often provided opportunities for such societies to address past human rights abuses, mass atrocities, or other forms of severe trauma in order to facilitate a smooth transition into a more democratic or peaceful future.

==History==
The origins of the transitional justice field can be traced back to the post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] period in [[Europe]] with the establishment of the [[International Military Tribunal]] at [[Nuremberg]] and the various [[de-Nazification]] programs in [[Germany]] and the trials of [[Japan]]ese soldiers at Tokyo Tribunal. What became known as the "[[Nuremberg Trials]]", when the victorious allied forces extended criminal justice to Japanese and German soldiers and their leaders for [[war crimes]] committed during the war, marked the genesis of transitional justice. The field gained momentum and coherence during the 1980s and onwards, beginning with the trials of former members of the military juntas in [[Greece]] (1975), and [[Argentina]] ([[Trial of the Juntas]], 1983). The focus of transitional justice in the 1970s and 1980s was on criminal justice with a focus on [[human rights]] promotion. This led to a worldwide focus and progressive rise of human rights regime culminating in the establishments of international human rights laws and conventions.

The emphasis of transitional justice was on how abuses of human rights get treated during political transition: legal and criminal prosecution. As noted earlier, the universal conceptions of "justice" became the platform on which transitional justice was premised. The field in its early [[epistemology]], thus, assumed jurisprudence of human rights. As a result, the initial literature on transitional justice was dominated by lawyers, law, and legal rights: defining laws, and processes on how to deal with human rights abuse and holding people accountable. Thus, transitional justice has its roots in both the human rights movement and in international human rights and humanitarian law. These origins in the human rights movement have rendered transitional justice “self-consciously victim-centric”.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a shift in the focus of transitional justice. Informed by the worldwide wave of democratization, particularly the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]], transitional justice reemerged as a new field of study in democratization. Transitional justice broadened its scope from more narrow questions of [[jurisprudence]] to political considerations of developing stable democratic institutions and renewing civil society. Studies by scholars on the transition from autocratic regimes to democratic ones have integrated the transitional justice framework into an examination of the political processes inherent to democratic change. The challenges of democratization in transitional periods are many: settling past accounts without derailing democratic progress, developing judicial or third-party fora capable of resolving conflicts, reparations, and creating memorials and developing educational curricula that redress cultural lacunae and unhealed trauma.

It is clear that elements of transitional justice have broken the initial mold of post-war jurisprudence. The transitional justice framework has benefited from democratic activists who sought to bolster fledgling democracies and bring them into line with the moral and legal obligations articulated in the international human rights consensus.

One particular innovation is the appearance of [[truth commission]]s. Beginning with Argentina in 1983, Chile in 1990, and South Africa in 1995, truth commissions have become a symbol of transitional justice, appearing in transitional societies in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. However, several attempts to create a regional truth commission in the former [[Yugoslavia]] (REKOM) have failed due to political obstacles. Recent years have also seen proposals for truth and reconciliation commissions in conflict zones of the Middle East and it is likely that these transitional justice institutions will someday figure prominently in [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[Kurdistan|Kurdish region]]s.{{or|date=September 2015}}

Another major institutional innovation is the appearance of the variety of [[lustration]] programs in Central and Eastern Europe since the 1990s. While most countries pursued programs based on dismissals of compromised personnel and comprehensive screening tools, other countries implemented more inclusive methods allowing discredited personnel a second chance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14845.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As a link between transition and justice, the concept of transitional justice transformed in the late 1940s to assume a broader perspective of comprehensive examination of the society in transition from a retrospective to a prospective position with democratic consolidation as one of the primary objectives. Scholars and practitioners of democratization have come to a common conclusion on the general principles of a transitional justice framework: that national strategies to confront past abuses, depending on the specific nature and context of the country in question, can contribute to accountability, an end to impunity, reconstruct state–citizen relations, and the creation of democratic institutions.

==Objectives==
The primary objective of a transitional justice policy is to end the culture of [[impunity]] and establish the rule of law in a context of democratic governance. The legal and human rights protection roots of transitional justice impute certain legal obligations on states undergoing transitions. It challenges such societies to strive for a society where respect for human rights is the core and accountability is routinely practiced as the main goals. In the context of these goals, transitional justice aims at:

* Halting ongoing human rights abuses;
* Investigating past crimes;
* Identifying those responsible for human rights violations;
* Imposing sanctions on those responsible (where it can);
* Providing reparations to victims;
* Preventing future abuses;
* Security Sector Reform;
* Preserving and enhancing peace; and
* Fostering individual and national reconciliation.

In general, therefore, one can identify eight broad objectives that transitional justice aims to serve: establishing the truth, providing victims a public platform, holding perpetrators accountable, strengthening the rule of law, providing victims with compensation, effectuating institutional reform, promoting reconciliation, and promoting public deliberation.

==Strategies==
In order to be effective, transitional justice measures should be part of a holistic approach. There are five broad strategies or forms of transitional justice:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-transitional-justice "What is Transitional Justice?"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; 1) Criminal prosecutions, 2) Truth commissions, 3) Reparation programs, 4) Security sector reform, 5) Memorialization efforts. The needs of the survivors are essential and including gender justice is necessary to ensure women have equal access to the mechanisms.

==Prosecutions==
{{main|International criminal law}}
The investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes, such as [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crimes]] helps to strengthen the rule of law by sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties. It also demonstrates that crime will not be tolerated, and that human rights abusers will be held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/criminal-justice "Criminal Justice"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; From its historical roots in the [[Nuremberg Trials]], recent examples have included [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], hybrid courts such as [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], [[Special Panels of the Dili District Court]], [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]], [[Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), assuming a [[universal jurisdiction]]. The ICC and Hybrid Courts/Tribunals are key components of prosecution initiatives:

===International Criminal Court===

{{main|International Criminal Court}}
The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] in 1998. It is the first international criminal court that helps end impunity for perpetrators of severe crimes. It was established to investigate and try leaders of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in cases where countries are unable or unwilling to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/Transitions-June-2010 "Transitions June 2010: Transitional Justice News From Around the World"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid courts and tribunals===

Hybrid courts and tribunals have emerged as “third generation” courts established to investigate and prosecute human rights offenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://pict-pcti.org/courts/hybrid.html&lt;/ref&gt; They follow the “first generation” Nuremberg and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo tribunals]] and the “second generation” International Criminal Court and International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia ([[ICTY]]) and Rwanda ([[ICTR]]). These courts consist of both international and domestic justice actors. They attempt to deliver justice that the domestic justice systems cannot provide alone due to lack of capacity or political will. Furthermore, hybrid courts attempt to strengthen domestic capacities to prosecute human rights abuses through the transfer of international legal skills and expertise. Examples include the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] and the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/where-here-international-tribunals "Where to From Here for International Tribunals?"], Caitlin Reiger, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; A step beyond within a more societal and traditional scope of justice could be the [[Gacaca]] for Rwanda.

===Reparations===
{{main|Reparations (transitional justice)}}
Reparations aim to repair the suffering of victims of human rights abuses. They seek to make amends with victims, help them overcome the consequences of abuse, and provide rehabilitation. They may include financial payments, social services including health care or education, or symbolic compensation such as public apologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/reparations-theory-and-practice "Reparations in Theory and Practice"], Lisa Margarrell, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the Canadian government’s apology “Statement of Reconciliation” to indigenous Canadian families for removing their children and placing them in church-run Indian Residential Schools. The Canadian government also created a $350&amp;nbsp;million fund to help those affected by the schools.

===Truth-seeking===
{{main|Truth-seeking}}
Truth-seeking encompasses initiatives allowing actors in a country to investigate past abuses and seek redress for victims. These processes aim to enable societies to examine and come to terms with past crimes and [[human rights]] violations in order to prevent their recurrence. They help create documentation that prevents repressive regimes from rewriting history and denying the past. They can also help victims obtain closure by knowing the truth about what actually happened (such as to “disappeared” people) and understanding the atrocities they endured. Truth-seeking measures may include [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information legislation]], declassification of archives, investigations, and truth commissions.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory  "Truth and Memory"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Truth commissions====
{{main|Truth commissions}}
Truth commissions are non-judicial commissions of inquiry that aim to discover and reveal past abuses by a government or non-state actors; about forty official truth commissions have been created worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/truth-commissions  "Truth Commissions"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa]], which was established to help overcome apartheid and reconcile tensions in the country.

===Memory and memorials===
{{main|Memorialization}}
Memorials seek to preserve memories of people or events. In the context of transitional justice, they serve to honor those who died during conflict or other atrocities, examine the past, address contemporary issues and show respect to victims. They can help create records to prevent denial and help societies move forward. Memorials may include commemoration activities, such as architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.&lt;ref name="Truth and Memory"/&gt; One example includes the monuments, annual prayer ceremony, and mass grave in northern [[Uganda]], created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/we-can%E2%80%99t-be-sure-who-killed-us-memory-and-memorialization-post-conflict-northern-uganda  "We Can’t Be Sure Who Killed Us: Memory and Memorialization in Post-conflict Northern Uganda"], Julian Hopwood, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional reform===
{{main|Security sector reform}}
Public institutions, including the [[police]], [[military]], and [[judiciary]], often contribute to repression and other human rights violations. When societies undergo a transition, these institutions must be reformed in order to create accountability and prevent the recurrence of abuse. Institutional reform includes the process of restructuring these state actors to ensure that they respect human rights and abide by the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/institutional-reform "Institutional Reform"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms can include measures such as [[vetting]], [[lustration]], and [[Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration]] (DDR). Vetting is the process of eliminating corrupt or abusive officials from public service employment. For instance, in [[Afghanistan]], election candidates in the 2009 and 2010 elections were vetted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/vetting-lessons-2009-10-elections-afghanistan "Vetting Lessons for the 2009-10 Elections in Afghanistan"], Fatima Ayub, Antonella Deledda, Patricia Gossman, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; While similar to lustration, "vetting" is the broader category referring to processes aimed at screening and excluding human rights abusers from public institutions while "lustration" refers specifically to the vetting processes and laws that were implemented in the former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe after the end of  the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/justice-prevention-vetting-public-employees-transitional-societies "Justice as Prevention: Vetting Public Employees in Transitional Societies"], eds. Pablo de Greiff and Alexander Mayer-Rieckh, ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; Vetting does not necessarily imply dismissals from the state apparatus. Several countries developed alternative personnel systems that provide for the inclusion of inherited personnel in exchange for their exposure or confession.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, David, ''Lustration and Transitional Justice: Personnel Systems in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; DDR programs assist ex‑combatants in rejoining society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/research/disarmament-demobilization-and-reintegration "Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of institutional reform is the removal of court officials involved in crimes of the fallen Tunisian regime. Under [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]’s rule, courts often facilitated corruption. The removal of implicated officials is a part of the government’s efforts to reconcile this abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/news/tunisias-courts-emerge-slowly-shadow-ben-ali "Tunisia's courts Emerge Slowly from Shadow of Ben Ali"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends and challenges==
States in times of transition to democracy, since the early 1980s, have been using a variety of transitional justice mechanisms as part of measures to account for the past and build a future democratic state. Mechanisms, such as trials, truth commissions, reparations, lustration, museums, and other memory sites have been employed either single-handedly or in a combined form to address past human rights violations. Diverse studies ranging from the decision-making process of a choice of strategy through to the implementation of the transitional justice policy and impacts on the transition and future stability of the society in question have been produced by scholars in recent years. One illuminating study in particular that has documented the dramatic new trend of transitional justice and democratization is by Kathryn Sikkink and Carrie Booth Walling (2006). In their research paper described as the "justice cascade", Sikkink and Walling conducting analysis of truth commissions and human rights trials occurring throughout the world from 1979 to 2004 revealed a significant increase in the judicialization of world politics both regionally and internationally. Of the 192 countries surveyed, 34 have used truth commissions, and 50 had at least one transitional human rights trial.

More than two-thirds of the approximately 85 new and/or transitional countries during that period used either trials or truth commissions as a transitional justice mechanism; over half tried some form of judicial proceedings. Thus, the use of a truth commission and/or human rights trials among transitional countries is not an isolated or marginal practice, but a widespread social practice occurring in the bulk of transitional countries.

Since its emergence, transitional justice has encountered numerous challenges such as identifying victims, deciding whether to punish superiors or middle agents, avoiding a "victor’s justice", and finding adequate resources for compensation, trial, or institutional reform. Also, the transitional period may only result in a tenuous peace or fragile democracy. As has been noted in the discourse on transition to democracy, the dilemma has always been for new regimes to promote accountability for past abuses without risking a smooth transition to democracy. In addition, existing judicial system might be weak, [[Political corruption|corrupt]], or ineffective and in effect make achieving any viable justice difficult. Observers of transitional justice application and processes, such as [[Makau W. Mutua]] (2000) emphasized on the difficulties of achieving actual justice through one of the most prominent mechanisms of transitional justice, trials. Commenting on the international tribunal established in [[Rwanda]] in 1994, he argued that it “serves to deflect responsibility, to assuage the consciences of states which were unwilling to stop the [[genocide]]... [and] largely masks the illegitimacy of the [[Tutsi]] regime”. In sum, Matua argues that criminal tribunals such as those in Rwanda and Yugoslavia are “less meaningful if they cannot be applied or enforced without prejudice to redress transgressions or unless they have a deterrent effect such as behavior modification on the part of would be perpetrators”.

More recently, [[Lyal S. Sunga]] has argued that unless truth commissions are set up and conducted according to international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, they risk conflicting or undermining criminal prosecutions, whether these prosecutions are supposed to be carried out at the national or international levels. He contends that this risk is particularly pronounced where truth commissions employ amnesties, and especially blanket amnesties to pardon perpetrators of serious crimes. On the other hand, criminal prosecutions should be better tailored to focus on victims and to place events in proper perspective.  Sunga therefore proposes ten principles for making truth and national reconciliation commissions fully complementary to criminal prosecutions in a way that conforms fully to international law.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Principles for Reconciling Truth Commissions and Criminal Prosecutions, in ''The Legal Regime of the ICC'', Brill (2009) 1071–1104.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of critique of transitional justice mechanisms could cause some scholars and policymakers to wonder which of the objectives outlined above are most important to achieve, and even if they are achievable. Truth commissions could be characterized as a second-best alternative and also an affront to rule of law, because of the possibility that amnesty and indemnities will be made exchange for truth. These sets of challenges can raise critical questions for transitional justice in its application. Questions and issues, such as: Can the "truth" ever really be established? Can all victims be given compensation or a public platform? Can all perpetrators be held accountable? Or is it sufficient to acknowledge that atrocities were committed and that victims should be compensated for their suffering?

Also, one might argue that too narrow a focus on the challenges of the field runs the risk of making transitional justice seem meaningless. However transitional justice aims at an ongoing search for truth, justice, forgiveness, and healing, and efforts undertaken within it help people to live alongside former enemies. Simply put, “the past must be addressed in order to reach the future”. Thus, even if the impact or reach of transitional justice seems marginal, the end result is worth the effort.

Another way of assessing attempts at transitional justice is to say that decision makers may have less control over the methods used to pursue such policies than they imagine. In fact, whatever their wishes, they may not be able to prevent such policies at all. As A.&amp;nbsp;James McAdams has demonstrated in his book, ''Judging the Past in Unified Germany'' (2001), West German policymakers such as former chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] wanted to close public access to the files of East Germany's secret police, the [[Stasi]], but pressures from East German dissidents prevented them from doing so.

Another challenge is the tension between peace and justice, which arises the conflicting goals of achieving peace and justice in the aftermath of a society’s emergence from conflict. Though it is generally unanimous that both goals are integral to achieving reconciliation, practitioners often disagree about which goal should be pursued first: justice or peace?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104175556/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/peace-justice.aspx |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the “justice” school of thought argue that if all perpetrators of human rights abuses do not stand trial, impunity for crimes will continue into the new regime, preventing it from fully completing a transition from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/18/seductions-sequencing&lt;/ref&gt; The "peace" school of thought, however, argues that the only way to effectively end violence is by granting amnesties and brokering negotiations to persuade criminals to lay down their arms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/744] Examples such as [[Northern Ireland]] illustrate how selective amnesties can cease conflict.

Recent trends in the post-conflict field have tended to favor the “justice” school of thought, maintaining that only if justice is dutifully served to victims of the conflict can civil war will be prevented from recurring. A 2011 debate in ''[[The Economist]]'' determined in its concluding polls that 76% of the debate participants agreed with the motion that achieving peace can occur only through implementing justice mechanisms.[http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/747]

=== Literary Applications ===
Literary scholars and historians have begun to use the concept of transitional justice to reexamine historical events and texts. Christopher N. Warren, for instance, has applied transitional justice to pre-[[Restoration England]], claiming that it helps explain how Anglican royalists convinced Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren also argues that English poet [[John Milton]] “can be seen as an early critic of transitional justice,” using the allegory of Sin and Death in his epic poem [[Paradise Lost]] to complicate “overly-rosy” depictions of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6R368 To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.]” ''Law, Culture and the Humanities''. p. 5, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future agenda==
Although transitional justice is engulfed by many critical challenges in addition to the difficulty in measuring its impact, given the number of other factors in any given country’s experience over time, human rights trials or truth commissions need not have a negative effect on human rights practices. This makes transitional justice viable, especially in this age of state-building and democracy promotion in post-conflict societies. In fact, Sikkink and Walling’s comparison of human rights conditions before and after trials in [[Latin America]]n countries with two or more trial years showed that eleven of the fourteen countries had better Political Terror Scale (PTS) ratings after trials. Latin American countries that had both a truth commission and human rights trials improved more on their PTS ratings than countries that only had trials. These statistics indicate that transitional justice mechanisms are associated with countries’ improving their human rights practices. Each state that employs transitional justice mechanisms will have to determine which mechanisms to use to best achieve the targeted goals. In order to avoid causing disappointment amongst victims, the state should also ensure that the public is well-informed about the goals and limits of those mechanisms.

Transitional justice shows no signs of decreasing in use. Indeed, the incorporation of transitional justice policies, tools and programs in peacebuilding and democratization process operations by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and in the programs by many local and international democracy promotion organizations, including, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Electoral Assistance and Democracy (International IDEA) and a host of others as well as the establishments of other international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and networks such as the [http://www.ictj.org International Center for Transitional Justice] (ICTJ) and the  [http://www.transitionaljustice.net African Transitional Justice Research Network] (ATJRN) and research centers like the [[Transitional Justice Institute]] are strong manifestations of how well placed transitional justice has become a feature in the discourse of transitional politics in the 21st century. Academic publications such as the [http://www.ijtj.oxfordjournals.org International Journal of Transitional Justice] are also contributing towards building an interdisciplinary field with the hope that future innovations are tailored for a specific state’s situation and will contribute towards political transitions that address the past as well as establish guarantees for respect of human rights and democracy.

The [[World Bank]]'s "2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security, and Development” links transitional justice to security and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/human-rights-and-transitional-justice-2011-world-development-report "Human Rights and Transitional Justice in the 2011 World Development Report"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt; It explores how countries can avoid cycles of violence and emphasizes the importance of transitional justice, arguing that it is one of the “[[Signalling (economics)|signaling mechanisms]]” that governments can use to show that they are breaking away from past practices. It also argues that transitional justice measures can send signals about the importance of accountability and to improve institutional capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext "Conflict, Security, and Development"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514143518/http://wdr2011.worldbank.org/fulltext |date=2011-05-14 }}, ''World Development Report 2011''&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) published a report advocating the need to understand traditional transitional justice measures from a child's perspective. The report identifies children as a large demographic too often excluded from traditional transitional justice measures. In order to correct this imbalance, a new child-centered perspective is needed to incorporate children into the larger scope of transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/through-new-lens-child-sensitive-approach-transitional-justice "Through A New Lens: A Child-Sensitive Approach to Transitional Justice"], "International Center for Transitional Justice"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Violence-Free Zones''', or Violence-Free Zone Initiatives, are community-based interventions for gang members and youth. Zones attempt to stem violence by providing mentorship, guidance, social development, job training and an effective environment for learning, among other tools, to help gang members and at-risk youth break free and become successful in life, crime-free and violence-free.&lt;ref name="National Gang Center"&gt;[http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/SPT/Programs/130] National Gang Center: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives operate in urban schools with high levels of crime and violence.&lt;ref name="Center for Neighborhood Enterprise"&gt;[http://www.cneonline.org/reducing-youth-violence-the-violence-free-zone/] Center for Neighborhood Enterprise&lt;/ref&gt;   

The model for Violence-Free Zones was developed by the [[Center for Neighborhood Enterprise]]&lt;ref name="Center for Neighborhood Enterprise"/&gt; and is based on the principle that lack of parental involvement and guidance is at the root of violence among youth in these high-risk communities.&lt;ref name="National Gang Center"/&gt;

Participating cities include Washington, D.C., Hartford, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Milwaukee,&lt;ref name="Violence-free program helps students"&gt;[http://www.wuwm.com/news/wuwm_news.php?articleid=4608] Violence-free program helps students turn their lives around; WUWM NPR radio, May 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond (Virginia) and others. 

The model has also been adopted as a strategy to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission in schools.&lt;ref name="Global AIDS Alliance"&gt;[http://toolkit.ineesite.org/toolkit/INEEcms/uploads/1041/Best_Practices_Violence_Free_Zone.PDF] Global AIDS alliance; retrieved November 1, 2012 via Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program components==

Each Violence-Free Zone engages youth-oriented organizations in the area to become "Community Partners."  These organizations must have the trust and confidence of local youth.  Key to the program are Youth Advisors, young adults from the neighborhood who have overcome similar obstacles and have the respect of students. The Advisors work in the schools, coaching and mediating, and serve as mentors to the most troubled students.  Community Partners and the school work together to provide guidance, social development, job readiness programs. Training, oversight, and technical assistance for the program administrators is provided by the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.&lt;ref name="Center for Neighborhood Enterprise"/&gt;

==Results==

The initiative has been found to have measurable success in each targeted metric, from school absences and incidents to police arrests.&lt;ref name="MJC"&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/88914992.html] Violence-Free Zone reduces crime around schools, new research says; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Academic Achievement and Violence Free Zones"&gt;[http://blog.heritage.org/2009/11/26/academic-achievement-and-violence-free-zones/] Academic Achievement and Violence Free Zones; The Foundry blog, November 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent evaluations, including a study by [[Baylor University]],&lt;ref name="Baylor"&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=73859] Baylor University Study Finds Violence-Reduction Program Improves Safety and Attendance and Decreases Need for Police in Richmond, Va., High School, May 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; have shown declines in each zone from 4% to 61%.&lt;ref name="Violence-Free Zone Results"&gt;[http://www.cneonline.org/results-and-evaluations/] Violence-Free Zone Results&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wheat Street Baptist Church''' is located at 359 Auburn Ave. in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The building is part of the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic District]]; the church and its leader at the time, Rev. [[William Holmes Borders]], played a leading role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=English|first=James W. |title=The prophet of Wheat Street: the story of William Holmes Borders, a man who refused to fail|publisher=D.

==Origins==

The term “winders” was originally coined in 2008 by the sociologist [[John W. Leigh]], in his article ''Moving towards new forms of social success'',&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;John W. Leigh, SIU, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/36664106/Moving-towards-new-forms-of-social-success Moving towards new forms of social success] 2008&lt;/ref&gt; describing the new forms of social success in the United States, and in Western societies. The term (a contraction of the expression “windy winners”) goes back to the original way of experiencing social success by individuals uninhibited with regards to their own success, not looking as much to reconcile rival existential expectations (such as the [[Bobos in Paradise|bobos]], for example) but rather to juxtapose them in a way which is not seeking to constitute a system.

==Description==
The analysis of this new group is positioned along the same lines as the social success models embodied respectively by [[yuppies]], “hardcore winners” (traders and other “golden boys” of the 1980s), and then [[Bobos in Paradise|bobos]]. It borrows from the [[critical theory|critical sociology]] of [[Michael Hartmann (sociologist)|Michael Hartmann]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hartmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A802Pz-IZ7cC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;dq=%22michael+hartmann%22+sociology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I6-YOpOttH&amp;sig=ghUxFaZc15UEzg97yGs97ZT5VIE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2Ny2TPOqJsT24AamhL2_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Sociology of Elites] 2007, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; as well as employment sociologists [[Peter Meiksins]] and [[Peter Whalley]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meiskins and Peter Whalley, [http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/The_Network_News/4-2/TNN4-2_Meiskins.pdf Conversations with the Experts], 2002, Boston College&lt;/ref&gt; whose work ''Putting work in its place: a quiet revolution''&lt;ref name="A quiet Revolution"&gt;{{cite book | last = Meiskins | first = Peter | authorlink =  |author2=Whalley, Peter  | year = 2202 | title = Putting Work in Its Place: a Quiet Revolution
 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, NY | isbn = 978-0-8014-8952-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
details the [[paradigm shift]] borne by the winders within the American employment market. As J. W. Leigh puts it: “In cultural terms, for example, he is a "multi-consumer": capable of frequenting art galleries or the screens of a public cinema, and listening to Haydn and Bach as much as Beyonce or Michael Jackson.”&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; To this regard, the winder is considered a “cultural omnivore”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Skiles, Omar Lizardo, [http://www.nd.edu/~olizardo/papers/soco-consumption.pdf Cultural consumption in the fine and popular arts realms], 2006, University of Notre Dame&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point of view, the “winder” is one of the many avatars of the ability of superior social classes to [[legitimation|legitimise]] their own situation via positive and always renewing [[value systems]].

== History ==
The term "working memory" was coined by [[George Armitage Miller|Miller]], [[Eugene Galanter|Galanter]], and [[Karl H. Pribram|Pribram]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-03-010075-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pribram, Karl H. |author2=Miller, George A. |author3=Galanter, Eugene |title=Plans and the structure of behavior |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |year=1960 |pages=65 |isbn=978-0-03-010075-8 |oclc=190675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Baddeley A |title=Working memory: looking back and looking forward |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=829–39 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14523382 |doi=10.1038/nrn1201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in the 1960s in the context of theories that likened the mind to a computer. In 1968, [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model|Atkinson and Shiffrin]]&lt;ref name="Atkinson Shiffrin 1968"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Atkinson    | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shiffrin | first2 = R.M.  | title = Human Memory: A Proposed System and its Control Processes | volume = 2 |pages = 89–195| editor1 = Kenneth W Spence |editor2= Janet T Spence | work = The psychology of learning and motivation | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1968 | isbn = 978-0-12-543302-0 |oclc = 185468704 |doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60422-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term to describe their "short-term store". What we now call working memory was formerly referred to variously as a "short-term store" or [[short-term memory]], primary memory, immediate memory, operant memory, and provisional memory.&lt;ref name="Fuster 1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fuster, Joaquin M. |title=The prefrontal cortex: anatomy, physiology, and neuropsychology of the frontal lobe |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |location=Philadelphia |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=978-0-397-51849-4 |oclc=807338522 |accessdate=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term memory is the ability to remember information over a brief period (in the order of seconds). Most theorists today use the concept of working memory to replace or include the older concept of short-term memory, marking a stronger emphasis on the notion of manipulating information rather than mere maintenance.

The earliest mention of experiments on the neural basis of working memory can be traced back to more than 100 years ago, when [[Eduard Hitzig|Hitzig]] and [[David Ferrier|Ferrier]] described [[ablation]] experiments of the [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC); they concluded that the frontal cortex was important for cognitive rather than sensory processes.&lt;ref name=Fuster1&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Fuster|first1= Joaquin |title= The prefrontal cortex |page= 126 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=zuZlvNICdhUC&amp;pg=PT140&amp;dq=%22different+investigators,+the+variability+of%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22different%20investigators%2C%20the%20variability%20of%22 |edition= 4 |year= 2008 |publisher= Elsevier |location= Oxford, UK |isbn= 978-0-12-373644-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 and 1936, Carlyle Jacobsen and colleagues were the first to show the deleterious effect of prefrontal ablation on delayed response.&lt;ref name=Fuster1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benton&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Benton|first1= A.&amp;nbsp;L.|editor1-first= Harvey,&amp;nbsp;S.|editor1-last= Levin|editor2-first= Howard,&amp;nbsp;M.|editor2-last= Eisenberg|editor3-first= Arthur,&amp;nbsp;L.|editor3-last= Benton|title= Frontal lobe function and dysfunction|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=9b1htO0V0rwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Jacobsen++prefrontal+ablation&amp;q=Jacobsen%20%20prefrontal%20ablation|year= 1991|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-19-506284-7|page= 19|chapter= The prefrontal region:Its early history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Numerous models have been proposed for how working memory functions, both anatomically and cognitively. Of those, the two that have been most influential are summarized below.

=== The multicomponent model ===
{{Main|Baddeley's model of working memory}}
[[File:Baddeley and Hitch's Working Memory Model.png|thumb|300px|Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory]]

In 1974, [[Alan Baddeley|Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch|Hitch]]&lt;ref name="Baddeley Hitch 1974"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Baddeley    | first1 = Alan D.  | last2 = Hitch | first2 = Graham  | title = Working Memory | volume = 2 | editor = Gordon H. Bower | work = The psychology of learning and motivation | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1974 | pages = 47–89 | isbn = 978-0-12-543308-2 |oclc = 777285348 |doi= 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|multicomponent model of working memory]]. The theory proposed a model containing three components: the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuospatial sketchpad with the central executive functioning as a control center of sorts, directing info between the phonological and visuospatial components.&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Working Memory : Capacity, Developments and Improvement Techniques|last = Levin|first = E.S.|publisher = [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Central executive|central executive]] is responsible ''inter alia'' for directing [[attention]] to relevant information, suppressing irrelevant information and inappropriate actions, and coordinating cognitive processes when more than one task is simultaneously performed. A "central executive" is responsible for supervising the integration of information and for coordinating "slave systems" that are responsible for the short-term maintenance of information. One slave system, the [[phonological loop]] (PL), stores phonological information (that is, the sound of language) and prevents its decay by continuously refreshing it in a [[memory rehearsal|rehearsal]] loop. It can, for example, maintain a seven-digit telephone number for as long as one repeats the number to oneself again and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Variations in psychology|last = Weiten|first = W.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 281–282|edition = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other slave system, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Visuospatial sketchpad|visuospatial sketchpad]], stores visual and spatial information. It can be used, for example, for constructing and manipulating visual images and for representing mental maps. The sketchpad can be further broken down into a visual subsystem (dealing with such phenomena as shape, colour, and texture), and a spatial subsystem (dealing with location).

In 2000, Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth component, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Episodic buffer|episodic buffer]], which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information not covered by the slave systems (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;semantic information, musical information). The episodic buffer is also the link between working memory and long-term memory.&lt;ref name="Weiten 2013 281–282"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Variations in psychology|last = Weiten|first = W.|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Belmont, CA|pages = 281–282|edition = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation. The episodic buffer resembles Tulving's concept of [[episodic memory]], but it differs in that the episodic buffer is a temporary store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nbu.bg/cogs/events/2002/materials/Markus/ep_bufer.pdf | title=The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? | author=Baddeley, A. D. | journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. | year=2000 | volume=4 | issue=11 | pages=417–423 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | pmid=11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory as part of long-term memory ===
[[Anders Ericsson]] and [[Walter Kintsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=Long-term working memory.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=2|pages=211–245|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.102.2.211|pmid=7740089|author=Ericsson, K. A.|author2=Kintsch, W.|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; have introduced the notion of "long-term working memory", which they define as a set of "retrieval structures" in long-term memory that enable seamless access to the information relevant for everyday tasks. In this way, parts of long-term memory effectively function as working memory. In a similar vein, [[Nelson Cowan|Cowan]] does not regard working memory as a separate system from [[long-term memory]]. Representations in working memory are a subset of representations in long-term memory. Working memory is organized into two embedded levels. The first consists of long-term memory representations that are activated. There can be many of these—there is theoretically no limit to the activation of representations in long-term memory. The second level is called the focus of attention. The focus is regarded as having a limited capacity and holds up to four of the activated representations.&lt;ref name="Cowan 1995"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cowan, Nelson |title=Attention and memory: an integrated framework |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-506760-6 |oclc=30475237 |accessdate=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oberauer has extended Cowan's model by adding a third component, a more narrow focus of attention that holds only one chunk at a time. The one-element focus is embedded in the four-element focus and serves to select a single chunk for processing. For example, four digits can be held in mind at the same time in Cowan's "focus of attention". When the individual wishes to perform a process on each of these digits—for example, adding the number two to each digit—separate processing is required for each digit since most individuals cannot perform several mathematical processes in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Attention, working memory, and long-term memory in multimedia learning: A integrated perspective based on process models of working memory|last = Schweppe|first = J.|date = 2014|journal = Educational Psychology Review|doi = 10.1007/s10648-013-9242-2|pmid = |issue = 2|volume = 26|page = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oberauer's attentional component selects one of the digits for processing and then shifts the attentional focus to the next digit, continuing until all digits have been processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oberauer K |title=Access to information in working memory: exploring the focus of attention |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=411–21 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12018494 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.28.3.411|citeseerx=10.1.1.163.4979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacity ==
Working memory is generally considered to have limited capacity. An early quantification of the capacity limit associated with short-term memory was the "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|magical number seven]]" suggested by Miller in 1956.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Miller GA |title=The magical number seven plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=81–97 |date=March 1956 |pmid=13310704 |doi=10.1037/h0043158|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }} Republished: {{Cite journal|author=Miller GA |title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information. 1956 |journal=Psychological Review |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=343–52 |date=April 1994 |pmid=8022966 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the information-processing capacity of young adults is around seven elements, which he called "chunks", regardless of whether the elements are digits, letters, words, or other units. Later research revealed this number depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span may be around seven for digits, six for letters, and five for words), and even on features of the [[chunking (psychology)|chunks]] within a category. For instance, span is lower for long than short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) depends on the phonological complexity of the content (i.e., the number of phonemes, the number of syllables),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Service|first=Elisabet|date=1998-05-01|title=The Effect of Word Length on Immediate Serial Recall Depends on Phonological Complexity, Not Articulatory Duration|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A|volume=51|issue=2|pages=283–304|doi=10.1080/713755759|issn=0272-4987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the lexical status of the contents (whether the contents are words known to the person or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Charles |last1=Hulme |first2=Steven |last2=Roodenrys |first3=Gordon |last3=Brown |first4=Robin |last4=Mercer |date=November 1995 |title=The role of long-term memory mechanisms in memory span |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=527–36 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1996-29539-001 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other factors affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and fewer in children and old adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Nelson |last1=Cowan |year=2001 |title=The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=87–185 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X01003922 |pmid=11515286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas most adults can repeat about seven digits in correct order, some individuals have shown impressive enlargements of their digit span—up to 80 digits. This feat is possible by extensive training on an encoding strategy by which the digits in a list are grouped (usually in groups of three to five) and these groups are encoded as a single unit (a chunk). For this to succeed, participants must be able to recognize the groups as some known string of digits. One person studied by Ericsson and his colleagues, for example, used an extensive knowledge of racing times from the history of sports in the process of coding chunks: several such chunks could then be combined into a higher-order chunk, forming a hierarchy of chunks. In this way, only some chunks at the highest level of the hierarchy must be retained in working memory, and for retrieval the chunks are unpacked. That is, the chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point to the digits they contain. Practicing memory skills such as these does not expand working memory capacity proper: it is the capacity to transfer (and retrieve) information from long-term memory that is improved, according to Ericsson and Kintsch (1995; see also Gobet &amp; Simon, 2000&lt;ref name="Gobet F 2000 551–70"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 2000|title=Some shortcomings of long-term working memory|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=91|issue=Pt 4|pages=551–70|doi=10.1348/000712600161989|pmid=11104178|author=Gobet F|url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/807|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Measures and correlates ===
Working memory capacity can be tested by a variety of tasks. A commonly used measure is a dual-task paradigm, combining a [[memory span]] measure with a concurrent processing task, sometimes referred to as "complex span".

Measures of working-memory capacity are strongly related to performance in other complex cognitive tasks, such as reading comprehension, problem solving, and with measures of [[intelligence quotient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Conway AR, Kane MJ, Engle RW |title=Working memory capacity and its relation to general intelligence |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=547–52 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14643371 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.005|citeseerx=10.1.1.538.4967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have argued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Engle, R. W.|author2=Tuholski, S. W.|author3=Laughlin, J. E.|author4=Conway, A. R. |title=Working memory, short-term memory, and general fluid intelligence: a latent-variable approach |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |volume=128 |issue=3 |pages=309–31 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10513398 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.3.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; that working-memory capacity reflects the efficiency of executive functions, most notably the ability to maintain multiple task-relevant representations in the face of distracting irrelevant information; and that such tasks seem to reflect individual differences in the ability to focus and maintain attention, particularly when other events are serving to capture attention. Both working memory and executive functions rely strongly, though not exclusively, on frontal brain areas.&lt;ref name="Kane MJ, Engle RW 2002 637–71"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03196323|author=Kane, M.

Other researchers have argued that the capacity of working memory is better characterized as the ability to mentally form relations between elements, or to grasp relations in given information. This idea has been advanced, among others, by Graeme Halford, who illustrated it by our limited ability to understand statistical interactions between variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Halford, G. S.|author2=Baker, R.|author3=McCredden, J. E.|author4=Bain, J. D. |title=How many variables can humans process? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=70–76 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15660854 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00782.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors asked people to compare written statements about the relations between several variables to graphs illustrating the same or a different relation, as in the following sentence: "If the cake is from France, then it has more sugar if it is made with chocolate than if it is made with cream, but if the cake is from Italy, then it has more sugar if it is made with cream than if it is made of chocolate". This statement describes a relation between three variables (country, ingredient, and amount of sugar), which is the maximum most individuals can understand. The capacity limit apparent here is obviously not a memory limit (all relevant information can be seen continuously) but a limit to how many relationships are discerned simultaneously.

=== Experimental studies of working-memory capacity ===
There are several hypotheses about the nature of the capacity limit. One is that a limited pool of cognitive resources needed to keep representations active and thereby available for processing, and for carrying out processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Just, M. A.|author2=Carpenter, P. A. |title=A capacity theory of comprehension: individual differences in working memory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=122–49 |date=January 1992 |pmid=1546114 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.99.1.122|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1730&amp;context=psychology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that memory traces in working memory decay within a few seconds, unless refreshed through rehearsal, and because the speed of rehearsal is limited, we can maintain only a limited amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03198549|author=Towse, J.

====Decay theories====

The assumption that the contents of short-term or working memory decay over time, unless decay is prevented by rehearsal, goes back to the early days of experimental research on short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown, J.|year=1958|title=Some tests of the decay theory of immediate memory|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=10|pages=12–21|via=|doi=10.1080/17470215808416249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Peterson, L.

D.|publisher=Clarendon|year=1986|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most elaborate decay-based theory of working memory to date is the "time-based resource sharing model".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=March 2004|title=Time constraints and resource sharing in adults' working memory spans|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=133|issue=1|pages=83–100|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.133.1.83|pmid=14979753|vauthors=Barrouillet P, Bernardin S, Camos V|citeseerx=10.1.1.379.9208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes that representations in working memory decay unless they are refreshed. Refreshing them requires an attentional mechanism that is also needed for any concurrent processing task. When there are small time intervals in which the processing task does not require attention, this time can be used to refresh memory traces. The theory therefore predicts that the amount of forgetting depends on the temporal density of attentional demands of the processing task—this density is called "cognitive load". The cognitive load depends on two variables, the rate at which the processing task requires individual steps to be carried out, and the duration of each step. For example, if the processing task consists of adding digits, then having to add another digit every half second places a higher cognitive load on the system than having to add another digit every two seconds. In a series of experiments, Barrouillet and colleagues have shown that memory for lists of letters depends neither on the number of processing steps nor the total time of processing but on cognitive load.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Time and cognitive load in working memory|date=May 2007|journal=J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn|vauthors=Barrouillet P, Bernardin S, Portrat S, Vergauwe E, Camos V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource theories====

Resource theories assume that the capacity of working memory is a limited resource that must be shared between all representations that need to be maintained in working memory simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first1=W. J.|author2=Husain, M.|author3=Bays, P. M.|year=2014|title=Changing concepts of working memory|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=17|issue=3|pages=347–356|via=|doi=10.1038/nn.3655|pmid=24569831|pmc=4159388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some resource theorists also assume that maintenance and concurrent processing share the same resource;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; this can explain why maintenance is typically impaired by a concurrent processing demand. Resource theories have been very successful in explaining data from tests of working memory for simple visual features, such as colors or orientations of bars. An ongoing debate is whether the resource is a continuous quantity that can be subdivided among any number of items in working memory, or whether it consists of a small number of discrete "slots", each of which can be assigned to one memory item, so that only a limited number of about 3 items can be maintained in working memory at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Berg|first=Ronald|last2=Awh|first2=Edward|last3=Ma|first3=Wei Ji|title=Factorial comparison of working memory models.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=121|issue=1|pages=124–149|doi=10.1037/a0035234|pmc=4159389|pmid=24490791|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interference theories====

Several forms of [[Interference theory|interference]] have been discussed by theorists. One of the oldest ideas is that new items simply replace older ones in working memory. Another form of interference is retrieval competition. For example, when the task is to remember a list of 7 words in their order, we need to start recall with the first word. While trying to retrieve the first word, the second word, which is represented in proximity, is accidentally retrieved as well, and the two compete for being recalled. Errors in serial recall tasks are often confusions of neighboring items on a memory list (so-called transpositions), showing that retrieval competition plays a role in limiting our ability to recall lists in order, and probably also in other working memory tasks. A third form of interference is the distortion of representations by superposition: When multiple representations are added on top of each other, each of them is blurred by the presence of all the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oberauer|first=Klaus|last2=Lewandowsky|first2=Stephan|last3=Farrell|first3=Simon|last4=Jarrold|first4=Christopher|last5=Greaves|first5=Martin|date=2012-06-20|title=Modeling working memory: An interference model of complex span|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=5|pages=779–819|doi=10.3758/s13423-012-0272-4|pmid=22715024|issn=1069-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth form of interference assumed by some authors is feature overwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.08.009 |title=A formal model of capacity limits in working memory |date=November 2006 |first1=Klaus |last1=Oberauer |first2=Reinhold |last2=Kliegl |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=601–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00221-010-2501-2 |pmid=21132280 |title=Distractor frequency influences performance in vibrotactile working memory |year=2011 |first1=T. |last1=Bancroft |first2=P. |last2=Servos |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=208 |issue=4 |pages=529–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that each word, digit, or other item in working memory is represented as a bundle of features, and when two items share some features, one of them steals the features from the other. The more items are held in working memory, and the more their features overlap, the more each of them will be degraded by the loss of some features.

==== Limitations ====
None of these hypotheses can explain the experimental data entirely. The resource hypothesis, for example, was meant to explain the trade-off between maintenance and processing: The more information must be maintained in working memory, the slower and more error prone concurrent processes become, and with a higher demand on concurrent processing memory suffers. This trade-off has been investigated by tasks like the reading-span task described above. It has been found that the amount of trade-off depends on the similarity of the information to be remembered and the information to be processed. For example, remembering numbers while processing spatial information, or remembering spatial information while processing numbers, impair each other much less than when material of the same kind must be remembered and processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.07.009 |title=The relationship between processing and storage in working memory span: Not two sides of the same coin |date=February 2007 |first1=Yukio |last1=Maehara |first2=Satoru |last2=Saito |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=212–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, remembering words and processing digits, or remembering digits and processing words, is easier than remembering and processing materials of the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1076/anec.6.2.99.784 |title=Selection from Working Memory: on the Relationship between Processing and Storage Components |date=June 1999 |last1=Li |first1=Karen Z.H. |journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=99–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are also difficult to explain for the decay hypothesis, because decay of memory representations should depend only on how long the processing task delays rehearsal or recall, not on the content of the processing task. A further problem for the decay hypothesis comes from experiments in which the recall of a list of letters was delayed, either by instructing participants to recall at a slower pace, or by instructing them to say an irrelevant word once or three times in between recall of each letter. Delaying recall had virtually no effect on recall accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3758/BF03196705|vauthors=Lewandowsky S, Duncan M, Brown GD |title=Time does not cause forgetting in short-term serial recall |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=771–90 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15732687 |url=http://pbr.psychonomic-journals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15732687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Oberauer K, Lewandowsky S |title=Forgetting in immediate serial recall: decay, temporal distinctiveness, or interference? |journal=Psychological Review |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=544–76 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18729591 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.115.3.544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[interference theory]] seems to fare best with explaining why the similarity between memory contents and the contents of concurrent processing tasks affects how much they impair each other. More similar materials are more likely to be confused, leading to retrieval competition.

Measures of performance on tests of working memory increase continuously between early childhood and adolescence, while the structure of correlations between different tests remains largely constant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Starting with work in the Neo-Piagetian tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(70)90108-3 | last1 = Pascual-Leone | first1 = J. | year = 1970 | title = A mathematical model for the transition rule in Piaget's developmental stages | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 301–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1985). Intellectual development. Birth to adulthood. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; theorists have argued that the growth of working-memory capacity is a major driving force of cognitive development.

Towse (Eds.), Variation in working memory (pp. 137–161). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly strong evidence for a role of working memory for development comes from a longitudinal study showing that working-memory capacity at one age predicts reasoning ability at a later age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01895.x | last1 = Kail | first1 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Longitudinal evidence that increases in processing speed and working memory enhance children's reasoning | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 312–313 | pmid = 17470254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in the Neo-Piagetian tradition have added to this picture by analyzing the complexity of cognitive tasks in terms of the number of items or relations that have to be considered simultaneously for a solution. Across a broad range of tasks, children manage task versions of the same level of complexity at about the same age, consistent with the view that working memory capacity limits the complexity they can handle at a given age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0285(02)00002-6 | last1 = Andrews | first1 = G. | last2 = Halford | first2 = G.

One is the processing speed theory of cognitive aging by Tim Salthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.403 | last1 = Salthouse | first1 = T.

However, the decline of working-memory capacity cannot be entirely attributed to slowing because capacity declines more in old age than speed.&lt;ref name="Park, D. C. 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(95)00689-3 | last1 = Mayr | first1 = U. | last2 = Kliegl | first2 = R. | last3 = Krampe | first3 = R.

(1988). Working memory, comprehension, and aging: A review and new view. In G. H. Bower (Ed.), ''The psychology of learning and motivation'', ''Vol. 22'', (pp. 193–225). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes a general deficit in old age in the ability to inhibit irrelevant, or no-longer relevant, information. Therefore, working memory tends to be cluttered with irrelevant contents that reduce the effective capacity for relevant content. The assumption of an inhibition deficit in old age has received much empirical support&lt;ref&gt;Hasher, L., Zacks, R.&amp;nbsp;T., &amp; May, C.&amp;nbsp;P. (1999). Inhibitory control, circadian arousal, and age. In D.&amp;nbsp;Gopher &amp; A.&amp;nbsp;Koriat (Eds.), ''Attention and Performance'' (pp. 653–675). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but, so far, it is not clear whether the decline in inhibitory ability fully explains the decline of working-memory capacity. An explanation on the neural level of the decline of working memory and other cognitive functions in old age has been proposed by West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.120.2.272 | last1 = West | first1 = R.&amp;nbsp;L. | year = 1996 | title = An application of prefrontal cortex function theory to cognitive aging | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 120 | issue = 2| pages = 272–292 | pmid = 8831298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that working memory depends to a large degree on the [[pre-frontal cortex]], which deteriorates more than other brain regions as we grow old.

Torkel Klingberg was the first to investigate whether intensive training of working memory has beneficial effects on other cognitive functions.

=== Neural mechanisms of maintaining information ===
The first insights into the neuronal and neurotransmitter basis of working memory came from animal research. The work of Jacobsen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacobsen CF|title= Studies of cerebral function in primates |journal=Comparative Psychology Monographs |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=1–68 |year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fulton in the 1930s first showed that lesions to the PFC impaired spatial working memory performance in monkeys. The later work of [[Joaquin Fuster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fuster JM |title=Unit activity in prefrontal cortex during delayed-response performance: neuronal correlates of transient memory |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=61–78 |date=January 1973 |pmid=4196203 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4196203|doi=10.1152/jn.1973.36.1.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the PFC of monkeys while they were doing a delayed matching task. In that task, the monkey sees how the experimenter places a bit of food under one of two identical-looking cups. A shutter is then lowered for a variable delay period, screening off the cups from the monkey's view. After the delay, the shutter opens and the monkey is allowed to retrieve the food from under the cups. Successful retrieval in the first attempt – something the animal can achieve after some training on the task – requires holding the location of the food in memory over the delay period. Fuster found neurons in the PFC that fired mostly during the delay period, suggesting that they were involved in representing the food location while it was invisible. Later research has shown similar delay-active neurons also in the posterior [[parietal cortex]], the [[thalamus]], the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]], and the [[globus pallidus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ashby FG, Ell SW, Valentin VV, Casale MB |title=FROST: a distributed neurocomputational model of working memory maintenance |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=17 |issue=11 |pages=1728–43 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16269109 |doi=10.1162/089892905774589271|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.7179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Patricia Goldman-Rakic|Goldman-Rakic]] and others showed that principal sulcal, dorsolateral PFC interconnects with all of these brain regions, and that neuronal microcircuits within PFC are able to maintain information in working memory through recurrent excitatory glutamate networks of pyramidal cells that continue to fire throughout the delay period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goldman-Rakic PS|title= Cellular basis of working memory |journal=Neuron |volume=14 |issue= 3 |pages=447–485 |year=1995 | pmid = 7695894 | doi = 10.1016/0896-6273(95)90304-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These circuits are tuned by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rao SG, Williams GV, Goldman-Rakic PS |title= Destruction and creation of spatial tuning by disinhibition: GABA(A) blockade of prefrontal cortical neurons engaged by working memory |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=20 |pages=485–494 |year=2000|pmid=10627624 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neuromodulatory arousal systems markedly alter PFC working memory function; for example, either too little or too much dopamine or norepinephrine impairs PFC network firing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.05.003|author1=Arnsten AFT |author2=Paspalas CD |author3=Gamo NJ |author4=Y.

The research described above on persistent firing of certain neurons in the delay period of working memory tasks shows that the brain has a mechanism of keeping representations active without external input. Keeping representations active, however, is not enough if the task demands maintaining more than one chunk of information. In addition, the components and features of each chunk must be bound together to prevent them from being mixed up. For example, if a red triangle and a green square must be remembered at the same time, one must make sure that "red" is bound to "triangle" and "green" is bound to "square". One way of establishing such bindings is by having the neurons that represent features of the same chunk fire in synchrony, and those that represent features belonging to different chunks fire out of sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=August 2001|title=A cortical mechanism for binding in visual working memory|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=13|issue=6|pages=766–85|doi=10.1162/08989290152541430|pmid=11564321|vauthors=Raffone A, Wolters G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example, neurons representing redness would fire in synchrony with neurons representing the triangular shape, but out of sync with those representing the square shape. So far, there is no direct evidence that working memory uses this binding mechanism, and other mechanisms have been proposed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The unity of consciousness: Binding, integration, and dissociation|last2=Busby|first2=Richard S.|last3=Soto|first3=Rodolfo|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-850857-1|location=Oxford|pages=168–90|chapter=Three forms of binding and their neural substrates: Alternatives to temporal synchrony|oclc=50747505|first1=Randall C.|last1=O'Reilly|editor1-first=Axel|editor1-last=Cleeremans|chapterurl=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-88180-008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that synchronous firing of neurons involved in working memory oscillate with frequencies in the [[theta rhythm|theta]] band (4 to 8&amp;nbsp;Hz).

=== Localization in the brain ===
Localization of brain functions in humans has become much easier with the advent of [[brain imaging]] methods ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]]). This research has confirmed that areas in the PFC are involved in working memory functions. During the 1990s much debate has centered on the different functions of the ventrolateral (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;lower areas) and the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral (higher) areas of the PFC]]. A human lesion study provides additional evidence for the role of the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] in working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Koenigs|first2=Michael|last3=Grafman|first3=Jordan|year=2013|title=Dorsolateral prefrontal contributions to human working memory|journal=Cortex|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1195–1205|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2012.05.022|pmid=22789779|last1=Barbey|first1=Aron K.|pmc=3495093}}&lt;/ref&gt; One view was that the dorsolateral areas are responsible for spatial working memory and the ventrolateral areas for non-spatial working memory. Another view proposed a functional distinction, arguing that ventrolateral areas are mostly involved in pure maintenance of information, whereas dorsolateral areas are more involved in tasks requiring some processing of the memorized material. The debate is not entirely resolved but most of the evidence supports the functional distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Owen, A. M.|title=The functional organization of working memory processes within human lateral frontal cortex: the contribution of functional neuroimaging |journal=The European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=1329–39 |date=July 1997 |pmid=9240390 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.1997.tb01487.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain imaging has also revealed that working memory functions are not limited to the PFC. A review of numerous studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Smith EE, Jonides J |title=Storage and executive processes in the frontal lobes |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5408 |pages=1657–61 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10073923 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5408.1657|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.8961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows areas of activation during working memory tasks scattered over a large part of the cortex. There is a tendency for spatial tasks to recruit more right-hemisphere areas, and for verbal and object working memory to recruit more left-hemisphere areas. The activation during verbal working memory tasks can be broken down into one component reflecting maintenance, in the left posterior parietal cortex, and a component reflecting subvocal rehearsal, in the left frontal cortex (Broca's area, known to be involved in speech production).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Smith, E.

There is an emerging consensus that most working memory tasks recruit a network of PFC and parietal areas. A study has shown that during a working memory task the connectivity between these areas increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Honey, G. D.|author2=Fu, C.

A current debate concerns the function of these brain areas. The PFC has been found to be active in a variety of tasks that require executive functions.&lt;ref name="Kane MJ, Engle RW 2002 637–71" /&gt; This has led some researchers to argue that the role of PFC in working memory is in controlling attention, selecting strategies, and manipulating information in working memory, but not in maintenance of information.

A 2003 meta-analysis of 60 neuroimaging studies found left [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] cortex was involved in low-task demand verbal working memory and right [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] cortex for spatial working memory. Brodmann's areas (BAs) [[Brodmann area 6|6]], [[Brodmann area 8|8]], and [[Brodmann area 9|9]], in the [[Superior frontal gyrus|superior frontal cortex]] was involved when working memory must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order had to be maintained. Right Brodmann [[Brodmann area 10|10]] and [[Brodmann area 10|47]] in the ventral frontal cortex were involved more frequently with demand for manipulation such as dual-task requirements or mental operations, and Brodmann 7 in the [[posterior parietal cortex]] was also involved in all types of executive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Neuroimaging studies of working memory: a meta-analysis|journal = Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 1530-7026|pmid = 15040547|pages = 255–274|volume = 3|issue = 4|first = Tor D.|last = Wager|first2 = Edward E.|last2 = Smith|doi=10.3758/cabn.3.4.255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of recognition tasks is that they require minimal movement (just pressing one of two keys), making fixation of the head in the scanner easier. Experimental research and research on individual differences in working memory, however, has used largely recall tasks (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;the [[reading span task]], see below). It is not clear to what degree recognition and recall tasks reflect the same processes and the same capacity limitations.

Brain imaging studies have been conducted with the reading span task or related tasks. Increased activation during these tasks was found in the PFC and, in several studies, also in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC). People performing better on the task showed larger increase of activation in these areas, and their activation was correlated more over time, suggesting that their neural activity in these two areas was better coordinated, possibly due to stronger connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kondo, H.|author2=Osaka, N.|author3=Osaka, M.|title=Cooperation of the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for attention shifting |journal=NeuroImage |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=670–9 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15488417 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Osaka N, Osaka M, Kondo H, Morishita M, Fukuyama H, Shibasaki H |title=The neural basis of executive function in working memory: an fMRI study based on individual differences |journal=NeuroImage |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=623–31 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14980565 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more stress in one's life, the lower the efficiency of working memory in performing simple cognitive tasks. Students who performed exercises that reduced the intrusion of negative thoughts showed an increase in their working memory capacity.

=== Behavioral genetics ===
Individual differences in working-memory capacity are to some extent [[heritable]]; that is, about half of the variation between individuals is related to differences in their genes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engelhardt|first=Laura E.|last2=Mann|first2=Frank D.|last3=Briley|first3=Daniel A.|last4=Church|first4=Jessica A.|last5=Harden|first5=K.

=== Attempts to identify individual genes ===
Little is known about which genes are related to the functioning of working memory. Within the theoretical framework of the multi-component model, one candidate gene has been proposed, namely [[ROBO1]] for the hypothetical [[phonological loop]] component of working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Genetic Variance in a Component of the Language Acquisition Device: ROBO1 Polymorphisms Associated with Phonological Buffer Deficits|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=648f7acb-e7fd-45d9-b0de-ca92e046deab%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4209|journal=Behavior Genetics|volume=41|issue=1|pages=50–7|doi=10.1007/s10519-010-9402-9|pmid=20949370|access-date=1 September 2016|via=PsycINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working memory capacity is correlated with learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy. Initial evidence for this relation comes from the correlation between working-memory capacity and reading comprehension, as first observed by Daneman and Carpenter (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Individual differences in working memory and reading|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022537180903126|journal = Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date = 1980-08-01|pages = 450–466|volume = 19|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/S0022-5371(80)90312-6|first = Meredyth|last = Daneman|first2 = Patricia A.|last2 = Carpenter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed in a later meta-analytic review of several studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daneman|first=Meredyth|last2=Merikle|first2=Philip M.|title=Working memory and language comprehension: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=422–433|doi=10.3758/BF03214546|pmid=24213976|issn=1069-9384|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work found that working memory performance in primary school children accurately predicted performance in mathematical problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson|first=H.

In a large-scale screening study, one in ten children in mainstream classrooms were identified with working memory deficits.

== Relationship with neural disorders ==

An impairment of working memory functioning is normally seen in several neural disorders:

'''ADHD:''' Several authors&lt;ref&gt;Barkley; Castellanos and Tannock; Pennington and Ozonoff; Schachar (according to the source)&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that symptoms of [[ADHD]] arise from a primary deficit in a specific executive function (EF) domain such as working memory, response inhibition or a more general weakness in executive control.&lt;ref name="WillcuttDoyle2005"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2005|title=Validity of the executive function theory of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analytic review|url=|journal=Biol. Psychiatry|volume=57|issue=11|pages=1336–46|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.02.006|pmid=15950006|vauthors=Willcutt EG, Doyle AE, Nigg JT, Faraone SV, Pennington BF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analytical review cites several studies that found significant lower group results for ADHD in spatial and verbal working memory tasks, and in several other EF tasks. However, the authors concluded that EF weaknesses neither are necessary nor sufficient to cause all cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name="WillcuttDoyle2005" /&gt;

Several [[neurotransmitters]], such as [[dopamine]] and [[glutamate]] may be both involved in ADHD and working memory. Both are associated with the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] brain, self-direction and self-regulation, but [[Causality|cause–effect]] have not been confirmed, so it is unclear whether working memory dysfunction leads to ADHD, or ADHD distractibility leads to poor functionality of working memory, or if there is some other connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/adhd.2008.16.6.8 Working Memory as a Core Deficit in ADHD: Preliminary Findings and Implications] – 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark Blackwell 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2007|title=Association between response inhibition and working memory in adult ADHD: a link to right frontal cortex pathology?|url=|journal=Biol.

'''Parkinson's disease''':&amp;nbsp;Patients with [[Parkinson's]] show signs of a reduced verbal function of working memory. They wanted to find if the reduction is due to a lack of ability to focus on relevant tasks, or a low amount of memory capacity. Twenty-one patients with Parkinson's were tested in comparison to the control group of 28 participants of the same age.The researchers found that both hypotheses were the reason working memory function is reduced which did not fully agree with their hypothesis that it is either one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2929336|title=Visual working memory deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease are due to both reduced storage capacity and impaired ability to filter out irrelevant information|last=Lee|first=Eun-Young|date=August 5, 2010|journal=Brain|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2677–2689|doi=10.1093/brain/awq197|pmid=20688815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alzheimer's disease''': As [[Alzheimer's disease]] becomes more serious, less working memory functions. There is one study that focuses on the neural connections and fluidity of working memory in mice brains. Half of the mice were given an injection that is similar to Alzheimer's effects, and the other half were not. Then they were expected to go through a maze that is a task to test working memory. The study help answer questions about how Alzheimer's can deteriorate the working memory and ultimately obliterate memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiaotiao|first=Liu|date=December 2014|title=Functional connectivity in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease during a working memory task|journal=Current Alzheimer Research|volume=11|issue=10|pages=981–991|doi=10.2174/1567205011666141107125912 |pmid=25387338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huntington's disease''':&amp;nbsp;A group of researchers hosted a study that researched the function and connectivity of working memory over a 30-month longitudinal experiment. It found that there were certain places in the brain where most connectivity was decreased in pre-[[Huntington disease]]d patients, in comparison to the control group that remained consistently functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poudel|first=Govinda R.|date=January 2015|title=Functional changes during working memory in Huntington's disease: 30-month longitudinal data from the IMAGE-HD study|journal=Brain Structure and Function|volume=220|issue=1|pages=501–512|pmid=24240602|doi=10.1007/s00429-013-0670-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{writing systems sidebar}}
A '''writing system''' is any conventional method of visually representing verbal [[communication]].  While both [[writing]] and [[spoken language|speech]] are useful in conveying [[message]]s, writing differs in also being a reliable form of [[information]] storage and [[information transfer|transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/definition.htm | title=Definitions of writing systems | publisher=www.omniglot.com | work=Omniglot: The Online Encyclopedia of Writing Systems and Languages | accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of [[code|encoding and decoding]] writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and [[reading (process)|readers]] of the meaning behind the sets of [[character (symbol)|characters]] that make up a script.  Writing is usually recorded onto a [[Storage medium#Recording medium|durable medium]], such as paper or [[data storage device|electronic storage]], although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer [[display device|display]], on a blackboard, in sand, or by [[skywriting]].

The general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories such as [[alphabet]]s, [[syllabary|syllabaries]], or [[logogram|logographies]]. Any particular system can have attributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a standard set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (basic written [[symbol]]s or [[grapheme]]s) of [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter pair/groups) represent [[phoneme|speech sounds]]. In a syllabary, each symbol correlates to a [[syllable]] or [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]. In a logography, each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or other semantic units. Other categories include [[abjad]]s, which differ from alphabets in that vowels are not indicated, and [[abugida]]s or alphasyllabaries, with each character representing a consonant–vowel pairing. Alphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language{{Citation needed|reason=Even the basic Roman alphabet has more symbols — after all “A” and “a” are clearly different symbols, though maybe not letters.|date=February 2018}}, whereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100{{Citation needed|reason=So how come 710 Canadian syllabics are encoded in Unicode?|date=February 2018}}, and logographies can have several hundreds of symbols.{{Citation needed|reason=To read a Chinese newspaper or book you need to know several thousand Chinese characters.|date=February 2018}}

Most systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that groups of them can be coded into larger clusters like [[word]]s or [[acronym]]s (generally [[lexeme]]s), giving rise to many more possibilities ([[permutation]]s) in meanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the [[concatenation|stringing together]] of these smaller groupings (sometimes referred to by the generic term 'character strings') in order to enable a full expression of the language. The reading step can be accomplished purely in the mind as an internal process, or [[reading aloud|expressed orally]].  A special set of symbols known as [[punctuation]] is used to aid in structure and organization of many writing systems and can be used to help capture nuances and variations in the message's meaning that are communicated verbally by cues in [[rhythm|timing]], [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[pitch accent|accent]], [[inflection]] or [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].  A writing system will also typically have a method for formatting recorded messages that follows the spoken version's rules like its [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] so that the [[receiver (information theory)|reader]] will have the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the intended message accurately preserved.

Writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]], which used [[pictogram]]s, [[ideogram]]s and other [[mnemonic]] symbols. Proto-writing lacked the ability to capture and express a full range of thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates back to the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic Era]] of the late [[4th millennium BC]], enabled the accurate durable recording of [[human history]] in a manner that was not prone to the same [[telephone (game)|types of error]] to which [[oral tradition|oral history]] is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided [[postal system|a reliable form]] of long distance communication. With the advent of [[publishing]], it provided the [[media (communication)|medium]] for an early form of [[mass communication]].

The creation of a new alphabetic writing system for a language with an existing logographic writing system is called alphabetization, as when the [[People's Republic of China]] studied the prospect of alphabetizing the [[Chinese language]]s with [[Latin script]], [[Cyrillic script]], [[Arabic script]], and even numbers,&lt;ref name="isbn_9780060826581"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hessler |first=Peter |year=2006 |title=Oracle Bones: A Journey Between China's Past and Present |publisher=Harper Collins |chapter=Artifact K: The Lost Alphabets |pages=401–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvmZjIDiOwcC |isbn=9780060826581 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most common instance of it, converting to Latin script, is usually called [[romanization]].

== General properties ==
[[File:Kuozhai.jpg|thumb|Chinese characters (漢字) are morpho-syllabic. Each one represents a syllable with a distinct meaning, but some characters may have multiple meanings or pronunciations]]

Writing systems are distinguished from other possible [[symbolic communication]] systems in that a writing system is always associated with at least one [[spoken language]]. In contrast, visual representations such as drawings, paintings, and non-verbal items on maps, such as contour lines, are not language-related. Some symbols on information signs, such as the symbols for male and female, are also not language related, but can grow to become part of language if they are often used in conjunction with other language elements. Some other symbols, such as [[Numeral system|numerals]] and the [[ampersand]], are not directly linked to any specific language, but are often used in writing and thus must be considered part of writing systems.

Every human community possesses language, which many regard as an innate and defining condition of humanity. However, the development of writing systems, and the process by which they have supplanted traditional [[orality|oral]] systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven and slow. Once established, writing systems generally change more slowly than their spoken counterparts. Thus they often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. One of the great benefits of writing systems is that they can preserve a permanent record of information expressed in a language.

All writing systems require:

* at least one set of defined base elements or [[symbol]]s, individually termed ''signs'' and collectively called a ''script'';&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian. 2003. ''Writing systems. An introduction''. Cambridge University Press. pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* at least one set of rules and conventions ([[orthography]]) understood and shared by a community, which assigns [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] to the base elements ([[grapheme]]s), their ordering and relations to one another;
* at least one language (generally [[spoken language|spoken]]) whose constructions are represented and can be recalled by the interpretation of these elements and rules;
* some physical means of distinctly representing the symbols by application to a permanent or semi-permanent [[medium (communication)|medium]], so they may be interpreted (usually visually, but tactile systems have also been devised).

== Basic terminology ==
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|''A Specimen'' of typefaces and styles, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

In the examination of individual scripts, the study of writing systems has developed along partially independent lines. Thus, the terminology employed differs somewhat from field to field.

=== Text, writing, reading and orthography ===
The generic term ''text''&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal (2008), [http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405152966.html ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics'', 6th Edition], p.481, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; refers to an instance of written or spoken material with the latter having been transcribed in some way. The act of composing and recording a text may be referred to as ''[[writing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bußmann (1998), [https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Routledge_Dictionary_of_Language_and_Lin.html?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;redir_esc=y ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''], p.1294, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; and the act of viewing and interpreting the text as ''[[Reading (activity)|reading]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bußmann (1998), [https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Routledge_Dictionary_of_Language_and_Lin.html?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;redir_esc=y ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''], p.979, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Orthography]]'' refers to the method and rules of observed writing structure (literal meaning, "correct writing"), and particularly for [[alphabet]]ic systems, includes the concept of ''[[spelling]]''.

=== Grapheme and phoneme ===
{{main|grapheme|phoneme}}
A ''[[grapheme]]'' is a specific base unit of a writing system. Graphemes are the ''minimally significant'' elements which taken together comprise the set of "building blocks" out of which texts made up of one or more writing systems may be constructed, along with rules of correspondence and use. The concept is similar to that of the [[phoneme]] used in the study of spoken languages. For example, in the [[Latin]]-based writing system of standard contemporary English, examples of graphemes include the [[majuscule]] and [[Lower case|minuscule]] forms of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet (corresponding to various phonemes), marks of [[punctuation]] (mostly non-phonemic), and a few other symbols such as those for [[Arabic numeral|numerals]] (logograms for numbers).

An individual grapheme may be represented in a wide variety of ways, where each variation is visually distinct in some regard, but all are interpreted as representing the "same" grapheme. These individual variations are known as ''[[allograph]]s'' of a grapheme (compare with the term [[allophone]] used in linguistic study). For example, the minuscule letter ''a'' has different allographs when written as a [[cursive]], [[capital letters|block]], or [[typeface|typed]] letter. The choice of a particular allograph may be influenced by the medium used, the [[Writing implement|writing instrument]], the stylistic choice of the writer, the preceding and following graphemes in the text, the time available for writing, the intended audience, and the largely unconscious features of an individual's [[handwriting]].

=== Glyph, sign and character ===
The terms ''[[glyph]]'', ''[[sign (linguistics)|sign]]'' and ''character'' are sometimes used to refer to a grapheme. Common usage varies from discipline to discipline; compare [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform sign]], [[Maya script|Maya glyph]], [[Chinese character]]. The glyphs of most writing systems are made up of lines (or strokes) and are therefore called [[Linear writing|linear]], but there are glyphs in [[Non-linear writing|non-linear writing systems]] made up of other types of marks, such as Cuneiform and [[Braille]].

=== Complete and partial writing systems ===
Writing systems may be regarded as ''complete'' according to the extent to which they are able to represent all that may be expressed in the spoken language, while a ''partial'' writing system is limited in what it can convey.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Joseph Ottenheimer (2012), [https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=EYcJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 ''The Anthropology of Language: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology'', p.194], Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems, languages and conceptual systems ===
Writing systems can be independent from languages, one can have multiple writing systems for a language, e.g., [[Hindi–Urdu controversy|Hindi and Urdu]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/27680/is-it-plausible-to-have-two-written-forms-of-one-spoken-language-that-are-so-dif StackExchange: Is it plausible to have two written forms of one spoken language that are so different as to be indecipherable?]&lt;/ref&gt; and one can also have one writing system for multiple languages, e.g., the [[Arabic script]]. Chinese characters were also borrowed by variant countries as their early writing systems, e.g., the [[Vietnamese language#Writing systems|early writing systems]] of [[Vietnamese language]] until the beginning of the 20th century.

To represent a [[conceptual system]], one uses one or more languages, e.g., mathematics is a conceptual system&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=1_IkBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 Metaphor and Analogy in the Sciences, p.126], Springer Science &amp; Business Media (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and one may use [[first-order logic]] and a [[natural language]] together in representation.

== History ==
{{main article|History of writing}}
[[File:Sanskrit Brhama English alphabets.jpg|thumb|Table of scripts in the introduction to ''[[Sanskrit]]-English Dictionary'' by [[Monier Monier-Williams]]]]

Writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]], systems of [[ideogram|ideographic]] and/or early [[mnemonic]] symbols. The best known examples are:

* [[Jiahu symbols]], carved on [[tortoise]] [[Animal shell|shells]] in [[Jiahu]], c. 6600 BC
* [[Vinča symbols]] ([[Tărtăria tablets]]), {{circa}}5300 BC
* Early [[Indus script]], c. 3500 BC.
* [[Nsibidi]] script, c. before 500 AD

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]]{{dubious|Bronze Age is what follows after Neolithic, by definition. Or is there some deeper meaning hidden here?|date=May 2015}} of the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400 to 3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]].

A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. [[Chinese script]] are probably an independent invention, because there is no evidence of contact between China and the literate civilizations of the Near East,&lt;ref&gt;David N. Keightley, Noel Barnard. The Origins of Chinese civilization. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC&amp;pg=PA415 Page 415-416]&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the distinct differences between the Mesopotamian and Chinese approaches to [[logogram|logography]] and phonetic representation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Sex_and_Eroticism_in_Mesopotamian_Litera.html?id=Fn67_Rid51EC Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature]. By Dr Gwendolyn Leick. Pg 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.

A [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|hieroglyphic writing system]] used by pre-colonial [[Mi'kmaq]], that was observed by missionaries from the 17th to 19th centuries, is thought to have developed independently. Although, there is some debate over whether or not this was a fully formed system or just a series of mnemonic pictographs.

It is thought that the first [[consonantal alphabet]]ic writing appeared before 2000 BC, as a representation of language developed by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] tribes in the Sinai-peninsula (see [[History of the alphabet]]). Most other alphabets in the world today either descended from this one innovation, many via the [[Phoenician alphabet]], or were directly inspired by its design.

The first true alphabet is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]] which consistently represents [[vowel]]s since 800 BC.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True alphabet"&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]], a direct descendant, is by far the most common writing system in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several approaches have been taken to classify writing systems, the most common and basic one is a broad division into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'', and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely. The term ''complex system'' is sometimes used to describe those where the admixture makes classification problematic. Modern linguists regard such approaches, including Diringer's&lt;ref&gt;David Diringer (1962): ''Writing''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* pictographic script
* ideographic script
* analytic transitional script
* [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic script]]
* alphabetic script
as too simplistic, often considering the categories to be incomparable.
Hill&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hill (1967): ''The typology of Writing systems''. In: William A. Austin (ed.), Papers in Linguistics in Honor of Leon Dostert. The Hague, 92–99.&lt;/ref&gt; split ''writing'' into three major categories of linguistic analysis, one of which covers discourses and is not usually considered writing proper:
* ''discourse system''
** ''iconic discourse system'', e.g. [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]]
** ''conventional discourse system'', e.g. [[Quipu]]
* ''morphemic writing system'', e.g. [[Hieroglyph|Egyptian]], [[Cuneiform|Sumerian]], [[Maya writing|Maya]], [[Chinese character|Chinese]]
* ''phonemic writing system''
** ''partial phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Demotic script|Egyptian]], [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]]
** ''poly-phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Linear B]], [[Kana]], [[Cherokee script|Cherokee]]
** ''mono-phonemic writing system''
*** ''phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Ancient Greek]], [[English writing system|Old English]]
*** ''morpho-phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[German writing system|German]], [[English writing system|Modern English]]
Sampson draws a distinction between ''[[semasiography]]'' and ''glottography''
* semasiography, relating visible marks to meaning directly without reference to any specific spoken language
* glottography, using visible marks to represent forms of a spoken language
** logography, representing a spoken language by assigning distinctive visible marks to linguistic elements of André Martinet's "first articulation" (Martinet 1949), i.e. morphemes or words
** phonography, achieving the same goal by assigning marks to elements of the "second articulation", e.g. phonemes, syllables

* ''logographic'', e.g. [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Hieroglyph|Ancient Egyptian]]
* ''phonographic''
** ''syllabically linear''
*** ''syllabically coded'', e.g. [[Kana]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]

=== Logographic systems ===
{{main article|Logogram}}
[[File:日-oracle.svg|thumb|Early [[Chinese character]] for [[sun]] (''ri''), 1200 B.C]]
[[File:Character Ri4 Trad.svg|thumb|Modern Chinese character (''ri'') [[Radical 72|meaning "day" or "Sun"]]]]

A ''logogram'' is a single written character which represents a complete grammatical word. Most traditional [[Chinese character]]s are classified as logograms.

As each character represents a single word (or, more precisely, a [[morpheme]]), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, the ability to communicate across languages only works for the closely related [[varieties of Chinese]], as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] uses [[kanji|Chinese logograms]] extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic [[Chinese grammar]], though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.

While most languages do not use wholly logographic writing systems, many languages use some logograms. A good example of modern western logograms are the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]: everyone who uses those symbols understands what ''1'' means whether they call it ''one'', ''eins'', ''uno'', ''yi'', ''ichi'', ''ehad'', ''ena'', or ''jedan''. Other western logograms include the [[ampersand]] ''&amp;'', used for ''and'', the [[at sign]] ''@'', used in many contexts for ''at'', the [[percent sign]] ''%'' and the many signs representing units of currency ([[dollar sign|$]], [[Cent (currency)#Symbol|¢]], [[Euro sign|€]], [[Pound sign|£]], [[¥]] and so on.)

Logograms are sometimes called [[ideogram]]s, a word that refers to symbols which graphically represent abstract ideas, but linguists avoid this use, as Chinese characters are often [[semantics|semantic]]–[[phonetic]] compounds, symbols which include an element that represents the meaning and a [[phonetic complement]] element that represents the pronunciation. Some nonlinguists distinguish between [[lexigraphy]] and ideography, where symbols in lexigraphies represent words and symbols in ideographies represent words or morphemes.

The most important (and, to a degree, the only surviving) modern logographic writing system is the Chinese one, whose characters have been used with varying degrees of modification in [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and other [[east Asian languages]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian hieroglyphs and the Mayan writing system are also systems with certain logographic features, although they have marked phonetic features as well and are no longer in current use. Vietnamese speakers switched to the [[Vietnamese alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in the 20th century and the [[Hanja|use of Chinese characters in Korean]] is increasingly rare. The [[Japanese writing system]] includes several distinct forms of writing including logography.

=== Syllabic systems: syllabary ===
{{main article|Syllabary}}
[[File:Cherokee stop sign.png|thumb|[[Bilingual]] stop sign in English and the [[Cherokee syllabary]], [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]]]]

''Another type of writing system with systematic syllabic linear symbols, the [[abugida]]s, is discussed below as well.

As logographic writing systems use a single symbol for an entire word, a ''syllabary'' is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s, which make up [[word]]s. A symbol in a syllabary typically represents a [[consonant]] sound followed by a [[vowel]] sound, or just a vowel alone.

In a "true syllabary", there is no systematic graphic similarity between phonetically related characters (though some do have graphic similarity for the vowels). That is, the characters for {{IPA|/ke/}}, {{IPA|/ka/}} and {{IPA|/ko/}} have no similarity to indicate their common "k" sound (voiceless velar plosive). More recent creations such as the [[Cree syllabary]] embody a system of varying signs, which can best be seen when arranging the syllabogram set in an [[Syllable onset|onset]]–[[Syllable coda|coda]] or onset–[[Syllable rime|rime]] table.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. The [[English language]], on the other hand, allows complex syllable structures, with a relatively large inventory of [[vowel]]s and complex [[consonant cluster]]s, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. To write English using a syllabary, every possible syllable in English would have to have a separate symbol, and whereas the number of possible syllables in Japanese is around 100, in English there are approximately 15,000 to 16,000.

However, syllabaries with much larger inventories do exist. The [[Yi script]], for example, contains 756 different symbols (or 1,164, if symbols with a particular tone diacritic are counted as separate syllables, as in [[Unicode]]). The [[Chinese script]], when used to write [[Middle Chinese]] and the modern [[varieties of Chinese]], also represents syllables, and includes separate glyphs for nearly all of the many thousands of syllables in [[Middle Chinese]]; however, because it primarily represents [[morpheme]]s and includes different characters to represent homophonous morphemes with different meanings, it is normally considered a logographic script rather than a syllabary.

Other languages that use true syllabaries include [[Mycenae]]an [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[Linear B]]) and [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]] such as [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]. Several languages of the [[Ancient Near East]] used forms of [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]], which is a syllabary with some non-syllabic elements.

=== Segmental systems: Alphabets ===
{{main article|Alphabet}}

An ''alphabet'' is a small set of ''letters'' (basic written symbols), each of which roughly represents or represented historically a [[phoneme]] of a spoken [[language]]. The word ''alphabet'' is derived from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] and [[beta (letter)|beta]], the first two symbols of the [[Greek alphabet]].

The first type of alphabet that was developed was the [[abjad]]. An abjad is an alphabetic writing system where there is one symbol per consonant. Abjads differ from other alphabets in that they have characters only for [[consonant]]al sounds. Vowels are not usually marked in abjads.

All known abjads (except maybe [[Tifinagh]]) belong to the Semitic family of scripts, and derive from the original [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Northern Linear Abjad]]. The reason for this is that [[Semitic languages]] and the related [[Berber languages]] have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphemic structure]] which makes the denotation of [[vowel]]s redundant in most cases.

Some abjads, like Arabic and Hebrew, have markings for vowels as well. However, they use them only in special contexts, such as for teaching. Many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full alphabets. Of these, the most famous example is the derivation of the [[Greek alphabet]] from the Phoenician abjad. This has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non-Semitic language.

The term ''abjad'' takes its name from the old order of the [[Arabic alphabet]]'s [[consonant]]s 'alif, bā', jīm, dāl, though the word may have earlier roots in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] or [[Ugaritic]]. "Abjad" is still the word for alphabet in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Malay and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

[[File:Bible printed with Balinese script.jpg|thumb|A Bible printed with [[Balinese script]]]]
An [[abugida]] is an alphabetic writing system whose basic signs denote consonants with an [[inherent vowel]] and where consistent modifications of the basic sign indicate other following vowels than the inherent one.

Thus, in an abugida there may or may not be a sign for "k" with no vowel, but also one for "ka" (if "a" is the inherent vowel), and "ke" is written by modifying the "ka" sign in a way that is consistent with how one would modify "la" to get "le". In many abugidas the modification is the addition of a vowel sign, but other possibilities are imaginable (and used), such as rotation of the basic sign, addition of [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]] and so on.

The contrast with "true [[syllabary|syllabaries]]" is that the latter have one distinct symbol per possible syllable, and the signs for each syllable have no systematic graphic similarity. The graphic similarity of most abugidas comes from the fact that they are derived from abjads, and the consonants make up the symbols with the inherent vowel and the new vowel symbols are markings added on to the base symbol.

In the [[Ge'ez script]], for which the linguistic term ''abugida'' was named, the vowel modifications do not always appear systematic, although they originally were more so. [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] can be considered abugidas, although they are rarely thought of in those terms. The largest single group of abugidas is the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, however, which includes nearly all the scripts used in [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The name ''abugida'' is derived from the first four characters of an order of the Ge'ez script used in some contexts. It was borrowed from Ethiopian languages as a linguistic term by [[Peter T. Daniels]].

=== Featural systems ===
{{main article|Featural writing system}}
A ''featural'' script represents finer detail than an alphabet. Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] or its [[place of articulation]]. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is [[Korean language|Korean]] [[hangul]]. In hangul, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.

Many scholars, e.g. [[John DeFrancis]], reject this class or at least labeling hangul as such.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a "sophisticated [[grammatogeny]]".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These include [[stenography|stenographies]] and [[constructed script]]s of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as [[Tengwar]]), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub-character "features".&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |first=Beatrice |last=Primus |title=A featural analysis of the Modern Roman Alphabet |journal=Written Language and Literacy |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=235–274 |url=http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/IDSLI/dozentenseiten/artikel_primus/Primus_Featural_Analysis_2004.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambiguous systems ===

Most writing systems are not purely one type. The English writing system, for example, includes numerals and other logograms such as #, $, and &amp;, and the [[written language]] often does not match well with the spoken one. As mentioned above, all logographic systems have phonetic components as well, whether along the lines of a syllabary, such as Chinese ("logo-syllabic"), or an abjad, as in Egyptian ("logo-consonantal").

Some scripts, however, are truly ambiguous. The [[semi-syllabary|semi-syllabaries]] of ancient Spain were syllabic for [[plosive consonant|plosives]] such as ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', but alphabetic for other consonants. In some versions, vowels were written redundantly after syllabic letters, conforming to an alphabetic orthography. [[Old Persian cuneiform]] was similar. Of 23 consonants (including null), seven were fully syllabic, thirteen were purely alphabetic, and for the other three, there was one letter for /C''u''/ and another for both /C''a''/ and /C''i''/. However, all vowels were written overtly regardless; as in the Brahmic abugidas, the /C''a''/ letter was used for a bare consonant.

The [[zhuyin]] phonetic glossing script for Chinese divides syllables in two or three, but into [[syllable onset|onset]], [[Syllable medial|medial]], and [[syllable rime|rime]] rather than consonant and vowel. [[Pahawh Hmong]] is similar, but can be considered to divide syllables into either onset-rime or consonant-vowel (all consonant clusters and diphthongs are written with single letters); as the latter, it is equivalent to an abugida but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Other scripts are intermediate between the categories of alphabet, abjad and abugida, so there may be disagreement on how they should be classified.

== Graphic classification ==

Perhaps the primary graphic distinction made in classifications is that of ''linearity''. Linear writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Chinese character]]s. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a ball-point pen or a calligraphic brush, or cast in bronze. Similarly, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in [[bas-relief]]. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian script]] of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its [[cuneiform]] descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as [[braille]], are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.

[[Cuneiform]] was probably the earliest non-linear writing. Its glyphs were formed by pressing the end of a reed stylus into moist clay, not by tracing lines in the clay with the stylus as had been done previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cuneiform.neocities.org/CWT/CWT.html|title=Cuneiform Writing Techniques|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|website=cuneiform.neocities.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|date=2014|title=The Cuneiform Stylus|url=https://www.academia.edu/12047738/The_Cuneiform_Stylus|journal=Mesopotamia|language=en|volume=XLIX|pages=53-90|via=https://osf.io/dfng4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a radical transformation of the appearance of the script.

Braille is a non-linear adaptation of the Latin alphabet that completely abandoned the Latin forms. The letters are composed of raised bumps on the writing [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]], which can be leather ([[Louis Braille]]'s original material), stiff paper, plastic or metal.

There are also transient non-linear adaptations of the Latin alphabet, including [[Morse code]], the [[manual alphabet]]s of various [[sign language]]s, and semaphore, in which [[Flag semaphore|flags]] or [[Semaphore line|bars]] are positioned at prescribed angles. However, if "writing" is defined as a potentially permanent means of recording information, then these systems do not qualify as writing at all, since the symbols disappear as soon as they are used. (Instead, these transient systems serve as [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signals]].)

== Directionality ==
[[File:Writing directions of the world.svg|thumb|Overview of the writing directions used in the world]]
{{see also|Right-to-left|Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|Bi-directional text|Mirror writing}}

Scripts are also graphically characterized by the direction in which they are written. Egyptian hieroglyphs were written either left to right or right to left, with the animal and human glyphs turned to face the beginning of the line. The early alphabet could be written in multiple directions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Threatte, Leslie |title=The grammar of Attic inscriptions |publisher=W. de Gruyter |year=1980 |pages=54–55 |isbn=3-11-007344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; horizontally (side to side), or vertically (up or down). Prior to standardization, alphabetical writing was done both left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextrally) and right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistrally). It was most commonly written [[boustrophedon]]ically: starting in one (horizontal) direction, then turning at the end of the line and reversing direction.

The [[Greek alphabet]] and its successors settled on a left-to-right pattern, from the top to the bottom of the page. Other scripts, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate [[Chinese characters]] have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right to the left of the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to [[Western culture|Western]] influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the [[Latin script]], and technical limitations in popular [[electronic document]] formats. Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counter-clockwise]] to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], such as [[Hanunó'o script|Hanunó'o]], are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right; however, [[Kulitan script|Kulitan]], another Philippine script, is written top to bottom and right to left. [[Ogham]] is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.

== On computers ==

In computers and telecommunication systems, writing systems are generally not codified as such,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} but graphemes and other grapheme-like units that are required for text processing are represented by "[[character (computing)|characters]]" that typically manifest in [[character encoding|encoded]] form. There are many [[:Category:Character encoding|character encoding standards and related technologies]], such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] (a character repertoire and encoding scheme oriented toward the Latin script), [[CJK characters|CJK]] (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and [[bi-directional text]]. Today, many such standards are re-defined in a collective standard, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 10646 "[[Universal Character Set]]", and a parallel, closely related expanded work, ''The Unicode Standard''. Both are generally encompassed by the term [[Unicode]]. In Unicode, each character, in every language's writing system, is (simplifying slightly) given a unique identification number, known as its ''code point''. Computer [[operating system]]s use code points to look up characters in the [[Typeface|font]] file, so the characters can be displayed on the page or screen.

A [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] is the device most commonly used for writing via computer. Each key is associated with a standard code which the keyboard sends to the computer when it is pressed. By using a combination of alphabetic keys with [[modifier key]]s such as [[Control key|Ctrl]], [[Alt key|Alt]], [[Shift key|Shift]] and [[AltGr key|AltGr]],&lt;!-- this is not meant to be an exhaustive list! --&gt; various character codes are generated and sent to the [[CPU]]. The [[operating system]] intercepts and converts those signals to the appropriate characters based on the [[keyboard layout]] and [[Input method editor|input method]], and then delivers those converted codes and characters to the running [[application software]], which in turn looks up the appropriate [[glyph]] in the currently used font file, and requests the operating system to draw these on the [[Computer display|screen]].
