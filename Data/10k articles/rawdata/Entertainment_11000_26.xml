Its plot involves air traffic controller Dylan Branson, who, thanks to a mysterious outbreak at 2:22, prevented the collision of two aircraft and met Sarah, with whom he opened the cruel mystery of the crossing of destinies. The film was released in theaters and on [[Video-on-demand|VOD]] on June 30, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Af2N3N5rURI|title= 2:22 Trailer #1 (2017)|date=May 5, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film starts with Dylan Branson (Michiel Huisman) having a dream about a murder at the [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] that feels very real. He wakes with a start and progresses with his routine while watching news about a star called Hamlin that died out 30 years ago, but its light is reaching the Earth 30 years later and that this [[supernova]] will have effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. Dylan is an [[air traffic controller]] who possess a unique ability to visualize patterns.

Dylan is then shown on his way to work, riding a bike and heading to the Grand Central Station to take the train. He works as air traffic controller with a serious talent in visualizing patterns. After work, he goes to a club drinking with his co workers and receives a ticket to an aerial ballet as a gift for his upcoming birthday. The following day at exactly 2:22pm, his world stops after he almost causes a mid air collision of the two aircraft as he was actually attempting to avoid the mid-air collision, resulting in him being suspended from his job for nearly killing over 900 people.

The day after he was suspended, he attends the aerial ballet and meets Sarah (Teresa Palmer). They go to a restaurant and start talking, Dylan tells Sarah that his father was a pilot and that he also trained to be a pilot but could never become one as he was afraid of flying. Sarah tells him that she works at the Howard Pace Art Gallery. He also tells her about his being suspended from work, and he finds out that Sarah was on the plane that almost collided with the other aircraft at 2.22pm. Dylan felt apologetic about the incident but Sarah was instead thankful towards Dylan for saving her life. As they depart, they admit to each other that for a "first date" they felt a deep connection and it felt like they had known each other forever.

The following day, while on the way to the Grand Central, Dylan notices the same happenings (siren, a woman laughing, construction sounds, "Can I help you with", glass breaking) and at 2:21pm, he hears the announcement of the boarding of the [[Millhurst, New Jersey|Millhurst]] express, sees a business man reading his newspaper, a couple hugging each other, a line of preschoolers where the last child in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clock. At exactly 2:22pm, the window of the station shatters. He goes to meet Sarah and asks her out to an early dinner, going to the [[Central Park]] with her. Sarah tells Dylan that she was a ballet dancer student before she landed awkwardly and tore two of her knee ligaments. Cheering her up, Dylan creates an improvised speaker using a paper cup and ice cream cone holder, lifting Sarah's mood, then dancing and kissing. They go to Dylan's apartment and make love. The next morning, Dylan asks Sarah where she got her necklace from, to which Sarah replies that it was from her ex-boyfriend; Jonas (Sam Reid) who happens to be the main artist of the gallery at which she works. Dylan asks when is Sarah's birthday and they find out that both of them were born on the same day; April 18, 1986 and they are both turning 30 within a week's time. Dylan suddenly hears a car crash on the road below his apartment at exactly 9:15am, and he tells Sarah that it was 3rd day in a row that the same incident had happened.

Dylan takes a cab with a reckless driver going to Grand Central. As the driver takes the shorter route, Dylan tells him to stop the cab and notices again the same pattern of siren, a woman laugh, construction sounds, and a man saying "Can I help you with". Dylan then shouts for the cab to stop and this infuriates the cab driver, who turns around to tell Dylan off for shouting at him. Just then, another car hits them both, causing the breaking of the cab's glass windows. Even though Dylan is injured, he goes to the Grand Central Station and sees the exact same pattern of events. He tells Sarah of these repeating patterns, but with different people carrying out the same actions. Sarah does not believe Dylan, but helps to clean his wounds from the car accident. Dylan goes home and starts writing all the events of his day starting from 9.10am (water drop, a bug dying, a plane flying overhead etc) and realizes that everything has a pattern thats repeating itself.

Dylan goes to the gallery looking for Sarah, and realises that the gallery was having an exhibition with Jonas' art piece as the main exhibition. Jonas has created a light [[Holography|hologram]] exhibition about the Grand Central Station, and Dylan sees that it is exactly like the events that he has experienced the past few days (announcement of the boarding of Millhurst Express, a business man reading his newspaper, a couple embracing each other, a line of preschoolers where the last one in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clocks). Dylan assumes that Jonas is stalking him as only Dylan knows about these events. He attacks Jonas, resulting in a brawl and questions Jonas on whether he was stalking him. In the audience is the owner of the Keifer Gallery and he applauds saying it was a great idea to enact the murder at the Grand Central Station that happened 30 years ago and that he has an exhibit related to it at his gallery. Sarah apologises to Jonas about Dylan's attack and puts her relationship with Dylan on hold.

Later that night, Dylan texts Sarah to beg for her forgiveness. In the mean time, he finds a stack of envelopes hidden in his home. He finds out a man named Jake Redman (Duncan Ragg) had written these letters to a woman named Evelyn. Upon investigation, Dylan finds out that Jake was a criminal, although he was never convicted for his crimes as the police could not find enough evidence to pin him down, while Evelyn was a singer, and they both were lovers. Dylan also finds an article online stating that Jack had shot Evelyn and another policeman, Noah (Jack Ellis), down in the Grand Central Station in a fit of jealous rage before being gunned down by other policemen on 18 April 1986, which was the day both Dylan and Sarah were born.

Dylan then visits Evelyn's sister, and she gives Dylan a stack of letters that Jack wrote to Evelyn as she could never bear to read them and shows him the necklace she is wearing saying that it was all she needs to remember her. The necklace is identical to the one that Dylan had seen Sarah wear. She also tells him that Noah; the policeman was taking Evelyn to [[Millhurst, New Jersey|Millhurst]] to keep her safe from Jake and that it seemed that he was also in love with Evelyn. Noah goes to the Grand Central Station to buy a ticket for the Millhurst Express, but is told that the service was terminated 30 years ago and now the train is known as the [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] Express. At exactly 2:22pm the chandelier crashes to the floor.

Dylan connects the dots and realises that Dylan was Jake in his past life, while Sarah was Evelyn, and that he would kill her at Grand Central Station on their birthday, 18 April at 2.22pm. He realises that the pattern of events that has been happening was leading up to the day they both would die. He tells Sarah this and she does not believe him. As she tries to calm Dylan down, Dylan insists that they both should break up as he would soon kill Sarah, which he does not want to as he knows that they are soulmates.

Dylan contemplates suicide, which was unsuccessful, while a distraught Sarah looks for Jonas in his apartment. Jonas offers to bring Sarah to Millhurst to help her feel better about the breakup. The next day, both Jonas and Sarah's flight to Millhurst gets canceled and they have to go to Grand Central Station to take a train there. Meanwhile, Dylan looks for Sarah and in the midst of it, he breaks into Jonas' apartment and sees that Jonas recognises Sarah as Evelyn in his past life and that he was Noah. Dylan figures out that Jonas/Noah is obsessed with Sarah/Evelyn and that Jonas/Noah had a gun with him and races to the Grand Central Station to see her. On his way he attracts the attention of the police and leads them there.

At the Grand Central Station, Sarah realises that the patterns Dylan saw were true and she tries to leave but is stopped by a crazed Jonas calling her Evelyn. He wants Sarah to admit that she loves him, while Sarah refuses just as Dylan arrives at the Station. Jonas thinking that Sarah called him there gets enraged and makes his way towards Dylan with a gun while Sarah sees the events unfold as Dylan had described them to her, and realizes that she is the pregnant woman standing under the clock. Jonas first points his gun towards Dylan and then Sarah saying that "she'll never be yours" intending to kill her so that if he couldn't have her neither could Dylan but Dylan shields Sarah just in time but himself gets shot at 2:21pm.

The events from 30 years ago plays out with Jake/Dylan protecting Sarah/Evelyn from Noah/Jonas and at exactly 2:22pm. Jonas gets shot by the police who have followed Dylan there. Dylan also falls in Evelyn's arms and momentarily closes his eyes having visions of Jake and Evelyn being affectionate. He does not die and Sarah then looks at the clock, saying it was 2.23pm and they managed to survive. Turns out that the Jake was framed for murdering Noah and Evelyn as the police had wanted to save the reputation of Noah since he was a police detective and one of them. Also the dying star; Hamlin mentioned at the start of the movie finally disappears but a new star is immediately reborn.

In the ending scene, it is shown that Dylan and Sarah are living happily, with Dylan having finally overcome his fear of flying and is now a pilot and Sarah smiling affectionately at their baby in the cradle.

'''''Becoming Batman: The Possibility of a Superhero'''''  is a 2008 science book by [[neuroscience]] professor [[E. Paul Zehr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becoming Batman May Not Be As Crazy As It Sounds|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/07/19/becoming-batman-may-not-be-as-crazy-as-it-sounds|publisher=US News|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first published on November 7, 2008 through [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] and covers how much an ordinary person would need to train and adapt to become [[Batman]]. ''Becoming Batman'' is unique in its explicit analysis of whether or not it is actually possible for a human being to achieve Batman status through training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Knight Shift: Why Batman Could Exist--But Not for Long|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-knight-shift-why-bat/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the book Zehr goes over the amount of physical training that would be necessary for someone to become Batman. Zehr draws upon his knowledge as a neuroscientist, kinesiologist, and martial artist to do this, and covers topics such as what it would be like to fight in a superhero uniform as well as what a person's daily dietary requirements would be. ''Becoming Batman'' is unique in its explicit analysis of whether or not it is actually possible for a human being to achieve Batman status through training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Could A Mere Mortal Really Be Batman?|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92621075|publisher=NPR|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Guardian'' gave a mostly positive review for ''Becoming Batman'', remarking that Zehr's "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poole|first=Steven|title=Becoming Batman (review)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/18/becoming-batman-e-paul-zehr|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; grasp of Chinese martial arts is somewhat loose, but the physiological material is fascinating and well explained." ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' also gave a positive review, remarking that the book would have an obvious appeal to fans of Batman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becoming Batman (review)|url=http://new.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8018-9063-5|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broader Impact==
Zehr’s work has also had a reciprocal impact on the way the comics are viewed and even written, providing reference material regarding the “physical reality of Batman” as recognized by Scottish ''[[Batman, Incorporated]]'' writer Grant Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Morrison Discusses 'Batman Inc,' Lord Death Man, and the Alan Moore Interview |url=http://comicsalliance.com/grant-morrison-interview-batman-inc-alan-moore/ |publisher=Comics Alliance |accessdate=14 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727113337/http://comicsalliance.com/grant-morrison-interview-batman-inc-alan-moore/ |archivedate=27 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, because of ''Becoming Batman'', media articles discussing Batman and the DC Universe have included commentary by Zehr as a relevant authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What a Hero: Batman's in Great Nick for a 75-Year-Old|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/what-a-hero-batman-s-in-great-nick-for-a-75-year-old-1.1792405|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or referred to ideas from his book, weaving his scientific perspective into the Batman conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batman: From Midnight Monster to Pop-Tacular Star.

==Gameplay==
Like the previous games from Amanita Design, in ''Botanicula'' the player controls a protagonist (or multiple protagonists) while exploring the environment, solving puzzles and collecting items that are required for the obstacles that come in their way. The player is able to interact with other creatures and find easter eggs that are present in the lush environment. Like ''[[Machinarium]]'', the game has no spoken or written dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/12/06/hands-on-botanicula/|title=Hands On: Botanicula |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brass Eye''''' is a British television comedy series [[parody]]ing the [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] news programming. A series of six episodes aired on [[Channel 4]] in 1997, and a further episode in 2001. The series was created and presented by [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], written by Morris, [[David Quantick]], [[Peter Baynham]], [[Jane Bussmann]], [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]], [[Graham Linehan]] and [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by [[Michael Cumming]].

== Overview ==
Originally planned as a spin-off from ''[[The Day Today]]'' (1994), the pilot (then called ''Torque tv™'') was passed on by the BBC. Channel 4 commissioned a new pilot, which would become called ''Brass Eye'' (mixing together the titles of two popular current affairs shows, ''[[Brass_Tacks_(BBC_TV_series)|Brass Tacks]]'' and ''Public Eye'').{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

The series satirised media portrayal of social ills, in particular [[sensationalism]], unsubstantiated establishmentarian theory masquerading as fact, and creation of [[moral panic]]s, and is a sequel to Morris's earlier spoof news programmes ''[[On the Hour]]'' (1991–92) and ''[[The Day Today]]'' (1994). The series stars Morris's ''The Day Today'' colleague [[Doon Mackichan]], along with [[Gina McKee]], [[Mark Heap]], [[Amelia Bullmore]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Julia Davis]], [[Claire Skinner]], [[John Guerrasio]], [[Hugh Dennis]] and [[Kevin Eldon]].

=== Original series (1997) ===

; "Drugs"
;{{Long plot|date=July 2018}}

The second episode, "Drugs", has been described by professor Michael Gossop as illustrative of the ease in which anti-drug hysteria can be evoked in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Gossop&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gossop|first1=Michael|title=Living with drugs|date=28 April 2013|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=9781472400079|page=21|edition=Seventh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCa6f85k9SoC&amp;pg=PT21|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening scene of this episode, a voiceover tells viewers that there are so many drugs on the streets of Britain that "not even the dealers know them all". An undercover reporter (Morris) asks a purportedly real-life [[drug dealer]] in London for various fictitious drugs, including "Triple-sod", "Yellow Bentines" and "Clarky Cat", leaving the dealer puzzled and increasingly irritated until he tells the reporter to leave. He also explains that possession of drugs without physical contact and the exchange of [[drugs]] through a [[mandrill]] are perfectly legal in English law.

One drug mentioned was a fictitious drug called "Cake", described as being from [[Czechoslovakia]], despite the country no longer existing when the episode was screened. The drug purportedly affected an area of the brain called "Shatner's Bassoon" (altering the user's perception of time), while also giving them a bloated neck due to "massive water retention", a "Czech neck", and was frequently referred to as "a made-up drug" during the show.&lt;ref name=Gossop /&gt; Other celebrities such as [[Bernard Ingham|Sir Bernard Ingham]], [[Noel Edmonds]], and [[Rolf Harris]] were shown holding the bright-yellow cake-sized pill as they talked, with [[Bernard Manning]] telling viewers a fictitious story about how one girl threw up her own pelvis&lt;ref name=Gossop/&gt; and describing how "One kiddy on Cake cried all the water out of his body. Just imagine how his mother felt. It's a fucking disgrace".

[[David Amess]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)|Basildon]], was fooled into filming an elaborate video warning against the dangers of this drug,&lt;ref name=Gossop /&gt; and went as far as to ask a question about "Cake" in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|the UK Parliament]], alongside real substances [[khat]] and [[gamma-hydroxybutyric acid]]. In response, the [[Home Office]] minister incorrectly identified the fictitious drug "Cake" as a [[pseudonym]] for the [[hallucinogenic]] drug [[methylenedioxybenzylamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=((Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster)) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960723/text/60723w10.htm#60723w10.html_sbhd8 |title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 23 Jul 1996 (pt 10) |publisher=www.publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

; "Sex"

In one scene of the "Sex" episode, Morris posed as a talk show host who took a starkly discriminatory attitude in favour of those with "Good [[AIDS]]" (e.g. from a contaminated [[blood transfusion]]) over those with "Bad AIDS" (caught through sexual activity or drug abuse).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== "Paedogeddon!" special (2001) ===
A special one-off edition of the show aired four years after the series had ended. Originally scheduled to broadcast on 5 July 2001, it was delayed as Channel 4 were unhappy with the timing in connection to the disappearances of 15-year-old [[Murder of Danielle Jones|Danielle Jones]] in June and 11-year-old Bunmi Shagaya in early July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cozens|first1=Claire|title=C4 pulls Brass Eye special|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/05/channel4.broadcasting1|website=|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 July 2001|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually aired on Thursday 26 July 2001, and was repeated on Friday 27 July 2001.&lt;ref name="ferguson-20010805"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/05/news.film|title=Why Chris Morris had to make Brass Eye|first=Euan|last=Ferguson|date=5 August 2001|accessdate=18 September 2018|quote=broadcast by Channel 4 on &lt;time datetime="2001-07-26" title="26 July 2001"&gt;26 July&lt;/time&gt; and repeated &lt;time datetime="2001-07-27" title="27 July 2001"&gt;the next night&lt;/time&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It tackled [[pedophilia|paedophilia]] and the [[moral panic]] in parts of the British media following the [[murder of Sarah Payne]], focusing on the [[name and shame|name-and-shame campaign]] conducted by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in its wake.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This included an incident in 2000 in which a [[paediatrics|paediatrician]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] had the word "PAEDO" daubed in yellow paint on her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/901723.stm|title=Paediatrician attacks 'ignorant' vandals|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=30 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''News of the World'''s then Editor [[Rebekah Brooks]] would years later discuss this campaign at the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= McNally, Paul|url=https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/rebekah-brooks-anti-paedophile-campaign-could-have-been-done-better-/s2/a549197/|title=Rebekah Brooks: Anti-paedophile campaign 'could have been done better'|work=Journalism.co.uk|date=11 May 2012|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate the media's knee-jerk reaction to the subject, various celebrities were duped into presenting fatuous and often ridiculous pieces to camera in the name of a campaign against paedophiles. [[Gary Lineker]] and [[Phil Collins]] endorsed a spoof charity, Nonce Sense, (pronounced "nonsense"—"nonce" being British slang for people convicted or suspected of molestation or sexual crimes), with Collins saying, "I'm talking Nonce Sense!" ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' presenter [[Philippa Forrester]] and [[ITN]] reporter [[Nicholas Owen (journalist)|Nicholas Owen]] were shown explaining the details of fictional "Hidden Online Entrapment Control System", or HOECS (pronounced "[[hoax]]") computer games, which online paedophiles were using to abuse children via the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1792738.stm|title=MPs' Brass Eye complaints rejected|work=BBC News Online|date=31 January 2002|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Neil Fox (media personality)|Neil "Doctor" Fox]] told viewers that "paedophiles have more genes in common with crabs than they do with you and me", adding "Now that is scientific fact—there's no real evidence for it—but it ''is'' scientific fact". At one point, bogus CCTV footage was shown of a paedophile attempting to seduce children by stalking the streets while disguised as a school.

Lineker described paedophile text slang, stating that "[[Baltimora|BALTIMORA]]" translates to "literally, I'm running at them now with my trousers down". Labour MP [[Syd Rapson]] related that paedophiles were using "an area of internet the size of Ireland". [[Richard Blackwood]] stated that internet paedophiles could make [[computer keyboard]]s emit noxious fumes to subdue children, subsequently sniffing a keyboard and claiming that he could smell the fumes, which made him feel "suggestible". Blackwood also warned watching parents that exposure to the fumes would make their children "smell like hammers".  Other notable figures appearing as themselves were [[Sebastian Coe]], [[Michael Hames]], [[Andy McNab]], [[Kate Thornton]], [[Barbara Follett (politician)|Barbara Follett]] MP and [[Gerald Howarth]] MP.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Morris reported that convicted child murderer [[Sidney Cooke]] had been sent into space to keep him away from children. Prior to the launch, an eight-year-old boy had been placed on board the spaceship with Cooke by mistake.&lt;ref name="McCartney"&gt;McCartney, Jenny, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335714/Are-there-no-limits.html "Are there no limits?"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coward|first=Ros|authorlink=Rosalind Coward|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/jul/31/childrensservices.comment1|title=It had no place on TV|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the programme, the studio was "invaded" by a fictional militant [[pro-paedophile activism]] organisation called "Milit-pede", and the programme appeared to suffer a short technical disturbance. When it returned, presenter Chris Morris confronted a spokesman, Gerard Chote (played by [[Simon Pegg]]), who had been placed in a [[pillory]], asking if he wanted sex with Morris's six-year-old son (actually a child actor).&lt;ref name="McCartney"/&gt; Hesitantly, the spokesman refused, apologetically explaining "I don't fancy him".

The episode won a [[Broadcast (magazine)|''Broadcast'' magazine]] award in 2002.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== ''Oxide Ghosts: The Brass Eye Tapes'' (2017) ===

In 2017, series director [[Michael Cumming]] released a 60-minute film of unbroadcast material from the making of Brass Eye between 1995 and 1997. The film is intended to mark the 20th anniversary of the series's original broadcast and includes scenes previously edited from the series due to time constraints or legal difficulties.&lt;ref name="Observer 22 October 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Thorpe |first= Vanessa | authorlink= |title= Twenty years on … how comedy genius Chris Morris invented 'fake news' |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/21/brass-eye-20-years-anniversary-chris-morris| date= 22 October 2017|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate=22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes extended or alternative versions of scenes that made the final cut, together with humorous [[outtake]]s of several scenes. Cumming also narrates the film and details his first meeting with Chris Morris and the difficulties involved in making the series. Comedy website [[Chortle]] described the film as "a thoughtful, curiously touching time capsule which pays fulsome tribute to, and certainly never cheapens, the spirit of the original show".&lt;ref name=Cumming&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcumming.co.uk/latest_news.html|title=Oxide Ghosts: The Brass Eye Tapes|date=Summer 2017|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chortle2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxide Ghosts: The Brass Eye Tapes|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/features/2017/05/10/36459/oxide_ghosts%3A_the_brass_eye_tapes|website=|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film premiered at the Pilot Light TV festival in May 2017 and toured to perform at selected UK cinemas throughout 2017.&lt;ref name=Cumming/&gt; Each performance was followed by a Q&amp;A with the director.
Cumming has indicated that the film will only be viewable at such public events and will never be broadcast, made available on the internet, or commercially released, due to legal and rights issues.&lt;ref name=Chortle2017 /&gt; He has also praised the positive experience of travelling to a cinema to enjoy an exclusive film and implored cinema-goers not to film or share excerpts from the performance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Broadcast and DVD release ==

The series was repeated in 2001 to tie in with the paedophilia special (see below), and released on DVD in a revised form. This new version reinstated most of the material cut from the original, although a few items were removed, most notably the subliminal message (see below) and an interview with [[Graham Bright]] MP in the "Drugs" episode. A disclaimer was also added to the "Drugs" episode at the request of David Amess.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Controversy ==

=== Myra Hindley ===

The screening of the 1997 series was postponed for nearly six months as it made comic reference to murderer [[Myra Hindley]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} who was back in the news at the time after her portrait was vandalised in the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sensation sparks New York storm|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/455902.stm|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=BBC News|date=23 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a particularly infamous portrayal, Hindley was the topic of a farcical song by a fictitious indie band called Blouse (whose appearance and style closely resembled that of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]). The lyrics to part of the song read: "Every time I see your picture, Myra/I have to phone my latest girlfriend up and fire her/And find a prostitute who looks like you and hire her/Oh, me oh Myra." The "leader singer" of Blouse, Purves Grundy (who resembles Pulp's [[Jarvis Cocker]]), is then shown commenting on the song; "Myra is a very complex woman, you know, and this song is about her hair. I don't think there's a single reference in the song to her brain, which I think maybe, had a slight problem. I do think [if] someone's gone and bought this record just because of the fuss that's been made about it, I think they should throw it away. And then they should go and buy another copy, because they liked the song."{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Michael Grade ===

[[Michael Grade]], then chief executive of [[Channel 4]], repeatedly intervened to demand edits to episodes of ''Brass Eye''.&lt;ref name=Guardian1 /&gt; The final episode included a single-frame [[subliminal message]] reading "Grade is a cunt".&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2009/apr/23/michaelgrade-itv|title=In pictures: Michael Grade's highs and lows|work=The Guardian|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=23 April 2009|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the 25th anniversary of Channel 4, this sequence was shown again, twice, including a freeze frame for anyone who did not catch it originally. When Grade was interviewed on this he pointed out that subliminal messages are illegal under British law.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== "Paedogeddon!" ===

There was also a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] campaign against Morris, who refused to discuss the issue. The ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' decried Morris and the show, and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ran a headline describing ''Brass Eye'' as "Unspeakably Sick" (quoting Beverley Hughes). ''[[The Observer]]'' accused both papers of hypocrisy; it noted that the ''Star'' article was positioned adjacent to an article about developing bust of 15-year-old singer [[Charlotte Church]], and that the ''Mail''{{'}}s coverage was preceded by "close-ups" of the "[[bikini]] princesses" [[Princess Beatrice of York|Beatrice]] and [[Princess Eugenie of York|Eugenie]], who were 13 and 11 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010806141503/http://chilled.cream.org/graphics/charlotte.jpg|archivedate=6 August 2001|url=http://chilled.cream.org/graphics/charlotte.jpg|title=Perv Spoof Bosses Axe Wrestling|format=copy of article from the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]''|year=2001|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/screen/story/0,6903,532307,00.html|title=Why Chris Morris had to make Brass Eye|first=Euan|last=Ferguson|work=[[The Observer]]|date=5 August 2001|accessdate=17 July 2012|quote=Mail … (headed 'Unspeakably sick', the words of one of the Ministers who hadn't watched it) was preceded by close-ups of Princesses Beatrice (13) and Eugenie (11) in their bikinis; in the Star, beside a shock-horror-sicko Morris story, sat a picture of singer Charlotte Church in a tight top ('She's a big girl now … chest swell!').

''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' columnist [[Rosalind Coward|Ros Coward]] wrote at the end of July 2001: "What's so dishonest about Channel 4's defence of ''Brass Eye'' as a satire of media forms is the implication that they (and the liberal left in general) have a better truth than the tabloids. They don't. ... [I]t suggests concern about sex abuse is exaggerated and that victims' shame and humiliation doesn't matter. That's why there were so many complaints."&lt;ref name="Coward"/&gt;

The '''Bud Light Daredevils''' were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998.  The show combined gymnastics, trampoline, acrobatics, and basketball.  The team was started by [[University of Mississippi]] cheerleaders [[Ty Cobb (cheerleader)|Ty Cobb]], Sam Martin, Robert Kirby, Tyler Hubbard, John White, and Ty Cobb's younger brother [[Guy Cobb]].

==Ole Miss and the Inception of Acrobatic Basketball (1979–83)==
[[File:Ole Miss Cheerleaders at Houston Rockets.jpg|thumb|Ole Miss cheerleaders (including [[Colonel Reb]]) performing as the halftime entertainment during a Houston Rockets game]]
In 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as [[Ole Miss Rebels]] mascot [[Colonel Reb]]) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic "flip dunk" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games.

In 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini-trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games.

With the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called "The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the "Ole Miss Cheerleaders" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in 1980, followed by shows for the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]].

Still in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother [[Guy Cobb]] joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the "flip-pass" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk ("Congo Dunk" 1987).

==The Dixie Daredevils (1983–84)==
[[File:The Dixie Daredevils.jpg|thumb|left|Brothers Ty and [[Guy Cobb]] performing with Steve Cliffe as "The Dixie Daredevils" in a grocery store parking lot (Summer 1983).]]
Following his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13]

In 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of "Dixie Daredevils". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14]

In the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14]

During the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and [[Guy Cobb]] performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called "Budweiser Light".[2]
{{-}}

==The Bud Light Daredevils (1984–1998)==
[[File:Guy Cobb Bud Light Daredevils.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guy Cobb]] performing with the Bud Light Daredevils in 1987.]] 
Both Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer "Budweiser Light" to "Bud Light". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15]

From 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10]

Anheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18]

A '''count room''' or '''counting room''' is a room that is designed and equipped for the purpose of counting large volumes of [[currency]]. Count rooms are operated by [[central bank]]s and [[casino]]s, as well as some large [[bank]]s and armored car companies that transport currency.

A count room may be divided into two separate areas, one for counting [[banknote]]s (sometimes referred to as [[soft count]]) and one for counting [[coin]]s (sometimes referred to as [[hard count]]). Some high-volume cash businesses, especially casinos, will operate two distinct rooms.

==Surveillance==
Most count rooms are equipped with [[closed-circuit television camera]]s and sometimes [[sound recording]] equipment to assist in detecting theft, fraud, or collusion among the count room personnel.

J. Lloyd Eaton was a [[pulmonologist]] specializing in the treatment of [[tuberculosis]]. While still in high school he collected science fiction and fantasy pulp literature. By the 1940s he communicated with book dealers in London and New York to acquire more books, expanding to the detective and western genres at a time when science fiction was an obscure interest. Eaton had particular interest in stories of ''future war'' or ''lost race'' from before the 1920s by authors such as [[John Polidori]], [[Frank Aubrey]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]].{{sfn|Dickinson|1986|pp=102-103}} Eaton was also the first president of the [[Elves, Leprechauns, Gnomes, and Little Men's Chowder &amp; Marching Society|Elves, Gnomes, and Little Men's Science Fiction, Chowder, and Marching Society]], and served as the editor of the group's [[sercon]] [[Science fiction fanzine|fanzine]], ''The Rhodomagnetic Digest''.{{sfn|Swigart|2005|p=15}} When Eaton's family sought a home for his collection, science fiction was considered an inferior literary product—pleasant enough as a diversion, but unworthy of serious academic study. As even public libraries did not regularly acquire science fiction, there was no comprehensive collection available anywhere outside of private hands.

==History of the collection==
Dr. Eaton's collection, acquired by UCR's University Librarian Donald Wilson in 1969, consisted of about 7,500 hardback editions of science fiction, fantasy, and horror from the late nineteenth century to 1955.{{Sfn|Swigart|2005|pp=1,11}} The development of the collection continued under University Librarian Eleanor Montague, who created the position of Eaton Curator, hiring for the position [[George Slusser]], a Harvard-trained literary scholar. When Hal W. Hall catalogued the growing Eaton Collection in 1975 for his then-upcoming ''Anatomy of Wonder'' bibliography, he determined the collection consisted of "over 8,500 volumes, and is particularly rich in early and scare items published from 1870 to 1930, along with some important eighteenth-century titles."{{sfn|Swigart|2005|p=19}}

During Slusser's 25-year curatorship, the Eaton collection grew to more than 100,000 volumes, ranging from the 1517 edition of [[Thomas More|Thomas More's]] ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rare Edition of "Utopia" Donated to the Eaton Collection|journal=[[Science Fiction Studies]]|volume=30|issue=2|date=July 2003|p=349|publisher=[[SF-TH Inc]]|jstor=4241194}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the most recently published titles. The collection includes first editions of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[The Time Machine]]'', [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', [[Fantastic Four]] #1, and [[Action Comics 1|Action Comics #1]].{{sfn|Ogles|2006}}{{sfn|Nashak|2013}} Foreign works of science fiction have been added systematically, including works in Chinese, Czech, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.{{sfn|Swigart|2005|p=11}} The collection also includes journals, comic books, and fanzines, primarily acquired as donations from collectors [[Terry Carr]], [[Bruce Pelz]], [[Fred Patten]], and Rick Sneary.&lt;ref name="Legion"/&gt; Some of the extensive texts maintained by the collection were used in the 1970s by Arno Press for reprints of ''Supernatural and Occult Fiction'' and ''Lost Race and Adult Fantasy Fiction''.{{sfn|Slusser|2013|p=27}}

In recent years, films, videos, DVDs, scripts and storyboards from TV series including ''[[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|Alien Nation]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', and other illustrated narratives have been added, most of which were donated. The archival holdings comprise the papers of leading science fiction and fantasy authors, including [[Gregory Benford]], [[David Brin]], [[F. M. Busby]], [[Michael Cassutt]], [[Robert L. Forward]], [[Anne McCaffrey]], [[William Rotsler]], [[James White (author)|James White]], and [[Colin Wilson]].{{sfn|Nashak|2013}} From 1986-1991, one of Slusser's students, author [[Daryl F. Mallett]] was instrumental in reaching out to authors and fans and asking if they would donate their archives, as well as starting a duplicate-asset trading program with the University of Michigan, which provided the Eaton Collection with its massive comic book collection.

From 1988 to 1990, the Collection published three issues of ''J. Lloyd Eaton Collection Newsletter'' "designed to alert scholars of new acquisitions and happenings in the Eaton Collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|magazine=J. Lloyd Eaton Collection Newsletter|title=J. Lloyd Eaton Collection Newsletter|publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]]|date=Summer 1988|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Swigart|2005|p=26}}

In 2014, George Slusser was asked how he assembled the world's largest SF collection: "By silence, exile and cunning", he replied. "And I did have allies in the library, who found funds to buy books, even when academics sought to block purchases. Librarians love books, and SF had a lot of them, with interesting covers and formats."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/benford20140810 An Interview with: Professor George Slusser – Eaton science fiction collection’s Curator Emeritus] by [[Gregory Benford]], August 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eaton SF conference==
[[File:Greg Benford Eaton 2008-05-17.png|thumb|upright|Greg Benford, Eaton SF Conference, 2008-05-17]]As part of its scholarly mission, the Eaton Collection hosts the Eaton Science Fiction Conference, which is biennial in odd-number years from 2009.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; It was inaugurated in 1979&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; as the J. Lloyd Eaton Science Conference, annual for many years, including some at other sites. As of 2013, some 21 conferences have been held at UC Riverside, while others have taken place at international venues, co-sponsored by UCR and various host institutions: London Polytechnic University,1984; the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle|Sorbonne Nouvelle]], 1986; [[University of Leeds]], 1989; [[Texas A&amp;M University]], 1990; the Maison d'Ailleurs, Yverdon-les-bains, and the Université de Neuchâtel, 1991; [[Imperial College]], [[London]], 1995; the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], 2000, and the [[Science Fiction Museum]] in [[Seattle]] in 2005. Conference attendees have included writers such as [[Brian Aldiss]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[David Brin]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], [[Robert Silverberg]], [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[Roger Zelazny]] as well as well-known critics of the genre and scientists like [[Harold Bloom]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], [[Harry Levin]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Robert Scholes]].{{sfn|Nashak|2013}} The Conference has produced more than twenty volumes of critical essays,&lt;ref name="Essays"/&gt; published by various university presses.

After a three-year gap, the conference resumed at UCR with the theme "Chronicling Mars", May 16–18, 2008. The 2009 conference, "Extraordinary Voyages: Jules Verne and Beyond" was held April 30 – May 3, 2009. The 2011 conference on "Global Science Fiction" was held February 11–13, 2011 at Riverside's historic [[Mission Inn Hotel &amp; Spa]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt; The most recent conference was held April 11–14, 2013, on the subject "Science Fiction Media".&lt;ref name=home/&gt;

==Eaton Award==
The now biennial conference sponsors the J. Lloyd Eaton Memorial Award. From 1979 to 2001 it recognized the "best critical book of each year", although it was not precisely annual.&lt;ref name="Locus-Eaton"/&gt; From 2008 it is a lifetime achievement award, in full the J. Lloyd Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award in Science Fiction, recognizing "contributions of lasting significance to the field". The four recipients to 2011 were [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], and [[Harlan Ellison]].&lt;ref name=award/&gt; [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] is the Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award winner for 2012.&lt;ref name=home/&gt; Both [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Stan Lee]] have been named for 2013 "to honor both science fiction film culture and science fiction comic book culture".&lt;ref name=award/&gt;

In the past several decades, researchers have spent continuous efforts on exploring how '''sexual content in the media''' influence individuals' perceptions of sex, marriage, and rape.  Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itfacts.biz/?id=p7960|website=IT Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content.

==Types of Sexual Content==

Scholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, which sexual content portray rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, and genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or [[humiliation]]. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=edited by Jennings|last2=Oliver|first2=Mary Beth|title=Media effects : advances in theory and research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-8058-6449-0|page=205|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of Sexual Content in the Media==

===[[Arousal]]===

One crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, "the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=edited by Jennings|last2=Oliver|first2=Mary Beth|title=Media effects : advances in theory and research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-8058-6449-0|page=307|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mallamuth|first1=Nell|title=Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil_Malamuth/publication/227585245_Sexually_Explicit_Media_Gender_Differences_and_Evolutionary_Theory/links/00b7d5217c318d0d1d000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to "normal" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than "normal" men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lohr|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Adams|first2=Henry E.|last3=Davis|first3=J. Mark|title=Sexual arousal to erotic and aggressive stimuli in sexually coercive and noncoercive men.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1997|volume=106|issue=2|pages=230–242|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.106.2.230|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=1997-03909-007&amp;S=L&amp;D=pdh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLe80SeprA4y9fwOLCmr0%2BeqK9Sr6i4SraWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGqs1Gyr7NJuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the Internet provides unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carnes|first1=Patrick J.|title=Cybersex, Courtship, and Escalating Arousal: Factors in Addictive Sexual Desire|journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity|date=13 October 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=45–78|doi=10.1080/10720160127560|url=https://www.iitap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ARTICLECybersex-Courtship-Escalating-Arousal_PCarnes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during the sexual intercourse.

=== Attitudinal Effects ===

One of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utility, Probability, and Human Decision Making Selected Proceedings of an Interdisciplinary Research Conference, Rome, 3-6 September, 1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=9789401018364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ZILLMANN|first1=DOLF|last2=BRYANT|first2=JENNINGS|title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography on Family Values|journal=Journal of Family Issues|date=December 1988|volume=9|issue=4|pages=518–544|doi=10.1177/019251388009004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zillmann|first1=Dolf|last2=Bryant|first2=Jennings|title=Pornography's Impact on Sexual Satisfaction1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=April 1988|volume=18|issue=5|pages=438–453|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00027.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|last2=Smith|title=Daytime talk shows: Up close and in your face. Sexual teens, sexual media|pages=79–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual Differences ===

Different people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gettleman|title=XXX=$$$|journal=Manhattan Mercury|date=1999|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=Charlene Y.|last2=Desmarais|first2=Serge|title=Impact of Interaction With a Partner or Friend on the Exposure Effects of Pornography and Erotica|journal=Violence and Victims|date=1 December 2004|volume=19|issue=6|pages=645–658|doi=10.1891/vivi.19.6.645.66347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Debra M.|last2=Strassberg|first2=Donald S.|last3=Turner|first3=Charles W.|title=Gender effects of romantic themes in erotica|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=February 1995|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–35|doi=10.1007/BF01541986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosher|first1=Donald L.|last2=MacIan|first2=Paula|title=College men and women respond to X‐rated videos intended for male or female audiences: Gender and sexual scripts|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=January 1994|volume=31|issue=2|pages=99–113|doi=10.1080/00224499409551736}}&lt;/ref&gt; while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it.  Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.

Personality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushman|first1=Brad J.|last2=Bonacci|first2=Angelica M.|last3=van Dijk|first3=Mirjam|last4=Baumeister|first4=Roy F.|title=Narcissism, sexual refusal, and aggression: Testing a narcissistic reactance model of sexual coercion.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|volume=84|issue=5|pages=1027–1040|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogaert|first1=Anthony F.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=2001|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–53|doi=10.1023/A:1026416723291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Effects ===

Bryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.

==== [[Catharsis]] ====

Catharsis holds that "vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and there by become less aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Jennings|last2=Zillmann|first2=Dolf|title=Violence and Sex in the Media|volume=An integrated approach to communication theory and research|pages=195–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;" This popular idea comes directly from [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic models of personality]]. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langevin|first1=Ron|last2=Lang|first2=Reuben A.|last3=Wright|first3=Percy|last4=Handy|first4=Lorraine|last5=Frenzel|first5=Roy R.|last6=Black|first6=Edward L.|title=Pornography and sexual offences|journal=Annals of Sex Research|date=1988|volume=1|issue=3|pages=335–362|doi=10.1007/BF00878103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CARTER|first1=DANIEL LEE|last2=PRENTKY|first2=ROBERT ALAN|last3=KNIGHT|first3=RAYMOND A.|last4=VANDERVEER|first4=PENNY L.|last5=BOUCHER|first5=RICHARD J.|title=Use of Pornography in the Criminal and Developmental Histories of Sexual Offenders|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=June 1987|volume=2|issue=2|pages=196–211|doi=10.1177/088626087002002005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very few empirical studies support the [[catharsis]] effect.

==== [[Disinhibition]] ====
Disinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Leonard|title=Some determinants of impulsive aggression: Role of mediated associations with reinforcements for aggression.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1974|volume=81|issue=2|pages=165–176|doi=10.1037/h0036094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donnerstein|first1=Edward|title=Aggressive erotica and violence against women.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1980|volume=39|issue=2|pages=269–277|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.2.269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imitation ====
Imitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that "humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|date=August 2001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.

==== Desensitization ====
The desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could in turn result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.

== Mitigating the Negative Effects ==
Harris and Barlett concluded that a few studies have developed extensive pre-exposure training and/or post-exposure debriefing procedures to lessen the desensitizing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LINZ|first1=DANIEL|last2=FUSON|first2=ILENE ARLUK|last3=DONNERSTEIN|first3=EDWARD|title=Mitigating the Negative Effects of Sexually Violent Mass Communications Through Preexposure Briefings|journal=Communication Research|date=October 1990|volume=17|issue=5|pages=641–674|doi=10.1177/009365090017005004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linz found that by offering pertinent educational information about rape myths reduced the effect of desensitization, which means experimental participation can also help reduce the rape myth acceptance. Wilson, Linz, Donnerstein, and Stipp conducted a field experiment, they found that men who are older than 50 had preexisting attitudes reinforced and actually blamed women for rape after seeing the film. In other words, preexisting attitudes and personal experience should be considered when conducting research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WILSON|first1=BARBARA J.|last2=LINZ|first2=DANIEL|last3=DONNERSTEIN|first3=EDWARD|last4=STIPP|first4=HORST|title=The Impact of Social Issue Television Programming on Attitudes Toward Rape|journal=Human Communication Research|date=December 1992|volume=19|issue=2|pages=179–208|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00299.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen, Emmers, Gebhardt, and Giery concluded that experimental studies show positive significant effect between pornography exposure and rape myth acceptance, whereas correlational field studies how a very small effect or nonexistent effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Mike|last2=D’Alessio|first2=David|last3=Emmers-Sommer|first3=Tara M.|title=Reactions of Criminal Sexual Offenders to Pornography: A Meta-Analytic Summary|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|date=18 May 2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=139–169|doi=10.1080/23808985.1999.11678961}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the relationship consistently stronger when the sexual materials was violent than it was nonviolent.

Sir [[Donald Tovey]]'s '''''Essays in Musical Analysis''''' are a series of [[musical analysis|analytical]] essays on [[classical music]].

The essays came into existence as [[programme notes]], written by Tovey, to accompany concerts given (mostly under his own baton) by the Reid Orchestra in [[Edinburgh]]. Between 1935 and 1939, they were published in six volumes as ''Essays in Musical Analysis''. Each volume focused on a certain genre of [[orchestra]]l or [[choral music]] (for example, Volumes I and II were devoted to Symphonies; Volume III to Concertos), with many of the works discussed with the help of music examples. In 1944, a posthumous seventh volume appeared on [[chamber music]].

Tovey's ''Essays'' were written as introductory notes for the concert-going public and are occasionally light-hearted in tone. Nevertheless, they analyse the pieces and describe their structure in much more depth than standard programme notes, even in a few pages each. Tovey saw his role as being "counsel for the defence" (Introduction to Volume I): in speaking up on behalf of the work about to be performed, he was seeking to facilitate the listener's appreciation of its artistic content and technical merits. As a result, his approach tends to 'track' the structure of a work as it unfolds through time before the ear of his imaginary 'naive listener'.

Pictures]].&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; It is based on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|1999 novel of the same name]]. The film, which is the third instal&lt;!--British English spells this word with one "l", not two --&gt;ment in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]], was written by [[Steve Kloves]] and produced by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] (director of the first two instalments), [[David Heyman]], and [[Mark Radcliffe (film producer)|Mark Radcliffe]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. This article also uses British English, so be sure to see WP:ENGVAR before inverting certain grammar, like "realise" for example. --&gt;
[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] has been spending another dissatisfying summer with [[The Dursleys]]. When Harry's [[Aunt Marge]] insults his parents, he loses his temper and silently wills her to bloat up and float away. Fed up, Harry then flees the Dursleys with his luggage. The [[Knight Bus]] delivers Harry to the [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|Leaky Cauldron]], where he is pardoned by Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] for using magic outside of [[Hogwarts]]. After reuniting with his best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], Harry learns that [[Sirius Black]], a convicted supporter of the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], has escaped [[Azkaban]] prison and intends to kill Harry.

The trio return to Hogwarts for the school year on the [[Hogwarts Express]], only for [[dementors]] to suddenly board the train, searching for Sirius. One enters the trio's compartment, causing Harry to pass out, but new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Professor Lupin]] repels the dementor with a [[Patronus Charm]]. At Hogwarts, headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large. Hogwarts groundskeeper [[Rubeus Hagrid]] is announced as the new [[Magic in Harry Potter#Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher; his first class goes awry when [[Draco Malfoy]] deliberately provokes the [[hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]], who attacks him. Draco [[exaggerates]] his injury, and his father [[Lucius Malfoy]] later has Buckbeak [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]].

[[The Fat Lady]]'s portrait, which guards the [[Gryffindor]] quarters, is found ruined and empty. Terrified and hiding in another painting, she tells Dumbledore that Sirius has entered the castle. During a stormy [[Quidditch]] match against [[Hufflepuff]], dementors attack Harry, causing him to fall off [[Nimbus 2000|his broomstick]]. At [[Hogsmeade]], Harry is shocked to learn that not only had Sirius been his father's best friend and apparently betrayed them to Voldemort, but is also Harry's godfather. Lupin privately teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus Charm.

After Harry, Ron, and Hermione witness Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat [[Scabbers]] bites him and escapes. When Ron gives chase, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the [[Whomping Willow]]'s base. This leads the trio to an underground passage of the [[Shrieking Shack]], where they discover that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an [[Animagus]]. Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend. He admits to being a werewolf, and explains that Sirius is innocent. Sirius was falsely accused of betraying the Potters to Voldemort, as well as murdering twelve Muggles and their mutual friend, [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. It is revealed that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who betrayed the Potters and committed the murders. After forcing him back into human form, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill him, but Harry convinces them to turn Pettigrew over to the dementors.

As the group departs, the full moon rises and Lupin transforms into a [[werewolf]]. Sirius transforms into his dog form to fight him off. In the midst of the chaos, Pettigrew transforms back into a rat and escapes. Harry and Sirius are attacked by dementors, and Harry sees a figure in the distance save them by casting a powerful Patronus spell. He believes the mysterious figure is [[James Potter (character)|his deceased father]] before passing out. He awakens to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the [[Dementor's Kiss]].

Acting on Dumbledore's advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time with Hermione's [[Time Turner]], and watch themselves and Ron repeat the night's events. They save Buckbeak from execution and witness the Dementors overpower Harry and Sirius. The present Harry realises that it was actually him who conjured the Patronus, and does so again. Harry and Hermione rescue Sirius, who escapes with Buckbeak. Exposed as a werewolf, Lupin resigns from teaching to prevent an uproar from parents. Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, who happily takes it for a ride.

==Production==

===Development===
With ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', production of the ''Harry Potter'' films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer [[David Heyman]] explained was "to give each [film] the time it required."&lt;ref name="heymanew"/&gt; [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], the director of the previous two films, decided not to return to helm the third instal&lt;!--British English spells this word with one "l", not two--&gt;ment as he "hadn't seen [his] own kids for supper in the week for about two and a half years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2465000/2465225.stm |title=Chris Columbus COS: full interview |accessdate=10 October 2007 |date=13 November 2002 |publisher=Newsround}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman.&lt;ref name="scifi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue372/interview.html |title=The creators of Harry Potter break out of character to discuss The Prisoner of Azkaban |accessdate=10 October 2007 |first=Lucinda |last=Dickey |publisher=Science Fiction Weekly |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819163554/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue372/interview.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillermo del Toro]] was approached to direct but considered the film "so bright and happy and full of light, that [he] wasn't interested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/10/26/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |title=Guillermo Game For ''Harry Potter'' |accessdate=26 October 2007 |date=26 October 2007 |first=Larry |last=Carroll |publisher=MTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027190511/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/10/26/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |archivedate=27 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Forster]] turned down the film because he had made ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'' and did not want to direct child actors again. [[M. Night Shyamalan]] was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]''. Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised [[Callie Khouri]], [[Kenneth Branagh]] (who played [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] in ''Chamber of Secrets'') and eventual selection [[Alfonso Cuarón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,322583,00.html |title=Great Expectations |accessdate=10 October 2007 |first=Gary |last=Susman |date=19 July 2002 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting, as he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct,&lt;ref name="cuaroninternewsround"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_3758000/3758101.stm |title=Alfonso Cuaron: the man behind the magic |accessdate=10 October 2007 |date=24 May 2004 |publisher=Newsround}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he had immediately connected to the story.&lt;ref name="scifi"/&gt; Cuarón's appointment pleased [[J. K. Rowling]] who loved his film ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'' and was impressed with his adaptation of ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]''.&lt;ref name="rowling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-05-27-potter-movie-book_x.htm |title=New ''Potter'' movie sneaks in spoilers for upcoming books |accessdate=29 August 2007 |date=27 May 2004 |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Claudia |last=Puig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heyman found that "tonally and stylistically, [Cuarón] was the perfect fit."&lt;ref name="heymanew"/&gt; As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process."&lt;ref name=castinterviews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Bob.

===Filming===
[[File:Loch Shiel - Glenfinnan bay (Scotland).jpg|thumb|right|[[Loch Shiel]], where scenes from ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' were filmed.]]
Principal photography began on 24 February 2003,&lt;ref name="newsround"/&gt; at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]], and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/preview/1808404333 |title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) |accessdate=10 October 2007 |authorlink=Greg Dean Schmitz |first=Greg Dean |last=Schmitz |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third film was the first to extensively utilise real-life locations, as much of the first two films had been shot in the studio. Some sets for the film were built in [[Glen Coe]], Scotland, near the [[Clachaig Inn]]. The indoor sets, including ones built for the previous two films, are mainly in Leavesden Film Studios. The Hogwarts Lake was filmed from [[Loch Shiel]], [[Loch Eilt]] and [[Loch Morar]] in the Scottish Highlands. Incidentally, the [[Glenfinnan Viaduct|train bridge]], which was also featured in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train. A small section of the triple-decker bus scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North London's [[Palmers Green]]. Some parts were also filmed in and around [[Borough Market]] and [[Lambeth Bridge]] in London.

Hogwarts grew and expanded significantly with the third film. For the first time, the Hogwarts courtyard and bridge were seen. At the end of the bridge, rock monoliths were placed onto the hillside to evoke a [[Celtic people|Celtic]] feeling. The use of live-action also significantly changed the look of Hagrid's hut. In the first two films, it appeared at the end of a flat stretch, right in front of the Forbidden Forest. The third film utilised the more rugged Scottish locations to place Hagrid's hut at the bottom of a steep hillside. A large pumpkin patch was added behind the hut.

The [[Honeydukes]] set in this film is a [[redress]] of the set of [[Flourish &amp; Blotts]] that was seen in ''Chamber of Secrets'', which, in turn, was a redress of the [[Ollivanders]] set from [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|the first film]].

Rowling allowed Cuarón to make minor changes to the book, on the condition that he stuck to the book's spirit.&lt;ref name="cuaroninternewsround"/&gt; She allowed him to place a [[sundial]] on Hogwarts' grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then unreleased [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|sixth book]].&lt;ref name="cuaroninternewsround"/&gt; Rowling said she "got [[goose bumps|goosebumps]]" when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated "people are going to look back on the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues."&lt;ref name="rowling"/&gt; When filming concluded, Cuarón found that it had "been the two sweetest years of my life," and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels.&lt;ref name="cuaroninternewsround"/&gt;

===Effects===
Cuarón originally wanted to move away from CGI toward puppetry. He hired master underwater puppeteer Basil Twist to help, using puppets to study the potential movement of the Dementors.&lt;ref name="heymanew"/&gt; Once it became apparent that puppetry would be too expensive and unable to portray the specific elements of the Dementors, Cuarón turned to CGI; however, he and his team did use footage of Dementor puppets underwater as a basis for the flowing movements of the computer-generated Dementors.

The [[Knight Bus]] segment when Harry is being taken to [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|The Leaky Cauldron]] uses the technique known as [[bullet time]], popularised in ''[[The Matrix]]'' series of films. This segment takes humorous advantage of the [[magic (Harry Potter)|magic]] quality of the Harry Potter world by having the [[Muggle]] world go into bullet time while inside the Knight Bus, Harry, [[Stan Shunpike]] and [[Ernie Prang]] (and the talking shrunken head) keep moving in real time.

===Music===
[[File:John Williams tux.jpg|thumb|upright|John Williams]]
{{Main|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (soundtrack)}}

The Academy Award-nominated [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (soundtrack)|score]] was the third and final score in the series to be composed and conducted by [[John Williams]]. It was released on CD on 25 May 2004. In general, this film's music is not as bright as that of the previous films, with distinct medieval influences in the instrumentation. One of the new themes, "Double Trouble," was written during production so that a children's choir could perform it in Hogwarts's Great Hall in one of the film's earlier scenes. The lyrics of "Double Trouble" are from a ritual performed by the Weïrd Sisters in Act 4, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's [[Macbeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=William|title=Macbeth|year=2009|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks|location=4.1.10–45|isbn=978-0-7434-7710-9|pages=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's trailer prominently features the cues "Anticipation" and "Progeny" by Brand X Music, a [[trailer music]] band.

==Differences from the book==
&lt;!-- This section should be integrated into the rest of the article --&gt;
''Prisoner of Azkaban'' was, at the time of publication, the series' longest book. The increasing plot complexity necessitated a looser adaptation of the book's finer plot lines and back-story. The film opens with Harry using magic to light his wand in short bursts, whereas in the same scene in the book, he uses a torch/flashlight, as performing magic outside the wizard world is illegal for wizards under the age of seventeen. The connection between Harry's parents and the Marauder's Map is only briefly mentioned,&lt;ref name="digitalspy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a64205/harry-potter-books-vs-films.html?page=3 |title=Harry Potter: books vs. films |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=10 October 2007 |date=9 July 2007 |last=Dadds |first=Kimberly |author2=Miriam Zendle}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is [[Remus Lupin]]'s association to both the map and James Potter.&lt;ref name="canmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canmag.com/news/3/3/248 |title=Movie Rant |publisher=CanMag Magazine |accessdate=14 September 2007 |date=28 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was never mentioned who the Marauders were or who the nicknames Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs referred to. Some [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] was removed for dramatic effect: both the Shrieking Shack and Scabbers the rat are mentioned only very briefly in the film, while they receive a more thorough coverage in the novel.&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt; Most of [[Sirius Black]]'s back story is also cut, with no mention of the manner of his escape from [[Azkaban]].&lt;ref name="canmag"/&gt; Only the first Quidditch game was kept in the film, due to its importance to the storyline; the second (Gryffindor/Ravenclaw) and third (Gryffindor/Slytherin) were cut. Thus, Harry receives the Firebolt at the film's end, while in the book he receives it anonymously at Christmas and it is confiscated for a few weeks to be checked for possible jinxes by Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch.

On account of pace and time considerations, the film glosses over detailed descriptions of magical education. Only one Hippogriff, Buckbeak, is seen, and only Malfoy and Harry are seen interacting with the Hippogriff during [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lessons, and most other lessons, including all of [[Severus Snape|Snape's]] [[Potions Class|potions]] classes, were cut from the film.&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt; The Fidelius Charm's complicated description is removed entirely from the film, with no explanation given of exactly how Black "betrayed" the Potters to [[Lord Voldemort]]. Many of this scene's lines are redistributed amongst [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Minerva McGonagall]]; in compensation, McGonagall's exposition of the Animagus transformation is instead given by Snape.&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;

In the film, where Harry and Hermione have travelled back in time and are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.

The embryonic romantic connection between Ron and Hermione is more prominent in the film than the book; in response to criticism of the first two films for sacrificing character development for mystery and adventure, the emotional development of all three lead characters is given more attention in the third film.&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt; That said, any mention of the beginnings of Harry's crush on [[Cho Chang]] is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,654023,00.html |title=Harry Situation |accessdate=10 October 2007 |date=17 June 2004 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang herself is not even seen until the next film. Harry's darker side is first glimpsed in this film, when Harry proclaims, "I hope he [Black] finds me. Cause when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does, I'm going to kill him!"&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;

The title is another name for the instrument (that instrument being a [[barrel organ]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which the street performer plays throughout the film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as the informal meaning of the term 'Hurdy Gurdy' is a "barrel organ".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hurdy-gurdy|title=hurdy-gurdy {{!}} Definition of hurdy-gurdy in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The street performer plays his barrel organ whilst Oswald is trying to escape.png|thumb|289x289px|The street performer plays his [[barrel organ]] (or hurdy-gurdy,) whilst Oswald is trying to escape.]]
The film opens with a bear (who is the street performer) using a barrel organ, and a monkey dancing to the music made by it. They do this until Oswald throws his bubblegum onto the floor and the monkey steps on it. In an attempt to free himself, the monkey comically gets himself swallowed up by the gum. The street performer, who is angered by the events, grabs Oswald and drags him by the neck with a leach through whilst playing the barrel organ. He does this until he descends onto a street with a girl who is seen using her clothes and her washing line comically like a [[swing (seat)|swing]]. The girl think positively about the music, who attempts to give money to them. The street performer notices this and asks Oswald to get the money, by comically using a [[mouse trap]] in order to get up to her house. However, when Oswald gets into the house, he and the girl passionately kiss. The street performer, then tries to pull Oswald back with the leach. So Oswald free himself by comically takes off his head and removing the leach. He places the leach onto one of the legs of a [[hippo]]'s bathtub. Oswald then [[blows a raspberry]] in order to gather the street performer's attention. This angers the street performer, who pulls at the leach in order to retrieve Oswald. This comically sends the hippo's bathtub crashing through the window, and hitting the street performer on the ground. This makes the hippo scream, and comically run away with her legs in the bathtub. After that, The street performer sees both Oswald and the girl, and comically scales up a pipe in order to reach them. However, once the street performer is on top of the roof and tries to grab Oswald and the girl, Oswald and the girl both use a piece of clothing as a parachute, which catches the street perform off-guard, and also makes the street performer fall off the building and slam into the ground. After falling, the street performer realises that Oswald and the girl are stealing his barrel organ. So, in response, the street performer throws a brick at them both. The brick hits Oswald, who falls off the organ. The street performer then throws another brick. Oswald, then comically uses the organ to bat it away, like a [[baseball bat]]. He does this until one of the bricks hits the street performer on the head. This makes the street performer [[hallucinate]],  with the buildings comically dancing in his hallucination. The street performer hallucinates until he collapses. Oswald and the girl both laugh at the events, and the film ends with them both kissing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Interactive street theatre''' is a combination of [[street theatre]] and [[interactive art]].
There are different kinds of interactive street theatre. The biggest difference between “normal interactive art” and "interactive street theatre" is that the presentation. 
The presentation of is always outside in a public place and most of the time on a festival. The audience are people how just walk by and stop and participate. You can participate but if you don’t want you can just watch. It is temporary, only a few hours. And it is easier to participate than in a gallery or a museum. People who might not have ever to a theatre or museum can now participate in an interactive street theatre.

Some interactive art installations visitor can "walk" in, on, and around them. And to “play” with the object of the installations. Another form is that spectators themselves become part of the artwork. And a third option is that spectator become active and work to gather to great a collective art piece.

The '''Jumpin' Joe''' is a [[swing dance]] move adaptation, invented in 2007 in [[Ventura, California]]. It can be used as an adaptation on the [[Princess Dip]] or the [[Pretzel (dance)|Pretzel]]. It was meant for leads who may be shorter than their partner. Instead of struggling to swing their following partner's arm over her own head, he may jump as she does so, thus executing the Jumpin' Joe.

== How It's Done (Princess Dip) ==

1st, the lead would bounce his partner off his leg.&lt;br /&gt;
2nd, he would then spin his partner to return to the open-hand position.&lt;br /&gt;
3rd, as she spins to that position, he jumps to get his hand over her head.&lt;br /&gt;
4th, he lands and is returned to the open-hand position.

== How It's Done (Pretzel) ==

After completing the Pretzel,

1st, the lead jumps to get his hand over head.&lt;br /&gt;
2nd, he lands and is returned to the open-hand position.

'''''Kingdom of Loathing''''' (abbreviated '''''KoL''''') is a [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] designed and operated by [[Asymmetric Publications]], including creator Zack "Jick" Johnson with a small team. The game was released in 2003, with ongoing small updates continually released.

It uses hand-drawn [[stick figure]] graphics and writing characterized by [[Surreal humour|surreal humor]], [[word play]], [[parody]] and references to [[popular culture]]. In ''KoL'', a player's [[Player character|character]] fights [[Mob (video gaming)|monsters]] for [[Experience point|experience]], and acquiring meat (the game's [[Virtual economy|currency]]), and/or [[Item (gaming)|items]], through a [[Time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] system. Players may also interact with each other through [[player versus player]] competition, participate in the in-game economy by trading goods and services, organize their characters into [[Clan (video gaming)|clans]], work together to complete clan [[dungeon crawl|dungeons]], and speak to each other in many different [[Chat room|chat]] channels.

The game is also particularly notable for managing to be financially successful purely from donations and the purchase of merchandise rather than from [[advertising]] or [[Subscription business model|subscription fees]], which are used by many [[online game]]s.   In 2008, the game had between 100,000 and 150,000 regular players. These players form an active community which frequently organizes fan meet-ups and runs an internet radio station.  The game has been generally well received by critics. In 2012, ''Mr. Card Game'', a tabletop game based on ''Kingdom of Loathing'', was launched on [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name=kick&gt;{{cite web

On August 10, 2017, Asymmetric launched ''[[West of Loathing]]'', a ''Kingdom of Loathing'' [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[Single-player video game|single-player]] role-playing video game for [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and [[Windows]].&lt;ref name="rps_wol"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/10/west-of-loathing-released/ | title=Cowboys and clowns ride out with West of Loathing | work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | first=Alice | last=O'Connor | date=10 August 2017 | accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay and features==
[[File:kingdom of loathing screenshot1.png|thumb|A screenshot of combat against scarab [[The Beatles|beatles]].|alt=A web page broken up into frames.  The center frame shows the combat, consisting entirely of text and crude thumbnail images of drawings.  There is also a chat pane showing various announcements and a character pane displaying the player's experience levels, hit points, and magic points.]]
Gameplay involves fighting monsters, completing quests, gaining skills and [[Statistic (role-playing games)|stats]], and accumulating items and meat.

In ''KoL'''s [[turn-based]] gameplay, a player's character is supplied with a number of adventures each day, at a base of 40, although this can be increased.&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/kingdom-loathing/review|title=Kingdom of Loathing Review|publisher=[[Gamezebo]]|author=Barry White|date=31 December 2009|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game day resets at a time called "rollover".  Characters are allotted forty adventures every rollover, though they can increase that number with various equipment and items. Additional adventures can be acquired by consuming [[food]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|booze]].&lt;ref name="Bixler"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305051438/http://gaming.psu.edu/KoLAnalysis|title=Kingdom of Loathing – Analysis of a Great Game|author=Brett Bixler|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=2 November 2011|date=15 January 2009|archivedate=5 March 2010|url=http://gaming.psu.edu/KoLAnalysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a limited amount of each can be consumed each day,&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; and drinking too much booze puts the character into a [[Alcohol intoxication|drunken stupor]] for the remainder of the day.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; During rollover, drunkenness and fullness levels are reset, and minor amounts of [[Health (gaming)|health points]] and [[magic point]]s are restored. Although a character can accumulate a large number of adventures, the number is reduced to 200 at rollover.&lt;ref name="massive"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hecht|first=Eliah|title=Time is money, friend!|publisher=Massively|date=5 November 2007|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2007/11/05/time-is-money/|accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most actions in the game use up adventures, including crafting items and exploring the game world (adventuring).&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"/&gt;  When exploring, players experience combat encounters, in which they fight monsters, as well as non-combat encounters.&lt;ref name="Ruiten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillageek.com/2011/11/review-kingdom-of-loathing/|title=Review: Kingdom of Loathing|publisher=Guerrilla Geek|author=Remy van Ruiten|date=18 November 2011|accessdate=5 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129050953/http://www.guerrillageek.com/2011/11/review-kingdom-of-loathing/|archivedate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat is turn-based, meaning that the player and the monster take turns attacking one another using weapons, skills and items.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/11/02/the-game-archaeologists-fear-and-loathing-in-the-kingdom-the-h/|title=The Game Archaeologist's fear and loathing in the Kingdom: The highlights|author=Justin Olivetti|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=2 November 2011|publisher=Massively|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508135737/http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/11/02/the-game-archaeologists-fear-and-loathing-in-the-kingdom-the-h/|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Players who successfully defeat a monster receive [[experience point]]s, pieces of meat (the game's currency), and various items.&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"/&gt;  Non-combat encounters simply present the reader with a text description of an event, occasionally allowing the player to choose how to respond to that event.&lt;ref name="Ruiten"/&gt;

After gaining enough experience points, players will [[Experience level|gain levels]],&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"/&gt; allowing them to access new areas and quests.  Characters can combine items by using "meat paste" (a substance analogous to glue),&lt;ref name="Ruiten"/&gt; and can also cook [[food]], mix [[cocktail]]s and [[Metalsmith|smith]] weapons and armor. Characters may also earn trophies or tattoos for various in-game achievements.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; Puzzle-solving is an important part of the game, with the solutions often involving a certain item combination or the completion of tasks in different zones.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt;

===Player interaction===
While ''Kingdom of Loathing''{{'}}s [[player versus environment]] content is largely single-player, some features allow multiplayer interaction.

Player versus player (PvP) combat is voluntary,&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; features a randomized selection of non-interactive minigames, and is subdivided into seasons.  The winner of the PvP battle can take fame or items from the loser.&lt;ref name="worldsinmotion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/07/worlds_in_motion_atlas_inside.php|title=Worlds in Motion Atlas: Inside Kingdom Of Loathing|author=Simon Carless|date=26 July 2008|accessdate=5 November 2011|publisher=Worlds in Motion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730005947/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/07/worlds_in_motion_atlas_inside.php|archivedate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game features an integrated chat system which is available only after completing a basic test of [[English grammar]] and [[English orthography|spelling]].&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; There are many chat channels, including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of [[Haiku in English|English haiku]].&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; Most of the chat channels are moderated; those who violate the chat rules are banned. Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in-game, and the official ''Kingdom of Loathing'' forums are another active venue for discussion among players.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Upon reaching level 3, characters may join a clan, a band of cooperating characters.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; A clan has a clan hall which can be furnished with beneficial equipment as well as a clan stash for sharing useful items.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; Clan members can chat with each other in a private chat channel. In 2008, a [[instance dungeon|multiplayer dungeon]] was added which allows clan members to [[raid (gaming)|raid]] cooperatively in Hobopolis, the underground city of [[hobo]]s.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] likened Hobopolis to [[World of Warcraft]] instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Pearson|first =Dan|title = Kingdom of Loathing expands|publisher =Eurogamer.net|date = 18 June 2008|url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/kingdom-of-loathing-expands|accessdate =10 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617060627/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/kingdom-of-loathing-expands|archivedate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional clan dungeons have since been added, including the Slimetube, Dreadsylvania, and the limited-time Haunted Sorority House.

Players can buy a store in The [[Shopping mall|Mall]] of Loathing and sell their character's items to other players.&lt;ref name="Safferling"/&gt; Direct trading between two players is also possible, and in the trade chat channel users can auction items and advertise shops.&lt;ref name="massive"/&gt; This functionality has created a complex in-game economy which author Ted Friedman, in his book ''Electric dreams: computers in American culture'', described as "vibrant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFn0kxWg0xcC|title=Electric dreams: computers in American culture|author=Ted Friedman|page=155|publisher=NYU Press|year=2005|isbn=0814727395|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Kingdom of Loathing'' economy was the subject of an academic study, ''Economics in the Kingdom of Loathing: Analysis of Virtual Market Data'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="Safferling"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safferling |first1=Christoph |last2=Lowen |first2= Aaron|year= 2011|title= Economics in the Kingdom of Loathing: Analysis of Virtual Market Data|journal=Working Paper Series of the Department of Economics, University of Konstanz|publisher= University of Konstanz|url= http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/wiwi/workingpaperseries/WP_30-Safferling-Lowen-11.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character classes===
Players choose from six [[Character class|classes]] when they create a character.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;  Each class has various items that characters obtain by completing class-specific quests. Characters also receive non-tradable class-dependent items as a reward for completing harder ascensions.  The classes can be split into groups based on the primary [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Attributes|character attribute]] associated with them.

*Muscle classes: The two muscle classes are [[Seal Clubber]] and Turtle Tamer.  Muscle classes depend on strength and fighting ability. A character's Max HP is determined by his/her muscle, and Muscle classes gain an innate +50% boost to their Max HP.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;
*Mysticality classes: The mysticality classes are Pastamancer and Sauceror.  Gameplay for mysticality classes is focused on spellcasting and the use of magic. A character's Max MP is determined by his/her Mysticality, and Mysticality classes gain an innate +50% to their Max MP.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;
*Moxie classes: The moxie classes, Disco Bandit and Accordion Thief, use charm and dexterity to achieve success.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;

===Familiars===
[[Familiar spirit|Familiars]] are creatures that can accompany players in combat, performing (usually) helpful actions.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; Familiars are often instrumental in the completion of quests.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;  Familiars possess many abilities;&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; for example, a Sabre-Toothed Lime attacks monsters, a [[Leprechaun]] grants extra meat after combat, and a Hovering [[Sombrero]] increases stat gains from combat. Some familiars, such as the Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot,&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt; are very difficult to acquire.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;

===Ascension===
Ascension is a feature that allows characters to start the game over and play through it again from the beginning,&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; similar to a [[New Game Plus]] feature.&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/11/16/the-game-archaeologists-fear-and-loathing-in-the-kingdom-joshi/|title=The Game Archaeologist's fear and loathing in the Kingdom: Joshing with Jick|date=16 November 2010|accessdate=2 November 2011|author=Justin Olivetti|publisher=Massively|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508135728/http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/11/16/the-game-archaeologists-fear-and-loathing-in-the-kingdom-joshi/|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This feature becomes available after the game's final quest is completed.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt;  Players who ascend have their character's experience levels reset to one, but they retain their currency and items.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;  Ascending players can also choose to make their ascension more difficult by taking on various restrictions, such as not being able to eat or drink,&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt; in exchange for special rewards.&lt;ref name="Olivetti"/&gt;  In addition, the game features a leaderboard system which allows players to see one another's ascension speeds and compete for the fastest ascensions.&lt;ref name="Safferling"/&gt;

==Plot and setting==
The player takes on the role of an [[adventure]]r who is tasked with solving problems and killing monsters in a [[fantasy]]-based kingdom. The game is humorous in nature, and most [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], battles and individual item descriptions include [[joke]]s, [[wit]]ticisms, or references to popular culture.&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt; Many quests parody the [[trope (literature)|tropes]] found in other role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Making_the_Most_of_a_Simple_Thing_Kingdom_of_Loathing/|publisher=The Mac Observer|author=Chris Barylick|date=3 October 2006|accessdate=5 December 2011|title=Making the Most of a Simple Thing: Kingdom of Loathing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise is that the Naughty [[Magician (paranormal)|Sorceress]] has captured and "imprismed" (imprisoned in a prism) the Kingdom's ruler, [[monarch|King]] Ralph XI. The ultimate objective of the game is to defeat the Naughty Sorceress and free King Ralph.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} In King Ralph's absence, most of the power in the Kingdom of Loathing is held by the Council of Loathing, which gives quests to characters as they increase in level,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{cite book

==Development==
[[File:Zack_johnson_gdc_2018.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Zach Johnson at the 2018 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]
Zack Johnson, the game's creator, developed several games before ''Kingdom of Loathing'' but did not feel that they were good enough to release online.&lt;ref name="escapist"/&gt; Deciding that he was taking the games he created too seriously, Johnson then set himself the challenge of creating one within a week and publishing the result online.&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt; The result was more of a joke than a game, and the initial content including classes and even the name of the game were stream of consciousness.&lt;ref name="escapist"/&gt;  The game was released in early 2003,&lt;ref name="PlanetGeek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet-geek.com/archives/2004/07/kingdom-of-loat.html|title=Kingdom of Loathing: An interview with Jick|publisher=Planet Geek|date=9 July 2004|accessdate=3 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930114625/http://planet-geek.com/archives/2004/07/kingdom-of-loat.html|archivedate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johnson soon invited his childhood friend Josh Nite to contribute content as a writer and designer.&lt;ref name="PlanetGeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cooper| first =Park| title =An Adventurer Is You: The Zack Johnson/Kingdom of Loathing Interview| publisher =Silver Bullet Comics| url =http://www.comicsbulletin.com/pb/117648256288713.htm| date = 13 April 2007| accessdate =3 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606202516/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/pb/117648256288713.htm|deadurl=yes|archivedate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a year, 300,000 player accounts had been created,&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diygamer.com/2010/04/kingdom-loathing/|title=On One's Own: Kingdom of Loathing|author=James Bishop|date=6 April 2010|accessdate=3 November 2011|publisher=DIY Gamer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618043728/http://www.diygamer.com/2010/04/kingdom-loathing/|archivedate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; far exceeding Johnson and Nite's expectations; Johnson has referred to the game's success as "a never ending series of astonishments".&lt;ref name="Eykemans"/&gt;  In 2008, the game had between 100,000 and 150,000 regular players.&lt;ref name="escapist"&gt;{{cite web| last =Janelle| first =Robert| title =Stumbling Into the Kingdom of Loathing| publisher =Escapist Magazine| date = 5 August 2008| url =http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_161/5112-Stumbling-Into-the-Kingdom-of-Loathing| accessdate =5 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613203450/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_161/5112-Stumbling-Into-the-Kingdom-of-Loathing|archivedate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game's early days, Johnson would work on the game during breaks while at work, but eighteen months or so after launch, the game was bringing in enough money for Johnson to quit his day job as a programmer and develop the game full-time.&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt;  He then began to pay Nite for his work&lt;ref name="escapist"/&gt; and after approximately two years hired two more developers.&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;  There are currently eight full-time employees working on ''Kingdom of Loathing'', as well as three other employees who are working on a separate game.
The game's creative process is fluid and loosely structured.&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt;  According to Johnson, "At this point, I provide the overall direction. I do about a quarter of the writing, a quarter of the coding, and almost all of the artwork."&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt;  The bulk of the writing is done by Nite, who also contributes design ideas,&lt;ref name="OlivettiSkullyInterview"/&gt; while two other developers, known in the game as Riff and HotStuff, work on writing, design, and coding.&lt;ref name="Eykemans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diygamer.com/2010/05/years-kingdom-loathing-interview/|title=Seven Years Later: Kingdom of Loathing [Interview]|author=Peter Eykemans|publisher=DIY Gamer|date=14 May 2010|accessdate=3 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710135708/http://www.diygamer.com/2010/05/years-kingdom-loathing-interview/|archivedate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nite, the game's writing style owes itself to a humorous email exchange between himself and Johnson that began when the two separated after high school.  These emails "helped us develop the shared comedic voice that ''KoL'''s written in".&lt;ref name="OlivettiSkullyInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/11/09/the-game-archaeologists-fear-and-loathing-in-the-kingdom-inter/|title=The Game Archaeologist's fear and loathing in the Kingdom: Interrogating Mr. Skullhead|author=Justin Olivetti|date=9 November 2010|publisher=Massively|accessdate=3 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508135731/http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/11/09/the-game-archaeologists-fear-and-loathing-in-the-kingdom-inter/|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game's developers cite text-based games such as [[Zork]] and [[Legend of the Red Dragon]] as creative influences, and Nite has compared the game to the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] series of children's books.&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;

The game has been in open [[Software development process|beta]] since its initial release, and is continuously being worked on.&lt;ref name="OlivettiSkullyInterview"/&gt;  New content is released weekly or monthly,&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OlivettiSkullyInterview"/&gt; and there is also unique holiday-themed content every Christmas, known as Crimbo.&lt;ref name="Eykemans"/&gt; Occasionally, the developers stage world events such as the Gray Plague, which was similar to the [[Corrupted Blood incident]] in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modeling Epidemic Spread in Synthetic Populations – Virtual Plagues in Massively Multiplayer Online Games|author1=Magnus Boman|author2=Stefan J. Johansson|year=2007|arxiv=0705.4584 |bibcode=2007arXiv0705.4584B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Nite left Asymmetric Publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Sad Announcement from Mr. Skullhead|url=http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showpost.php?p=4692554&amp;postcount=1|publisher=Forums of Loathing|date=10 November 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
''Kingdom of Loathing'' is [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free]] and does not charge subscription fees.&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;

Maintenance and development of the game is supported primarily through donations&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1043_3-5389938.html|title=Dare you fight the possessed tomatoes?|date=1 October 2004|accessdate=3 November 2011|author=John Borland|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and players who donate [[United States dollar|US]]$10 to the game receive a powerful item known as a Mr. Accessory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Mr. Accessories can be equipped to give stat boosts or spent in the "Mr. Store" to buy powerful items (including special monthly items).&lt;ref name="Safferling"/&gt;  Mr. Accessories and Mr. Store items may be traded freely between players.&lt;ref name="Safferling"/&gt;  According to an interview with Zack Johnson from 2010, Johnson originally established the Mr. Accessory revenue model as "kind of an afterthought", but it became lucrative enough to allow him to work on the game full-time and eventually to hire several permanent employees.&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt;

==Community==
''Kingdom of Loathing'' has been praised for its welcoming and active player community.&lt;ref name="EuroGReview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FekDAAAAMBAJ|title=Kingdom of Loathing|page=12|newspaper=GameAxis Unwired|date=August 2005|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most unusual aspects of the community is the large number of female players: according to Johnson, approximately 40% of players are female.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;  Fans often gather at both official conventions, run by Asymmetric, and unofficial player-organized meet-ups,&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt; including the annual KoLumbus event.&lt;ref name="OlivettiSkullyInterview"/&gt; Players support the game by writing [[script (computing)|scripts]] to perform various in-game functions, using [[Greasemonkey]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], and have also developed a player-run [[wiki]] which offers puzzle solutions and walkthroughs.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diygamer.com/2010/03/love-community/|title=On One’s Own: For the Love of Community|author=James Bishop|date=23 March 2010|publisher=DIY Game|accessdate=5 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327113231/http://www.diygamer.com/2010/03/love-community/|archivedate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Longtime player and nerdcore rapper [[MC Frontalot]] is active in the community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzbinmagazine.com/home/2011/08/12/mc-frontalot-attendance-is-mandatory/ |title=MC Frontalot: Attendance is Mandatory! |publisher=Buzzbin Magazine |accessdate=3 November 2011 |date=12 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920043624/http://www.buzzbinmagazine.com/home/2011/08/12/mc-frontalot-attendance-is-mandatory/ |archivedate=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and included a ''Kingdom of Loathing''-themed song on his 2010 album ''[[Zero Day (album)|Zero Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitech.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/08/geek-out-m-c-frontalot-talks-nerdcore-hip-hop-geekery/|title=Geek Out!: M.C.

Brett Bixler, founder of the Educational Gaming Commons at [[Pennsylvania State University]], has hypothesized that the ''Kingdom of Loathing'' community is successful because it accounts for [[Richard Bartle]]'s [[Bartle Test|model]] of player personality types in [[massively multiplayer online roleplaying game]]s, creating a balanced gameplay system that appeals to a wide variety of players.&lt;ref name="Bixler"/&gt;  Researcher Martin Oliver addressed similar issues in a 2009 study of the ''Kingdom of Loathing'' player community, "Playing Roles in the MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Effective Electronic Gaming in Education|chapter=Playing Roles in the MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing|author=Martin Oliver|publisher=London Knowledge Lab|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[SHOUTcast]] radio station, ''Radio KoL'', is the "official unofficial" radio station of ''KoL''. It is a [[24/7]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]]-hosted station, with volunteer DJs drawn from the ''KoL'' user base.&lt;ref name="OlivettiJickInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7951|title=UpFront – March 1, 2005|date=1 March 2005|publisher=Linux Journal|accessdate=3 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709011256/http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7951|archivedate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice weekly, development team members host shows on Radio KoL in which they discuss the state of the game and answer questions from players.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Critical response for ''Kingdom of Loathing'' has been generally positive, with consistent praise for the game's humor and surrealism. The gameplay and content have been praised as "well designed" and having a "huge amount of content".&lt;ref name="EuroGReview"/&gt;  Matt Gallant of Gizmodo said that the game is "actually very full-featured" with "a lot of content",&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/16409/pickup-games-vol-4-kingdom-of-loathing?tag=archives|title=Pickup Games, Vol. 4 – Kingdom of Loathing|author=Matt Gallant|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Worlds in Motion, "''Kingdom of Loathing'' isn't just a great game, but a really unique and interesting MMO."&lt;ref name="worldsinmotion"/&gt; [[Jay Is Games]] called it "a 'must play' game for RPG fans who want something different".&lt;ref name="JayIsGames"&gt;{{cite web| last = Preston| first=| title = Kingdom of Loathing| publisher = Jay Is Games| date = 12 September 2005| url = http://jayisgames.com/archives/2005/09/kingdom_of_loat.php| accessdate =13 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623103207/http://jayisgames.com/archives/2005/09/kingdom_of_loat.php|archivedate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamezebo]] criticized the interface, calling it "clunky",&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"/&gt; and several reviewers expressed concern that the game might be confusing to new players.&lt;ref name="Gamezebo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64851">The following is a list of media published in the ''[[Lone Wolf (gamebooks)|Lone Wolf]]'' series of gamebooks, and other derivative media based on the gamebooks. The original gamebook series, and the bulk of subsequent Lone Wolf media, was written by [[Joe Dever]]. The success and cult status of the original gamebooks helped in the creation of a spin-off called The World of Lone Wolf, written by [[Ian Page (singer)|Ian Page]], a series of novelizations, a collection of role-playing games, and a number of video games and other derivative works.

==Printed Media==

===Main Gamebook Series===
Although they form one full series numbered 1 to 29, the Lone Wolf gamebooks are in fact subdivided in four subseries. In the Kai Series (books 1 to 5), we follow Lone Wolf as he climbs the steps to become a Kai Lord of the Magnakai level. In the Magnakai Series (books 6 to 12), Lone Wolf collects the Lorestones so he could reach the Grand Master level, the highest level a Kai Lord could achieved in the First Kai Order. In the Grand Master series (books 13 to 20), Lone Wolf discovers that there are even higher levels a Kai Lord could achieved, up to the point of Supreme Kai Master. In the New Order series (books 21 to 29), we play as a member of the Second Kai Order already at the level of a Grand Master. The yet to be published books 30 to 32 will belong to this subseries.

| colspan="2" style="border: none; vertical-align: top;"| At the Kai Monastery is a young initiate, given the name Silent Wolf. On the feastday of Fehmarn, when all the Kai Lords gather at the monastery, Silent Wolf is sent to cut wood from the surrounding forest as a punishment for his inattention in class. While he is gone, a surprise attack is launched from the Darklands at several places across Sommerlund. The Monastery is assaulted and the gathered Kai Lords massacred.

===Spin-off Gamebook series===

====The World of Lone Wolf====
All four ''World of Lone Wolf'' books were written by [[Ian Page (singer)|Ian Page]] and edited by Joe Dever. In 2005 the gamebooks were made available for free download at Project Aon [http://groups.google.com/group/projectaon-announcements/browse_thread/thread/c487a464fdc1ff7e/49de5132f176a5a6#49de5132f176a5a6].

The series plays for the most part at the tip of south-eastern Magnamund, in the land then known as the Shadakine Empire, and features Grey Star, a human that was raised by the Shianti, a race of demi-gods.

According to a 2008 interview with Joe Dever, Grey Star was actually the principal character that Ian Page played in Dever's [[D&amp;D]] campaign in the late 1970s. Since Ian Page had created a detailed backstory for Grey Star and fleshed out many aspects of southern Magnamund, Joe Dever convinced him to write a four-book story arc centered on this character, and to include his contributions in the Magnamund setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Das Spielbuchforum (Joe Dever Interview thread)| work =| publisher =Mantikore-Verlag| date =| url =http://www.mantikore-verlag.de/forum/index.php?thema_id=59| format =| accessdate =2010-10-22| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060247/http://www.mantikore-verlag.de/forum/index.php?thema_id=59| archivedate =19 July 2011| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autumn Snow====
In the years 2010-2011, the French associative editor [[Scriptarium]] published original adventures in its webzine ''Draco Venturus''.

====Bonus Adventures====
With the republication of the Lone Wolf series, Mongoose Publishing decided to add a bonus adventure at the end of each gamebook, except for ''[[Flight from the Dark]]''. These bonus adventures feature a supporting character of the main story of the gamebook and have their own set of rules. They are written by different authors with the approbation of Joe Dever who edits and augments their work. Contrary to the main adventures which nearly all have 350 sections, these bonus stories don't have a fixed number of sections.

The skull of Agarash is the first and only (to-date) graphic novel in the Lone Wolf series. The plot involves an ancient artifact called the Skull of Agarash the Damned, which is used by Khadro's band of pirates to wreak havoc. During one of their raids, Lone Wolf's mentor, Lord Rimoah of the Elder Magi, is kidnapped by the rogues, forcing Lone Wolf to pursue them and find their hidden lair.

It was drawn by Cyril Julien (pages 3 to 31) and Brian Williams (pages 32 to 66 and the covers).

The book in now [[out of print]], and is highly valued by many collectors. A digital version was released in July 2005 by [[Project Aon]] adding it to the many other books in the Lone Wolf series released in the same way.

Starting in 2012, Joe Dever released various maps representing the world of Magnamund.

The text includes scenario ideas for creating adventures, with specific briefings tailored to each map board. On March 12, 2014, Cubicle 7 announced that it became the official publisher of these maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = | first = | title = Lone Wolf - Magnamaund Maps Pre-order| work = Cubicle 7| date = 2014-03-12 | url = http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/lone-wolf-magnamund-maps-pre-order/| accessdate = 2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Match fixing]] is when the outcome of a match in organized sports has been manipulated. The reason for fixing a match includes ensuring a certain team advances or gambling. Match fixing is seen as one of the biggest problems in organized sports. This page is a '''list of match fixing incidents'''.

==American football==
*In 1998, four [[Northwestern University]] football players were indicted for lying to a federal [[grand jury]] when they testified they had not placed wagers on their own games in 1994. Only one player—[[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] [[Dennis Lundy]]—was accused of fixing the game. Lundy denied in front of the grand jury to intentionally [[fumble|fumbling]] on a play during a game against the [[University of Iowa]] in 1994. Federal prosecutors attested the fumble was intentional for the purposes of point-shaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dedman |first=Bill |title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL; 4 Are Indicted in Northwestern Football Scandal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/04/sports/college-football-4-are-indicted-in-northwestern-football-scandal.html |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=December 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: On May 6, a federal grand jury in [[Detroit]] indicted six former [[University of Toledo]] athletes—three each from the school's football and basketball programs—on charges of conspiracy to commit sports bribery in relation to their alleged involvement in a point shaving scheme that ran from 2003 through 2006. It is believed to be the first major U.S. gambling case involving two sports at the same college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4146980 |title=Six ex-players charged with conspiracy |first=Mike |last=Fish |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, four former Toledo athletes, including at least one not named in the original indictments, have pleaded guilty on charges related to the scheme. One of these, former Rockets running back Quinton Broussard, admitted he had deliberately fumbled during the [[2005 GMAC Bowl]] against [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]] (a game ultimately won 45–13 by Toledo) in exchange for $500, and had been paid to provide confidential team information to one of the orchestrators of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/6895890/former-toledo-rockets-player-quinton-broussard-pleads-guilty-sports-bribery-investigation |title=Quinton Broussard pleads guilty |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==
{{Further|Match fixing in association football}}

*In 1964, the great [[British betting scandal of 1964|British football betting scandal]] of the 1960s was uncovered. A betting ring organized by [[Jimmy Gauld]] and involving several Football League players had been fixing matches. The most famous incident involved three [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] players, including two England international players, who were subsequently banned from football for life and imprisoned after it was discovered they had bet against their team winning in a match against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. A [[1915 British football betting scandal|similar scandal]] had occurred in 1915.
*[[Totonero 1980|1980 Italian football scandal]] (''"Totonero"''): In May 1980, the largest match fixing scandal in the history of Italian football was uncovered by Italian [[Guardia di Finanza]], after the spalling of two Roman shopkeepers, Alvaro Trinca and Massimo Cruciani, who declared that some Italian football players sold the football-matches for money; implicating, among others, [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. Teams were suspected of rigging games by selecting favorable referees, and even superstar Italian World Cup team goalkeeper [[Enrico Albertosi]] and future [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] winner Paolo Rossi banned with betting on football games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-499301/UEFA-target-betting-mob.html UEFA target betting mob], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 2 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both clubs were forcibly relegated to [[Serie B]] and Milan's president, [[Felice Colombo]], received a life ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4985738.stm Italian FA under emergency rule], [[BBC Sport]], 16 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 1999 a [[Malaysia]]n-based betting syndicate was caught attempting to install a remote-control device to sabotage the floodlights at [[FA Premier League]] team [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[The Valley (London)|ground]] with the aid of a corrupt security officer. If the match had been abandoned after half-time, then the result and bets would have stood. Subsequent investigations showed that the gang had been responsible for previously unsuspected "floodlight failures" at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham's]] [[Boleyn Ground|ground]] in November 1997, and again a month later at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace's]] [[Selhurst Park|ground]] during a home match of Palace's groundsharing tenant [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/422742.stm | work=BBC News | title=Football guard 'bribed for sabotage' | date=1999-08-17 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/426148.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bad bets and blown lights | date=1999-08-20 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Italian Football Federation said in October 2000 it had found eight players guilty of match-fixing. Three were from Serie A side [[Atalanta Bergamo|Atalanta]] and the other five played for Serie B side [[Pistoiese]]. The players were [[Giacomo Banchelli]], [[Cristiano Doni]] and [[Sebastiano Siviglia]] (all Atalanta) and [[Alfredo Aglietti]], [[Massimiliano Allegri]], [[Daniele Amerini]], [[Gianluca Lillo]] and [[Girolamo Bizzarri]] (all Pistoiese). The charges related to an Italian Cup first round tie between the two sides in [[Bergamo]] on August 20, 2000 which ended 1–1. Atalanta scored at the end of the first half and Pistoiese equalised three minutes from full-time. Atalanta qualified for the second round. [[Snai]], which organises betting on Italian football, said later it had registered suspiciously heavy betting on the result and many of the bets were for a 1–0 halftime score and a full-time score of 1–1.
*In 2004, Portuguese Police launched the operation [[Apito Dourado]] and named several Portuguese club presidents and football personalities as suspects of match fixing, including [[FC Porto]]'s chairman [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa|Pinto da Costa]]. Some of the wiretaps used as proof, deemed unusable in court, can now be found on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/330214-fc-porto-leaked-phone-taps-proof-major-corruption-scandal|title=FC Porto: Leaked Phone Taps Proof in Major Corruption Scandal|author=Josep Vernet-Riera|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtqzgmhAOIk|title=Apito Dourado: António Araújo e Augusto Duarte|work=YouTube|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[2004 in sports|June 2004]] in [[South Africa]], thirty-three people (including nineteen [[referee (association football)|referees]], club officials, a match commissioner and an official of the [[South African Football Association]]) were arrested on match-fixing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4396904.stm|title=Anti-sleaze probe collapses |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the summer of 2004, [[Betfair]] provided evidence of race fixing to [[City of London Police]] that led to the arrest of [[jockey]] [[Kieren Fallon]] and fifteen others on race fixing charges.  On 7 December 2007 the judge in the case ordered the jury to find Fallon not guilty on all charges.
* [[Bundesliga scandal (2005)|2005 Bundesliga scandal]]: In [[2005 in sports|January 2005]], the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) and [[Germany|German]] prosecutors launched separate probes into charges that referee [[Robert Hoyzer]] bet on and fixed several matches that he worked, including a [[German Cup]] tie.  Hoyzer later admitted to the allegations; it has been reported that he was involved with [[Croatia|Croat]] gambling syndicates. He also implicated other referees and players in the match fixing scheme. The first arrests in the Hoyzer investigation were made on January 28 in [[Berlin]], and Hoyzer himself was arrested on February 12 after new evidence apparently emerged to suggest that he had been involved in fixing more matches than he had admitted to. Hoyzer has been banned for life from football by the DFB. On March 10, a second referee, Dominik Marks, was arrested after being implicated in the scheme by Hoyzer. Still later (March 24), it was reported that Hoyzer had told investigators that the gambling ring he was involved with had access to [[UEFA]]'s referee assignments for international matches and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Cup]] fixtures several days before UEFA publicly announced them. Ultimately, Hoyzer was sentenced to serve 2 years and 5 months in prison.
* In July 2005, [[Italy|Italian]] [[Serie B]] champions [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] was placed last in the division by the sporting justice, and therefore condemned to relegation in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|Serie C1]], after it was revealed that they bribed their opponents in the final match of the season, [[Venezia A.C.|Venezia]] to throw the match. His president Enrico Preziozi was banned for five years after being guilty by the sporting justice. Genoa won the match 3–2 and had apparently secured promotion to [[Serie A]].
*[[Brazilian football match-fixing scandal]]: In September 2005, a [[Brazil]]ian magazine revealed that two football referees, [[Edílson Pereira de Carvalho]] (a member of [[FIFA]]'s referee staff) and Paulo José Danelon, had accepted bribes to fix matches. Soon afterwards, sport authorities ordered the replaying of 11 matches in the country's top competition, the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Campeonato Brasileiro]], that had been worked by Edílson. Both referees have been banned for life from football and face possible criminal charges. Brazilian supporters have taken to shout "Edílson" at a referee who they consider to have made a bad call against their team, in a reference to the scandal.
*2008 ''The Fix'': Book by [[Declan Hill]] alleges that in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], the group game between Ghana and Italy, the round-of-16 game between Ghana and Brazil, and the Italy-Ukraine quarter-final were all fixed by Asian gambling syndicates to whom the final scores were known in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/world-cup-matches-fixed-says-author/2008/08/31/1220121049179.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=World Cup matches fixed, says author | date=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Football Federation]] (DFB) and [[German Football League]] (DFL) looked into claims made in a ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,575586,00.html|title=Interview with Match-Fixing Investigator Declan Hill: 'I Am Sure the Game Was Manipulated'|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=1 September 2008|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; interview with Hill that two [[Bundesliga]] matches were fixed by [[William Bee Wah Lim]] a fugitive with a 2004 conviction for match-fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerpro.com/the-fix/ |title=Declan Hill "The Fix" match fixing interview |publisher=SoccerPro.com |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131075803/http://soccerpro.com/the-fix/ |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2008: On October 1, it was reported that a [[Spain|Spanish]] judge who headed an investigation against [[Russian Mafia]] figures uncovered information alleging that the mobsters may have attempted to fix the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]] [[2007–08 UEFA Cup knockout stage#Semi-finals|semi-final]] between [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|eventual champion]] [[FC Zenit St. Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].

==Baseball==
*A game in September 1865 which resulted in a 23–11 victory for the [[Eckford of Brooklyn]] over the [[New York Mutuals]] was fixed according to confessions by those involved. Mutuals [[catcher (baseball)|catcher]] [[Bill Wansley]] was approached by gambler Kane McLoughlin to throw the game for $100. Wansley enlisted the help of the Mutuals [[third baseman]] [[Ed Duffy]] who agreed to participate if they included [[shortstop]] [[Tom Devyr]]. Wansley took the two players by [[wagon]] to the [[Hoboken Ferry]] where the payment was divided. Duffy and Devyr both received $30 each and Wansley kept $40 for himself. The fielding of those in on the fix—particularly Wansley's performance—was so poor that rumors of a fix began almost instantly. Wansley had so many [[passed ball]]s during the game that he was moved to [[right field]] in the seventh inning. [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote about the game for the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' and defended Wansley against the fixing allegations. Mutuals players who were not in on the fix became suspicious of Wansley and accused him of "wilful and designated inattention". After a formal investigation, Wansley admitted to the fix and the three players were banned from organized baseball. Devyr was allowed to return in 1867 for a short time before two complaints from opposing teams were filed against the Mutuals. In December 1867 the baseball's [[Commissioner of Baseball|National Commission]] voted to reinstate Devyr. Duffy returned to the Mutuals in 1868, but was not reinstated by the National Commission, which led to one of the Mutuals opponents to file a complaint to void the games Duffy appeared in. The complaint was successful and the Mutuals were briefly expelled from organized baseball. The final convention of the amateur baseball National Commission was held on November 30, 1870. At the convention, Mutuals president John Wildly motioned to reinstate Wansley to good standing which was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Daniel E. |title=The Fix Is In: A History of Baseball Gambling and Game Fixing Scandals |date=2004 |publisher=McFarland |location=North Carolina |isbn=0786419202 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOjvggO19joC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Mutuals players—[[John Hatfield (baseball)|John Hatfield]] and [[Nat Hicks]]—began accusing each other of being in on the fix. Hicks eventually grabbed a [[baseball bat]] and struck Ferguson in the arm which caused it to break. Ferguson, who was also a player as well as an umpire, was unable to play for one year because of the injury. No actions were taken against Hicks or any other player.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1877, four players for the [[Louisville Grays]] were banned from organized baseball for [[1877 Louisville Grays scandal|throwing games]]. ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' sports writer [[John Haldeman]], whose father [[Walter Haldeman]] owned the team, became suspicious of the play of the four members of the Grays and began writing in his columns that he believed the players were purposefully losing. His columns led to a formal investigation and four players—[[Jim Devlin]], [[George Hall (baseball)|George Hall]], [[Al Nichols]] and [[Bill Craver]]—were banned from organized professional baseball for life.

*An [[American League]] game on September 25, 1919 between the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Cleveland Indians]] was fixed according to letters ascertained by league president [[Ban Johnson]] in 1926. The letters were between Detroit [[outfielder]] [[Ty Cobb]] and Cleveland outfielder [[Smokey Joe Wood]]. They were sold to Johnson by [[pitcher (baseball)|pitcher]] [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] who was one of the four players in on the fix along with Cobb, Wood and Cleveland [[player-manager]] [[Tris Speaker]]. According to Leonard, Cobb suggested the players place bets on the game which they had already agreed to fix. Cobb denied placing any bets, but did confess to being involved in the fix. According to a retrospective of events by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in 1989, Leonard went to Johnson with the letters in 1926 after he became embittered at Cobb and Wood whom he felt had a hand in ending his career early. Johnson initially turned Leonard away and he went to Detroit owner [[Frank Navin]] with the letters. Navin advised Johnson to make a payment to Leonard to keep the letters from going public. Johnson then agreed to pay Leonard $20,000 for the letters. Following the 1926 season, Johnson called a secret meeting with Cobb and Speaker, who were the managers of their respective teams. Johnson laid out the facts and advised the men to resign their positions as managers, which both did. Cobb and Speaker both retired from playing in 1928 and neither took another managerial job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holtzman |first1=Jerome |title=Cobb And Speaker Got Themselves Into A Real Fix |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-05-21/sports/8902030567_1_betting-dutch-leonard-ty-cobb |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 21, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] broke the story on December 21, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cobb and Speaker Named in Baseball Expose |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84024315/1926-12-22/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=01%2F01%2F1910&amp;index=1&amp;date2=12%2F31%2F1950&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;SearchType=prox10&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Fixed+fixed+fixing+Game+game&amp;proxdistance=10&amp;to_year=1950&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;from_year=1910&amp;proxtext=fixed+game&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=The Republican-Journal |date=December 22, 1926 |location=Ogdensburg, New York |page=1|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1919, gamblers bribed several members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] to throw the [[World Series]].  This became known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]] and was recounted in book and movie form as ''[[Eight Men Out]]''.
*Following the 1919 [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) season, [[first baseman]] [[Babe Borton]] alleged that as a member of the pennant winning [[Vernon Tigers]], he was party to pay-offs to all other PCL teams to ensure they would lose to Vernon. Borton alleged that every member of the Tigers pooled their money to make the pay-offs. Nate Raymond of [[Seattle, Washington]] was responsible for the payments according to Borton. [[Seattle Indians]] first baseman Rod Murphy alleged that Raymond offered him a $2,000 bribe during the 1920 season and confided that during the 1919 season he won $50,000 from gambling on fixed PCL games. Ultimately no player was charged with fixing games because there were no state statutes that were violated. The PCL banned several players for life, but some like [[Bill Rumler]] was reinstated after several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Figone |first1=Al |title=The 1919 Pacific Coast League Fixing Scandal: The "Black Sox" Had Nothing on Babe Borton |journal=North American Society for Sport History |date=1996 |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP1996/NP1996zh.pdf |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their role in the alleged plot, the five players—Bill Thomas, Lanny Pecou, Alvin W. Kaiser, Paul Fugit and Don Vettorel—were banned from [[professional baseball]] for life. An investigation of the alleged actions of the five players by [[Society for American Baseball Research]] writer George W. Hilton found little proof that there was any match-fixing. One of the accused players, Bill Thomas, [[pitcher|pitched]] a perfect 5–0 record in the playoffs. Hilton conducted an interview with an unnamed player in the Evangeline League who claimed he was approached to be a part of the fixing scheme, but declined.

In an interview with Garbey, ''Herald'' writer Peter Richmond brought up match-fixing allegations and Garbey admitted to playing a part in the scheme. Garbey was allowed to continue his minor league career, but the Tigers were prevented from calling him up by ruling of the [[Commissioner of Baseball|National Commission]] president [[John H.

This plan was not motivated by gambling, but was instead meant to manipulate tie-breaking rules for Somerset's benefit and assure qualification for the quarterfinals of the tournament. Although the plan was not against the letter of the rules, it was widely condemned by both media and cricket officials, and Somerset was expelled from that year's tournament in response.

He also named [[Saleem Malik]] ([[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]]), [[Mohammed Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] ([[Indian cricket team|India]]). Jadeja was banned for 4 years.

Both ddz and Lance were removed from the Arrow Gaming and the rest of the team disbanded one day later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.joindota.com/en/news/22341-arrow-involved-in-sea-matchfixing|title=Arrow involved in SEA matchfixing « News|last=freaks4u.com|first=Freaks 4U Gaming GmbH,|website=joinDOTA.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/news/28858-ddz-admits-involvement-in-matchfixing-says-evidence-faked-by-arrow-s-manager|title=DDZ admits involvement in matchfixing, says evidence faked by Arrow's manager|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handball==
*In 2012, several [[French people|French]] [[handball]] players from the [[Montpellier Handball|Montpellier]] club were arrested on allegations they fixed matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Montpellier players arrested over match-fixing |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-handball-montpellier/montpellier-players-arrested-over-match-fixing-idUSBRE88T0EN20120930?feedType=RSSandamp;feedName=sportsNews |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=Reuters |date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the French government pressed charges against the alleged Montpellier fixers who included [[Olympic medal]]ist [[Nikola Karabatic]], his brother [[Luka Karabatic]] and six others Montpellier players. Prosecutors alleged Montpellier, who had already sealed the French handball championship, purposefully lost to [[Cesson Rennes MHB|Cesson]] in May 2012. French authorities were tipped off to the alleged fix when discovering that over 100,000 [[euros]] in bets had been placed on the low-stakes game that prosecutors contend should have only garnered a few thousand euros in wagers. In July 2015, the 16 people indicted by French authorities for their part in the match fixing scandal—including the Karabatic brothers—were found guilty. Nikola Karabatic was fined 10,000 euros and the largest fine on 30,000 euros went to [[Mladen Bojinovic]]. None of the people were given jail sentences, despite the prosecutors request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French handball star Karabatic found guilty of match-fixing |url=http://en.rfi.fr/sports/20150711-french-handball-player-found-guilty-match-fixing |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=Radio France Internationale |date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karabatic brothers appealed the decision and in 2017, but lost and a new ruling made by the Disciplinary Committee of the [[French Handball Federation]] required Nikola Karabatic to sit out six games and Luka Karabatic to sit out two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Szekeres |first1=Ibolya |title=New verdict in match-fixing case of Karabatic brothers |url=http://timeoutmag.com/2017/11/12/new-verdict-in-match-fixing-case-of-karabatic-brothers/ |website=timeoutmag.com |publisher=Time Out Magazine |accessdate=July 26, 2018 |date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorsport==
[[File:Nelson Piquet 2009 Australia.jpg|thumb|[[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] admitted to [[Renault Formula One crash controversy|intentionally wrecking his Formula One car]] during a 2008 race.]]
*In September 2009, [[Formula 1]] driver [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] admitted to have intentionally wrecked his race-car during the [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]] due to team orders. It gave an advantage to his teammate [[Fernando Alonso]] who went on to win the race. Following a lawsuit by the [[Renault F1|Renault Formula 1 team]] against the Piquet family, a judge ruled in Piquet's favor due to overwhelming evidence against the team; fining the Renault Formula 1 team millions, lliquidating various employees, banning the team from Formula 1 for 2 years (on suspended sentence) and various key members of Renault Formula 1 team being banned for life (which was later appealed).

*In the [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]], the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400]] was scandalized by [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400#Race manipulation controversy|extensive manipulation of the race results]] by three teams—[[Michael Waltrip Racing]], [[Penske Racing]], and [[Front Row Motorsports]]—in an attempt to ensure that MWR and Penske drivers would earn places in the [[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. When the manipulation was discovered, NASCAR imposed unprecedented penalties that knocked [[Martin Truex Jr.]], one of the intended beneficiaries, out of the Chase, and also gave [[Jeff Gordon]], an unwitting victim of the manipulation, a 13th place in the normally 12-driver Chase.

==Snooker==
:{{main|List of snooker players investigated for match-fixing}}
*In 2009, [[snooker]] player [[Stephen Maguire]] acknowledged through his management company that police had questioned him about allegations of match-fixing at the [[UK Championship]] in [[Telford, England]] on December 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Maguire interviewed by Police Fraud Squad |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/snooker/5190915/Stephen-Maguire-interviewed-by-Police-Fraud-Squad.html |accessdate=27 July 2018 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2010, allegations were made by the [[United Kingdom|British]] newspaper ''[[News of the World]]'' that [[snooker]] champion [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] had accepted a [[Pound sterling|£]]261,000 bribe from undercover reporters in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] to throw frames.

*In 2016, [[Ireland|Irish]] snooker player [[Leo Fernandez]] was banned from the sport for 15 months by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA) for manipulating part of a match. While it was not a full manipulation of the match's outcome, Fernandez had contact with people that placed a [[prop bet]] which said he would chose to shoot the first foul shot of the game. Fernandez did opt to take first foul shot, thus making the bet successful. The WPBSA ruled that was a violation of their corruption bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leo Fernandez handed 15-month ban after admitting corruption charge |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/36722680 |accessdate=27 July 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
*In 2007, [[France|French]] tennis player [[Arnaud Clément]] claimed he was offered a bribe to fix a match, which he turned down, but added, "I won't say where or under what circumstances". Clément feared divulging more details on the bribe would have negative consequences on his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I turned down bribe to fix match, says Clement |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/i-turned-down-bribe-to-fix-match-says-clement-20071031-gdrh2h.html |accessdate=27 July 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |agency=Associated Press |date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In June 2018, [[Argentinian]] tennis player [[Nicolas Kicker]] was banned from the sport for at least three years for match-fixing.

==Volleyball==
*During the qualifying period for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the [[Japan women's national volleyball team]] came under scrutiny for allegedly throwing a match against [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in order to get a better Olympic seeding. The [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball]] cleared Japan in May 2012 and the team was allowed to compete in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan's volleyball team cleared |url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/volleyball/story/_/id/7987315/japan-women-volleyball-cleared-fixing-2012-london-olympics-qualifier |accessdate=July 26, 2018 |work=ESPN.com |agency=Associated Press |date=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2012, the [[Korea Volleyball Federation]] expelled four [[South Korea]]n volleyball players for life after its disciplinary panel found evidence they took part in fixing matches.

The promotion, under the sub-name ''Low Blows Wrestling Parties'', hosts regular wrestling-themed parties in Dublin which follow [[WWE|WWE's]] [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view schedule]], specifically [[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]] and [[Survivor Series]]. They also host bi-annual live podcasts in Dublin.

== History ==
Low Blows began in April 2012 as an entity specifically tailored towards hosting WWE pay-per-view parties at Captain America's restaurant in Dublin. Then called ''WWE Parties Ireland'', the budding company began as a Facebook page out to be '"a hub for wrestling fans to chat &amp; have a laugh",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WWEIreland/posts/135406596596927|title=Sooo...who's up for a party this... - Low Blows Wrestling Parties {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also provided a platform to promote independent wrestling shows around the country from brands such as Main Stage Wrestling and Celtic Championship Wrestling. At this stage, future host Rick Nash would begin to provide his own insights and critique on the WWE product via his wrestling blog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thericknash.blogspot.ie/2012/07/cm-punk-and-how-landscape-of-wrestling.html|title=CM Punk and How The Landscape of Wrestling Has Changed|website=thericknash.blogspot.ie|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which he would also announce details of future events hosted by the company.

In April 2013, following their second successful WrestleMania party, the company began to host their own 'Hall of Fame' ceremony&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Gerard Leggett|title=WWE Parties Hall of Fame Ceremony|date=2013-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7--ophl9OM|accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (mimicking the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWE Hall of Fame Ceremony]] carried out during the weekend of WrestleMania each year). It was at this stage that the popularity of the events began to outweigh the capacity of Captain America's, and as a result future events were announced to be staged in Woolshed Baa and Grill on Parnell Street, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WWEIreland/photos/a.137593126378274.28656.114162802054640/265836870220565/?type=3|title=You spoke, we listened.

Following continued success, Nash's critical articles garnered the attention of Irish sports outlet Balls.ie, who offered Nash a position as their professional wrestling correspondent beginning in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.balls.ie/uncategorized/kingofthering-83909|title=The King is Dead, Long Live The King (Of The Ring)|last=Nash|first=Rick|work=Balls.ie|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this position, Nash was able to extend the reach of the events through pay-per-view prediction leagues in his articles, the winner of which would be given complimentary access to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WWEIreland/posts/293096860827899|title=WWE PAYBACK PREDICTION CONTEST: ➟ Winner... - Low Blows Wrestling Parties {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitions were also able to be held throughout relevant news outlets, further promoting the brand and its events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.ie/competitions/display.asp?CompID=8083|title=Win tickets to the WWE WrestleMania 31 screening party at Woolshed Baa &amp; Grill - entertainment.ie|last=Entertainment.ie|work=entertainment.ie|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.balls.ie/american-sports/win-2-tickets-watch-wwe-wrestlemania-31-woolshed-dublin-240809|title=WIN 2 Tickets To Watch WWE WrestleMania 31 In Woolshed Dublin|last=Nash|first=Rick|work=Balls.ie|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, in anticipation of their first WrestleMania event at the Woolshed venue, the first episode of Low Blows was released hosted by Nash and Don Marnell (now commentator for OTT Wrestling), an inductee of the company's hall of fame from the year prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WWEIreland/posts/421021428035441|title=4 DAYS UNTIL #WoolshedMania!

In February 2016, in an effort to distance themselves away from WWE and cultivate the Low Blows brand established with the podcast and their [https://twitter.com/hashtaglowblows twitter handle], the company was officially rebranded to Low Blows Wrestling Parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WWEIreland/photos/a.137593126378274.28656.114162802054640/727296587407922/?type=3|title=For the fifth time, this April we bring... - Low Blows Wrestling Parties {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing new branding to their events as of WrestleMania 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thingstodoindublin-ireland.com/event/wwe-wrestlemania-32-at-woolshed-baa-grill/|title=WWE WrestleMania 32 at Woolshed Baa &amp; Grill - Dublin Event Guide|work=Dublin Event Guide|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the company hosted a campaign on behalf of a five-year-old Max Birmingham, who was then suffering from a relapse of stage four [[Neuroblastoma|neuroblastoma cancer]]. Because of his fascination with wrestling, Max's mother contacted the company asking for any spare memorabilia that people could give while Max is in treatment as a means of distraction from his treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/wrestling-toys-for-max-2813842-Jun2016/|title=A campaign wants you to give old wrestling toys to a five-year-old boy who has cancer|last=Hosford|first=Paul|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the company's Money in the Bank party was labelled with '[https://twitter.com/search?q=%23memorabiliaformax&amp;src=typd #MemorabiliaForMax]', and there was a collection of toys made to be donated to Max. Nash had to say on the matter "“Max and his family aren’t looking for money, just toys that people already have and can afford to give away. It’s something so small for people, but it’d make a huge difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.lalalay.com/news/world/ireland/-15064-a-campaign-wants-you-to-give-old-wrestling-toys-to-a-five-year-old-boy-who-has-cancer/|title=A campaign wants you to give old wrestling toys to a five-year-old boy who has cancer|work=СМИ Express|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was so impactful that it drew the attention of [[Mick Foley|WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley]], who tweeted his support for the event saying "Please let me know where I can send Max some cool things".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/RealMickFoley/status/740974684443975680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw|title=Mick Foley on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
Low Blows in its current format is presented as 2 separate weekly shows, ''SmackJade'' and ''Raw in Fast Forward.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lowblows.podbean.com/|title=Low Blows|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SmackJade'' is hosted by Nash and professional wrestler Jade Costello, and focuses on wrestling news that has transpired over the course of the week. ''Raw in Fast Forward'' is hosted again by Nash and sports persona David Kent, and offers a more in depth view of WWE programming with specific focus on [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]].

Both shows, while offering a critical view on the world of professional wrestling, are maintained in a lighthearted manner, often employing [[Comedy skit|comedic bits]] which are segmented throughout the show and rely on [[audience participation]]. Current segments include 'Dave's Mystery PPV' (a segment where listeners must guess an unidentified pay-per-view through a series of clues)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lowblows.podbean.com/e/raw-in-fast-forward-153-he-who-makes-lists/|title=Raw In Fast Forward 15/3: Maryse's Blow-Up Doll|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '30 second warning' (a segment where listeners ring in to face off against the hosts in an attempt to win tickets to a future event).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lowblows.podbean.com/e/smackjade-203-hanging-five-highing-ten/|title=#SmackJade 20/3: Hanging Five &amp; Highing Ten|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During live podcasts, the format will typically follow a panel-style where the audience asks questions to the hosts and any special guests they might have featured.  On establishing the live podcasts, Marnell stated "Six months ago, Rick Nash approached me about co-hosting a wrestling comedy podcast -a niche market you might say. Here we are 20 episodes later and we are preparing to host our first live episode in front of an audience. Has anyone hosted a live comedy wrestling podcast before Probably not, but we’re going to give it a bash anyway!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.krank.ie/category/ent/cul/live-comedy-wrestling-podcast-low-blows-expected/|title=Live Comedy Wrestling Podcast: Low Blows Expected - Krank.ie|website=www.krank.ie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pay-Per-View Parties ==
The origins of Low Blows lie within the WWE pay-per-view parties hosted during the 'big four' pay-per-view events Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series. These were initially held at Captain America's restaurant on Grafton Street  before being moved to Woolshed Baa and Grill due to capacity issues. As of 2017, the parties have again been moved to Buskers on the Ball due to legal issues following the 2017 Royal Rumble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WWEIreland/posts/918858281585084|title=WrestleMania 33 party tickets in our NEW... - Low Blows Wrestling Parties {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dizzy Fingers Sheet Music Cover 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The sheet music for "Dizzy Fingers" by Zez Confrey, one of the most popular of the novelty piano composers.]]'''Novelty Piano''' is a [[genre]] of piano and [[novelty music]] that was popular during the 1920s.

A successor to [[ragtime]] and an outgrowth of the [[piano roll]] music of the 1910s, '''novelty piano''' can be considered a pianistic cousin of [[jazz]], which appeared around the same time. "Nola," a 1915 composition by New York pianist [[Felix Arndt]], is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, had their headquarters.  Though also often highly syncopated, it is distinct from [[stride piano]], which was developed in New York at about the same time.

The earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists looking to sell piano rolls. These pieces started out as highly complex rags with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmonies. The pioneer of this style was [[Charley Straight]], whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confrey's novelty hits. Early [[Charley Straight]] novelties include
S'more," "Playmor," "Nifty Nonsense," "Rufenreddy," and "Wild And Wooly."

Novelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of [[Zez Confrey|Zez Confrey's]] "Kitten on the Keys".  The popularity of this piece quickly led to other Confrey works including "Dizzy Fingers" and "Greenwich Witch", and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces.  The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated.  Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved off center stage and took on more of a "support" role.

Although novelty piano has structural and stylistic similarities to the earlier ragtime form, there are also distinct differences.  Ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, so it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by the competent amateur.  By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the "hand-played" piano roll and the phonograph record.  Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music.  It was a new "turbo-charged" piano form, shorn of hackneyed, Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic piano roll flourishes, and influenced by the "modernistic" sounds of the art-deco twenties (which were themselves largely adopted from the French "Impressionist" pianists such as Debussy and Satie; "novelty" pianists tended to be highly classically trained, so were fully familiar with such "modern" pianists, and their fondness for complex chordal intricacies).

Prominent artists in the novelty piano genre include [[Zez Confrey]], [[Charley Straight]], [[Roy Bargy]], Pauline Alpert, [[Fred Elizalde]], [[Rube Bloom]], [[Clement Doucet]], [[Max Kortlander]], and [[Billy Mayerl]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3956">'''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is an instructional bass line with either [[figured bass]] or [[unfigured bass]]. Partimenti were used mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries as pedagogical aids for the teaching of harmony, counterpoint and improvisation.

== History ==
The Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in the [[Music conservatories of Naples|Naples conservatories]] and then spread throughout Europe. Notable Partimento collections were written by [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Francesco Durante]], [[Leonardo Leo]], [[Fedele Fenaroli]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Nicola Sala]], [[Giacomo Tritto]], [[Stanislao Mattei]], and [[Luigi Palmerini]]. Many important Italian composers emerged from the Partimento schools, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]]. The rediscovery of the Partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.

== Function ==
Partimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]], [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). There is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition. The beginners’ partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue]]s. Partimenti were also used as bass lines in written counterpoint exercises, over which students wrote two-, three, and four-part “disposizione” (multistave settings).

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}

'''Pascal's Wager''' is an argument in philosophy presented by the seventeenth-century [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Connor |first= James A. |date= 2006 |title= Pascal's wager : the man who played dice with God |location= San Francisco |publisher= HarperSanFrancisco |pages= 180–1 |isbn= 9780060766917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that humans bet with their lives that God either [[Existence of God|exists]] or does not.

Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in [[Heaven]]) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in [[Hell]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Blaise Pascal", ''Columbia History of Western Philosophy'', page 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal's Wager was based on the idea of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], though similar arguments have occurred [[#Variations|in other religious traditions]]. The original wager was set out in section 233 of Pascal's posthumously published ''[[Pensées]]'' ("Thoughts"). These previously unpublished notes were assembled to form an incomplete [[treatise]] on [[Christian apologetics]].

Historically, Pascal's Wager was groundbreaking because it charted new territory in [[probability theory]],&lt;ref name="chance and infinity"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/friday-phil-pascals-wager/|title=A Logical Infinite: The Constrained Probabilistic Definitions of Chance and Infinity in Blaise Pascal's Famous Wager|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 18, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the first formal use of [[decision theory]], and anticipated future philosophies such as [[existentialism]], [[pragmatism]] and [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]].&lt;ref name="SEP entry"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/index.html|title=Pascal's Wager|last=Hájek|first=Alan|date=November 6, 2012|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Wager==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
The Wager uses the following logic (excerpts from ''Pensées'', part III, §233):

#God is, or God is not. Reason cannot decide between the two alternatives.
#A Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up.
#You must wager (it is not optional).
#Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing.
#Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. (...) There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our proposition is of infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
#But some cannot believe. They should then 'at least learn your inability to believe...' and 'Endeavour then to convince' themselves.

Pascal asks the reader to analyze humankind's position, where our actions can be enormously consequential but our understanding of those consequences is flawed. While we can discern a great deal through reason, we are ultimately forced to gamble. Pascal cites a number of distinct areas of uncertainty in human life:

|}
Pascal describes humanity as a finite being trapped within an incomprehensible infinity, briefly thrust into being from non-being, with no explanation of "Why?" or "What?" or "How?" On Pascal's view, human finitude constrains our ability to reliably achieve truth.

Given that reason alone cannot determine whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, even if we do not know the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.

In Pascal's assessment, participation in this wager is not optional. Merely by existing in a state of uncertainty, we are forced to choose between the available courses of action for practical purposes.

==Explanation==
The ''Pensées'' passage on Pascal's Wager is as follows:

{{quote|If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is....

..."God is, or He is not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager? According to reason, you can do neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend neither of the propositions.

Do not, then, reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know nothing about it. "No, but I blame them for having made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he who chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. The true course is not to wager at all."

Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.

"That is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much." Let us see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But if there were three lives to gain, you would have to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_272_on_20110506051909"/&gt;}}

Pascal begins by painting a situation where both the existence and non-existence of God are impossible to prove by [[Reason|human reason]]. So, supposing that reason cannot determine the truth between the two options, one must "wager" by weighing the possible consequences. Pascal's assumption is that, when it comes to making the decision, no one can refuse to participate; withholding assent is impossible because we are already "embarked", effectively living out the choice.

We only have two things to stake, our "reason" and our "happiness". Pascal considers that if there is "''equal'' risk of loss and gain" (i.e. a coin toss), then human reason is powerless to address the question of whether God exists. That being the case, then human reason can only decide the question according to possible resulting happiness of the decision, weighing the gain and loss in believing that God exists and likewise in believing that God does not exist.

He points out that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of happiness and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness for the possibility of gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain [[Immortality|eternal life]] if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..."

===Inability to believe===
Pascal addressed the difficulty that '[[reason]]' and '[[rationality]]' pose to genuine belief by proposing that "acting as if [one] believed" could "cure [one] of unbelief":

{{quote|quote=But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour then to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of your passions. You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.&lt;ref&gt;Pensées Section III note 233, Translation by W. F. Trotter&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Analysis with decision theory===
The possibilities defined by Pascal's Wager can be thought of as a [[decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision under uncertainty]] with the values of the following [[decision matrix]].
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;width100%;"
|-
|
! God exists (G)
! God does not exist (¬G)
|-
! Belief (B)
| +∞ (infinite gain)
| −1 (finite loss)
|-
! Disbelief (¬B)
| −∞ (infinite loss)
| +1 (finite gain)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Given these values, the option of living as if God exists (B) dominates the option of living as if God does not exist (¬B), as long as one assumes a positive probability that God exists. In other words, the expected value gained by choosing B is greater than or equal to that of choosing ¬B.

In fact, according to decision theory, the only value that matters in the above matrix is the +∞ (infinitely positive).  Any matrix of the following type (where f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are all negative or finite positive numbers) results in (B) as being the only rational decision.&lt;ref name="SEP entry" /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|
! God exists (G)
! God does not exist (¬G)
|-
! Belief (B)
| +∞
| f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Disbelief (¬B)
| f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
| f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Misunderstanding of the wager===
Many criticisms have explained that the wager has been used as a supposed theory of the necessity to believe, although that was never Pascal's intention. As Laurent Thirouin writes: 
{{quote|The celebrity of fragment 418 has been established at the price of a mutilation. By titling this text "the wager", readers have been fixated only on one part of Pascal's reasoning. It doesn't conclude with a QED at the end of the mathematical part. The unbeliever who had provoked this long analysis to counter his previous objection ("Maybe I bet too much") is still not ready to join the apologist on the side of faith. He put forward two new objections, undermining the foundations of the wager: the impossibility to know, and the obligation of playing.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Thiroin, Le hasard et les règles, le modèle du jeu dans la pensée de Pascal, Vrin, Paris 1991, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;}}
To be put at the beginning of Pascal's planned book, the wager was meant to show that logical reasoning cannot support faith or lack thereof, {{quote|We have to accept reality and accept the reaction of the libertine when he rejects arguments he is unable to counter. The conclusion is evident: if men believe or refuse to believe, it is not how some believers sometimes say and most unbelievers claim, because their own reason justifies the position they have adopted. Belief in God doesn't depend upon rational evidence, no matter which position.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Thiroin, Le hasard et les règles, le modèle du jeu dans la pensée de Pascal, Vrin, Paris 1991, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;}}Pascal's intended book was precisely to find other ways to establish the value of faith, an apology for the Christian faith.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Pascal's Wager began in his own day, and came from both atheists, who questioned the 'benefits' of a deity whose 'realm' is beyond reason, and the religiously orthodox, who primarily took issue with the wager's [[deism|deistic]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] language. It is criticized for not proving God's existence, the encouragement of false belief, and the problem of which religion and which God should be worshipped.&lt;ref name="chance and infinity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The God Delusion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|publisher=Black Swan|date=May 21, 2007|title=[[The God Delusion]]|pages=130–132|chapter=Chapter 3: Arguments for God's existence|isbn=9780552773317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Should probably source criticisms to J.

===Nature as not a proof of the existence of God=== 
[[Voltaire]] (another prominent French writer of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), a generation after Pascal, rejected the idea that the wager was "proof of God" as "indecent and childish", adding, "the interest I have to believe a thing is no proof that such a thing exists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/22/07_Pascal.html|title=Remarques (Premiéres) sur les Pensées de Pascal|last=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire|year=1728|website=Oeuvres Complétes de Voltaire|series=Mélanges I|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418162422/http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/22/07_Pascal.html|archive-date=April 18, 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal, however, did not advance the wager as a proof of God's existence but rather as a necessary pragmatic decision which is "impossible to avoid" for any living person.&lt;ref name="Durant-Voltaire"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that abstaining from making a wager is not an option and that "reason is incapable of divining the truth"; thus, a decision of whether to believe in the existence of God must be made by "considering the consequences of each possibility".

Voltaire's critique concerns not the nature of the Pascalian wager as proof of God's existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing. Voltaire hints at the fact that Pascal, as a [[Jansenist]], believed that only a small, and already predestined, portion of humanity would eventually be saved by God.

Voltaire explained that no matter how far someone is tempted with rewards to believe in Christian salvation, the result will be at best a faint belief.&lt;ref&gt;Vous me promettez l’empire du monde si je crois que vous avez raison: je souhaite alors, de tout mon coeur, que vous ayez raison; mais jusqu’à ce que vous me l’ayez prouvé, je ne puis vous croire. […] J’ai intérêt, sans doute, qu’il y ait un Dieu; mais si dans votre système Dieu n’est venu que pour si peu de personnes; si le petit nombre des élus est si effrayant; si je ne puis rien du tout par moi-même, dites-moi, je vous prie, quel intérêt j’ai à vous croire? N’ai-je pas un intérêt visible à être persuadé du contraire? De quel front osez-vous me montrer un bonheur infini, auquel d’un million d’hommes un seul à peine a droit d’aspirer?&lt;/ref&gt;  Pascal, in his Pensees, agrees with this, not stating that people can choose to believe (and therefore make a safe wager), but rather that some cannot believe.

As [[Étienne Souriau]] explained, in order to accept Pascal's argument, the bettor needs to be certain that God seriously intends to honour the bet; he says that the Wager assumes that God also accepts the bet, which is not proved; Pascal's bettor is here like the fool who seeing a leaf floating on a river's waters and quivering at some point, for a few seconds, between the two sides of a stone, says: "I bet a million with Rothschild that it takes finally the left path." And, effectively, the leaf passed on the left side of the stone, but unfortunately for the fool Rothschild never said "I [will take that] bet".&lt;ref&gt;À vrai dire le célèbre pari de Pascal, ou plutôt le pari que Pascal propose au libertin n'est pas une option désintéressée mais un pari de joueur. Si le libertin joue «croix», parie que Dieu existe, il gagne (si Dieu existe) la vie éternelle et la béatitude infinie, et risque seulement de perdre les misérables plaisirs de sa vie actuelle. Cette mise ne compte pas au regard du gain possible qui est infini. Seulement, l'argument suppose que Dieu accepte le pari, que Dieu dit «je tiens». Sans quoi, nous dit Souriau, le libertin « est comme ce fou : il voit une feuille au fil de l'eau, hésiter entre deux côtés d'un caillou. Il dit : «je parie un million avec Rothschild qu'elle passera à droite». La feuille passe à droite et le fou dit : «j'ai gagné un million». Où est sa folie? Ce n'est pas que le million n'existe pas, c'est que Rothschild n'a pas dit : «je tiens». ». (Cf. l'admirable analyse du pari de Pascal in Souriau, L'ombre de Dieu, p. 47 sq.) – La Philosophie, Tome 2 (La Connaissance), Denis Huisman, André Vergez, Marabout 1994, pp. 462–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from inconsistent revelations===
{{main|Argument from inconsistent revelations}}
Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the Wager, in an argument known as the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]]. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in "the wrong god", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.&lt;ref name="chance and infinity" /&gt; [[Denis Diderot]], a contemporary of Voltaire, concisely expressed this opinion when asked about the Wager, saying "an [[Imam]] could reason the same way".&lt;ref name="Diderot"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. L. Mackie]] notes that "the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]], but perhaps that of the [[Anabaptists]] or members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] or the [[Sunni Muslims|Muslim Sunnis]] or the worshipers of [[Kali]] or of [[Odin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]] (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism'', Oxford, pg. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of this objection argues that for every religion that promulgates rules, there exists another religion that has rules of the opposite kind. If a certain action leads one closer to salvation in the former religion, it leads one further away from it in the latter. Therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion could be negative. Or, one could also argue that there are an infinite number of mutually exclusive religions (which is a subset of the set of all possible religions), and that the probability of any one of them being true is zero; therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion is zero.

Pascal considers this type of objection briefly in the notes compiled into the ''Pensées'', and dismisses it as obviously wrong and disingenuous:&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, David (1994). ''Pascal and Disbelief: Catechesis and Conversion in the Pensées''. Washington, D. C.: The Catholic University of America Press, p. 117. {{ISBN|0-8132-1328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=What say [the unbelievers] then? "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail. That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;}}

This short but densely packed passage, which alludes to numerous themes discussed elsewhere in the ''Pensées'', has given rise to many pages of scholarly analysis.

Pascal says that unbelievers who rest content with the many-religions objection are people whose scepticism has seduced them into a fatal "repose". If they were really bent on knowing the truth, they would be persuaded to examine "in detail" whether Christianity is like any other religion, but they just cannot be bothered.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objection might be sufficient were the subject concerned merely some "question in philosophy", but not "here, where everything is at stake". In "a matter where they themselves, their eternity, their all are concerned",&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_226 ''Pensée'' #226]&lt;/ref&gt; they can manage no better than "a superficial reflection" ("une reflexion légère") and, thinking they have scored a point by asking a [[leading question]], they go off to amuse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Pascal scholars observe, Pascal regarded the many-religions objection as a rhetorical ploy, a "trap"&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', pp. 118 (quotation from Jean Mesnard), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; that he had no intention of falling into. If, however, any who raised it were sincere, they would want to examine the matter "in detail". In that case, they could get some pointers by turning to his chapter on "other religions".

As David Wetsel notes, Pascal's treatment of the pagan religions is brisk: "As far as Pascal is concerned, the demise of the pagan religions of antiquity speaks for itself. Those pagan religions which still exist in the New World, in India, and in Africa are not even worth a second glance. They are obviously the work of superstition and ignorance and have nothing in them which might interest 'les gens habiles' ('clever men')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_251 ''Pensée'' #251]&lt;/ref&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam warrants more attention, being distinguished from paganism (which for Pascal presumably includes all the other non-Christian religions) by its claim to be a revealed religion. Nevertheless, Pascal concludes that the religion founded by Mohammed can on several counts be shown to be devoid of divine authority, and that therefore, as a path to the knowledge of God, it is as much a dead end as paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism, in view of its close links to Christianity, he deals with elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The many-religions objection is taken more seriously by some later [[apologist]]s of the Wager, who argue that, of the rival options, only those awarding infinite happiness affect the Wager's [[dominance (game theory)|dominance]]. In the opinion of these apologists "finite, semi-blissful promises such as Kali's or Odin's" therefore drop out of consideration.&lt;ref name="SEP entry" /&gt;  Also, the infinite bliss that the rival conception of God offers has to be mutually exclusive.  If Christ's promise of bliss can be attained concurrently with [[Jehovah]]'s and [[Allah]]'s (all three being identified as the [[Abrahamic religions|God of Abraham]]), there is no conflict in the decision matrix in the case where the cost of believing in the wrong conception of God is neutral (limbo/purgatory/spiritual death), although this would be countered with an infinite cost in the case where not believing in the correct conception of God results in punishment (hell).&lt;ref name="IEP entry"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/pasc-wag/|title=Pascal's Wager about God|last=Saka|first=Paul|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[ecumenical]] interpretations of the Wager&lt;ref&gt;For example: Jeff Jordan, ''Gambling on God: Essays on Pascal's Wager'', 1994, Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that it could even be suggested that believing in a generic God, or a god by the wrong name, is acceptable so long as that conception of God has similar essential characteristics of the conception of God considered in Pascal's Wager (perhaps the [[Aristotelian view of God|God of Aristotle]]).  Proponents of this line of reasoning suggest that either all of the conceptions of God or gods throughout history truly boil down to just a small set of "genuine options", or that if Pascal's Wager can simply bring a person to believe in "generic theism" it has done its job.&lt;ref name="IEP entry" /&gt;

Pascal argues implicitly for the uniqueness of Christianity in the Wager itself, writing: "If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible...Who then can blame the Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, professing as they do a religion which they cannot explain by reason?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/pascal_wager.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from inauthentic belief===
Some critics argue that Pascal's Wager, for those who cannot believe, suggests feigning belief to gain eternal reward. This would be dishonest and immoral. In addition, it is absurd to think that God, being just and omniscient, would not see through this deceptive strategy on the part of the "believer", thus nullifying the benefits of the Wager.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;

Since these criticisms are concerned not with the validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, "I am so made that I cannot believe. What would you have me do?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_233 ''Pensée'' #233]&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: "God looks only at what is inward."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_904 ''Pensée'' #904]&lt;/ref&gt; For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.

Explicitly addressing the question of inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the Wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: "your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [believe] and yet you cannot, [comes] from your passions." This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: "Learn from those who were bound like you. . . . Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—'But this is what I am afraid of.'—And why? What have you to lose?"&lt;ref&gt;''Pensée'' #233. Gérard Ferreyrolles, ed. Paris: Librairie Générale Française, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other critics have objected to Pascal's Wager on the grounds that he wrongly assumes what type of epistemic character God would likely value in his rational creatures if he existed. More specifically, [[Richard Carrier]] has objected by positing an alternative conception of God that prefers his creatures to be honest inquirers and disapproves of thoughtless or feigned belief:

{{quote box|quote=Suppose there is a god who is watching us and choosing which souls of the deceased to bring to heaven, and this god really does want only the morally good to populate heaven. He will probably select from only those who made a significant and responsible effort to discover the truth. . .Therefore, only such people can be sufficiently moral and trustworthy to deserve a place in heaven — unless God wishes to fill heaven with the morally lazy, irresponsible, or untrustworthy.

==Variations==
*Muslim [[Imamah (Shia)|Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] is recorded to have postulated variations of the Wager on several occasions in different forms, including his famed 'Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit.'&lt;ref&gt; Al-Islam.org. (2017). Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit. https://www.al-islam.org/tradition-myrobalan-fruit-hadith-al-halila-imam-jafar-al-sadiq/hadith&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Shia Islam|Sh'i'i]] [[hadith]] book [[Al-Kafi|al-Kafi]], al-Sadiq declares to an atheist "If what you say is correct – and it is not – then we will both succeed. But if what I say is correct – and it is – then I will succeed, and you will be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;al-Kulainī, M. (1982). al- Kāfī. Tehran: Group of Muslim Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An instantiation of this [[argument]], within the Islamic ''kalam'' tradition, was discussed by [[Al-Juwayni|Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni]] (d. 478/1085) in his ''Kitab al-irshad ila-qawati al-adilla fi usul al-i'tiqad'', or ''A Guide to the Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief''.&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Juwayni]] ''A Guide to Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Anyone want to write a little about what makes Juwayni's argument different from Pascal's? --&gt;
*The [[Sophist]] [[Protagoras]] had an agnostic position regarding the gods, but he nevertheless continued to worship the gods. This could be considered as an early version of the Wager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Socrates &amp; the fat rabbis|last= Boyarin|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Boyarin|year=2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-06916-8|page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the famous tragedy of [[Euripides]] ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'', [[Kadmos]] states an early version of Pascal's Wager. It is noteworthy that at the end of the tragedy [[Dionysos]], the god to whom [[Kadmos]] referred, appears and punishes him for thinking in this way. [[Euripides]], quite clearly, considered and dismissed the wager in this tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plots of epiphany: prison-escape in Acts of the Apostles |last= Weaver|first=John B.|authorlink= John B. Weaver|year=2004 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018266-8|pages=453–454, 595}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Christian apologist [[Arnobius of Sicca]] (d. 330) stated an early version of the argument in his book ''Against the Pagans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The pillar and ground of the truth (1914)|last= Aleksandrovich Florenskiĭ|first=Pavel|authorlink=Pavel Florensky|year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03243-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pascal's Wager is often concluded (not by Pascal) by stating that people should 'choose the safer wager'.  Pascal stated that people could not simply choose to believe, but that they might develop a faith through their actions.
*In the [[Sanskrit]] classic ''[[Sārasamuccaya]]'', &lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;[[Vararuci]] makes a similar argument to Pascal's Wager.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Ostler|Ostler, Nicholas]] (2005). ''Empires of the Word''. HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2008 philosophy book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', presents a secular revision of Pascal’s wager: “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.... Thus, we should seek value.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://andphilosophy.com/2014/07/16/24-and-philosophy/ 24 and Philosophy (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Curry''' (1917&amp;ndash;1986) was the vice-president of the [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]] Insurance Company of New York, and a famous amateur [[magic (illusion)|magician]] who became well known in the magic community for inventing highly-original card magic.

Many magicians have performed illusions and effects created by Curry. [[Doug Henning]] used Curry's "The Sliding Knot" in one of his TV specials. Curry's most famous creation is [[Out of This World (card trick)|Out of This World]], which he created in 1942, at the age of 25. Curry is the author of a number of books and manuscripts dealing with his many original magical creations.

He has also been credited with inventing the [[missing square puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Gardner|title=Mathematics Magic and Mystery|year=1956|publisher=Dover|pages=139–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 1977, the Academy of Magical Arts at [[The Magic Castle]] awarded Paul Curry a "Creative Fellowship" award.

'''''Photo-Kinema''''' (some sources say '''''Phono-Kinema''''') was a [[sound-on-disc]] system for [[motion pictures]] invented by Orlando Kellum.

==1921 introduction==
The system was first used for a small number of [[short film]]s, mostly made in 1921. These films presented subjects such as actor [[Frederick Warde]] reading an original poem "A Sunset Reverie", labor leader [[Samuel Gompers]] speaking on labor issues, Judge [[Ben Lindsey (jurist)|Ben Lindsey]] on the need for a separate [[juvenile court]] system, [[Irvin S. Cobb]] reading from his works, and a lecture by [[James J. Davis]], [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] in the [[Warren Harding|Harding administration]].

Kellum also filmed musical numbers, including a performance of the song "De Ducks" by [[African American]] musicians [[F. E. Miller]] and [[Aubrey Lyles]] who wrote the book for the musical ''[[Shuffle Along]]'' (1921), and ''The Famous Van Eps Trio in a Bit of Jazz'' (1921), featuring [[Fred Van Eps]], father of musician [[George Van Eps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/F/FamousVanEpsTrioInABit1921.html ''The Famous Van Eps Trio in a Bit of Jazz'' at SilentEra.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A filmed performance by Sir [[Harry Lauder]] made in Phono-Kinema is preserved at the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] but the disc with the sound is lost.

==D. W. Griffith and ''Dream Street''==
The process was most famously used by [[D. W. Griffith]] to record singing and sound effects sequences for his movie ''[[Dream Street (film)|Dream Street]]'' (1921). Employing the Phonokinema system, Griffith turned what was originally a [[silent film]] into a [[sound film]]. Earlier crude sound-on-disc and sound-on-cylinder systems had been invented 1894-1914 by [[Thomas Edison]] ([[Kinetophone]], [[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film|Kinetophonograph]]), Cameraphone in the US, [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] ([[Chronomegaphone]]) and [[Pathé]] in France, and others, but they were only used for short films. ''Dream Street'' was the first [[feature film|feature-length film]] in which a frame-synchronous human voice was heard from a sound recording of any kind.

Some prints of ''Dream Street'' show Griffith speaking in a brief introduction to the film. However, the sound quality was poor, and ''Dream Street'' was only shown with sound at two theaters in [[New York City]].

The silent version premiered on April 12, 1921 at the Central Theatre in New York City. On April 27, Griffith and [[Ralph Graves]] filmed and recorded their respective sound segments at Orlando Kellum's Photokinema office at 203 West 40th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrios |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Barrios|date=13 July 1995 |title=A Song in the Dark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_C3AmDL314C&amp;pg=PA15 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=15 |isbn=9780195088113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Griffith to Present Sound Film at Town Hall Tomorrow", ''The New York Times'' (May 1, 1921), Drama and Music section, page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of the sound version of ''Dream Street'' took place on May 2, 1921 at [[Town Hall (New York, New York)|Town Hall]] in New York City with Griffith's introduction. On May 15, the film also featured two other short sound sequences — Ralph Graves singing, and background noise in a scene showing a [[craps|craps game]]. Unfortunately, no other theaters could show the sound version of the film, since no other theaters had the Photokinema sound system installed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Eyman]], ''The Speed of Sound'' (1997), page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, May 29, ''Dream Street'' moved to the Schubert-Crescent Theater in [[Brooklyn]] in a program with Phonokinema short films. However, business was poor and the program soon closed.

==Phonokinema overshadowed by other systems==
Phonokinema was soon overshadowed by the [[Lee De Forest]] [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] system which premiered in [[New York City]] on 15 April 1923. Phonofilm was itself overtaken by the [[Vitaphone]] sound-on-disc system, premiered in New York with ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' on 6 August 1926, and by other [[sound-on-film]] systems such as [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] in 1927 and [[RCA Photophone]] in 1928.

According to [[Internet Movie Database]], two low-budget [[Western (genre)|Western]]s released in 1930, ''Sagebrush Politics'' and ''The Apache Kid's Escape'', the latter film with Western star [[Jack Perrin]], were the last two films released in the Phonokinema system.

In 1982, Kellum's widow donated the surviving films made with the Phonokinema process to the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].

'''''Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[Wii]] by [[Austria]]n [[video game developer]] [[Bplus]], who describe the game as a "[[Puzzle game|puzzle]] [[shoot 'em up|shooter]]". It was the first third party [[WiiWare]] title to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joystiq.com/2007/07/09/first-wii-ware-game-announced-plattchen-twist-n-paint/ "First Wii Ware game announced: Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint"], ''Joystiq'', July 9, 2007. Accessed July 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released in Europe on September 12, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiiware-world.com/news/2008/09/eu_wiiware_update_plattchen_bomberman_blast_and_midnight_pool EU WiiWare Update: Plättchen, Bomberman Blast, and Midnight Pool!]&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America on September 22, 2008.&lt;ref name=sept22&gt;[http://www.wiiware-world.com/news/2008/09/usa_wiiware_update_mega_man_9_and_plattchen USA WiiWare Update: Mega Man 9 and Plättchen]&lt;/ref&gt; It is priced at 1500 [[Wii Points]] in Europe, and 1000 Wii Points in North America.&lt;ref name=sept22/&gt;

==Gameplay==

''Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint'' involves painting a sequence of tiles, called "plättchen" (which means "platelet" in German) the same color to make them disappear, with special tiles also painted in the sequence contributing to a point meter that must be filled in order to pass the stage. In addition to a short time limit to paint their tiles, the player must contend with items on the play field that hinder their progress, obstacles that can destroy their personified cursor, gravity that shifts tiles across the play area and unpaintable tiles.&lt;ref name=wwwrev/&gt;

The game includes a single player mode as well as several offline multiplayer modes where up to 8 players can take part. The single player mode includes over 100 levels, which developer Bplus claims can take from minutes to weeks to perfect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://n-europe.com/news.php?nid=10997 N-Europe: Q&amp;A: Bplus - Developers of PLÄTTCHEN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Players use the pointer function of the [[Wii Remote]], twisting it left and right to change the color to be painted. The game also features support for the [[Wii Zapper]], with the developers claiming that playing with the Zapper brings some advantages over the other available controller configurations.&lt;ref name=gonintendo&gt;[http://gonintendo.com/?p=33660 GoNintendo » Blog Archive » More news on WiiWare title, Plättchen (bongo support!)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plättchen'' was originally intended to include a multiplayer mode which made use of four sets of [[DK Bongos]], but Nintendo has requested this functionality to be removed. It was replaced by a new "Bomb Rain Party Mode".&lt;ref name=neurope/&gt; In addition, the game also features "Copycat" and "Mission" modes which must be unlocked.

==Reception==

WiiWare World gave ''Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint'' a 3/10, deriding the overcomplexity of the game and the high price it was being sold at in Europe, which they said was "extortionate". In summary, they called the game "the videogame equivalent of trying to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time; there are too many elements to consider in tandem for this to be considered to be much fun".&lt;ref name=wwwrev&gt;[http://www.wiiware-world.com/reviews/2008/09/plattchen_twist_n_paint WiiWare World Plättchen: Twist 'n' Paint Review]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]], which gave the game 5/10, called ''Plättchen'' "a game buried under an avalanche of ideas, few of which are adequately developed or incorporated into a coherent play experience" with its more interesting elements "obscured by a deluge of vaguely explained and often conflicting gameplay concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=239049 Eurogamer Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint Review]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo Power]] rated this game "Grumble Grumble", stating that "everything is about the game is overly complex - from a lack of clear level goals to the seemingly random need to shoot down asteroids while matching up colored tiles."

On the other side, [[IGN]] rated the game with 7.4/10 (Decent), calling it a "pretty entertaining game and some great (but strange) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering." They say: "if you're looking for something truly original, and don't mind taking a gamble, Plattchen is certainly a one-of-a-kind offering."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/940/940232p1.html IGN Plättchen Twist 'n' Paint Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Poker Players Alliance''' ('''PPA''') is an [[United States|American]] [[nonprofit]] [[political action committee|Interest group]] formed{{By whom|date=July 2010}}{{When|date=July 2010}} to emphasize the rights of [[poker]] players, and to protect the players' liberties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pokerplayersalliance.org/aboutus.php Poker Players Alliance AboutUs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070621000131/http://pokerplayersalliance.org/aboutus.php |date=2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PPA formed to serve as an [[advocacy group]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to establish rights and protections for U.S. poker players.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Within the first year of its existence, the PPA garnered over 600,000 members.&lt;ref name = "letter"&gt;Polson, Sarah. [http://www.pokerlistings.com/ppa-issues-letter-of-support-from-players PPA issues letter of support from players] PokerListings.com November 7, 2006 accessed 7/9/07&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, the PPA claimed to have signed up its one millionth member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pokerplayersalliance.org Poker Players Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710023442/http://www.pokerplayersalliance.org/ |date=2005-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership growth has been due in part to promotional activities by [[online poker]] cardrooms like [[Party Poker]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/31/AR2006053102054.html WashingtonPost.com: Poker Players Lose a Round on Capitol Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;

This organization unsuccessfully lobbied against the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/24/AR2006052402432.html WashingtonPost.com: Bill to Ban Gambling Online Gets 4th Chance]&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited [[financial institution]]s from making payments to [[Online gambling|internet gambling]] sites.&lt;ref name = "acts"&gt;[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/financialsvcs_dem/questionandanswer.pdf House of Representative Questions and Answers]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many online poker sites suspended U.S. operations.&lt;ref name = "damato" /&gt;  Other sites have continued to serve U.S. customers, citing legal opinions that UIGEA does not apply to poker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/article/3316/pokerstars-will-keep-serving-american-customers Cardplayer.com: PokerStars Will Keep Serving American Customers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
The PPA aims to overturn laws such as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, whether through political or judicial means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/322849_poker07.html Seattle Post-Intelligencer: Lawyer raises stakes against state's Internet poker ban] 7/7/07 Accessed 7/9/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heikkinen |first1=Ari |title=Advocacy Work by the Poker Players Alliance and What it Means |url=https://www.reelbonanza.com/en/advocacy-work-poker-players-alliance-ppa-what-it-means/ |website=Reel Bonanza |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the PPA in conjunction with online poker sites, dedicated June 15, 2006 as "Write Your Congressmen Day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/poker/legislation/prweb400267.htm PocketFives and Poker Players Alliance Write Your Congressmen Day: A Grassroots Campaign Success] June 20, 2006. Accessed 7/9/07&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the "PPA Fly-In", where around 100 members and many professional poker players, including [[Annie Duke]], [[Howard Lederer]], and [[Chris Ferguson]], flew to [[Washington, D.C.]] to lobby Congress for poker rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/poker/2007-10-22-lobby_N.htm USAToday.com: Poker lobby plays its hand as 'game of skill']&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPA hired former New York Sen. [[Alfonse D'Amato]] as its chairman.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In an interview with [[Card Player (magazine)|Cardplayer Magazine]], he said "What really needs to happen is to have a legitimate house, a fair game, and a fair operator, and not take away from 20-plus-million citizens who play poker the opportunity to play poker on the Internet."&lt;ref name = "damato"&gt;[http://www.cardplayer.com/magazine/article/16635 Can Alfonse D'Amato Save Poker? Former New York Senator Joins the Poker Players Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; D'Amato went on to point out that under the current legislation, that the companies "with good business practices" could potentially be replaced by "those who do not care" because the U.S. is driving "the industry offshore, where we have no regulation and no controls."&lt;ref name = "damato" /&gt;

[[Michael Bolcerek]], the former president of the PPA, says that the PPA has been able to mount a counteroffensive to the anti-gaming bills on Capitol Hill. He states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Opponents of online gambling fail to realize that sweeping it under the rug will only serve to exacerbate any issues with [[problem gambling]]. Turning the wildly popular Internet poker from a common pastime to an illegal activity, banned by [[United States Congress|Congress]], will ultimately ensure that problem gamblers do not confront their issues with gambling and drive them further underground. Regulation and taxation, however, would provide billions in revenue for federal and state governments. These funds could be used to treat problem gamblers and to educate adults and youths alike on the dangers of gambling addictions."&lt;ref name = "President"&gt;Burton, Earl. [http://www.pokernews.com/news/2006/5/poker-players-alliance-washington.htm Poker Players Alliance Leads Poker's Cause In Washington] May 27, 2006. PokerNews.com Accessed 7/9/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bolcerek has appeared on over 60 local stations, CNN, CNBC, and Fox to get his message out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/article/3363 Poker Players Alliance Has Been Everywhere] Oct 23, 2006. Accessed 7/9/07&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, the organization announced Michael Bolcerek had stepped down as President. John Pappas filled the role vacated by Bolcerek.

Shortly after the 2009 WSOP began, the [[Southern District of New York Action Against Online Poker Players]] seized $34 million from over 27,000 accounts of poker players affiliated with [[Full Tilt Poker]], [[Absolute Poker]], [[Ultimate Bet]] and [[PokerStars]].&lt;ref name = "WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124459561862800591|title=U.S. Deals Blow to Online-Poker Players|last=Audi|first=Tamara|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2009-06-10|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Ifrah, the attorney for one of the disbursement companies affected, said that the government “has never seized an account that belongs to players who are engaged in what [Ifrah] would contend is a lawful act of playing peer-to-peer poker online.”&lt;ref name = "NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/business/10poker.html?_r=1|title=Web’s Poker Winners Face Delays in Collecting|date=2009-06-09|last=Richtel|first=Matt|accessdate=2009-06-29 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the seizure may have been intentionally timed to affect the access to people's accounts during the World Series of Poker.&lt;ref name = "Rose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/gambling-law-expert-nelson-rose-comments-on-online-poker-seizure-2994/|title=Gambling Law Expert Nelson Rose Comments on Online Poker Seizure|publisher=Poker News Daily|last=Cypra|first=Dan|date=2009-06-18|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7808131|title=Feds Freeze Poker Champ's Winnings|last=Goldman|first=Russell|date=2009-06-11|accessdate=2009-06-29|publisher=ABC news|work=ABCnews.go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the PPA held National Poker Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2009/07/23/poker-players-descend-on-capitol-hill.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727101050/http://www.blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2009/07/23/poker-players-descend-on-capitol-hill.aspx |archivedate=2009-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an effort to rally support for H.R. 2267, the [[Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2267&lt;/ref&gt; More than 350,000 people signed the petition supporting the licensing and regulation of online poker and more than 150,000 letters were sent to Members of Congress during National Poker Week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fool.com/news/associated-press/2009/07/21/poker-players-hope-for-hot-hand-in-lobbying-week.aspx{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the PPA and its membership held more than 100 meetings with Members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://theppa.org/npw/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bills supported==
The PPA supports several bills in Congress that amend UIGEA. The Skill Game Protection Act (HR 2610), proposed by Rep. [[Robert Wexler]] (D-FL), provides an exemption to UIGEA for games of skill, including poker, mah jong, bridge, and other games. As of December 15, 2007, HR 2610 has 20 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02610:@@@P Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2046), proposed by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] (D-MA), provides for federal licensing and regulation of online gaming sites. As of December 15, this bill has 45 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02046:@@@P Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Gambling Study Act (H.R. 2140), proposed . [[Shelley Berkley]] (D-NV), provides for a study by the National Academy of Sciences to identify the proper response of the United States to the growth of Internet gambling. As of December 15, this bill has 68 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02140:@@@P Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Rep [[Barney Frank]] (D-Mass) introduced a bill (the aforementioned HR 2046) that would not simply repeal the 2006 bill, but would open up a U.S. based market for online gambling. The Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2007 "would establish a regulatory and enforcement framework to license companies to accept bets and wagers online from individuals in the U.S."&lt;ref name = "acts" /&gt; The act would address underage and compulsive gambling, while providing safeguards for Americans. Legalizing these transactions would enable the government to tax and monitor fund transfers. This would allow transactions to be checked "against a number of anti-fraud, [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism]] databases".&lt;ref name = "acts" /&gt;

[[HIV]] is a problem in the country, but the true situation is unknown as the Government has manipulated figure to downplay the problem.&lt;ref name="bearr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uzbekistan: HIV/AIDS Statistics|url=http://www.bearr.org/uzbekistan-hivaids-statistics/|website=The BEARR Trust|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes are a high risk group, and has been blamed for a rise in HIV infections.&lt;ref name="liberty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aidsday"&gt;{{cite news|title= In-depth: World AIDS Day 2002||work= [[IRIN]]|date=|url= http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=39&amp;ReportId=70957&amp;Country=Yes|accessdate=2011-09-16 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081122132842/http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=39&amp;ReportId=70957&amp;Country=Yes |archive-date=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, of the reported 11,000 cases of HIV in the country, 20% were sex workers.&lt;ref name="liberty" /&gt;

{{see also|Human trafficking in Uzbekistan}}
Uzbekistan is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Uzbek women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in the Middle East, Eurasia, and Asia, and also internally in brothels, clubs, and private residences.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uzbekistan 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271311.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=31 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 135 of the criminal code prohibits both sex trafficking and forced labour, prescribing penalties of three to 12 years imprisonment. The government reported that 250 of the crimes investigated in 2016 were related to sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Uzbekistan as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Uzbekistan 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282778.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7640">'''Social media use in hiring''' refers to the examination by employers of job applicants' [[social media]] profiles as part of the hiring assessment. Some employers use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees. 
==Ethical implications==
This issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider [[discrimination]]. Except in the states of California, Maryland, and Illinois, there are no laws that prohibit employers from using social media profiles as a basis of whether or not someone should be hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aclu-mn.org/news/2012/03/06/aclu-mn-files-lawsuit-against-minnewaska-area-schools |title=ACLU-MN Files Lawsuit Against Minnewaska Area Schools |website=www.aclu-mn.org |access-date=2016-11-30|date=March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title VII]] also prohibits discrimination during any aspect of employment including hiring or firing, recruitment, or testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/employers-schools-and-social-networking-privacy |title=Employers, Schools, and Social Networking Privacy |newspaper=American Civil Liberties Union |access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has been integrating into the workplace and this has led to conflicts within employees and employers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Social media#cite note-Buettner2015c-107|[107]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Particularly, Facebook has been seen as a popular platform for employers to investigate in order to learn more about potential employees. This conflict first started in Maryland when an employer requested and received an employee's Facebook username and password. State lawmakers first introduced legislation in 2012 to prohibit employers from requesting passwords to personal social accounts in order to get a job or to keep a job. This led to Canada, Germany, the U.S. Congress and 11 U.S. states to pass or propose legislation that prevents employers' access to private social accounts of employees.&lt;sup&gt;[[Social media#cite note-108|[108]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Many Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand them to give forth their username or password for a social media account.&lt;ref name="Marche2012"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marche, S. |year=2012 |title=Is Facebook Making Us Lonely? |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws that forbid employers from disciplining an employee based on activity off the job on social media sites have also been put into act in states including California, Colorado, Connecticut, North Dakota, and New York. Several states have similar laws that protect students in colleges and universities from having to grant access to their social media accounts. Eight states have passed the law that prohibits post secondary institutions from demanding social media login information from any prospective or current students and privacy legislation has been introduced or is pending in at least 36 states as of July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turkle, S. |year=2012 |title=Alone together: Why we expect more from technology and less from each other |location=New York, NY |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-03146-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2014, legislation has been introduced and is in the process of pending in at least 28 states and has been enacted in Maine and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elaine |last=Burke for Silicon Republic |date=30 May 2013 |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing |title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the National Labor Relations Board has been devoting a lot of their attention to attacking employer policies regarding social media that can discipline employees who seek to speak and post freely on social media sites.

[[File:Marijuana smoking glass.jpg|thumb|200px|If a young person posts photos on social media of themselves using drugs, this could adversely affect their chance of getting some types of jobs.]]

==Impacts==
Use of social media by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media when they try to enter the job market. A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on social media websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elaine |last=Burke for Silicon Republic |date=30 May 2013 |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing |title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 survey of recruiters found that 93% of them check candidates' social media postings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Susie|last= Poppick |date=September 5, 2014 |url=http://time.com/money/3019899/10-facebook-twitter-mistakes-lost-job-snake/ |title=10 Social Media Blunders That Cost a Millennial a Job — or Worse|work=Money Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, professor Stijn Baert of [[Ghent University]] conducted a field experiment in which fictitious job candidates applied for real job vacancies in Belgium. They were identical except in one respect: their Facebook profile photos. It was found that candidates with the most wholesome photos were a lot more likely to receive invitations for job interviews than those with the more controversial photos. In addition, Facebook profile photos had a greater impact on hiring decisions when candidates were highly educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baert |first=S. |year=2015 |url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp9584.pdf |title=Do They Find You on Facebook? Facebook Profile Picture and Hiring Chances |id=IZA Discussion Paper No. 9584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These cases have created some [[privacy]] implications as to whether or not companies should have the right to look at employee's Facebook profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/23/facebook-says-it-may-launch-legal-action-against-employers-who-ask-for-user-passwords/ |title=Facebook May Take Legal Action Over Employer Password Requests |author=Matt Brian |date=23 March 2012 |work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation of Facebook policy. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=326598317390057 |title=Protecting Your Passwords and Your Privacy |work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Speedball raquette.jpg|thumb]]
'''Speed-Ball''' is a [[Racquets (sport)|racquet sport]] invented in [[Egypt]] in [[1961 in sports|1961]] by [[Mohamed Lotfy]] for the training of beginner tennis players. Today it is a sport in its own right, enjoying popularity not only in Egypt but in other countries. Several of these countries make up the International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB).

== Description ==
[[Image:Speedball balle.jpg|thumb]]
A hollow ball in [[latex]] revolves around a metallic mast (1,70m high) which is linked by a [[nylon]] thread (fishing thread type) of 1,70m length. The thread is knotted to the mast by a loop or a plastic ring freely revolving around a reel. The mast is fixed in a base from 40&amp;nbsp;kg to 90&amp;nbsp;kg. The ball is elliptic and is hit with a rigid plastic [[racquet]] with a small handle and a strings around 25&amp;nbsp;cm of diameter. The speed-ball court is about 6x4 m. for the single match and 8x6 m. for the doubles.

== Rules ==

Speed-ball is played alone (super-solo), with two players (single match), or four players (double match),or four players (relay)

=== Super-solo ===
[[Image:speedball super-solo.gif|thumb]]

In ''Super-solo'', the aim is to hit the ball a maximum times in one minute. At first with the right hand, then a minute again with the left hand, then with two racquets in fore-hand only,  then with two racquets in back-hand only. The number of hits of each movement is added to make the final score of the solo.

The duration of one movement is  30 seconds for the players under 14 years old and one minute for older players. A break of 30 seconds for all classes is granted behind each movement.

The best players can do up to 160 hits in one minute.
The current men's world record is 614 hits,  set by Egypt's Mohamed Nagy, while the women's record of 539 hits set by Egyptian Noha AbouZeid in the 26th world championship In Kuwait.

=== Single match ===
[[Image:speedball match simple.gif|thumb]]

The ''single match'' is played by two players, each with one racquet. Each player has their own ground, separated by a neutral strip 60&amp;nbsp;cm wide (the diameter of the speed-ball's base). A match is divided into games of 10 points. The players attempt to hit the ball once each in turn, inverting its direction of rotation. To score points, the ball must pass twice successively across the opponent's ground, without the opponent being able to return it. If there is a fault, the point is missed and there is a new service. The service is alternated according to who wins each point. The first player to score 10 points wins the game. The first player who wins two games (three games for men's seniors) wins the match.

=== Double match ===
[[Image:speedball match double.gif|thumb]]

The ''double match'' takes place like the single, in two teams of two players. In each team, the players serve and hit the ball alternatively. The general rules are the same as the single.

Specific mistakes involve the player's rotation and reception of the ball.

== Federation ==

The International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB) was founded in 1984 by the membership of Egypt, France, and Japan. Several other countries joined the federation ([[Kuwait]], [[KSA]], [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Denmark]], [[Sudan]], [[India]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nigeria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[UAE]],  ...).

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

[[Image:ABC drifter.jpg|right|ABC Sunday Night Movie TV promo]]
'''''The ABC Sunday Night Movie''''' is a [[television program]] that aired on Sunday nights, first for a brief time in [[1962 in television|1962]] under the title ''Hollywood Special'' (although ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine lists this version as ''The Sunday Night Movie'') to supposedly replace an open time slot for the TV show ''Bus Stop'', which was cancelled after March 1962. It then began airing regularly under its more commonly known title from late [[1964 in television|1964]] to [[1998 in television|1998]], on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  Since 2004, it has aired sporadically as a special program, now titled the ''ABC Sunday Movie of the Week'', though as of the 2011-12 television season, the only films in this timeslot were aired under the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' banner, which transferred to ABC in that season. However, in 2014, ''The Hallmark Hall of Fame'' moved exclusively to cable on the [[Hallmark Channel]]. As a result of this, the ''Sunday Night Movie'' is now exclusively relegated to two special holiday movies, ''The Sound of Music'' every holiday season and ''The Ten Commandments'' every Easter.

''The ABC Sunday Night Movie'' was replaced in 1998 with ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' although the ''Sunday Night Movie'' initially continued to air alongside ''TWWOD'' for its final season.

==History==
Encouraged by the ratings success on [[NBC]]'s ''[[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies|Saturday Night at the Movies]]'', ABC initially purchased 15 [[United Artists]] films released in the late 1950s for its April 1962 premiere.&lt;ref&gt;p. 146 Castleman, Harry &amp;  Podrazik, Walter J. ''Watching TV: Six Decades of American Television'' Syracuse University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Artists Television]] also provided some short featurettes promoting upcoming United Artists cinema releases to fill out some films that ended before the two hour time slot finished.

===Edits for television===
The program presented theatrical [[film|feature films]] airing on TV for the first time. The feature films were [[Editing|edited]] for content, to remove objectionable material, and for time - one such instance was the first network telecast in 1962 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049513/combined&lt;/ref&gt; of [[John Huston]]'s [[1956 in film|1956]] film ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'', a [[Warner Bros.]] film which runs 117 minutes uncut, and yet was shown in a two-hour time slot with commercials. In many cases, however, the broadcast was expanded from two to two-and-a-half hours to fit a film's longer running time, as in the two [[1966 in television|1966]] network telecasts of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]''  (a 1956 film not to be confused with the [[1967 in television|1967]] [[videotape]]d television adaptation of the musical, also broadcast by ABC). The first major network showing of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' in 1982 was broadcast in two parts with previously unused footage. Extra footage was also added to the ABC broadcast of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' in 1983, ''[[Superman II]]'' in 1984 and ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' in 1985.

Because the concept of [[letterbox]]ing films for television had not been introduced yet, the films shown were also [[pan-and-scan]]ned so the image would fit the standard 4:3 television screen.

===James Bond franchise===
{{see also|James Bond films on television}}

In [[1972 in television|1972]], ABC bought the broadcasting rights to the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] franchise (also by United Artists). The first film broadcast was ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. Unlike the British broadcasts of the James Bond films, the franchise was not presented in production order. 

ABC [[James Bond films on television|made edits to the Bond films]] for violence, sexual content, and so that the films would fit in the time allotted, but perhaps the most controversial of these was [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)#Broadcast television version|the re-edit]] of the 1969 film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' broadcast on the ''ABC Monday Night Movie''.

ABC held the rights to the James Bond films until [[1990 in television|1990]], when ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' was the final film aired prior to [[TBS (TV network)|Turner Broadcasting]] buying the TV rights to the franchise. The Bond films have also aired on several cable channels not owned by Turner. ABC broadcast the films again as a promotional tie-in when ''[[Die Another Day]]'' was in theaters in 2002, dubbed as ''The Bond Picture Show'' on Saturday nights.

===''ABC Sunday Movie Special''===
Occasionally, ''The ABC Sunday Night Movie'' would telecast what they termed an '''''ABC Sunday Movie Special''''', i.e. a film running three hours or more (counting the commercials). When the movie in question was a family film, the telecasts would begin at an earlier hour, so that the film would end at around 11:00 p.m, enabling younger viewers to watch without having to stay up too late. The '''Movie Special'''s invariably consisted of [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'',  and ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''. The last-named film continues its television career on ABC today, having become, like ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', an annual television tradition. It is usually shown during the [[Palm Sunday]] or [[Easter]] weekend (''The Robe'', which made its TV debut in 1968, had been shown on Easter weekends by ABC prior to being sold to local television stations). The telecast of ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', which took place in [[1972 in television|1972]] at 9 P.M. E.S.T., was remarkably mature, in that very little of the film's profanity was cut for television.

ABC would occasionally telecast ''Movie Special''s on other days of the week as well, among them ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', and ''[[Godspell (film)|Godspell]]'' (which was shown on network television as a [[Thanksgiving]] season special in 1974).

===Method of presenting films throughout the 1960s===
Beginning in 1965, ''The ABC Sunday Night Movie'' used a rather unusual method of presenting the films that movie series on other networks did not use. Except on rare occasions, such as the aforementioned ''Movie Specials'', or films which already had a [[Pre-credit|pre-credits sequence]] that led directly into the [[title sequence|main title]] and so could not be altered, the [[opening credits]] of the particular film in question generally would not be shown until after the movie had ended. Instead, a [[Cold open|teaser]] from the film was shown, whereupon an offscreen announcer (e.g. Joel Crager) would say the name of the film and its stars, and then the credit '''''The ABC Sunday Night Movie''''' would appear. A [[Television advertisement|commercial]] would then follow, and when the program started up again, one would see the screenwriter and the director's names respectively - superimposed over the film's opening scene in credits manufactured by ABC. At film's end, another commercial would follow, after which, somewhat anti-climactically, the movie's actual opening credits, together with the studio [[logo]], would then be presented exactly as they were originally made, as if the film were starting up again. 

''The ABC Sunday Night Movie'' was also famous in the mid 1970s for its theme music and brightly colored marquee. The opening has been parodied on the G4 network under the title ''Movies That Don't Suck''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stleKBpQk6w  YouTube video of Movies That Don't Suck intro, which mirrors that of ABC's intro from the 1970s.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other nights and methods of presentation===
From [[1968 in television|1968]] to [[1970 in television|1970]], ABC ran a concurrent movie series on Wednesday nights, under the title ''[[The ABC Wednesday Night Movie]]''. 

A Tuesday night '''''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]''''' featuring only [[made-for-TV movies]] was added in [[1969 in television|1969]]. The series was renamed '''''[[ABC Movie of the Week|Tuesday Movie of the Week]]''''' and a Wednesday night '''''[[ABC Movie of the Week|Wednesday Movie of the Week]]''''', also presenting only made-for-TV films, was added in [[1972 in television|1972]]. Both series continued until [[1975 in television|1975]].

From [[1975 in television|1975]] to [[1983 in television|1983]] (and again, briefly, in [[1999 in television|1999]]) ABC ran a concurrent movie series on Friday nights, under the title '''''[[The ABC Friday Night Movie]]'''''.

Other concurrent movie series during that time also aired on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

During the 1980s, films with more mature and politically-charged themes, such as ''[[The Day After]]'' and ''[[Consenting Adult (film)|Consenting Adult]]'' ([[homosexuality]]) aired under the ''[[ABC Theater]]'' banner.

Beginning in 1999, a Saturday night variant on the formula began, and has been somewhat of a ratings favorite. However, and more importantly nowadays, the ratings have varied from week to week. Since 1999, The ''[[ABC Saturday Night Movie]]'' has alternated with random repeats, ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' (up until 2008), and ''[[Saturday Night Football]]'', which runs from the first Saturday in September, up into the first of December. Movies also alternate on various other nights of the week, for sweeps and also as holiday-based programming, such as the annual pre-Easter telecast of ''The Ten Commandments''.

===Announcers===
For many years, until the early 1980s, the announcer for all of ABC's movie shows was network staff [[announcer]] [http://www.musicradio77.com/joelcragerprofile.html  Joel Crager].  Afterwards, the duties would be handled first by [[Ernie Anderson]], and then others.

===Decline due to the advent of cable networks===
The advent of such [[cable television]] networks as [[HBO]], [[Cinemax]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[The Movie Channel]] (all of which broadcast theatrical films on cable before they appear on commercial television), along with the emergence of various [[home video]] formats, led to the decline of theatrical films regularly airing on commercial network TV. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, print ads for ''The ABC Sunday Night Movie'' regularly played up the quality of the film being offered to viewers at no cost ("Another Great Film Not On Pay TV"). Whereas one used to be able to see a relatively recent theatrical film on [[prime time]] commercial network television every night of the week, this is now done only occasionally (or, in the case of ABC's ''Saturday Movie of the Week'', weekly). Only cable networks exclusively devoted to films, such as [[AMC (TV network)|American Movie Classics]] or [[Turner Classic Movies]], show theatrical films in prime time every night; the [[Big Three television networks|big three networks]], including the newer [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] no longer follow this practice, except perhaps on holidays. The grand opening sequences of the past are now usually eschewed by merely mentioning the airing title in an 'up next' sequence, or a direct cut to a disclaimer noting the film has been edited and presented for a broadcast television presentation with the assumption viewers have already viewed the basic [[electronic program guide]] information for the film.

'''The Egg''', or the '''Dome''', is an unfinished cinema structure built in 1965 in Beirut, Lebanon. Its construction was interrupted during the Lebanese civil war and the horse-shoe shaped dome that remains today is now historical landmark Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://failedarchitecture.com/the-value-of-a-war-scarred-ruin-in-beirut/|title=The Value of a War-Scarred Ruin in Beirut - Failed Architecture|last=Springer|first=Daniel|date=|work=Failed Architecture|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was part of a commercial and residential project named "Beirut City Center", by architect [[Joseph Philippe Karam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/1407366/the-egg-beirut-lebanon|title=The Egg, Beirut {{!}} 1407366 {{!}} EMPORIS|last=GmbH|first=Emporis|website=www.emporis.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of its possible demolition in the past two decades has mobilized students and architects in favor of its preservation. The current owners of the site have affirmed their desire to preserve it and to integrate it into a new project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2011/Jul-27/Solidere-denies-demolition-of-Beiruts-egg.ashx#axzz2H6ocGfH3|title=Solidere denies demolition of Beirut's 'egg'|last1=Alabaster|first1=Olivia|last2=Gatten|first2=Emma|date=July 27, 2011|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Graham Kennedy Show''''' was an [[Australia]]n talk show which debuted on 19 September 1972 on the [[Nine Network]].

On 23 December 1969, host [[Graham Kennedy]] quit as host of ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' due to exhaustion and rested for two years. In spite of his fame and fortune, he later described that period as "years of misery".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} After specials on 15 November 1971 and 2 March 1972, he returned with this series.

Kennedy sparked controversy after a "crow-call", which sounded like the word "[[fuck]]", was broadcast in March 1975 (see below). Forced to prerecord from that point on, he abruptly departed following [[GTV-9]]'s censorship of the 16 April 1975 edition.

==Crow call incident==
On the show of 3 March 1975, Kennedy imitated a crow, saying "faaaaaaark", during a live read of a Cedel hairspray advertisement by announcer Rosemary Margan. The [[Nine Network]] reportedly received hundreds of complaints, followed by a rash of newspaper headlines the next day.  This led the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] to request that Kennedy "show cause" why he should not be removed from the airwaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kennedy faces a total ban on TV|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XVoQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OpIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3156%2C949082|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Age (Melbourne)|date=1975-03-05|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy replied that he could not show cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kennedy case to be heard on Tuesday|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N_xjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=904%2C3520849|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-12|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Order to Kennedy producer - threat to two TV shows|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MvxjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3160%2C1897513|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-07|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the Board take action to limit his appearances, while hinting at legal action should they do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court threat by Kennedy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NvxjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5757%2C3373285|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-11|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than removing him, the ABCB banned Kennedy from appearing live, forcing him to pre-record the show on videotape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV and radio ban on 'live' Kennedy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PvxjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3781%2C4968719|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-19|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=April 2014}} have claimed that Kennedy deliberately engineered the crow call incident so that the show would have to be prerecorded, allowing him to get home earlier, while others{{who|date=April 2014}} suggest that he did it so that Nine would sack him.

In 2002, in ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper, writer [[Jonathan Green (journalist)|Jonathan Green]] reported that the crow call segment was in fact pretaped and that the controversy was probably just a pretext for other issues. Rival Nine personality [[Ernie Sigley]], who presented his own variety show on different nights to Kennedy, has claimed the real reason Kennedy was axed was that his ratings were so poor compared to Sigley's.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

According to ''Age'' reporter [[Suzanne Carbone]], the first known use of the expletive on Australian TV was in the 1960s, when Nine Adelaide evening news presenter [[Kevin Crease]] said "fucking hell" during a mishap in a live advertisement on variety show ''Adelaide Tonight''. Crease told ''The Age'' that "The audience fell off their chairs laughing" and that he was amazed no complaints were received and that although he feared he would be sacked, nothing happened.

==Criticism of Doug McClelland==
Having been forced to tape his shows "indefinitely" by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the network took advantage of the pretaping to completely [[censorship|edit out]] Kennedy's scathing attack on Senator [[Doug McClelland]], the then Minister for the Media, for his failure to support local content regulations for TV on the 16 April 1975 edition.

According to Kennedy's biographer, [[Graeme Blundell]], Kennedy resigned from Nine after this controversy, just six weeks after the "crow call" incident.

Kennedy's words which never made it to air were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
: Good evening.

: Little serious bit to start with: Senator Douglas McClelland, ahh, is really copping it in the press at the moment. All this week, every paper you pick up, there's a, there's a roast of the Senator.

: And like most Australians, I hate to kick a man when he's down.

: (audience laughter)

: But in Doug McClelland's case, I happily make an exception.

: (audience laughter)

: He has failed, and he knows it too. Now, the public know it.

: This misguided Minister took credit for a mythical boom in television production. Now, there is no boom.

: Employment in television production is down this year, by over 30 percent, and that's a fact.

: His point system has proved utterly ineffective, and I wonder if you can remember who that little blond-headed fellow was, who works on television, who originally pointed out that it wouldn't work.

: (audience: Graham!)

: That's right.

: (audience laughter)

: We are all suffering from the lack of local content at the moment. I'm being thrashed in the surveys because constantly being thrown at, up against me are shows like the Academy Awards, imported films, and cheap television series, all purchased for a few hundred dollars from the Yanks.

: Now some of these - when I say a few hundred dollars, by the time it's amortised over the network, that's how much the program costs. Now we can't compete, umm, with the price of these shows.

: We cannot: this is a, what is this, a six thousand dollar a night ... uhh, we can play Mrs. Miniver for, err, ninepence.

: (audience laughter)

: It's beneath my dignity to even go into the laughable and inane carryings-on of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which the good Minister of the Crown, Senator Douglas McClelland, is in charge of, but I know I can speak for a lot of my colleagues in this industry, and several other industries in the entertainment field, when I demand, here, tonight, nationally, that Senator McClelland be dismissed from office; and I would suggest most strongly that the portfol ...  the portfolio itself be dropped.

: That's all I want to say.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a segment featuring guest [[Daryl Somers]], Kennedy said that he'd let it be known that Somers would make a suitable replacement host "... should I be on my way".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPfO4J8Fli8&lt;/ref&gt; In the first commercial break, Kennedy addressed the opening comments off-air with the studio audience, wondering if the network would cut the remarks, and stating that if they did, he would repeat them live on ''[[This Day Tonight]]''. He made the same threat on-air during the "wheel" segment later in the episode, with he and [[Bert Newton]] both effectively repeating the opening remarks. Kennedy also remarked that McClelland was "...not all that literate", and that "... he has to go".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

The opening segment was indeed edited out before the show went to air and Kennedy resigned in anger. He did not, however, follow through with the threat to repeat the comments on ''This Day Tonight'', with an ABC spokesman later commenting that Kennedy had decided that it "would not be in his interests" to appear.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R-BUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PZIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6737%2C3736612&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian content on TV was a highly sensitive issue at this time. In the wake of the controversial [[McLean Report]], the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government was taking major steps to open up the radio spectrum with the introduction of community broadcasting and the ABC's new rock station, [[Triple J]] (launched as "Double Jay"), but it had done nothing to address the low levels of local content on Australian TV.

Aware of the media's crucial role in its own election in 1972, and understandably fearful of a backlash if it forced unpopular content quotas on the industry, the government steered well clear of any serious re-examination of the current structure and did little to increase levels of Australian content on TV.

The proposal to increase local content had long been advocated local producers, writers and actors, but it was bitterly opposed by the networks, who relied on being able to buy large blocks of American programming at a fraction of what it would have cost to produce similar shows locally. The problem was compounded by the Whitlam government's far-reaching 1973 decision to reduce [[tariff]]s across the board by 25% in the first move towards today's highly successful "free trade" policies. The immediate result of the tariff reduction was that overseas programming became even cheaper. Also at this time, the networks were being targeted by the "TV - Make It Australian" campaign, which involved a number of prominent Australian actors and TV personalities including Kennedy and several leading actors from the popular police shows made by [[Crawford Productions]], notably [[Gerard Kennedy (actor)|Gerard Kennedy]] and [[Charles Tingwell|Charles "Bud" Tingwell]].  The cancellation of all three major Crawford Productions police shows within months of each other during 1975 has been portrayed by Tingwell and others as an act of revenge by the networks for Crawford's active support for the campaign and the participation of its contract players. Following this logic, Blundell suggests that Kennedy too was a victim of the Nine TV network's sensitivity about the local content issue. It has also been suggested that, with a federal election looming, Nine used the crow call incident as a pretext to remove the politically vocal Kennedy, who was known to support the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]].

'''''The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters''''' is a 2007 American [[documentary film]] about [[competitive gaming]] directed by [[Seth Gordon]]. It follows [[Steve Wiebe]] in his attempts to take the [[high score]] record for the 1981 arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' from the previous holder, [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]]. The film premiered at the [[2007 Slamdance Film Festival]] and was released in US theaters in August 2007. It received positive reviews.

==Summary==
[[Walter Day]] is the founder of [[Twin Galaxies]], an organization dedicated to tracking [[Score (game)|high scores]] in [[arcade game]]s. Among the high-scoring players is restaurateur [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]], who has held the high score for the 1981 game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' since 2004.

In [[Redmond, Washington]], out-of-work engineer [[Steve Wiebe]] has purchased a ''Donkey Kong'' cabinet to try to break the record. Using his mathematical knowledge to identify exploitable patterns in the game, Wiebe achieves a new record of 1,006,600 points – the first ever score over a million. He submits a tape to Twin Galaxies, which propels him to local celebrity in the Seattle area.

Mitchell and Twin Galaxies send two referees to investigate Wiebe's machine. They learn that the machine's [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] was provided by Roy Shildt, a self-proclaimed fitness guru and [[pickup artist]] who claims the high score for ''[[Missile Command]]''. Unbeknownst to Wiebe, Shildt and Mitchell have been at odds for years after Mitchell questioned Shildt's high score, causing Twin Galaxies to disqualify it. Twin Galaxies suspects that Shildt may have tampered with Wiebe's board, and does not recognize Wiebe's record.

Wiebe travels to a tournament at [[Funspot Family Fun Center|Funspot]] in [[Laconia, New Hampshire]], to attempt a live high score for high-ranking Twin Galaxies members. Wiebe challenges Mitchell to a ''Donkey Kong'' competition, but Mitchell does not attend. Before a crowd, Wiebe sets a new high score of 985,600 and reaches the [[kill screen]], ending the game. However, contrary to his statements that videotaped scores carry less validity than scores achieved in public, Mitchell sends a low-quality VHS to Funspot depicting himself achieving a higher score of 1,047,200 points. Twin Galaxies proclaims Mitchell the record holder.

Nine months later, ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' has decided to publish Twin Galaxies' records — including Mitchell's latest score – and hosts a tournament in Mitchell's hometown of [[Hollywood, Florida]]. Wiebe again challenges Mitchell to a public competition, but Mitchell refuses. Wiebe fails to surpass the record, but afterward, Day acknowledges Wiebe's integrity and invites him to submit taped scores. At home, Wiebe achieves a new record of 1,049,100 in his garage.

==Emulation controversy==
On February 2, 2018, Twin Galaxies member Jeremy Young filed a complaint regarding several of Mitchell's records.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra, Heather (February 7, 2018). [https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-breaks-silence-about-donkey-kong-high-sc-1822815818 "Billy Mitchell Breaks Silence About ''Donkey Kong'' High Score Controversy"]. [[Kotaku]].&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of Mitchell's August 7, 2010, high score, set at Boomers-Grand Prix Arcade, could not be determined. The referee who allegedly witnessed and certified the record was gamer [[Todd Rogers (video game player)|Todd Rogers]], who appears in ''The King of Kong'', and was himself exposed as having fabricated scores earlier in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Orland, Kyle (February 8, 2018). [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/king-of-kong-star-says-original-tape-will-prove-his-disputed-scores "''King of Kong'' star says 'original tape' will prove his disputed scores"]. [[Ars Technica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, Twin Galaxies announced that Mitchell had used [[Emulator|emulation software]] to achieve the ''Donkey Kong'' high score rather than an arcade machine; this is banned because it allows players to cheat in undetectable ways. Mitchell was stripped of his records and banned from submitting further scores, and Wiebe was recognized as the first person to score over a million points. Footage obtained from the ''Kong'' DVD's special features was cited by the investigative committee in their findings as having been instrumental in exposing Mitchell.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;Crecente, Brian (April 12, 2018).

==Adaptations and sequels==
In 2014, ''King of Kong: The Musical'', which parodied the characters and events depicted in the documentary began its limited run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kingofkongthemusical.com|title=King of Kong the Musical|website=www.kingofkongthemusical.com|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scripted film adaptation is also in the works. Director [[Seth Gordon]] has said that the movie might be a sequel instead of a remake, telling the story of how the documentary changed both men's lives, as well as their continuing rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justpressplay.net/articles/1863-king-of-kong-movie-might-be-a-sequel-nathan-fillion-vs-johnny-depp.html 'King of Kong' Movie Might Be a Sequel?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3811">'''Theatre studies''' (sometimes referred to as '''theatrology''' or '''dramatics''') is the study of theatrical performance in relation to its literary, physical, psycho-biological, sociological, and historical contexts. It is an interdisciplinary field which also encompasses the study of theatrical [[aesthetics]] and [[semiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;Helbo, André (1987).

'''Ursula Schaeppi''' or '''Ursula Schäppi''' (born 22 June 1940) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] comedian, radio personality, and stage, voice and film actress starring usually in Swiss German language stage productions and as voice actress in children's literature.

== Early life and education ==
Born and raised in [[Zürich]], [[Canton of Zürich]] in Switzerland, Ursula Schäppi began acting at the conservatory in Bern at Margarethe Schell von Noé in 1955 and in 1956/58 lessons with Walter Fried on ''Bühnenstudio Zürich'', and private lessons with Richard Münch. During her training Schaeppi premierred on stage, and played among others ''Gisèle'' in Giraudoux's "Intermezzo" on [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ursulaschäppi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Ursula_Schaeppi|title=Ursula Schaeppi|author=Sonja Galler |language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theater, playwright and children's literature and plays ==
In 1958 Schaeppi was engaged at the ''Studio 20'' in Bern as ''Laura'' in Williams' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''. From 1959 she worked at German city theaters, among other things, in Castorp-Rauxel, Berlin, München and in Rendsburg. At this time also began Schaeppi's career with children and trouser roles that later became one of her trademarks, including the title role in Saint-Exupéry's ''[[The Little Prince]]''. In 1968/69 she toured with the ''Deutsche Kammerspiele Buenos Aires'' through South and Central America, and received an engagement at ''Berliner Kammerspiele'' stages in 1971/72. Since 1969 she appeared in guest roles at Swiss theaters, for example, in 1969 at the ''Stadttheater Bern'' as ''Effie'' in Ludwig Thomas' "Moral", and in 1970 at the gallery theater ''Die Rampe'' in Bern as ''Mingo'' in the premiere of Alexander Ziegler's "Zellengeflüster". In 1976 she starred in the title role of [[Hansjörg Schneider]]'s "Sennentuntschi" that was directed by Schneider.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ursulaschäppi"/&gt;

It was followed by appearances at the ''Stadttheater Luzern'', ''Kleintheater Kramgasse 6'' in Bern and at the ''Stadttheater Chur'', and since the early 1970s, also first appearances in the Swiss German dialect theater. Her breakthrough celebrated Ursula Schäppi in 1975,&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ursulaschäppi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-bernhard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Bernhard-Theater,_Z%C3%BCrich_ZH|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Bernhard-Theater, Zürich ZH|author=|language=German|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Bernhard-Theater Zürich]] as ''Heideli'' in the premiere of Max Rüeger's "Hochzeit in Hägglingen", under the direction of [[Inigo Gallo]],&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-gallo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Inigo_Gallo|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Inigo Gallo|author=|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by regular appearances in the Bernhard-Theater, at first mainly in cabaret revues by [[Charles Lewinsky]],&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-lewinsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Charles_Lewinsky|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Charles Lewinsky|author=Dietrich Seybold|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredy Lienhard and [[Hans Gmür]], later in Swiss dialect versions of boulevard plays, for example, in 1988 in the title role of Jack Popplewell's successful play "Katharina die Kühne" and Swiss tour performances and television broadcasting. Moreover, Schaeppi created her own arrangements for Swiss productions of the Bernhard Theater where she also performed in leading roles. There, also the long-standing collaboration with Rudolf Haas and Franco Romano began. She had further guest appearances at other theaters, for example, in 1979 as ''Oma Zeitel'' in [[Jerry Bock]]'s musical "Anatevka" and in 1982 as ''Toinette '' in Molière's ''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'' on ''Atelier Theater'' in Bern.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ursulaschäppi"/&gt;

National merits gained Ursula Schäppi since 1977 through her appearances on Swiss television as ''Goof'' or ''Göre Ursula'' (cheeky girl) in Kurt Felix' "Teleboy", by her television show ''10 x Schaeppi'' and as ''Eva Chifler'' in "Traumpaar" with [[Walter Andreas Müller]] when even a song was listed in the Swiss radio charts.&lt;ref name="chifler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitparade.ch/album/Ursula-Schaeppi-und-Walter-Andreas-Mueller/Alp-Traum-Paar-Adam-&amp;-Eva-Chifler-153747|publisher=hitparade.ch|title=Ursula Schaeppi und Walter Andreas Müller - Alp-Traum-Paar - Adam &amp; Eva Chifler|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1987, Schaeppi produced independent theater productions with Haas, Romano and Müller, in which she also starred and for which she often wrote the Swiss dialect versions, including in 1987 the Swiss premiere of Pierre Chesnot's "Vier linke Hände" with Müller and directed by Haas, in 1991 as "Käthi - Superstar", and in 1994 the dialect version of "Die Sternstunde der Hanna Bieder", which on ''Gastspieltheater Zürich'' was resumed in 2000. A great success was "Stan und Ollie in der Schweiz", starring Schaeppi as ''[[Stan Laurel|Stan]]'' and ''[[Stephanie Glaser]]'' as ''[[Oliver Hardy|Ollie]]''. Her productions staged for several years guest performances, among others at the Bernhard-Theater,&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ursulaschäppi"/&gt; on [[Theater am Hechtplatz]],&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-hechtplatz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Theater_am_Hechtplatz,_Z%C3%BCrich_ZH|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Theater am Hechtplatz, Zürich ZH|author=Tanja Stenzl|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the studio stage of the [[Opernhaus Zürich]], at the ''Atelier-Theater'' in Bern and at the ''Sommertheater Winterthur''.

In the first episode, set in 1974, it features [[John Walker (runner)|John Walker]] beating [[Rod Dixon]] in the 1500 metres at the [[1974 Commonwealth Games]]. Each episode covers one year, from 1974 to 1979, with events like the Muldoon election, dawn raids on overstayers, carless days, and the birth of the punk rock scene in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV picks: Westside, the Outrageous Fortune prequel|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11456184|accessdate=3 June 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second series is set in 1981, and follows the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour|Springbok Tour]]. The series starts with Rita returning home from prison to find the West household in disrepair. Throughout the course of the series Ted's gang plots to steal from the South Africans visiting New Zealand, preventing them from buying land, while Rita plans a job against developer Evan Lace.

The third Series is set in 1982 and deals with the fallout from the Evan Lace job and Wolf's first meeting with his future wife, Cheryl.

== Cast and characters ==
This table shows the show's characters and the cast members who have portrayed them.

''Note'': Only those appearing in more than one episode appear in this list, and only when the actor contributes new material to an episode.
&lt;!-- I may have gotten carried away with adding all the info for season 5, but everything else was accurate and true, so whoever removed all my hard work, that was such a d*ck move, NOTE: also Teds gang are main characters not recurring --&gt;

'''Zoopoetics''' has been defined as "the process of discovering innovative breakthroughs in form through an attentiveness to another species' bodily ''poiesis''." It assumes many actual, biological animals possess agency to craft gestures, vocalizations—clear material signs—in order to create social cohesion with conspecifics and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moe|first=Aaron|title=Zoopoetics: Animals and the Making of Poetry|year=2014|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0-7391-8662-6|pages=10, 19–22|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739186626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoopoetics is not a minor event in poetry, nor is it limited to human spheres.  Other species discover innovative forms of their bodily ''[[poiesis]]'', through, at times, an attentiveness towards humans. Many disciplines have contributed to the radical revaluation of the animal in culture and society; zoopoetics further contributes through tracing the implications of [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]]’s insight, that animals, including humans, follow the “same old law” of a bodily ''poiesis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitman|first=Walt|title=Poetry and Prose|year=1982|publisher=The Library of America|location=New York|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moe|first=Aaron|title=Toward Zoopoetics: Rethinking Whitman's 'original energy'|journal=Walt Whitman Quarterly Review|year=2013|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–17|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol31/iss1/2/|doi=10.13008/0737-0679.2091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[Jacques Derrida]] first used the term in ''The Animal that Therefore I Am'' (an address first delivered in 1997), speaking of “Kafka’s vast zoopoetics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=The Animal that Therefore I Am|year=2007|publisher=Fordham UP|location=New York|pages=6|translator=David Wills |editor=Marie-Louise Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt;   And so, in the broadest sense, zoopoetics suggests the presence of nonhuman animals within a text. In a 2008 dissertation, Christopher White establishes another facet of zoopoetics by conflating it with the term [[zoosemiotics]] (the sign-systems of nonhuman animals), and he uses both terms to explore the presence and sign-systems of animals in William Faulkner’s ''As I Lay Dying''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Christopher|title=Dissertation|journal=Animals, Technology, and the Zoopoetics of American Modernism|year=2008|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another facet of zoopoetics is explored in “Zoopoetics: A Look at [[E. E. Cummings|Cummings]], [[W. S. Merwin|Merwin]], &amp; the Expanding Field of Ecocriticism.”  Here, zoopoetics is more of an approach that “gravitates to the agency of nonhuman animals” within both the ecosphere and within texts.  The notion of animal agency is defined by how nonhuman animals are imaginative, [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]], and cultural beings.&lt;ref name=moe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moe|first=Aaron|title=Zoopoetics: Cummings, Merwin, &amp; the Expanding Field of Ecocriticism|journal=Humanimalia: A Journal of Human/Animal Interface Studies|year=2012|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.depauw.edu/site/humanimalia/issue%206/moe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The essay draws upon the well-known rhetorician George Kennedy, who published a controversial article in 1992: “A Hoot in the Dark: The Evolution of General Rhetoric.” In it, Kennedy argues that all animals, human and nonhuman, “share a ‘deep’ universal rhetoric.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=George|title=A Hoot in the Dark: The Evolution of General Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1992|volume=25|issue=1|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This rhetoric is not founded on sign-systems but rather upon what he calls the “rhetorical energy” of the gestures that deliver those sign-systems.  Animals (including humans) constantly navigate rhetorical situations by delivering gestures to an audience with a specific purpose.  Kennedy’s article challenged one of the long-standing assumptions concerning the difference between humans and animals, for he sees language as less of a distinguishing mark of human exceptionality and more of a commonality given the evolutionary origin shared by many animals. (For a recapitulation of the history of the response to Kennedy's article, as well as a defense of the ideas within it, see Debra Hawhee's "Toward a Bestial Rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawhee|first=Debra|title=Toward a Bestial Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=2011|volume=44|issue=1|pages=81–87|doi=10.1353/par.2011.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Aaron Moe's book ''Zoopoetics: Animals and the Making of Poetry'' explores the zoopoetic dynamic in the poetry of Whitman, Cummings, Merwin, Hillman as well as several other poets.

As with many literary terms, it is helpful to look at the term’s etymology.  Zoopoetics, etymologically speaking, has to do with how animals (''zoo'') can be capable of creation, or of "making" (''poesis''). Zoopoetics is seen as the process by which animal rhetorics may contribute to the making and shaping of both a specific poem as well as the overall poetics of a given author.&lt;ref name=moe2&gt;[http://aaronmoe.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/zoopoetics-revisited/ Moe, Aaron. (2012, March 21). "Zoopoetics Revisited" (blog post)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One premise underlying zoopoetics is the notion that humans are not the only beings who dwell ([[Heideggerian terminology#Lichtung|in Heideggerian sense]]) on the earth.  Nonhuman animals do as well.  Some human poetry hints at the dwelling of the animal, but for obvious reasons, such an endeavor is fraught with challenges.  Jacques Derrida articulates this challenge most clearly through his term limitrophy:

[[File:Carduelis pinus at feeder.jpg|thumb]]
:''Limitrophy'' is therefore my subject.  Not just because it will concern what sprouts or grows at the limit, around the limit, by maintaining the limit, but also what feeds the limit, generates it, raises it, and complicates it.  Everything I'll say will consist, certainly not in effacing the limit, but in multiplying its figures, in complicating, thickening, delinearizing, folding, and dividing the line precisely by making it increase and multiply. . . . [The limit] has an abyss:  The discussion is worth undertaking once it is a matter of determining the number, form, sense, or structure, the foliated consistency, of this abyssal limit, these edges, this plural and repeatedly folded frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=The Animal that Therefore I Am|year=2008|publisher=Fordham UP|location=New York|pages=29–30|translator=David Wills |editor=Marie-Louise Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit between the human and the animal becomes its own infinite terrain within the text, but Derrida seems to have overlooked one crucial aspect.  It is not just the human who strives to venture into the abyss of the animal—reaching with language and with gestures—for animals also strive to venture into the abyss of the human through their gestures and the vocalizations embedded within those gestures. Stephanie Rowe demonstrates what this ebb and flow encounter may look like in a text. In her article, Rowe explores how the orangutang in Poe's story reaches into the abyss of the human, seeking to change the human space into a shared space.  This occurs when the orangutang—a species whose culture is oft defined by grooming—takes on the human ritual of shaving.  His gestures are misunderstood, of course, which has morbid consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowe|first=Stephanie|title=No Human Hand? The Ourang-Outang in Poe's 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue,' in Animals and Agency: An Interdisciplinary Exploration|publisher=Brill|location=Boston|pages=107–128|editor=Sarah E. McFarland |editor2=Ryan Hediger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoopoetics, then, is an ebb and flow of energy between the human and the nonhuman.  The human reaches into the abyss of the animal, but acknowledges the animals reach as well.  Perhaps zoopoetics can best be experienced in a poetics that allows the gestures and vocalizations of nonhuman animals to permeate human language, through [[iconicity]], thereby creating a shared space.&lt;ref name=moe /&gt;

Within literary studies, there is a movement toward a multiculturalism that includes the social networks of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feder|first=Helena|title=Rethinking Multiculturalism: Theory and Nonhuman Cultures|journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment|year=2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=775–777}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this to happen, though, humans must take seriously the notion that animals enter into rhetorical situations, crafting their own texts, for audiences, with specific purposes.  The last thirty years of studies in animal behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laland|first=Kevin N. and Bennet G. Galef|title=The Question of Animal Culture|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; have, in part, influenced the proliferation of video documentary of animals crafting such texts.  For instance, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120203113419/http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/planet-earth-ice-worlds-humpback-hunt.html Planet Earth]'' captures several humpback whales coordinating efforts to surround krill with bubbles from their blowholes.  As the video unfolds, viewers hear and witness the text the humpback whales craft.  One can then infer that such behavior is learned, socially passed on from one generation of humpback to another.  One can further infer that a single humpback, or a group of humpbacks, collectively had an innovative breakthrough in using the bubbles as a tool.  This innovation had to be communicated to other humpbacks, and when this happens, the humpback enters into a rhetorical situation, relying on the text of song and gesture to communicate.

Orca also craft texts.  Ethologists have recognized that such texts help maintain group cohesion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sargeant|first=Brooke L. and Janet Mann|title=The Question of Animal Culture|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge|pages=161|editor=Kevin N. Laland |editor2= Bennet G. Galef|chapter=From Social Learning to Culture: Intrapopulation Variation in Bottlenose Dolphins}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and they may therefore exemplify how animal texts sustain nonhuman animal cultures. For a live feeds of orca vocalizations (and archives of past recordings) from the Puget Sound, listen to [http://orcasound.net/lk/ this hydrophone].

A wide range of animals demonstrate similar crafting of texts, but to take this seriously, one must wrestle with the implications of how nonhuman animals enter rhetorical situations.

'''Zouk''' is a musical style  originating from the Caribbean islands of [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] and popularized by the French Antillean band [[Kassav']] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |last= Pareles|first=Jon |date=1988 |title=Zouk, a Distinctive, Infectious Dance Music|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/arts/recordings-zouk-a-distinctive-infectious-dance-music.html |work=New York Times |location=New York |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very rapid in [[tempo]], the style lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of [[Compas]] / [[kompa]] and [[Cadence rampa|kadans]], the main music of the French Antilles. Today, zouk is the French Antilles compas (Kompa),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Manuel, Musics of the Non-Western World, Chicago press University 1988p74&lt;/ref&gt; also called zouk-love.

==Etymology==
The Creole word ''zouke'', ''sekwe'', or ''zouke'', etc. from the French verb ''secouer'' meaning "shake intensely and repeatedly" was used by Haitian artists who toured the French Antilles during the late 1970s and 1980s. &lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skah Sha and Magnum band were among the first Haitian music groups to use the word ''souke/zouke'' in the French Antilles. Magnum band, which toured the Caribbean countless times, once spent two years in Martinique and Guadeloupe. The band leader, guitar player Dadou Pasket, popularized the word ''zouke'' in many live tunes, especially on the album ''La seule difference'', Ibo Records, 1981, in the song "pike devan" meaning "full speed ahead". During the same year "Les Skah sha #1 that frequently toured the French Antilles featured an LP album called ''This is it'', produced by Mini Records, July 1981. "Zouke" is the second tune's title.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''zouk'' has, over time, come to mean "party" or "festival" in the local [[Antillean Creole]] of French.

==Zouk today{{when?|date=July 2018}}==
{{citations needed|date=July 2018}}
Zouk was an attempt to develop a proper local music that would lessen or even eradicate the meringue-kadans or [[compas]] influence from the French islands. When the MIDI technology came out, Kassav' used it fully, creating new sound in both their fast carnival beat and compas. The Antilleans were all over with zouk but as other bands from the Caribbean and Africa added the MIDI technology to their music and people got used to it. Because it was a jump up beat the fast zouk béton faded away In the same 1980s and Antilleans would continue to play and dance meringue-cadence or compas. After all, French Antilleans and Dominicans are important players of the style. However, the problem is that musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe have calculatedly labeled compas as zouk in order to remain on the map (keeping in mind Compas was created in 1950 by Haitians); creating a big confusion in Africa, Cabo Verde, Angola, Brazil, Portugal and other places. [[Kassav']], the originator of the zouk béton, is a compas music band that has taken compas to many places, and is the only band that continues to include zouk béton in its repertoire, though to a lesser extent.
