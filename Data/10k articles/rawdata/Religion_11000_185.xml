The word is derived from [[Urdu]], through the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Aadaab'', meaning etiquette.

Since the normal greeting of Muslims i.e. "[[As-salamu alaykum]]" was meant for Muslims only, and Muslims in India lived in a multi-faith and a multi-lingual society, this alternative form of greeting was coined. The use of ''Adab'' is especially popular in the Indian city of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], where religious pluralism has been historically emphasized; the [[Nizam]] of the region stated: "Hindus and Muslims are like my two eyes ... How can I favor one eye over the other?"&lt;ref name="Basit2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Basit|first=Abdul|title=The Global Muslim Community at a Crossroads: Understanding Religious Beliefs, Practices, and Infighting to End the Conflict|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9780313396977|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentalist elements in the society oppose the use of "Adab" in an all-Muslim society.

The gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the finger tips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gambhir|first=Vijay|title=The Teaching and Acquisition of South Asian Languages|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|isbn=0-8122-3328-X|pages=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mB7TQc_OpdcC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical for the person to say "''adab arz hai''" (Nastaleeq: آداب عرض ہے, Devanagari: आदाब अर्ज़ है), meaning "I offer my respects to you", or simply just "''adab''".&lt;ref name="Basit2012"/&gt; 
It is often answered with the same or the word "''Tasleem''" is said as an answer or sometimes it is answered with a facial gesture of acceptance.

In popular culture today, the adab is often associated with the courtly culture of the Muslim [[Nawab]]s.

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}

In the [[Book of Exodus]], '''Amram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|r|æ|m}}) is the husband of [[Jochebed]] and father of [[Aaron]], [[Moses]] and [[Miriam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|6:20|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Alternative spellings of the name include {{Hebrew Name|עַמְרָם|‘Amram|ʻĀmrām|"Friend of the most high"{{\}}"The people are exalted"}}.

== In the Bible ==

In addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the [[Septuagint]] state that Jochebed was Amram's father's cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed's cousin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx-kjv/Exodus/exo_006.htm Exodus 6:16–20, LXX -]&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Masoretic Text]] states that she was his father's sister.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New American Bible]]'', footnote to Exodus 6:20&lt;/ref&gt;  He is praised for his faith in the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref||Hebrews|11:23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the [[Book of Generations]], a hypothetically reconstructed document theorized to originate from a similar [[wiktionary:religiopolitical|religiopolitical]] group and date to the [[priestly source]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who Wrote The Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Biblical criticism|critical scholars]], the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants, is actually an [[aetiology|aetiological]] [[myth]] reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the [[Levites]] – the [[Gershonites]], [[Kohathites]], [[Merarites]], and [[Kohen|Aaronid]]s;&lt;ref name = "wnsmyy"&gt;''[[Peake's Commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – could not be portrayed as a brother to [[Gershon]], [[Kohath]], and [[Merari]], as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier [[Elohist]] source, mentions only that ''both'' his parents were Levites (without identifying their names).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|2:1–2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both [[matrilinear descent|matrilineal]] and [[patrilinear descent|patrilineal]] descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses.&lt;ref name = "wnsmyy"/&gt;

== In Islam ==
''Amram'' is Arabicized to ''‘Imrān'' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|m|ˈ|r|ɑː|n}}, {{lang-ar|عِـمْـرَان}}). Commentators of the [[Quran]] have linked two individuals to the Arabic name.&lt;ref name=Ayoub&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ayoub |first=Mahmoud M. |title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters: Volume 2: Surah 3 |publisher=Islamic Book Trust |date=2013-05-21 |page=93 |isbn=978-967-5062-91-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unanimous in asserting that Imran in verse {{Cite Quran|3|35|expand=no|style=nosup}} is clearly the father of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], whose genealogy, according to [[al-Tabari]], traces back to [[King David|David]].&lt;ref name=Ayoub /&gt; However, they disagreed whether the Imran mentioned in verse {{Cite Quran|3|33|expand=no|style=nosup}} was the father of Moses and Aaron, or Mary.&lt;ref name=Ayoub /&gt; According to Islam, Imran was a noble man.

== Family tree ==

According to the [[Septuagint]], Amram's family tree would be as follows:
{{familytree/start}}
{{familytree | }}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | LEV |~|y|~| WIF | | | BRV | LEV=[[Levi]]|WIF=(Unnamed)|BRV=(unnamed)}}

{{familytree | | | | | | | | | LEV |~|y|~| WIF | | LEV=[[Levi]]|WIF=(unnamed)}}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | }}

{{familytree | }}
{{familytree/end}}

According to [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|The Book of Jasher]], Amram's family tree would be:
{{familytree/start}}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |jb|jb=Eber}}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!}}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |jb|jb=Yoktan}}

{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | }}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| }}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | GER | | KOH | | MER | | JOC| GER=[[Gershon]]|KOH=[[Kehath]]|MER=[[Merari]]|JOC=[[Jochebed]]}}

{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | }}
{{familytree | | | MIR | | AAR | | MOS | | | MIR=[[Miriam]]|AAR=[[Aaron]]|MOS=[[Moses]]}}
{{familytree | }}
{{familytree/end}}  Amram married his aunt, Jochebed, the sister of his father Kehath.&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Jasher 67:2; see also Exodus 6:20&lt;/ref&gt;

== In rabbinical and apocryphal literature ==

In the [[Apocrypha]]l ''[[Testament of Levi]]'', it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of [[Levi]], when Levi was 64 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of the Patriarchs'', Levi:12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exodus Rabbah]] argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed;&lt;ref name = "ssdjlv"&gt;Exodus Rabbah 1:17&lt;/ref&gt; however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again.&lt;ref name = "ssdjlv"/&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baba Batra]] 17a&lt;/ref&gt;  The other three  ancient Israelites who died without sin, being [[Benjamin]], [[Jesse]] and [[Chileab]].

According to the [[Book of Jubilees]], Amram was among the Israelites who took the bones of Jacob's sons (excluding those of [[Joseph (Genesis))|Joseph]]) to Canaan for burial in the [[cave of Machpelah]].&lt;ref name="Jubilees 46:11"&gt;Jubilees 46:11&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Israelites then returned to Egypt but some remained in Canaan, including Amram who only returned somewhere up to forty years later.

One of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (4Q535, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the ''[[Visions of Amram]]''. The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]:
{{quote|I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me...holding a great contest over me. I asked them, 'Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?' They answered, 'We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.' They said to me, 'Which of us do you choose to rule you?' I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark....And I looked again, and in his appearance, his visage like a [[Viperidae|viper]]....I replied to him, 'This Watcher, who is he?' He answered, 'This Watcher...his three names are [[Belial]] and Prince of Darkness and King of Evil.' I said (to the other Watcher), 'My lord, what dominion (have you?)' He answered, 'You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (am empowered over all Light.)...My three names are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Prince of Light (Bible)|Prince of Light]] and [[King of Righteousness]].&lt;ref&gt;translation by Prof. Robert Eisenman&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Lord Risbabhdev moving over golden lotus after attaining Omniscience.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicitng [[Rishabhanatha]], the first Arihant of the present half cycle of time (''[[avasarpini]]'') moving over lotus after attaining omniscience.]]
{{Jainism}}
'''''Arihant''''' ({{lang-pka|arihant|italic=yes}}, {{lang-sa|árhat|italic=yes}} "conqueror") is a [[soul]] who has conquered inner passions such as attachment, anger, pride and greed. Having destroyed four inimical karmas, they realize pure self.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} ''Arihants'' are also called ''kevalins'' ([[omniscience|omniscient]] beings) as they possess ''[[kevala jnana]]'' (pure infinite knowledge).{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} An ''arihant'' is also called a '''''jina''''' ("victor"). At the end of their life, ''arihants'' destroy remaining ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and attain ''[[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (liberation) and become ''[[Siddha#Jainism|siddhas]]''. ''Arihantas'' have a body while ''siddhas'' are bodiless pure spirit. The [[Namokar Mantra|Ṇamōkāra mantra]], the fundamental prayer dedicated to ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]'' (five supreme beings), begins with ''Ṇamō arihantāṇaṁ'', "obeisance to the arihants".

''Kevalins'' - omniscient beings - are said to be of two kinds{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
# ''[[Tirthankara]] kevalī'':  24 human spiritual guides who after attaining omniscience teach the path to salvation.{{sfn|Rankin|2013|p=40}}
# ''Sāmānya kevalī'': ''Kevalins'' who are concerned with their own liberation.

According to Jains, every soul has the potential to become an ''arihant''. A soul which destroys all [[kashaya (Jainism)|''kashayas'']] or inner enemies like [[anger]], ego, [[deception]], and [[greed]], responsible for the perpetuation of ignorance, becomes an ''arihant''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} 

== Philosophy ==
According to Jain texts, [[omniscience]] is attained on the destruction of four types of ''karmas''– deluding, the knowledge-obscuring, the perception-obscuring and the obstructive ''karmas'', in the order mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reality|last=Jain|first=S.A.|year=1960|publisher=Vira Sasana Sangha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRIaAAAAMAAJ |quote=Non-Copyright |p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''arihants'' are said to be free from the following eighteen imperfections:{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=3}}

# ''janma'' – (re)birth;
# ''jarā'' – old-age;
# ''triśā'' – thirst;
# ''kśudhā'' – hunger;
# ''vismaya'' – astonishment;
# ''arati'' – displeasure;
# ''kheda'' – regret;
# ''roga'' – sickness;
# ''śoka'' – grief;
# ''mada'' – pride;
# ''moha'' – delusion;
# ''bhaya'' – fear;
# ''nidrā'' – sleep;
# ''cintā'' – anxiety;
# ''sveda'' – perspiration;
# ''rāga'' – attachment;
# ''dveśa'' – aversion; and
# ''maraņa'' – death.

=== Omniscience ===
{{Main|Kevala Jnana}}
[[File:Kevalajnana.jpg|thumb|Kevala Jñāna of Mahavira]]
In Jainism, omniscience is said to be the infinite, all-embracing knowledge that reflects, as it were in a mirror, all substances and their infinite modes, extending through the past, the present and the future.{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=2}} According to Jain texts, omniscience is the natural attribute of the pure souls. The self-attaining omniscience becomes a ''kevalin''.

The four infinitudes (''ananta cātuṣṭaya'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=3}} 
# ''ananta jñāna'', infinite knowledge
# ''ananta darśana'', perfect perception due to the destruction of all darśanāvaraṇīya karmas
# ''ananta sukha'', infinite bliss
# ''ananta vīrya'' – infinite energy

== Tirthankaras ==
{{Main|Tirthankara}}
[[File:Vardhaman Keezhakuyilkudi.jpg|thumb|right|Image of ''Vardhaman Mahāvīra'', the 24th and last tirthankara of present half time cycle]]
Those ''arihants'' who re-establish the Jain faith are called ''tirthankaras''. ''Tirthankaras'' revitalize the ''[[Sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]'', the fourfold order consisting of male saints (''[[Sadhu|sādhu]]s''), female saints (''sādhvis''), male householders (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'') and female householders (''srāvika'').

The first ''tirthankara ''of the current time cycle was [[Rishabhanatha|Ṛṣabhanātha]], and the twenty-fourth and last Tirthankara was [[Mahavira]], who lived from 599 BCE to 527 BCE.

[[File:Samavasarana.jpg|thumb|[[Samavasarana]] (divine preaching hall) where omniscient ''Arihantas'' preach]]

Jain texts mention forty-six attributes of ''arihants'' or ''tirthankaras''. These attributes comprise four infinitudes (''ananta chatushtaya''), thirty-four miraculous happenings (''atiśaya''), and eight splendours (''prātihārya'').{{sfn|Jain|2014|p=3}}

The eight splendours (''prātihārya'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=181}}
# ''aśokavrikśa'' – the [[Ashoka tree]];
#  ''siṃhāsana''– bejeweled throne;
#  ''chatra'' – three-tier canopy;
#  ''bhāmadal'' – halo of unmatched luminance;
#  ''divya dhvani'' – divine voice of the Lord without lip movement;
#  ''puśpavarśā'' – shower of fragrant flowers;
#  ''camara'' – waving of sixty-four majestic hand-fans; and
#  ''dundubhi'' – dulcet sound of kettle-drums and other musical instruments.

== Liberation ==
At the time of ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]'' (final release), the ''arihant'' sheds off the remaining four ''aghati karmas'':
# ''Nama'' (physical structure forming) karma
# ''[[Gotra]]'' (status forming) karma,
# ''Vedniya'' (pain and pleasure causing) karma,
# ''Ayushya'' (life span determining) karma.

These four karmas do not affect the true nature of the soul and are therefore called ''aghati karmas''.

== Worship ==
[[File:Hatigumfa.jpg|thumb|[[Hathigumpha inscription]] of [[Kharavela|King Khāravela]] at [[Udayagiri_and_Khandagiri_Caves|Udayagiri Caves]], second Century BCE, starts with [[Namokar Mantra]] ]]
In the Ṇamōkāra mantra, ''Namo Arihantanam, Namo Siddhanam'', Jains worship the arihants first and then to the ''siddhas'', even though the latter are perfected souls who have destroyed all karmas but arihants are considered to be at a higher spiritual stage than ''siddhas''. Since ''siddhas'' have attained ultimate liberation, they probably are not directly accessible but may be through the wisdom they passed on. However arihants are accessible for spiritual guidance of human society until their nirvana. The ''[[Dravyasamgraha|Dravyasaṃgraha]]'', a major [[Jain literature|Jain text]], states:
{{quote|Having destroyed the four inimical varieties of karmas (''ghātiyā karmas''), possessed of infinite faith, happiness, knowledge and power, and housed in most auspicious body (''paramaudārika śarīra''), that pure soul of the World Teacher (Arihant) should be meditated on.|''{{IAST|Dravyasaṃgraha}}'' (50){{sfn|Jain|2013|p=177}}}}

An '''Armenian cross''' is a symbol that combines a [[cross]] with a floral postament or elements. In the [[Armenian Christianity]] it was combined with the [[Christian cross]] and this design was often used for [[high cross]]es ([[khachkar]]) – a free-standing cross made of stone and often richly decorated.

'''Buddhism in Venezuela''' is practiced by over 52,000 people (roughly 0.2% of the population). The Buddhist community is made up mainly of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese Venezuelan|Japanese]], and [[Korean people|Koreans]].

Most identify with the [[Mahayana]] tradition, reflecting the religious heritage of their emigrant countries.

However, in the mid-1990s [[Keun-Tshen Goba]] (''né'' Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta), together with Jigme Rinzen, founded a meditation center using the [[Shambhala Training]] method.
There are Buddhist centers in [[Caracas]], [[Maracay]], [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], [[Puerto Ordáz]], [[San Felipe, Venezuela|San Felipe]], and [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]].

'''Buddhist ethics''' as an academic discipline is relatively new, blossoming in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;This is a contestable point. The reason that the "mid-1990s" is stated is due to the sharp increase in activity in the field at that time: the publication of the first systematic study of the topic, the founding of the first academic journal devoted to the topic, and an American Academy of Religion panel (Philadelphia, 20 November 1995) devoted to "Revisioning Buddhist Ethics". Before this short span, there were ventures into Buddhist ethics, but no period marks such a dramatic "burst" in academic activity as the mid-1990s.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much like [[Critical Buddhism]] and [[Buddhist modernism]], it is a result of recent exchanges of Eastern and Western thought. While generally thought of as a sub-field of [[Buddhist studies]], the discipline of Buddhist ethics draws together history, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, and more in an attempt to understand what may be the fundamental question of Buddhism: how ought man live?&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (1992). ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific work has been produced on Buddhist ethics dating back to the 1920s. Early descriptive accounts of Buddhist ethics include Tachibana’s ''Ethics of Buddhism'' (1926), focused on [[Theravada|Theravādin]] ethics, and Poussin’s ''La Morale Bouddhique'' (1927), based on [[Mahāyāna]] texts. Other early authors that expressed interest in Buddhist ethics include [[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids]] and [[Isaline Blew Horner]]. In 1979 the ''Journal of Religious Studies'' featured a section devoted to the study of Theravādin ethics. featuring four prominent scholars in [[Buddhist studies]].&lt;ref&gt;(1979 Vol. 7 (1) pp.1-64)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==
Buddhist ethics emerged as an academic discipline in 1992, with the publication of Damien Keown's book ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics''. His subsequent co-founding of the ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' in 1994 further solidified the birth of a new field in the discipline of Buddhist studies. Prior to Keown's book, only a handful of books and articles existed that attempted to delve into the questions of a specifically Buddhist ethic. Even more daunting, however, has been the separation of 'ethics' from the rest of Buddhism. Buddhism has been called an eminently ethical religion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It has also been argued, by Keown and others, that the very question the Buddha sought to answer was a purely ethical one, namely, "the perennial problem of the best kind of life for man to lead."&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (1992). ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 [[Columbia University]] hosted the first conference dedicated solely to Buddhist ethics entitled [http://www.cbs.columbia.edu/buddhist_ethics/ Contemporary Perspectives on Buddhist Ethics].

== Trends ==

Arguably the most fruitful attempt to define Buddhist ethics has been in terms of Western theories from [[Aristotle]] ([[virtue]]), [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] ([[deontological]]), and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[James Mill]] ([[utilitarian]]). However, others—mainly non-Western scholars—have sought to present Buddhist ethics in a more direct or traditional form.

===Aristotle / virtue===
{{See also|Virtue ethics}}
In ''Buddhist Ethics as Virtue Ethics'', Nick Gier compares Buddha's ethical teachings to Aristotle's, "Like Greek virtue ethics, Buddhist ethics is also humanistic and thoroughly personalist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/307/buddve.htm ''Buddhist Ethics as Virtue Ethics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Damien Keown]] devotes a great deal of his work to debunking claims that Buddhism is utilitarian in nature. His work then goes on to examine the structure of Buddhist ethics, focusing specifically on morality (Pali: ''siila''). His conclusion is that Buddhist ethics most closely resembles the ancient Greek virtue ethics found in Aristotle.

James Whitehill, in ''Buddhist Ethics in Western Context: The Virtues Approach'', says, "Buddhism's legitimation in the West can be partially met by demonstrating that Buddhist morality is a virtue-oriented, character-based, community-focused ethics, commensurate with the Western 'ethics of virtue' tradition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistethics.org/1/white1.html ''Buddhist Ethics in Western Context: The Virtues Approach''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220151652/http://www.buddhistethics.org/1/white1.html |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kant / Deontological===
A handful of pioneering works have sought to examine similarities between Kantian and Buddhist ethics.  One such is Bradford Cokelet's "Reflections on Kant and Karma".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I would argue that, given the recent popularity of claiming that Buddhist ethics is a type of virtue ethics, Buddhist ethicists should respond to criticisms that Kant and Kantians have made of western versions of virtue ethics and to claims that most virtue-ethical criticisms of Kantianism rest on misunderstandings of Kant and Kantianism. See for example, J.B. Schneewind, “The Misfortunes of Virtue,” in Ethics, Volume 101, 1990, p. 42-63, Barbara Herman, “Making Room for Character,” and Allen W. Wood, “Self-love, Self-benevolence, and Self-conceit,” both in Kant, Aristotle, and the Stoics, ed. [[Jennifer Whiting]] and Stephen Engstrom, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1996, and Onora O’Neill, Towards Justice and Virtue, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1996." fn. 20, p.13."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bentham/Mill - utilitarian===
{{See also|Utilitarianism}}
Mark Siderits suggests that the doctrine of [[anatta]] provides the grounding for an "aretaic consequentialism" &lt;ref&gt;Siderits, "Buddhist Reductionism..." p.293&lt;/ref&gt; in which the goal is the alleviation of suffering for all beings (realizing that there is no "self" to be freed apart from others). He follows a long line of thinkers in Buddhist ethics.

===Traditional Buddhist ethics===
Two key teachers of traditional Buddhist ethics are [[Hammalawa Saddhatissa]] and [[Padmasiri De Silva]]. Saddhatissa was a [[Sri Lanka]]n Buddhist monk who wrote ''Buddhist Ethics'' in 1970 (reprinted in 1987, 1997 &amp; 2003). De Silva has a similar work, ''Buddhism, Ethics and Society: The Conflicts and Dilemmas of Our Times'' (2002). A third, and less notable work is ''The Way to Social Harmony'' (1989, available online) by Venerable U Pyinnyathiha.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/pyinya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

These works can be invaluable as an introduction into key Buddhist canonical texts such as the [[Sigalovada Sutta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for the Study of World Christianity''' (CSWC) is a research centre based in [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]], the School of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. It was founded in the [[University of Aberdeen]] by [[Andrew F.

== Research ==
The Centre promotes historical, theological, and social scientific research in the field of [[World Christianity]] – broadly speaking, Christianity in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, and eastern Europe, as well as diasporic forms of non-Western Christianity emerging in contexts such as Western Europe and North America. Closely related to the Centre is the peer-reviewed academic journal ''[[Studies in World Christianity]]'', published three times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/journal/ |title= Journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity |access-date= 7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is one of the main sponsors of the Yale-Edinburgh Group on the History of the Missionary Movement and World Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-Edinburgh Group Website|url=http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Yale-Edinburgh/|website=divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains its own research archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/collections/ |title= Collection |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity |access-date= 7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the Christ in Christianity [[Christianity and Judaism#The Messiah|originated from the concept]] of the [[messiah]] in [[Judaism]]. Although the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the [[split of early Christianity and Judaism]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]].

Though the original [[Disciple (Christianity)|followers of Jesus]] believed Jesus to be the Jewish messiah, e.g. in the [[Confession of Peter]], before the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jesus was usually referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" or "Jesus, son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]".&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Jesus Christ | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 May 2013 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus came to be called "Jesus Christ" (meaning "Jesus the ''Khristós''", i.e. "Jesus the Messiah" or "Jesus the Anointed") by his followers after his crucifixion and resurrection. Christians believe that the [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] were fulfilled in his [[Ministry of Jesus|mission]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].

It is also used as a title, in the reciprocal use "Christ Jesus", meaning "the Messiah Jesus", and independently as "the Christ".&lt;ref name=Pannenberg/&gt;

The followers of Jesus became known as Christians (as in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|11:26|9}}) because they believed Jesus to be the ''Khristós'' or ''Mashiach'' [[prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=Miriam /&gt;&lt;ref name=mercer142&gt;{{cite book|title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |first1=Watson E. |last1=Mills |first2=Roger Aubrey |last2=Bullard |year=1998 |isbn=0-86554-373-9 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was not, and is not, [[Rejection of Jesus#Jewish rejection|accepted in Judaism]] as [[Messiah in Judaism|a Jewish messiah]], and the concept of a divine messiah was always rejected by [[Judaism]] as [[Idolatry#Judaism|idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The nine questions people ask about Judaism |first1=Dennis |last1=Prager | authorlink1=Dennis Prager |first2=Joseph |last2=Telushkin | authorlink2=Joseph Telushkin |year=1981 |isbn=0-671-42593-5 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious [[Jews]] still await their messiah's first coming and the [[Messiah#Judaism|Messianic prophecies of Jewish tradition]] to be accomplished.

==Etymology==
Christ comes from {{lang|grc|Χριστός}} (''Christos''), meaning "[[anointing|anointed]] one". In the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]], ''christos'' was used to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מָשִׁיחַ (''Mašíaḥ,'' messiah), meaning "[one who is] anointed.", a title allegedly adopted from the term for the tradition of anointing the Egyptian pharaoh during coronation or marriage with oil drawn from the fat of ''messeh'', who was the sacred crocodile or crocodile star in the spells and the same anointing ritual may be traced to earlier Mesopotamian [[Mušḫuššu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Ahmed|title=Jesus in the House of the Pharaohs: The Essene Revelations on the Historical Jesus|date=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781591438786|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VkoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Laurence|title=Genesis of the Grail Kings: The Pendragon Legacy of Adam and Eve |publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=9780593044308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPEQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=crocodile+star+messeh&amp;dq=crocodile+star+messeh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg4ciFwvzYAhWFEVAKHTTOC_0Q6AEIbjAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rush|first1=John A.|title=The Twelve Gates: A Spiritual Passage Through the Egyptian Books of the Dead|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=9781583941751|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yl8WpoJrPMoC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coffins of Egyptian mummies the word ''krst'' is found as a blessing and anointing  from [[Horus]] and [[Osiris]], hence the word ''Christos'' is thought as loaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Philip|title=Gateways to the Otherworld: The Secrets Beyond the Final Journey, from the Egyptian Underworld to the Gates in the Sky: Easyread Super Large 18pt Edition|isbn=9781442960992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tk6hcjx6BfgC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Egypt Light Of The World 2 Vol Set|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134568918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcBYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Krst'' denoted the process of preparation of the mummy by embalming, purifying and anointing, and can mean anointed, buried or covered in oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=Gerald|title=Ancient Egypt - Light Of The World, Volume 1|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=9783849644444|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED-kAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlow|first1=Lewis S.|title=The Imminent Second Coming|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781466953536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0PpaLrzElQC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ifie|first1=Egbe|title=Papers in Honour of Professor Dapo Adelugba at 60|publisher=End-Time Publishing House, Indiana University|isbn=9789782163004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wkKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=krst+anoint&amp;dq=krst+anoint&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPgo_I0PzYAhWPa1AKHejNBLs4FBDoAQhfMAk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elleh|first1=Nnamdi|title=African Architecture: Evolution and Transformation|date=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill, the University of Michigan|isbn=9780070215061|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yHqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=krst+anoint&amp;dq=krst+anoint&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPgo_I0PzYAhWPa1AKHejNBLs4FBDoAQhMMAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The word ''Christ'' (and similar spellings) appears in English and in most European [[languages|language]]s. English-speakers now often use "Christ" as if it were a name, one part of the name "Jesus Christ", though it was originally a title ("the Messiah"). Its usage in "Christ Jesus" emphasizes its nature as a title.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg&gt;{{cite book|title= Jesus God and Man |first= Wolfhart |last= Pannenberg | authorlink= Wolfhart Pannenberg |year= 1968 |isbn= 0-664-24468-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zWfvlpURwiIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA30|pages= 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miriam &gt;{{cite book|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |first= Wendy |last= Doniger | authorlink= Wendy Doniger |year=2000 |isbn= 0-87779-044-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA212|page= 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare the usage "the Christ".

The spelling ''Christ'' in English became [[standardization|standardized]] in the 18th century, when, in the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the spelling of certain words changed to fit their [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] origins. Prior to this, scribes writing in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]] usually used the spelling ''Crist'' - the ''i'' being pronounced either as {{IPAc-en|iː}}, preserved in the names of churches such as [[St Katherine Cree]], or as a short {{IPAc-en|ɪ}}, preserved in the modern pronunciation of "[[Christmas]]". The spelling "Christ" in English is attested from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern and ancient usage, even in secular terminology, "Christ" usually refers to Jesus, based on the centuries-old tradition of such usage. Since the [[Apostolic Age]], the&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] use of the definite article before the word Christ and its gradual development into a proper name show the Christians identified the bearer with the promised Messias of the Jews.&lt;ref name=CathencChrist&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Ancient Greek]] text of the [[deuterocanonical books]], the term "Christ" (Χριστός, [[Romanization of Greek|translit.]] Christós) is found in [[2 Maccabees]] 1:10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Maccabees-Chapter-1_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible, Second Book of Maccabees, chapter 1, verse 10 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=2Mc&amp;ch=1&amp;interlin=on | title = Greek Septuagint and Wiki English Translation, Second Book of Maccabees, chapter 1 | website = katabiblon.com | language = en, gr | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to the [[High Priest of Israel#Consecration|anointed High Priest of Israel]]) and in the [[Sirach|Book of Sirach]] 46:19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ecclesiasticus-Chapter-46_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible, Book of Sirach, chapter 46, verse 19 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=Sir&amp;ch=46 | title = Greek Septuagint and Wiki English Translation, Book of Sirach, chapter 46 | website = katabiblon.com | language = en, gr | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in relation to [[Samuel#Biblical account#Calling|Samuel]], prophet and institutor of the kingdom under Saul.

==Background and New Testament references==
[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|130px|First page of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century): "''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''".]]

At the time of Jesus, there was no single form of [[Second Temple Judaism]], and there were significant political, social, and religious differences among the various Jewish groups.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 &gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=1-60477-929-2 |pages=147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for centuries the Jews had used the term ''moshiach'' ("anointed") to refer to their expected deliverer.&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt; A large number of Old Testament passages were regarded as [[Messiah|messianic]] by the Jews, many more than are commonly considered messianic by Christians, and different groups of Jews assigned varying degrees of significance to them.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

The Greek word ''messias'' appears only twice in the [[Septuagint]] of the promised prince ({{Bibleref2|Daniel|9:26}}; {{Bibleref2|Psalm|2:2}}). This title was used when a name was wanted for the promised one who was to be at once King and Savior.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah &gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Messiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasper &gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus the Christ |first=Walter |last=Kasper | authorlink=Walter Kasper |year=1976 |isbn=0-8091-2081-X |pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Testament]] states that the long-awaited messiah had come and describes this savior as "the Christ". In {{bibleref|Matt|16:16}}, the apostle Peter said, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleref2|Mark|1:1|KJV|1:1}} ("The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God") identifies Jesus as both Christ and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]]. The divinity is re-affirmed in {{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Mark never applies the term ''Christ'' to Jesus as a name. {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:1}} uses Christ as a name and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:16|4=1:16}} explains it again with: "Jesus, who is called Christ". In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus referred to himself as the Son of God far more frequently than in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |pages=363–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the definite article before the word "Christ" and its gradual development into a proper name show that the Christians identified Jesus with the promised messiah of the Jews who fulfilled all the [[Christian messianic prophecies|Messianic predictions]] in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the [[rabbis]].&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt;

The Gospels of Mark and Matthew begin by calling Jesus both Christ and the Son of God, but these are two distinct attributions. They develop in the New Testament along separate paths and have distinct theological implications. At the time in [[Roman Judaea]], the Jews had been awaiting the "Messiah", and many people were wondering who it would be. When John the Baptist appeared and began preaching, he attracted disciples who assumed that he would be announced as the messiah, or "the one" that they had been awaiting. 

In the three [[Synoptic Gospels]], the Baptism of Jesus is the first fact of the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament#Ministry |public ministry of Jesus]] and the first instance explicitly claiming that He is  the Son of God, directly by [[God the Father]] and the descent of the Holy Spirit God, in aspect of a [[Doves as symbols#Christianity|dove]] upon Him: [[Mark 1|Mark, chapter 1]] (verses from 9 to 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Mark-Chapter-1_Original-1611-KJV |title= 1611 King James Bible, Gospel of Mark, Chapter 1 |language= en |year= 1611 |website= kingjamesbibleonline.org |archive-url= |archive-date= |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Matthew 3|Matthew, chapter 3]] (verses 15 to 17)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-Chapter-3_Original-1611-KJV |title= 1611 King James Bible, Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 3, vers 15 to 17 |year=1611 |website = kingjamesbibleonline.org |language= en |archive-url= |archive-date= |deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Luke 3|Luke, chapter 3]] (vv. 15 to 17)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611_Luke-Chapter-3 | title = 1611 King James Bible, Gospel of Luke, Chapter 3, verses 15 to 17 | year = 1611 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike Mark 1, the other two Synoptic Gospels don't refer the Baptism of Jesus in their first chapter. Nevertheless, [[Luke 1]] narrows the birth of John the Baptist, and chapter 3 of Matthew is titled as its ''first narrative section'' by some translations of the Bible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.maranatha.it/Bibbia/5-VangeliAtti/49-LucaPage.htm | title = gospel of Mathew, chapter 3 | website = maranatha.it | language = it | access-date = Sep 28, 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}, [[Episcopal Conference of Italy]] official translation, published in 1974&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the [[Gospel of John|Gospel of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist]] too, the first instance of Jesus being called the Son of God appears during [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]] by John the Baptist. In the narrative, a voice from heaven called Jesus "My Son". John the Baptist was in prison in the [[Messengers from John the Baptist]] episode ({{bibleref2|Matthew|11:2–6|NIV;KJV}} and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleref2|Luke|7:18–23|KJV|7:18–23}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gospel of Matthew |first=Rudolf |last=Schnackenburg |authorlink=Rudolf Schnackenburg |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4438-3 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two of his disciples ask Jesus a question on his behalf: "Are you the one to come after me or shall we wait for another?"&lt;ref name=mercer459&gt;{{cite book|title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |first1=Watson E. |last1=Mills |first2=Roger Aubrey |last2=Bullard |year=1998 |isbn=0-86554-373-9 |page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;—indicating that John doubted the identity of Jesus as Christ at that time (see also [[Rejection of Jesus]]).

In {{bibleref2|John|11:27|NIV;KJV}} Martha told Jesus, "you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world", signifying that both titles were generally accepted (yet considered distinct) among the followers of Jesus before the [[raising of Lazarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=1-60477-929-2 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit claims of Jesus being the messiah are found in the canonical gospels in the [[Confession of Peter]] (e.g. {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16|9}}) and the words of Jesus before his judges at his [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial before the Sanhedrin]].&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|16:13–20}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|8:27–30|9}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|9:18–20|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents involve far more than a mere Messianic claim; taken in their setting, they constitute a claim to be the Son of God.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;

In the trial of Jesus before the [[Sanhedrin]] and [[Pontius Pilate]], it might appear from the narratives of Matthew and Luke that Jesus at first refused a direct reply to the high priest's question: "Art thou the Christ?", where his answer is given merely as "''su eipas"'' ("thou hast said it"). The Gospel of Mark, however, states the answer as "''ego eimi"'' ("I am"), and there are instances from [[Jewish literature]] in which the expression "thou hast said it" is equivalent to "you are right".&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; The Messianic claim was less significant than the claim to divinity, which caused the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]'s horrified accusation of [[blasphemy]] and the subsequent call for the death sentence. Before Pilate, on the other hand, it was merely the assertion of his [[Kingship and kingdom of God|royal]] dignity which gave grounds for his condemnation.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;

The word "Christ" is closely associated with Jesus in the [[Pauline epistles]], which suggests that there was no need for the [[early Christians]] to claim that Jesus is Christ because it was considered widely accepted among them. Hence [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] can use the term ''Khristós'' with no confusion as to whom it refers, and he can use expressions such as "in Christ" to refer to the followers of Jesus, as in {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|4:15|KJV}} and {{bibleref2|Romans|12:5|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul proclaimed him as the [[Last Adam]], who restored through obedience what [[Adam]] lost through disobedience.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of theology: A concise Sacramentum mundi |first=Karl |last=Rahner |authorlink=Karl Rahner |year=2004 |isbn=0-86012-006-6 |pages=730–739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pauline epistles are a source of some key Christological connections; e.g., {{bibleref2|Ephesians|3:17–19|9}} relates the [[love of Christ]] to the [[knowledge of Christ]], and considers the love of Christ as a necessity for knowing him.&lt;ref name=WBarc152&gt;{{cite book|title=The letters to the Galatians and Ephesians |first=William |last=Barclay | authorlink=William Barclay (theologian) |year=2002 |isbn=0-664-22559-4 |pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also implicit claims to him being the Christ in the words and actions of Jesus.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; Episodes in the life of Jesus and statements about what he accomplished during his public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]]. [[Trinitarianism]] summarily claims: "Jesus Christ was [[Hypostatic union|fully God and fully man]] in one [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|person]], and will be so [[In saecula saeculorum|forever]]."&lt;ref name="Grudem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grudem |first=Wayne A. | authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine |publisher=Zondervan |year=1994 |isbn=0-310-28670-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUPWk9ng3wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0310286700&amp;pg=PA529|chapter=The Person Of Christ |page=529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-existence, Incarnation and Nativity===
{{see also|Pre-existence of Christ|Logos (Christianity)|Nativity of Jesus}}
[[File:Sainte-marie Madeleine2.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Anointing of Jesus]], c. 1450]]
There are distinct, and differing, views among Christians regarding the existence of Christ before his conception. A key passage in the New Testament is {{bibleverse||John|1:1–18|NIV}} where John 1:17 specifically mentions that "grace and truth came through Jesus Christ." Those who believe in the [[Trinity]], consider Christ a pre-existent divine [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]] called the [[Logos]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]]. Other, non-Trinitarian views, question the aspect of personal pre-existence or question the aspect of divinity, or both. An example is the Orthodox Gnomic view, which asserts that Christ was, in fact, not a pre-existent divine being.

The concept of Christ as [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] derives from {{bibleverse||John|1:1|NIV}}: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In the original Greek, ''[[Logos]]'' (λόγος) is used for "Word," and is often used untranslated. In the [[Christology]] of the Logos, Christ is viewed as the Incarnation of the "Divine Logos", i.e. The Word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A theology primer |first=Robert C. |last=Neville |authorlink=Robert Cummings Neville |year=1991 |isbn=0-7914-0849-3 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century, with his theory of "recapitulation", [[Irenaeus]] connected "Christ the Creator" with "Christ the Savior", relying on {{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:10|NIV}} ("when the times reach their fulfillment – to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ") to gather together and ''wrap up'' the cycle of the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era |first=Lisa D.

Christian teachings present the [[Love of Christ]] as a basis for his sacrificial act that brought forth salvation.&lt;ref name=Matera155/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamar192/&gt; In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:31|John 14:31]] Jesus explains that his sacrifice was performed so: "that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do."&lt;ref name=Lamar192&gt;{{cite book|title=Preaching the Gospel of John: Proclaiming the Living Word |first=Lamar |last=Williamson |year=2004 |isbn=0-664-22533-0 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#5:25|Ephesians 5:25]] then states that: "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it".&lt;ref name=Matera155&gt;{{cite book|title=New Testament Christology |first=Frank J. |last=Matera | year = 1999 |isbn=0-664-25694-5 |pages=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century, [[Irenaeus]] expressed his views of salvation in terms of the imitation of Christ and his theory of "recapitulation". For Irenaeus the imitation of Christ is based on God's plan of salvation, which involved Christ as the "[[Last Adam]]"&lt;ref&gt;Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, eds, ''Mercer dictionary of the Bible''. 1998, p. 10. {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. G. Dunn|Dunn, James D.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=NHFfHulVTNMC&amp;pg=PA241 p. 241]. {{ISBN|0802844235}}&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed the incarnation as the way in which Christ repaired the damage done by Adam's disobedience. For Irenaeus, salvation was achieved by Christ restoring humanity to the image of God, and he saw the Christian imitation of Christ as a key component on the path to salvation.&lt;ref name=McKim &gt;{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Irenaeus Christ succeeded on every point on which Adam failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era |first=Lisa D. Maugans |last=Driver|year=2009 |isbn=0-664-22897-6  |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus drew a number of parallels, e.g. just as in the fall of Adam resulted from the fruit of a tree, Irenaeus saw redemption and salvation as the fruit of another tree: the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross of crucifixion]].&lt;ref name=McKim /&gt;

Following in the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline tradition]], in the 5th century [[Augustine of Hippo]] viewed Christ as the mediator of the [[New Covenant]] between God and man and as the conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God after the fall of Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An introduction to the theology of religions|first=Veli-Matti |last=Kärkkäinen| author-link = Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen |year=2003 |isbn=0-8308-2572-X |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] aimed to recapture the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] on the role of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the economy of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Saint Thomas Aquinas |first1=Gilles |last1=Emery |first2=Francesca Aran |last2=Murphy |year=2010 |isbn=0-19-958221-1 |pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aquinas' view [[angels]] and humans were created for salvation from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thomas Aquinas' trinitarian theology: A study in theological method |first=Timothy Lee |last=Smith |isbn=978-0-8132-1097-1 |publisher=CUA Press |year=2003 |pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aquinas the [[Passion of Christ]] poured out the grace of salvation and all its virtues unto humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 |first=Erwin |last=Fahlbusch |year=2008 |isbn=0-8028-2417-X |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] distinguished the history of salvation [[Law and Gospel|between the Old and the New Testament]], and saw a new dimension to salvation with the arrival of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systematic Theology, Volume 3 |first=Wolfhart |last=Pannenberg | authorlink=Wolfhart Pannenberg |year=2004 |isbn=0-567-08068-4 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on human history was an important element of the biblically grounded 16th-century theology of [[John Calvin]]. Calvin considered the [[Ministry of Jesus|first coming of Christ]] as the key turning point in human history. He viewed Christ as "the one through whom salvation began" and he saw the completion of Christ's plan of salvation as his death and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].&lt;ref name=McKim161 &gt;{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|80px|The ''[[Chi-Rho]]'']]
The use of "Χ", derived from Chi, the [[Greek alphabet]] initial, as an abbreviation for Christ (most commonly in the abbreviation "[[Χmas]]") is often misinterpreted as a modern secularization of the term. Thus understood, the centuries-old English word Χmas, is actually a shortened form of CHmas, which is, itself, a shortened form for Christmas. Christians are sometimes referred to as "Xians", with the 'X' replacing 'Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early Christogram is the ''[[Chi Rho]]'' symbol formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in Christ ({{lang|grc|"Χριστός"}}), [[chi (letter)|chi]] = ch and [[rho (letter)|rho]] = r, to produce &lt;big&gt;☧&lt;/big&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Symbols of the Christian faith |first=Alva William |last=Steffler |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4676-9 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, on Christian fasting days of [[Lent]] ([[Ash Wednesday]] and [[Good Friday]]), the [[Catholic Church]] prescribes "one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/catholic-information-on-lenten-fast-and-abstinence.cfm|title=Fast &amp; Abstinence|year=2018|publisher=[[USCCB]]|language=English|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an [[Evangelical Lutheran]] publication delineating fasting guidelines states that "On fasting days, two ¼ meals are eaten, and one regular meal in the evening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glctulsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fasting-Guidelines-Rev-2016.pdf|title=Fasting Guidelines|publisher=[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|language=English|year=2016|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saint Augustine's Prayer Book|Traditional Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion]] defines "Fasting, usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent."&lt;ref name="Gavitt1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gavitt|first=Loren Nichols|title=Traditional Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion|accessdate=11 June 2015|year=1991|publisher=Holy Cross Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The [[France|French]] court of [[Louis XIV]] used the term collation to refer to light meals in general. In [[British English]] today, a collation is likewise a light meal, offered to guests when there is insufficient time for fuller entertainment. It is often rendered '''cold collation''' in reference to the usual lack of hot or cooked food. The [[Polish language|Polish]] word ''kolacja'' ("[[supper]]") is a derivation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} 

In modern [[Italian language|Italian]], the two small meals are the ''prima colazione'' (breakfast) and ''seconda colazione'' (lunch). The word "colazione" itself in the general language now means "breakfast" (whereas the English "break their fast" for breakfast; lunch is ''pranzo'' in Italian).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6423">'''Cowrie-shell divination''' refers to several distinct forms of [[divination]] using [[cowrie]] shells that are part of the [[ritual]]s and [[religion|religious beliefs]] of certain religions. Though best-documented in [[West Africa]] as well as in [[Afro-American religions]], such as [[Santería]], [[Candomblé]], and [[Umbanda]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Edouard Leopold Verger|Pierre Fatumbi Verger]] (1954): ''Dieux D'Afrique'' Paul Hartmann, Paris (1st edition, 1954; 2nd edition, 1995). 400 pages, 160 photos, {{ISBN|2-909571-13-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Verger, ''Notas Sobre o Culto aos Orixás e Voduns''. 624 ages.  Portuguese translation by Carlos E. M. Moura. Editora da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, 1999 {{ISBN|85-314-0475-4}}

&lt;/ref&gt; cowrie-shell divination has also been recorded in other regions, notably [[East Africa]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Wilfrid Jackson (1917). ''Shells as Evidence of the Migrations of Early Culture''. London: Longmans, Green, &amp; Co. (pp. 144-45, 170)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In West Africa==
Several forms of cowrie-shell divination are distributed broadly throughout West Africa.

While there are many variants using from eight to 21 cowrie shells, West African-derived forms most commonly use 16 cowrie shells on a prepared table or on a mat on the ground, interpreting the patterns that result which are known as Odu. Before casting the shells, the priest/priestess invokes and salutes the [[Orisha]]s, and puts questions to them. The Orishas answer the questions by influencing the way the shells fall on the table.

===Merindinlogun===
Merindinlogun (from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''mẹrindínlógún'' "sixteen", literally "four taken from 20") is a cowrie-shell divination method practiced in the [[Yoruba religion]].

The number 16 holds important significance in Yoruba mythology as it was the purported number of original divinities that established life on earth. In merindinlogun divination, the shells are thrown and the number of shells that fall with the opening facing up is associated with a certain odu. This system of divination is used when consulting the Orishas.

==In the African diaspora==
Cowrie-shell divination is found in [[Latin America]] where it plays an important role in religions like Santería and Candomblé.

In [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]], it is called ''dilogun''.&lt;ref&gt;Ocha ni'lele (2003). ''The Diloggun: The Orishas, Sacrifices, Proverbs, and Prohibitions of Cuban Santeria''. Destiny Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], it is called ''merindinlogun''.

Though they share a common root, Caribbean and South American cowrie shell divination have subsequently developed in independence from West African practice. For example, among Caribbean diviners, the first throw of the shells involves throwing them twice to derive a composite ''Odu.''

===In Santería===
The cowrie-shells, called dilogun, are used by priests and priestesses of [[Santería]], who are called Santeros and Santeras, respectively. Both men and women who have been initiated into Santería can read cowrie shells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutsanteria.com Cynthia Duncan, Ph.D. About Santeria]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a combination of 256 possible odu and a skilled diviner can interpret the meaning of each one, depending on the orientation of the reading. If the reading comes in Ire, the client will experience good fortune, and if it comes in Osorbo, the client faces obstacles that can be overcome with the help of the Orichás.

===In Candomblé===

}}
The cowrie shell, as collected from a beach, has a flattened side with a longitudinal slit, and a smooth, rounded side. Like a [[coin]], the shell has only two stable positions on a flat surface, with the slit side facing either up or down. A few cowrie-shell diviners use the shells in this natural state; then the outcome of the throw, for each piece, is either "open" (slit up) or "closed" (slit down).

Most priests, however, use modified shells whose rounded part has been ground away, creating a second, artificial opening. The two stable positions of the shell are still called "open" or "closed" for divination purposes. In most [[Candomblé]] houses, "open" still means that the natural opening is facing up; but some traditions (mainly in [[Candomblé Ketu]]) use the opposite convention.
The number of "open" shells is used to select an item (''odú'') which direct the diviner to a fixed list of oracular verses.

[[File:A woman makes a cursing ritual ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A woman performs a cursing ritual ([[Hokusai]])]]

A '''curse''' (also called an '''imprecation''', '''malediction''', '''execration''', '''malison''', '''[[anathema]]''', or '''commination''') is any expressed [[wish]] that some form of [[adversity]] or misfortune will befall or attach to some other [[entity]]: one or more persons, a place, or an object. In particular, "curse" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a [[supernatural]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] power, such as a [[god]] or gods, a [[spirit]], or a [[Natural phenomenon|natural force]], or else as a kind of [[spell (paranormal)|spell]] by [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[witchcraft]]; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a '''hex''' or a '''jinx'''. In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying [[ritual]]) is considered to have some causative force in the result. To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called "removal" or "breaking", as the [[Incantation|spell]] has to be dispelled, and is often requiring elaborate rituals or prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chauran|first=Alexandra |title=Have You Been Hexed? Recognizing and Breaking Curses|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2013|isbn =0-7387-3620-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1170 - Keramikos Museum, Athens - Curse inscription - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 12 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek curse written on a lead sheet, 4th century BC, [[Kerameikos]] Archaeological Museum, [[Athens]].]]

The study of the forms of curses comprise a significant proportion of the study of both [[folk religion]] and [[folklore]]. The deliberate attempt to levy curses is often part of the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In [[Hindu]] [[culture]] the Sage or [[Rishi]] is believed to have the power to [[blessing|bless]] and curse. Examples include the curse placed by Rishi Bhrigu on king Nahusha&lt;ref name="author"&gt;{{cite book|author=author|title=The Mahabharata, Book 13 of 18: Anusasana Parva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YdaEN-kM5wC&amp;pg=PA408|accessdate=4 September 2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-60506-623-3|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the one placed by Rishi Devala.&lt;ref name="Buddhaghosha1870"&gt;{{cite book|author=Buddhaghosha|title=Buddhaghosha's Parables: translated from Burmese by Captain T. Rogers: With an Introduction, containing Buddha's Dhammapada, or "Path of Virtue", translated from Pâli by F. Max Müller|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeJRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA22|year=1870|publisher=Trübner|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Special names for specific types of curses can be found in various cultures:
* [[African American]] [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] presents us with the [[jinx]] and crossed conditions, as well as a form of foot track magic which was used by Ramandeep, whereby cursed objects are laid in the paths of victims and activated when walked over.
* Middle Eastern and Mediterranean culture is the source of the belief in the [[evil eye]], which may be the result of envy but, more rarely, is said to be the result of a deliberate curse. In order to be protected from the evil eye, a protection item is made from dark blue circular glass, with a circle of white around the black dot in the middle, which is reminiscent of a human eye. The size of the protective eye item may vary.
* German people, including the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] speak in terms of [[pow-wow (folk magic)|hexing]] (from ''hexen'', the German word for doing witchcraft), and a common hex in days past was that laid by a stable-witch who caused milk cows to go dry and horses to go lame.

==Tecumseh's curse==
[[Tecumseh's curse]] was reputed to cause the deaths in office of [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] elected in years divisible by 20, beginning in 1840. This alleged curse appears to have fallen dormant, since [[Ronald Reagan]] (elected in 1980) survived an assassination attempt and [[George W. Bush]] (elected in 2000) survived his eight-year presidency.

==As plot devices==
Curses have also been used as [[plot device]]s in literature and theater.  When used as a plot device they involve one character placing a curse or hex over another character.  This is distinguished from adverse spells and premonitions and other such plot devices.  Examples of the curse as a plot device are the following:
* ''[[Rigoletto]]'' -- Count Monterone places a curse on Rigoletto.  Rigoletto blames the climactic death of his daughter on the curse.
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' -- A dying Mercutio curses the Montagues and Capulets with "A plague 'o both your houses." (Often quoted as "a pox on both your houses.")
* "[[Sleeping Beauty]]" -- Maleficent places a curse on Princess Aurora to die on her 16th birthday.
* "[[Beauty and the Beast]]"  -- Enchantress transforms prince to beast.
* “[[Shrek]]” —- The Princess Fiona was cursed by a witch; to be human by day, but ogre by night.

==Sports==
{{Main article|Sports-related curses}}
A number of curses are used to explain the failures or misfortunes of specific sports teams, players, or even cities. For example:
* No first-time winner of the [[World Snooker Championship]] has successfully defended his title since the event was first held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]] in [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]]. This has been widely attributed to a '''"[[Crucible Curse]]"'''.
* The '''[[Curse of the Billy Goat]]''' was used to explain the failures of the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball team, who did not win a World Series championship between 1908 and 2016, and a National League pennant between 1945 and 2016.
* There was a famous curse called the '''[[Curse of the Bambino]]''' on the [[Boston Red Sox]] Major League Baseball team. After the Red Sox sold [[Babe Ruth]], who had won 3 of the 5 Red Sox World Series titles at the time, to the [[New York Yankees]] where he won his final 4 titles, it took the Red Sox 86 years to win another World Series (1918-2004). In 2004 the Red Sox made history in the [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) coming back from 0 games to 3, winning 4 games in a row against their archrivals the New York Yankees blowing out game 7 in the Bronx 10 to 3, this is cited as one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. The Red Sox secured the AL Pennant and then went on to sweep the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]], 4 games to 0 ending the curse once and for all. Three years later they would win sweep again in the [[2007 World Series]] against the [[Colorado Rockies]], and in {{wsy|2013}} they added a third championship by defeating the Cardinals 4 games to 2.
* The '''"Krukow Kurse"''' was used to explain the [[San Francisco Giants]]' failure to ever win the [[World Series]] until 2010. It is attributed to [[Mike Krukow]] (a former [[pitcher]] for the Giants and a current [[Sports presenter|broadcaster]] for the team) based upon his yearly [[pre-season]] predictions that the Giants "have a chance" to win the [[World Series]]. Once Krukow stops making such predictions—says the [[legend]]—the Giants will, in fact, win the [[World Series]]. However, the Giants went on to win the World Series in 2010. It was during the same year that Krukow's partner, Giants broadcaster, Duane Kuiper stated "Giants  baseball, it's torture!", due to the large amount of close games that they played.  This phrase was adopted by fans and became a rallying cry throughout the second half of the season and the playoff run.
* Marketing experts have highlighted '''"the curse of [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]"''', given the mishaps that happen to sports stars associated with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/international/article/2009/nov/29/shaven-but-stirred-the-gillette-curse/|title=Shaven but stirred: the Gillette curse|last=Mesure|first=Susie|date=November 29, 2009|work=Tribune News|publisher=Tribune.ie|accessdate=21 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609204203/http://www.tribune.ie/news/international/article/2009/nov/29/shaven-but-stirred-the-gillette-curse/|archive-date=9 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/henry-woods-federer-the-curse-of-gillette-1830663.html|title=Henry, Woods, Federer: The curse of Gillette|last=Mesure|first=Susie|date=29 November 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects==
[[File:1172 - Keramikos Museum, Athens - Curse inscription - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 12 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek cursed object against enemies in a trial, written on a lead figurine put in a lead box, 420-410 BC, [[Kerameikos]] Archaeological Museum, [[Athens]].]]
Cursed objects are generally supposed to have been stolen from their rightful owners or looted from a sanctuary. The [[Hope Diamond]] is supposed to bear such a curse, and bring misfortune to its owner. The stories behind why these items are cursed vary, but they usually are said to bring bad luck or to manifest unusual phenomena related to their presence. [[Busby's stoop chair]] was reportedly cursed by the murderer Thomas Busby shortly before his execution so that everyone who would sit in it would die.

==Egyptians and mummies==
[[File:Donation stele with curse inscription.jpg|right|225px|thumb|[[Limestone]] donation-[[stele]] from [[Mendes]], [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|3rd Intermediate Period]], [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XXII]]. The inscription celebrates a donation of land to an Egyptian temple, and places a curse on anyone who would misuse or appropriate the land.]]
There is a broad popular belief in curses being associated with the violation of the tombs of [[mummy|mummified]] corpses, or of the mummies themselves. The idea became so widespread as to become a pop-culture mainstay, especially in [[horror film]]s (though originally the curse was invisible, a series of mysterious deaths, rather than the walking-dead mummies of later fiction). The "[[Curse of the Pharaohs]]" is supposed to have haunted the [[archeologist]]s who excavated the tomb of [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]], whereby an imprecation was supposedly pronounced from the grave by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian priests, on anyone who violated its precincts. Similar dubious suspicions have surrounded the excavation and examination of the (natural, not embalmed) [[Ötztal Alps|Alpine]] mummy, "[[Ötzi the Iceman]]". While such curses are generally considered to have been popularized and sensationalized by British journalists of the 19th century, ancient Egyptians were in fact known to place curse inscriptions on markers protecting temple or tomb goods or property.

==Bible==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=January 2018}}
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article ''Cursing'', the Bible depicts [[God in Christianity|God]] cursing the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]], the earth, and [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|3:14|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|3:17|NIV}},&lt;ref&gt;On Genesis 3:17 cf. Andreas Dorschel, 'Entwurf einer Theorie des Fluchens', ''Variations'' 23 (2015), § 29, pp. 167–175, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|4:11|NIV}}). Similarly [[Noah]] curses [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|9:25|NIV}}), and [[Joshua]] curses the man who should build the city of [[Jericho]] ({{bibleref|Joshua|6:26-27|NIV}}). In various books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] there are long lists of curses against transgressors of [[Mosaic Law|the Law]] ({{bibleref|Leviticus|26:14-25|NIV}}, {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|27:15|NIV}}, etc.). The 10 [[Plagues of Egypt]], preceeding [[Ten Commandments|the 10 Commandments]], can be seen as curses cast from the [[Nehushtan|magical rod]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of Aron and Moses acting on instruction from the God of Israel, in order to enable the enthralled to come free from the yoke of enforced [[serfdom]], [[slavery]] and the like.

In the [[New Testament]], Christ [[Cursing the fig tree|curses the barren fig-tree]] ({{bibleref|Mark|11:14|NIV}}), pronounces his denunciation of woe against the [[Rejection of Jesus#Chorazin.2C Bethsaida and Capernaum|incredulous cities]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|11:21|NIV}}), against [[Jesus and the rich young man|the rich]], the worldly, [[Woes of the Pharisees|the scribes and the Pharisees]], and [[The Sheep and the Goats|foretells the awful malediction that is to come upon the damned]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|25:41|NIV}}). The word curse is also applied to the victim of [[expiation]] for [[sin]] ({{bibleref|Galatians|3:13|NIV}}), to sins [[Venial sin|temporal]] and [[Eternal sin|eternal]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|2:17|NIV}}; {{bibleref|Matthew|25:41|NIV}})."&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle = Cursing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Egungun masquerade dance garment.jpg|thumb|right|An egungun masquerade dance garment in the permanent collection of [[The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis]]]]
'''Egungun''', in the broadest sense of the word, refers to all types of [[Yoruba culture|Yoruba]] masquerades or masked, costumed figures.&lt;ref name=Adepegba&gt;{{cite book|last=Adepegba|first=C.O.|title=. Yoruba Egungun: Its association with ancestors and the typology  of Yoruba masquerades by its costume|year=1984|publisher=University of Ibadan|location=Ibadan, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, "Egungun" refers to the Yoruba masquerades connected with [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor reverence]], or to the ancestors themselves as a collective force. The singular form, for an individual ancestor, is '''Egun''' or '''Eegun'''.

==Classification of Egungun types==
[[File:Voudou Chile.jpg|thumb|left|]]
The classification of Egun or Egungun types, might appear to be a fairly straightforward task, but in fact it is extremely complex deciphering the comprehension of indigenous taxonomies. The difficulties include: the problem of distinguishing between personal Egun names and generic terms for types; the problem of determining "sets" where one masquerader may be regarded as within several type categories simultaneously; the practice of "layering," in which a masquerader wears one costume type over another and changes these during performance; and the variety of criteria used to classify Egungun as well as the range of variations within type categories. Such factors demonstrate the complexity of the analysis of indigenous taxonomies and the classification of masquerade types. These same difficulties arise in the definition and use of the term Egungun itself.&lt;ref name=Drewal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewal|first=H.T.|title=The Arts of Egungun among Yoruba Peoples|journal=African Arts|date=April 1978|volume=11|issue=3|pages=18–19+97–98|doi=10.2307/3335409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family Role in Egungun ==
In the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] religion, the annual ceremonies in honor of the dead serve as a means of assuring their ancestors a place among the living. They believe the ancestors have the responsibility to compel the living to uphold the ethical standards of the past generations of their clan, town or family. The Egungun are celebrated in festivals, known as '''Odun Egungun''', and in family ritual through the masquerade custom.

In family situations, a family elder known either formally or informally as "Alagba" presides over ancestral rites.  He may or may not be initiated into the local Egungun society.  In matters that deal with whole communities, Egungun priests and initiates who are trained in ancestral communication, ancestral elevation and funerary rites are assigned to invoke and bring out the ancestors. They wear elaborate costumes in masquerade.  Through drumming and dance, the Egungun robed performers are believed to become possessed by the spirits of the ancestors, as manifested as a single entity. The Egungun spiritually cleans the community; through the dramatic acting and miming of the robed priests, they demonstrate both ethical and amoral behavior that have occurred since their last visit.  In this way, they expose the strengths and weaknesses of the community to encourage behavior more befitting of their descendants. When this performance is completed, the performers as Egungun give messages, warnings and blessings to the assembled spectators.

Important Egungun include the Oloolu and Alapansanpa, both of Ibadanland.  Elewe of the [[Igbomina|Ìgbómìnà]] Yoruba [[clan]], which is common in the towns of [[Oke-Ila|Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún]], Ìlá Òràngún, and Arandun, is also of particular prominence.

In [[Brazil]], the main cult of the Egungun is found on the island of [[Itaparica]], in the State of [[Bahia]].  Houses of worship dedicated to the Egungun also exist in other states.

==Egungun ensembles==
[[File:Yoruba Egungun Dance Costume Brooklyn Museum.jpg|thumb| Egungun Costume (mid-20th century) [[Brooklyn Museum]] ]]
Cloth plays an important role in the world of the Yoruba. Their beliefs equate nakedness with infancy, insanity, or the lack of social responsibility.&lt;ref name=Bascom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bascom|first=W.R.|title=Social Status, Wealth and Individual Differences among the Yoruba|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=53|pages=490–505|doi=10.1525/aa.1951.53.4.02a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt; More elaborate dress reflects social power and prestige. In performances honoring ancestors, exquisite cloth is the major medium for the masker's transformation. An Egungun costume is composed of multiple layers of cloth lappets made from expensive and prestigious textiles, expressing the wealth and status of a family as well as the power of the ancestor.

The composition of an Egungun ensemble has several distinctive features. The layer worn closest to the masker's skin, the undersack, must be made of Aso-Oke, the indigo and white strip-cloth (Fig. 6). It closely resembles the shroud in which the dead are wrapped.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carlos.digitalscholarship.emory.edu/items/show/7947|title=Egungun Masquerade Costume · Michael C. Carlos Museum Collections Online|website=carlos.digitalscholarship.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sack, along with the netting for the face and hands, must completely seal the masker's body. The netting effectively disguises facial and hand features that might disclose his identity.

On top of this base are placed the layers of lappets. As the masker whirls, the lappets are sent flying, creating a "breeze of blessing." The design of the costume is therefore closely related to the choreography of the performance. Henry Drewal hypothesizes that the breeze of blessing created by the Egungun may also relate to [[Oya]], the wife of [[Shango]], the deified fourth king of [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] and the god of thunder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt; Oya is the whirlwind, considered a wind of blessing, that precedes Shango, the storm.

To make the costume beautiful, and thus powerful, the lappets are decorated with patchwork patterns, braids, sequins, tassels, and amulets. The amulets hold medicinal preparations which have performative power ([[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]), providing protection against enemies at a time when the transformed person is vulnerable.The main protective amulets, however, are on the inside of the costume, not the outside. Metallic objects are also sewn onto the garment. These catch the light as the wearer moves, creating flashes that suggest connection to the spirit world, orun.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The multiple hidden and visible layers of fabric used to create an Egungun costume signify the sacred and the worldly, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The layers, used in combination, suggest the reunion of the departed and the living.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An ensemble is repaired and refurbished for use year after year, with layers of new lappets and amulets added to express remembrance and honour. Through divination, however, an ancestor might request a new costume altogether. The owner and the patron, the priest of divination, the tailor, the herbalist who prepares the packets of medicines, and the entire lineage collaborate in creating the ensemble. Depending upon its wealth, a family may own several types of Egungun costumes, which may represent specific or collective ancestors of the lineage.

The Egungun ensemble acts as the medium for the masker's transformation into his ancestors. An Egungun society is composed of men and women whose lineages have the right to present the masquerade. Men do the masking. Women never wear the costume, although they participate in the chorus that sings the oriki [[praise poems]] and histories of the families. Elder women of high title also perform invocations, prayers, and offerings. At annual festivals, each of the numerous lineages is given a separate day to perform. The masker is kept at a distance from the surrounding crowd with the help of attendants dressed in masquerade costumes of different types. After all the Egungun have danced, the ensembles are stored until the next performance.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=Mary Ann |author2=Henry J. Drewal |author3=Moyo Okediji|title=Transformation through Cloth: An Egungun Costume of the Yoruba|journal=African Arts|date=Spring 1995|volume=28|issue=2|pages=54–57|doi=10.2307/3337226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's role in Egungun ==
Egungun masquerades are male dominated within the performance aspect and women play an integral role in the ritual. Only males are allowed to connect with the spirits in Egungun by transforming into the masked figure. However, women are not powerless in the ritual of Egungun. Women are important to the creation of the materials, dramatizing the performance, singing, dancing and serving as an audience member. Elders say separation is necessary because of the dangers of women power. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Willis|first=John Thabiti|title=The Role of Women in Egungun Masquerades - Hist 282 - f11|date=2011-11-15|url=https://vimeo.com/32176247|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ifa|Ifa corpus]],  women were once in control of Egungun and the ritual originates from women’s religious experience in Yoruba.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-jstor-org.ez-proxy.brooklyn.cuny.edu/stable/25002489?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents|title=EZ-Proxy - Login|website=www-jstor-org.ez-proxy.brooklyn.cuny.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that women were the sustainers of Egungun and according to the ''Odu Irantegbe'' ''chapter'' of the  Ifa corpus, they were tricked by men and their powers over the Egungun cult were taken away. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Five of Wands or Batons''' is a card used in Latin suited playing cards which include [[tarot|tarot decks]]. It is part of what [[tarot reading|tarot card readers]] call the "[[Minor Arcana]]".

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divinatory purposes==
A posse of youths are brandishing staves (wands), as if in sport or strife.  This illustrates a kind of mimic warfare and corresponds to these divinatory meanings: Imitation, as in taking part with others, for example, in a sham fight; a strenuous competition and struggle in the search for riches and fortune.  It is about being alert, engaged, ready to struggle and fight for what is important; defending what you perceive as yours.  Also, a card that foretells the acquisition of gold; a card of gain.

If the card appears reversed, this indicates that the questioner seeks to avoid conflict at all costs, and may submit to others to their own detriment.

The '''Foundation Stone''' ({{lang-he|אבן השתייה}} ''Even ha-Shtiyya'' or {{lang-he|סֶּלַע‏}} ''Selā‛'', {{lang-ar|صخرة}} ''Sakhrah'' "Rock") is the name of the rock at the centre of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. It is also known as the '''Pierced Stone''' because it has a small hole on the southeastern corner that enters a cavern beneath the rock, known as the [[Well of Souls]]. There is a difference of opinion in classical Jewish sources as to whether this was the location of the [[Holy of Holies]] or of the Outer Altar. According to those that hold it was the site of the Holy of Holies, that would make this the holiest site in Judaism (''[[Tanhuma]]'', chapter 10).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Jewish tradition views the Holy of Holies as the spiritual junction of [[Heaven]] and Earth, the [[axis mundi]], and is therefore the direction that Jews face when praying the [[Amidah]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The other view, that this was the site of the Outer Altar, would explain the holes in the stone which served various sacrificial purposes in the Outer Altar.{{cn|date=November 2017}} From a classical Jewish textual standpoint, there is no conclusive opinion on the matter.

==Location==
The rock is located towards the centre of the [[Temple Mount]], an artificial platform built and expanded over many centuries. The current shape is the result of an expansion by [[Herod the Great]] on top of vaults over a [[summit]] called [[Moriah|Mount Moriah]] which three millennia ago was the highest elevation in early Jerusalem's proximity to the [[City of David]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

There is some controversy among secular scholars about equating Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount and the Foundation Stone as the location where events occurred according to the Biblical narrative.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Early Jewish writings assist in confirming that the [[Dome of the Rock]], completed in 691, is the site of the [[Holy of Holies]] and therefore the location of the Foundation Stone. ''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, Gerald, Pirkê de rabbi Eliezer, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; co. Ltd., London, 1916, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; a [[midrash]]ic narrative of the more important events of the [[Torah]] believed to have been compiled in [[Italy]] shortly after 833 CE, writes: "[[Rabbi Ishmael]] said: In the future, the sons of [[Ishmael]] (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the [[Land of Israel]] … They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple and ''construct a building on the site of the sanctuary''."

[[Rabbi]]s have discussed the precise location of the rock. [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] was convinced that "under the dome on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt is the location of the Foundation Stone."&lt;ref&gt;[[Responsa]] 691.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Travels of [[Petachiah of Regensburg|Petachia of Ratisbon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A. Benisch, Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon (with English translation), London 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; c.1180, ''The Travels of [[Benjamin of Tudela]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Travels in the Middle Ages; (English translation originally published by Joseph Simon/Pangloss Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0-934710-07-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Travels of the Student of the [[Nachmanides|Ramban]]'' all equally state that "on the Temple Mount stands a beautiful sanctuary which an Arab king built long ago, over the place of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] sanctuary and courtyard." [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura]], who wrote a letter from Jerusalem in 1488, says that "I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful dome which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct."&lt;ref&gt;Avraham Ya'ari, ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'', Ramat Gan 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditional sources disagreed; operating under the belief that the [[Southern Wall]] of the Temple Mount as it stood in their time was the Southern Wall of the Biblical era, they argued that the measurements given in the [[Talmud]] do not reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;Rav lshtori HaParchi (14th Century), ''Kaftor VeFerach'', Provence, France.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy of Holies ends up being too far north and they therefore locate the Foundation Stone as being directly opposite the current exposed section of the [[Western Wall]], where no building currently stands. This is the view of [[Isaac Luria]]&lt;ref&gt;''Emek HaMelech'', Preface, paragraph 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Maharsha]],&lt;ref&gt;End of [[Makkot]].&lt;/ref&gt; who state the prophecy that "[[Zion]] will become a ploughed field" indicates that no dwelling will be established there until the time of the [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]]. It therefore follows that the footprint of the Temple courtyard and Holy of Holies is situated in the unbuilt area between the Dome of the Rock and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig6.html|title=Fig. 6. The Southern System (237 K)|publisher=Templemount.org|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe the position is north of the Dome of the Rock, opposite the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Gate of Mercy]], which Emmanuel Hai Ricci&lt;ref&gt;''Aderes Eliyahu''.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies as the Shushan Gate mentioned in the [[Talmud]]. This gate was described as being opposite the opening of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig5.html|title=Fig. 5. The Northern System (63K)|publisher=Templemount.org|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Jewish academics list four possible locations of the Foundation Stone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templemount.org/tempmt.html|title=The Hidden Secrets of the Temple Mount|publisher=Templemount.org|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The stone that was located beneath the Ark of the Covenant is now near El Kas fountain to the South of the Dome of the Rock.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
#The stone that was located beneath the Ark of the Covenant is now inside the Spirits Dome situated to the North of the Dome of the Rock.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Description==
Although the rock is part of the surrounding 90-million-year-old, Upper [[Turonian]] Stage, [[Late Cretaceous]] [[karst]]ed [[Meleke|limestone]],{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} the southern side forms a ledge, with a gap between it and the surrounding ground; a set of steps currently uses this gap to provide access from the Dome of the Rock to the Well of Souls beneath it.

The rock has several artificial cuts in its surface generally attributed to the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Christian kings of Jerusalem]] placed a protective marble slab over the rock. The marble slab was removed by [[Saladin]]. More recently, there has been speculation that several artificial features of the rock's surface may substantially predate the Crusades.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]] reports&lt;ref&gt;[[Leen Ritmeyer|Ritmeyer, Leen]], The Quest (2006), pp. 263-268.&lt;/ref&gt; that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 [[cubit]]s, precisely the width that the [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;Tractate [[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]] 4.7&lt;/ref&gt; credits to the wall of the Holy of Holies, and hence Ritmeyer proposed that these flat sections constitute ''foundation trenches'' on top of which the walls of [[Solomon's Temple|the original temple]] were laid. However, according to [[Josephus]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} there were 31 steps up to the Holy of Holies from the lower level of the Temple Mount, and the Mishnah identifies 29 steps in total{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and each step was half a cubit in height (according to the Mishnah); this is a height of at least 22 feet—the height of the Sakhra is 21 feet above the lower level of the Temple Mount, and should therefore have been under the floor.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Measuring the flat surface as the position of the southern wall of a square enclosure, the west and north sides of which are formed by the low clean-cut ''scarp'' at these edges of the rock, at the position of the hypothetical centre is a rectangular cut in the rock that is about 2.5 cubits (min. 120.4&amp;nbsp;cm SI) long and 1.5 cubits (min. 72.24&amp;nbsp;cm SI) wide, which are the dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant (according to the [[Book of Exodus]]&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 25:10&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Mishnah&lt;ref&gt;Tractate [[Yoma]] 5:3.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the height of the rock as three thumb-breadths (min. 6&amp;nbsp;cm SI) above the ground. Radbaz&lt;ref&gt;[[Responsa]] (639).&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the apparent contradiction of the Mishnah’s measurements and the actual measurement of the rock within the Dome he estimates as a “height of two men” above the ground. He concluded that many changes in the natural configuration of the Temple Mount have taken place which can be attributed to excavations made by the various occupiers of Jerusalem since the [[Second Temple]] construction.

{{Main article|Temple in Jerusalem}}
This is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews all over the world pray towards the Foundation Stone.

The Roman-Era midrash ''[[Tanhuma]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Kedoshim]] Ch.10.&lt;/ref&gt; sums up the centrality of and holiness of this site in Judaism:
:As the navel is set in the centre of the human body,
:so is the land of Israel the navel of the world...
:situated in the centre of the world,
:and Jerusalem in the centre of the land of Israel,
:and the sanctuary in the centre of Jerusalem,
:and the holy place in the centre of the sanctuary,
:and the ark in the centre of the holy place,
:and the '''Foundation Stone''' before the holy place,
:because from it the world was founded.

According to the sages of the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;Tractate [[Yoma]] 54b.&lt;/ref&gt; it was from this rock that the world was created, itself being the first part of the Earth to come into existence. In the words of the ''[[Zohar]]'', "The world was not created until God took a stone called ''Even haShetiya'' and threw it into the depths where it was fixed from above till below, and from it the world expanded. It is the centre point of the world and on this spot stood the Holy of Holies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vayechi]] 1:231.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Talmud, it was close to here, on the site of the altar, that God gathered the earth that was formed into [[Adam]]. It was on this rock that Adam—and later [[Cain and Abel]] and [[Noah]]—offered sacrifices to God. Jewish sources identify this rock as the place of the [[Binding of Isaac]] mentioned in the [[Bible]], where [[Abraham]] fulfilled God's test to see if he would be willing to sacrifice his son. The mountain is identified as Moriah in Genesis 22. It is also identified as the rock upon which [[Jacob]] dreamt about angels ascending and descending on a ladder and consequently consecrating and offering a sacrifice upon.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

When, according to the Bible, King [[David]] purchased a threshing floor owned by [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]],&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Chronicles]] 21:25, and [[2 Samuel]] 24:18-25.&lt;/ref&gt; it is believed that it was upon this rock that he offered the sacrifice mentioned in the verse. He wanted to construct a permanent temple there, but as his hands were "bloodied", he was forbidden to do so himself. The task was left to his son [[Solomon]], who completed [[Solomon's Temple|the Temple]] in c. 950 BCE.

The Mishnah in tractate [[Yoma]]&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Yoma 5:2.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a stone situated in the Holy of Holies that was called ''Shetiya'' and had been revealed by the early prophets (i.e. David and [[Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;Tractate [[Sotah]] 48b.&lt;/ref&gt;).

An early [[Christian]] source noting Jewish attachment to the rock may be found in the ''[[Itinerarium Burdigalense]]'', written between 333–334 CE when Jerusalem was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, which describes a "perforated stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/pilgr/bord/10Bord07aJerus.html#590|title=Bordeaux Pilgrim - Text: 7a. Jerusalem (first part)|publisher=Christusrex.org|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the Temple===
Situated inside the Holy of Holies, this was the rock upon which the Ark of the Covenant was placed in Solomon's Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zohar]] [[Vayechi]] 1:231; [[Midrash]] [[Tanchuma]] [[Acharei]] Ch.3 (see ''Etz Yosef'' commentary); [[Maimonides]], Beis HaBechirah 4:1.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Temple]] period when the Ark of the Covenant was not present, the stone was used by the High Priest who offered up the incense and sprinkled the blood of the sacrifices on it during the [[Yom Kippur]] service.

===Commemoration in Jewish law===
The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] states:
{{quote|
"נשייא דנהגן דלא למי שתייה עמרא מן דאב עליל מנהג – שבו פסקה אבן שתייה".

Women are accustomed not to prepare or attach [[warp and weft|warp]] threads to a weaving [[loom]] from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Av]] onwards (till after [[Tisha B'Av]]), because during the month of Av the Foundation Stone [and the Temple] was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pesachim]] 4:1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Citing this, the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]''&lt;ref&gt;551:7, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; rules that not only are women not to prepare or attach warp threads to a weaving [[loom]], but it is forbidden for anyone to make, buy or wear new clothes or shoes from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'Av falls until after the fast, and that people should ideally not do so from the beginning of Av.

In further commemoration of the Foundation Stone, it is also forbidden to eat meat or drink wine from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'av falls until after the fast. Some have the custom to refrain from these foodstuffs from Rosh Chodesh Av, while others do so from the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;This is derived from the fact that another version of the same piece of Talmud reads: "למישתייה '''ח'''מרא" “(to refrain) from drinking wine”. This follows the version recorded by [[Hai Gaon]]. It is brought down by the ''Kolbo, [[Halakha]] [[Tisha B'Av]]'', and ''[[Machzor Vitri]]'' 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical references===
In the days when [[Selichot]] are recited, in the days leading up to [[Rosh Hashanah]] until [[Yom Kippur]], the supplications include the following references:

{{quote|טענתנו גפי קרת נתונים, ישבתנו '''שן סלע''' איתנים

You carried us and placed us on the [Holy] City’s height, You settled us on the Patriarch’s rocky peak.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArtScroll]] [[Selichot]], Second day, Selicha 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

רבוצה עליו '''אבן שתית''' חטובים ...שמה בתוך לפני מזיב מאשנבים

Upon it lying the stone from which the foundation was hewn… Who gives ear from which the waters flow [i.e. the foundation stone "from which flow all the waters of the world"].&lt;ref&gt;ArtScroll Selichot, [[Fast of Gedalia]], Selicha 46.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During [[Sukkot]], the following references to the Foundation Stone are mentioned in the [[Sukkot#Prayers|Hoshanot]] recital:

הושענא! – '''אבן שתיה''' – הושענא

''Please save! – '''Foundation Stone''' – Please save!''

הושענא! – תאדרנו '''באבן תלולה''' – הושענא

''Please save! – Adorn us with the '''elevated Stone''' – Please save!''

==Islamic significance==
The [[Temple Mount]], where the Foundation Stone is located, is thought by commentators of the [[Qur'an]] to be the place to which [[Muhammad]] traveled in the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Although the Qur'an does not specifically mention Jerusalem in name as the ascension site, labelling the site as the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], the [[Hadith]], the recorded sayings of Muhammad, specify that the site is indeed the Foundation Stone in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Sahih Bukhari Hadith Volume 5, Book 58, Number 226:"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahih Bukhari Hadith Volume 5, Book 58, Number 226:|url=http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/058-sbt.php#005.058.226}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islamic belief, angels visited the site 2,000 years before the creation of Adam. It is also thought to be the place where [[Israfil]], the angel of the trumpet, will sound his horn on Resurrection Day.

Beneath the Foundation Stone is a cavern known as the [[Well of Souls]]. It is sometimes thought of as the traditional hiding place of the [[Ark of the Covenant]].

The '''Gawaria''' are a Hindu caste found in North India.  They are also known as Banajra.&lt;ref name="Peopleof"&gt;''People of India Rajasthan'' edited by Ghanshyam Gawariya Sr. Software Engineer&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origin ==

The Gawaria are a sub-group within the larger [[Banjara]] community of India origin, a caste in the desert of Rajasthan, the districts of Nagaur, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Ajmer, Barmer, and Jaisalmer, Alwar, According to their own traditions, the community is descended from three brothers, Tapasvi Singh, Lakhi Singh and Bhumi Singh. These brothers lost their land, and took to peddling goods and services. The Gawaria were a nomadic community, travelling throughout North India selling their wares. With the building of the railways in the 19th Century, the Gawaria had to abandon their traditional occupation. The community is now settled on the outskirts of villages and towns involved in wage labour, petty trade and the scrap business. They are distributed all over North India, in particular in the states of [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. They speak the [[Marwari ,goarboli,&amp; Haroti, Gwarki, goaarfarsi, language|Marwari]] language, although most also understand [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name="Peopleof" /&gt;

The Gawaria are divided into three sub-groups, the Rajput Gawaria and the Dharamput Gawaria and Gwar. In their system of social hierarchy, the Rajput and Gwar group is considered superior. These two sub-groups are endogamous, and there is no intermarriage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Gawaria are further divided into clans, known as [[gotra]]s. Each gotra claims descent from a common ancestor, and marriages are strictly forbidden.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Their main clans are the Meghawat,manchhani, atbhaya, bhajwan,  gehlan;dasani;Chhohet, Bindrawat, Kurra, Athvia, Jharabala and Dhamsod, nimawat,kanawat , binjrawat, dharmshout,lawdiya, bartiya,bhukiya, goramba,kelut, muchaal, barnot, munawat, gelana, mood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}the rajasthan gawaria also group of gor banjara rajasthan.they lokdevta baba ramdev peer in ramevra.

== Present circumstances ==

The Gawaria are now a denotified ghumantu community, and many in the rural areas are agricultural labourers. While those in the cities are wage labourers. A small number have taken to trade, and a smaller number have taken to education, . The community's distinct dialect marks it out from neighbouring communities, and they tend to be residentially segregated. They are entirely Hindu, and worship local deities such as the Gurgaon wali mata.&lt;ref name="Peopleof" /&gt;

Currently Gawaria caste is spread around Rajasthan (in the Thar desert), Haryana, Uttar Pradesh &amp; Punjab&amp; gujarat . These people are in large number. Labour of these people is currently agriculture laborer there work women sell each place to another place chudiya, bindiya, and other ladies beauty items. Gawaria people work munj, ban, sirki, kunchi, chapper,etc. But education status is very poor condition is spreading among them slowly{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Gawaria is belong from larger community of banjara.

[[File:19th Century goblin illustration.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Nineteenth-century illustration of a goblin]]
A '''goblin''' is a [[monster|monstrous]] creature from [[European folklore]], first attested in stories from the [[Middle Ages]].  They are ascribed various and conflicting abilities, temperaments and appearances depending on the story and country of origin.  They are almost always small and [[grotesque]], [[trickster|mischievous]] or outright malicious, and greedy, especially for gold and jewelry.  They often have magical abilities similar to a [[fairy]] or [[demon]].  Similar creatures include [[brownie (folklore)|brownies]], [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]], [[duende]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[imp]]s, and [[kobold]]s.

==Name==
Alternative spellings include ''gobblin'', ''gobeline'', ''gobling'', ''goblyn'', ''goblino'', and ''gobbelin''

English ''goblin'' is first recorded in the 14th century and is probably from unattested Anglo-Norman ''*gobelin'',&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Hoad, ''English Etymology'', Oxford University Press, p. 196b.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Old French ''gobelin'', already attested around 1195 in [[Ambroise|Ambroise of Normandy]]'s ''Guerre sainte'', and to [[Medieval Latin]] ''gobelinus'' in [[Orderic Vitalis]] before 1141,&lt;ref name="cnrtl.fr"&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/gobelin CNRTL etymology of ''gobelin'' (online French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Du Cange]] et al, ''Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis'' ...(online French and Latin) [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/Gobelinus]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the name of a devil or daemon haunting the country around [[Évreux]], Normandy.

It may be related both to German ''[[kobold]]'' and to Medieval Latin ''cabalus'', or ''*gobalus'', itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] κόβαλος (''kobalos''), "rogue", "knave", "imp", "goblin".&lt;ref name="cnrtl.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dko%2Fbalos κόβαλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may be a diminutive or other derivative of the French [[proper name]] ''Gobel'', more often ''Gobeau'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=goblin |title=Goblin|work=The Online Etymological Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Harper |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HOAD, p. 196b.&lt;/ref&gt; diminutive forms ''Gobelet, Goblin, Goblot'', but their signification is probably "somebody who sells tumblers or beakers or cups".&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Dauzat]], ''Noms et prénoms de France'', Librairie Larousse 1980, édition revue et commentée par [[Marie-Thérèse Morlet]]. p. 295b '''Gobel'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these proper names are not from Normandy, where the word ''gobelin, gobelinus'' first appears in the old documents. German ''Kobold'' contains the Germanic root ''kov-'' (Middle German ''Kobe'' "refuge, cavity", "hollow in a rock", Dial. English ''cove'' "hollow in a rock", English "sheltered recess on a coast", Old Norse ''kofi'' "hut, shed" ) which means originally a "hollow in the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Duden, ''Herkunftswörterbuch : Etymologie der deutschen Sprache'', Band 7, Dudenverlag, p. 359 : '''Kobel, koben, Kobold'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HOAD, p. 101b.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is probably related to Dial. Norman ''gobe'' "hollow in a cliff", with simple suffix ''-lin'' or double [[suffixation]] ''-el-in'' (cf. Norman surnames ''Beuzelin'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geopatronyme.com/cgi-bin/carte/nomcarte.cgi?nom=Beuzelin&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0 Géopatronyme : surname ''Beuzelin'' in France (online French)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gosselin'',&lt;ref&gt;Géopatronyme : surname ''Gosselin'' in France (online French) [http://www.geopatronyme.com/cgi-bin/carte/nomcarte.cgi?nom=Gosselin&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0 Gosselin'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Étancelin'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geopatronyme.com/cgi-bin/carte/nomcarte.cgi?nom=%E9tancelin&amp;image.x=11&amp;image.y=9 Géopatronyme : surname ''Étancelin'' in France (online French)]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.)

The Welsh ''coblyn'', a type of [[knocker (folklore)|knocker]], derives from the Old French ''gobelin'' via the English ''goblin''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Anna (2002). "Goblin", ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Fairies''. London: Paper Tiger. {{ISBN|1-84340-240-8}}. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''goblette''' has been used to refer to female goblins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1992 |title=[[The Color of Her Panties]] |quote=You can't move me out, you skirted goblette. |first=Piers |last=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[The Adventures of Puss in Boots]] |date=28 September 2015 |number=12 |title=Goblin |quote=My dear, dear goblette, there is really nothing to it. |first=Jesse |last=Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Thompson writes, "In ''The Hobbit'' – whose title character resembles the traditional hobgoblin, thinly disguised by name and role – Tolkien's goblins, though villains, retain a hint of earlier portrayals as scamps, with their bumbling efforts, punctuated by boisterous and doggerel song, posing little threat to the story's heroes and perhaps reflecting the novel's intended young audience. Yet, in notes for the novel, he acknowledges an indebtedness to [[George MacDonald|MacDonald]], and while his goblins may appear burlesque, they are also grotesque, filthy, and wicked, preying upon travelers from underground lairs." Thompson adds that, in ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien has "abandoned all pretence at depicting goblins in a comic light, instead casting them as the great evil race of Middle-earth..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson |first= William |chapter= Goblins |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, Conn. |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 2005 |volume= 1 |page= 348 |ISBN=0-313-32951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Goblins are portrayed as roughly half the size of adult humans as [[non-player character]]s in the tabletop [[role-playing game]], ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', which influenced most later depictions in tabletop and computer roleplating games, including ''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom|Akalabeth]]'', ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'', ''[[Tibia (game)|Tibia]]'', ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[World of Warcraft]]''
* The 1973 film ''[[Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973 film)|Don't Be Afraid of the Dark]]'' portrays a house infested with goblins; it was [[Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2011 film)|remade in 2011]]. In both versions the Goblins are small, intelligent, nimble and evil creatures with a penchant for preying on children. They feed on human teeth and are afraid of light.
* The [[Jim Henson Productions]] film ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' centres around a kingdom of Goblins ruled by Jareth the Goblin King (played by [[David Bowie]]). The Goblins in this film come in many diverse forms: they range from a few inches to several feet in height; some have small eyes, some have large eyes, some have protruding eyes, some have horns, some have hair, and some are hairless. It has been implied by Jareth that all the Goblins were once human children.
* Goblins play an important role in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. They guard the wizard bank Gringotts and are portrayed as clever, arrogant, greedy, and churlish. They are skilled in metalwork; goblin-made steel, such as the sword of Gryffindor, absorbs the magic of other substances to make it stronger.
* ''[[The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy]]'' by Clare B. Dunkle features a creative re-imagining of goblins, elves, and dwarves.
* ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Elves, Goblins, and Other Little Creatures'' depicts them as originating in the British Isles, whence they spread by ship to all of Continental Europe. They have no homes, being wanderers, dwelling temporarily in mossy cracks in rocks and tree roots.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Encyclopedia of Elves, Goblins, and Other Little Creatures'' by Pierre Dubois, in English 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Things That Never Were'' by Michael Page &amp; Robert Ingpen, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
* The music of the band [[Nekrogoblikon]] centers around goblins.
* A goblin appears in one of the poems in the book ''[[It's Halloween]]'' by Jack Prelutsky.
* The [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Spider-Man]] has several enemies that dress as [[Goblin (Marvel Comics)|goblins]] such as the [[Green Goblin]] and [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].
* Goblins take the place of Orknies in the film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.
* In ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', goblins serve the main antagonist, the [[ogre]] Mulgarath, and terrorize the Grace children in an attempt to snatch ''Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide'' from them. They are frog-like in form with whiskers and pointed ears. [[Hobgoblin]]s, like Hogsqueal, are depicted as mischievous but more benign.
* In ''[[Guardian: The Lonely and Great God]]'', a popular 2016 [[Korean drama]], 939-year-old immortal goblin Kim Shin (played by [[Gong Yoo]]) is the protector of souls who looks for his bride (the only one who can remove the sword he was killed with) to end his immortality and rest in peace.
* In the television fantasy game show ''[[Knightmare]]'', goblins were regular antagonists.  They were child-sized humanoid creatures, with ugly, hairless features and brown, leathery skin, and usually armed with a club and sometimes a shield.  Their arrival was always heralded by the distinctive sound of a goblin horn.  They were always aggressive, pursuing and attempting to kill the 'dungeoneer' (competitor).  On rare occasions hobgoblins appeared, which were identical but far larger (taller than an average adult human).&lt;ref&gt;Interactive ''Knightmare'' Lexicon, http://interactive.knightmare.org.uk/component/legacy/page/display/lexicon?s=view&amp;EID=goblin&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Gyani''' or '''Giani''' is an [[honorific]] [[Sikh titles|Sikh title]] used by someone learned in the [[Sikh]] religion and who often leads the congregation in prayers, such as [[Ardas]], or in singing ([[kirtan]]). The word "Ghian" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] means knowledge, derivative of [[Sanskrit]] word, [[Jnana]]. So a "gyani" is someone who has spiritual and religious knowledge and can help the congregation, called the [[Sadh Sangat]], in understanding the Sacred Texts and the history of the religion.

==Characteristics==
A gyani can be a male or a female, as the Sikh religion gives equal rights to both sexes. He or she will have undergone an intensive course of study and evaluation at an academic or religious institute, will have a thorough knowledge of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the Sikh Holy Scripture, and will have the ability to translate the words of sacred text into simple everyday language. Gyanis can also communicate in English (not always the case), a major bonus to western children who are not fluent in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] or [[Gurmukhi]], the language of the holy scriptures. Spiritually, a true gyani is called a Brahm gyani.

Gyani or Giani is also an academic degree in [[Punjabi literature]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism'' from W. Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi, Curzon Press, p.68, {{ISBN|0700710485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inclusive Wicca''' is an [[Eclectic Wicca|eclectic wiccan]] tradition which developed from the [[Circle of Oak and Mistletoe|Oak and Mistletoe Teaching Coven]] founded in 2008 by Australian, Amethyst Treleven.

==Incorporation==
The corporate body of the tradition in Australia is the Community Church of Inclusive Wicca Incorporated, which is registered as a church in [[South Australia]] with its headquarters in [[Adelaide]]. It aims to present [[Wicca]] in an open way that adapts to the needs of individual seekers both in Australia and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Treleven, Amethyst | title=Seeker's Guide to Learning Wicca: Training to First Degree for the Northern Hemisphere.| publisher=Oak &amp; Mistletoe|location=Adelaide, South Australia| year=2008| isbn= 978-0-9805818-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covens and teaching==
CCIWT has both a face-to-face [[coven]], and an online one,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakandmistletoe.com.au/ Circle of Oak &amp; Mistletoe]&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as a school of "three degrees" or levels of training.

==Publication==
The body produces a quarterly [[e-magazine]], ''Spirit and Spell'' at low cost which is free to paid up members of the group. It serves the Australian pagan community and appears four times a year to coincide with the [[Sabbats|Australian sabbats]] being:

::[[Lughnasadh]] – 1 February
::[[Samhain]] – 1 May

According to a study by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), [[Afghanistan]] is one of the seven countries in the world (the other six being Iran, the Maldives, Mauritania, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sudan) where being an [[atheist]] or a convert can lead to a [[death sentence]].&lt;ref name=atheists&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheists around world suffer persecution, discrimination: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/10/us-religion-atheists-idUSBRE8B900520121210|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, Afghanistan ranks among the countries where people are least likely to admit to being an atheist.&lt;ref name=gallup2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Index Of Religion And Atheism |url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |publisher=WIN-Gallup |accessdate=3 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apostasy in Afghanistan==

[[Apostasy]] is a crime under the [[sharia]] of Afghanistan. Although [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s have been living peacefully for centuries, apostates are not seen kindly. Apostates, including atheists, are considered safe if they were brought up as Muslim and do not make their beliefs public. Apostates are usually disowned by their families. Apostasy and conversion to atheism carry death sentences in Afghanistan's Islamic legal system. Mob lynchings have also been known to happen.&lt;ref name=apostasy&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversy of apostasy in Afghanistan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25732919|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=14 January 2014|author=Dawood Azami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asylums==

In January 2014, an Afghan man living in the [[UK]] since 2007 was granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] under the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]]. The man's legal team argued that he may face a death sentence if he returned. He had come to the UK with his family when he was 16, and had become an atheist while living there.&lt;ref name=asylum&gt;{{cite news|title=Atheist Afghan granted religious asylum in UK|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25715736|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was responsible for being the first to compile information about Shinran's life, and formalizing the new Jōdo Shinshū sect, while re-asserting power at the mausoleum away from Shinshu followers in the [[Kantō region]]. Kakunyo was an avid writer whose liturgies comprise an important part of Jōdo Shinshū services, while his biography on Shinran, the {{nihongo|''Godenshō''|御伝鈔||}} is still an important source for scholars.

He completed his graduation from [[Shibli College]], Azamgarh, and Masters and doctorate of philosophy (PhD) in the Hindi language from [[Agra University]]. He is also completed [[Aalimiat]] from Sunni Muslim seminary called Nadwatul Ulema, Lucknow, and [[Fazeelat]] from Rampur.

The topic of his PhD was Sufi Darshan evam Sadhna ka Kramik Vikas tatha Kutban, Manjhan evam Jaysee. (Development of Mysticism in Hindi with reference to the Poetry of Kutban, Manjhan and Jaysee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/193/4980/BJP-STRATEGICALLY-DISTANCES-ITSELF-FROM-HINDUTVA/2010-02-28/Face-to-Face/Story-Detail/039My-pen-has-not-retired039.html|title='My pen has not retired'|author=DR.

==Association and activism with Jamat Islami Hind&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/01-15Mar04-Print-Edition/0103200466.htm|title=A towering personality among Muslims|author=Javed Ali|publisher=The Milli Gazette|volume=5|issue=5|date=1–15 Mar 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

Yazdani came into the contact of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), when he was in Intermediate at Tanda. Jamaat was writing new chapters in Islamic dawah and awakening for non-Muslims as well as Muslims. He learnt, Islam is for everybody. Yazdani, whose subject in BA was not Hindi, chose [[Hindi journalism]] as his lifelong career under the influence of the Islamic movement. At that time, Muslims of north India had a hate relationship with Hindi. [[Urdu]] had not become their preferred language but it was crushed just after the Independence. It is a historical fact that Urdu was vastly used in government and non-government works before 1947. But its use stopped in government offices, its teaching banned in schools and other educational institutions and it was labelled as anti-Indian. It place was given to Hindi, which was finally declared the official language of the province in 1951 by Congress government in UP, under its chief minister [[Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant]]. But no reciprocal safeguard was given to Urdu language. Yazdani chose Hindi as his first love.

[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|Jamaat]] decided to publish a Hindi magazine and called him for the job in 1956-7. After some preparations '[[Kanti (magazine)|Kanti]]' monthly started its publication in 1958. It became a weekly after a decade and changed its place of publication from [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] to Delhi.

When Nadvi joined the Kanti, he did not know the Arabic language. But as he chose the dawah path, he decided to learn Arabic and studied the language from [[Maulana Salman Qasmi]] at Rampur. Then he took three years leave to study Arabic and Islamic sciences at [[Nadwatul Ulama|Nadwa College]], [[Lucknow]]. Jamaat chief [[Maulana Abul lais]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaateislamihind.org/index.php?do=category&amp;id=125&amp;blockid=31 Jamaat-e-Islami Hind: HISTORY AND BACKGROUND] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114012150/http://www.jamaateislamihind.org/index.php?do=category&amp;id=125&amp;blockid=31 |date=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed him to work from Lucknow and granted him the required leave. [[Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi|Maulana Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi]] gave special permission to enroll him for [[Almiat]]. He cleared all the papers in one year and got Almiat degree. Later he completed his [[Fazilat]] at Rampur. Kanti was banned during emergency and its editor was jailed for few months. In this critical period he did his MA in Hindi Literature and a PhD in 1980. His thesis was on [[Sufism]] and [[Sadhna]]. Kanti was divided into weekly and monthly in the same year. Weekly was generally for Muslims and monthly was for non-Muslims. But according to Nadvi, its readership were prominently Muslims, although non-Muslims also read it.

He remained its editor for about 37 years and left it in 1995. Nadvi told us that 'generally Hindus have a little or no interest for understanding Islam. We reached them and explained its message'. So its circulation in his time remained between 3 and 5 thousands. It published extracts from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], episodes from Islamic history and true principles of Islam. It also tried to remove misunderstandings against Islam and Muslims. It had one or two short stories. After 1968, political and social issues increased considerably. Then it became a weekly. To a query, whether Kanti criticised Hindu Dharam also former editor replied that we criticised very little and never made such criticism a formal topic. 'It was not appropriate in the early phase of Dawah'. Islam's fundamental teachings were introduced in a positive way, polytheism was mildly criticised. If reverse was done, it could have caused a riot and then nobody would have heard our message, he explained. He concluded that when Islam would be described in more details, in the next phase of our dawah, such criticism may increase, then it would be relevant.

He was not just a journalist or writer, but an active worker and a leader also. He became chief of J. I. H. (Delhi &amp; Haryana State) in 1979 and remained so till 1995. At that time, he used to start his day before morning prayers ([[salat Fajr]]), read daily newspaper and wrote editorial, etc. Later, he worked for the Kanti till about 1 o'clock. After 3 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, to 11 in the night, he spent his time, visiting different places of Delhi &amp; Haryana for Dawah and Islamic awakening. It was his daily routine. In 1995 he was called to central office of the Jamaat as its all India secretary to look after the Dawah work from which he just retired. As his health deteriorated, he spent most of his time at his residence at [[Abul Fazl Enclave]] in New Delhi. He has three sons and one daughter. His wife died in 1990.

==Books published==
Nadvi translated about 40 books in Hindi and wrote a dozen books. He also wrote more than 500 articles published in different national and international journals and magazines.

In [[demonology]], '''Leraje''' is a mighty Great Marquis of [[Hell]] who has thirty legions of [[demon]]s under his power. He causes great battles and disputes, and makes [[gangrene]] wounds caused by arrows. Some authors say this demon belongs to the [[zodiac]]al sign of Sagittarius.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6648">'''Magis Institute''' is a non-profit educational organization founded by Jesuit priest and former [[Gonzaga University]] president [[Robert Spitzer, SJ|Robert J. Spitzer, SJ]].  The institute's primary outreaches are the [[Magis]] Center of Reason and Faith and the Magis Center for Catholic Spirituality.

== Founder ==
{{main|Robert Spitzer, SJ}}

'''Robert J. Spitzer''' [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (b. May 16, 1952) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]], philosopher, educator, author, speaker, and retired President of [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].   Father Spitzer is founder and currently active as President of Magis Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to public education concerning the complementary relationship among the varied disciplines of physics, philosophy, reason, and faith.  He is also the Chief Education Officer of the Ethics and Performance Institute which delivers web-based ethics education to corporations and individuals. He is also President of the Spitzer Center of Ethical Leadership, which delivers similar curricula to non-profit organizations.

== The Magis Center for Reason and Faith ==
Magis Institute originally was created to be only a center for Catholic spirituality.  In 2008, Father Spitzer and his associates at Magis considered how they might offer a reasoned, scientific alternative viewpoint to those publicly expressed by "[[new atheism]]" writers such as [[Christopher Hitchins]] and [[Richard Dawkins]].  As a result of these conversations, Father Spitzer began the [http://magiscenter.com/ Magis Center for Reason and Faith] to provide a framework for the creation and distribution of materials expressing this alternative viewpoint.

On 3 September 2010, the Catholic News Agency featured Magis founder Father Spitzer in their response to the announcement of Stephen Hawking's new book touching on the subject of the origins of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawking's new book does not dismiss the real God from creation, Jesuit scholars say'' CNA, retrieved 8 Sept 2010 from http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/hawkings-new-book-does-not-dismiss-the-real-god-from-creation-jesuit-scholars-say/&lt;/ref&gt;  Online magazine "The Blaze" also featured a response to Hawking from Father Spitzer:  "There are already numerous video responses to Hawking popping up on YouTube. Let’s pick one.  Here is former Gonzaga University President Father Robert Spitzer who now heads the Magis Center of Reason and Faith"&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Scott.  ''Religious Leaders Respond to Hawking's 'No Need for God' ''The Blaze, 5 September 2010 retrieved on 8 September 2010 from http://www.theblaze.com/stories/religious-leaders-respond-to-hawkings-no-need-for-god-argument/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2010, the institute was prominently mentioned on the CNN program ''[[Larry King Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript link: http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1009/10/lkl.01.html&lt;/ref&gt; Father Spitzer appeared as a panelist on the program which featured Dr. [[Stephen Hawking]], Hawking's literary collaborator, [[Leonard Mlodinow]], and author [[Deepak Chopra]] in a one-hour prime-time discussion on the need for a transcendent creator of the universe.

== Methods ==
The institute, through Magis Center for Reason and Faith, is using five methods to leverage media to publicize their view of the compatibility of faith and reason:

=== Books ===
Father Spitzer has published ''New Proofs for the Existence of God''&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert J, SJ. ''New Proofs for the Existence of God'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The books authored by members of the institute will be "affordable (under $30.00 US for the most part) and tailored for the average reader within the planned demographic. The institute also helps to promote the books of other writers who share a similar viewpoint, e.g. William Lane Craig, working with a physicist named Simpson, published the ''Blackwell Commentary on Natural Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. Craig and Moreland.  ''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' (John Wiley and Sons, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentary films ===
The institute hired Martha Cotton, former producer of NBC News and the ''Today Show'', who has written a script that made these complex issues more intelligible, with the goal of bringing the discussion to the level of a high school student. Planned for a 2011 release, the first documentary features Nobel Laureate Arno Penzias, who discovered background radiation from the Big Bang. A Templeton Prize winner, John Polkinghorne, who is also an Anglican priest, is featured as well.  The feature is completed and distribution is being negotiated (as of March 2011).

=== New media ===
The institute is reaching out via the World Wide Web, and to the blogosphere; it has a popular Facebook page, and also releases frequent videos via YouTube.  The institute provides information concerning the long history of scientific research done by members of the clergy over the centuries with a special focus on those who are currently active in their respective fields both on Facebook and its website.

=== High school curriculum ===
The institute has planned the release in September 2011 of a curriculum aimed at the high school student, and designed for use in parochial schools and church youth groups..

=== Adult education and college curricula ===
Catalogued for the Fall (September) of 2011, there is a college course in conjunction with [[Benedictine College]] in Atchison, Kansas numbered GS298 and titled "Physics and Metaphysics in Dialogue". The course will carry 3 semester credits and will be transferable as elective credit to any regionally accredited institution of higher education.

'''Maurice Baring''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (27 April 1874 – 14 December 1945) was an English [[man of letters]], known as a dramatist, poet, novelist, translator and essayist, and also as a travel writer and war correspondent. During World War I, Baring served in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force]].

==Life==
Baring was the eighth child, and fifth son, of [[Edward Charles Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke|Edward Charles Baring]], first [[Baron Revelstoke]], of the [[Barings Bank|Baring]] banking family, and his wife Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel, granddaughter of the [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|second Earl Grey]]. Born in Mayfair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://entitycube.research.microsoft.com/p/maurice_baring.htm Maurice Baring] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709214211/http://entitycube.research.microsoft.com/p/maurice_baring.htm |date=9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BRN893M|name=Baring, the Hon. Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an abortive start of a diplomatic career, he travelled widely, particularly in Russia. He reported as an eye-witness of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] for the London ''[[Morning Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, Charles (2003). ''Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage'' (Vol. 3), p. 3324;&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepeerage.com/p14959.htm#i149582 |title=Major Hon. Maurice Baring |date=7 May 2011 |work=The Peerage |first=Darryl |last=Lundy |location=Ngaio, Wellington |publisher=Lundy Consulting Ltd }}&lt;br /&gt;Baring, Maurice (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JxYMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=With+the+Russians+in+Manchuria&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR6,M1  ''With the Russians in Manchuria,'' p. vi.]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of [[World War I]] he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]], where he served as assistant to [[David Henderson (British Army officer)|David Henderson]] and [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] in France. In 1918, Baring served as a staff officer in the [[Royal Air Force]] and was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1918 Birthday Honours]]. In 1925 Baring received an honorary commission as a [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the Reserve of Air Force Officers. After his death, Trenchard wrote, "He was the most unselfish man I have ever met or am likely to meet. The Flying Corps owed to this man much more than they know or think."&lt;ref name="Read"&gt;[[Piers Paul Read|Read, Piers Paul]] (2007). [http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/246306/whats-become-of-baring/ "What's become of Baring?"], ''The Spectator'', 10 October 2007. Reprinted in [https://web.archive.org/web/20110826002306/http://repository.shu.edu:8080/xmlui/handle/10420/103 ''Chesterton Review'', Spring-Summer 2008], pp. 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he enjoyed a period of success as a dramatist, and began to write novels. He suffered from chronic illness during the last years of his life; for the final 15 years of his life he was debilitated by [[Parkinson's Disease]].

He was widely known socially, to some of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], to [[The Coterie]], and to the literary group associating with [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joseph. [http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/pearce/08500.html "Maurice Baring, In the Shadow of the Chesterbelloc,"] ''CatholiCity,'' 24 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was staunch in his [[anti-intellectualism]] with respect to the arts, and a convinced [[practical joke]]r.

Previously an agnostic,&lt;ref&gt;Baring, Maurice (1910). [http://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=1205450211&amp;l=en&amp;searchform= Letter dated 3 May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1909, "the only action in my life which I am quite certain I have never regretted."&lt;ref&gt;Baring, Maurice (1922). ''The Puppet Show of Memory'', pp. 395-396.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking from personal experience, however, he once advised Belloc to "never, never, never talk theology or discuss the Church with those outside it. People simply do not understand what you are talking about and they merely (a) get angry and (b) come to the conclusion that one doesn't believe in the thing oneself and that one is simply doing it to annoy."&lt;ref name="Read"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Baring is remembered in verse in ''Belloc's Cautionary Verses:''

''Like many of the upper class''&lt;br&gt;
''He liked the sound of broken glass*''&lt;br&gt;
''* A line I stole with subtle daring''&lt;br&gt;
''From Wing-Commander Maurice Baring''

He once gave [[Virginia Woolf]] a copy of his book ''C''. She was not impressed, writing in her diary:

Second-rate art i.e. C., by Maurice Baring. Within it limits, it is not second rate, or there is nothing markedly so, at first go off. The limits are the proof of its non-existence. He can only do one thing; himself to wit; charming, clean, modest, sensitive Englishman. Outside that radius and it does not carry far nor illumine much, all is—as it should be—light, sure, proportioned, affecting even; told in so well bred a manner that nothing is exaggerated, all related, proportioned. I could read this for ever, I said. L. said one would soon be sick to death of it.

The character, Horne Fisher, the protagonist of ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (book)]]'', a collection of detective stories by [[G.K. Chesterton]], "is generally thought to be based on Chesterton’s good friend, Maurice Baring." Although, while "Fisher fits Baring’s physical description, he is a respected member of the upper class, and he seems to know everybody and everything," the similarity ends there, Chesterton scholar, [[Dale Ahlquist]] notes: "By all accounts, the real Baring was a charming, affable gentleman who knew how to laugh and had no fear of making a fool of himself," while "Horne Fisher is distinctly lacking in both the charm and humor departments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ahlquist |first1=Dale |title=Lecture 39: The Man Who Knew Too Much |url=https://www.chesterton.org/lecture-39/ |website=Chesterton.org |publisher=The American Chesterton Society |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">The '''Michigan Churches''' or '''Michigan related Amish''' are a [[subgroups of Amish|subgroup]] or affiliation of [[Old Order Amish]]. They emerged in 1970 in [[Michigan]]. This affiliation is more evangelical and more open to outsiders, so-called "[[Seeker (Anabaptism)|seekers]]", than other Old Order Amish affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amish365.com/manton-michigan/ "Manton, Michigan" at amish365.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/atypical-amish-community-unity-maine "The Atypical Amish Community at Unity, Maine" at amishamerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The church at [[Mio, Michigan|Mio]] was founded in 1970 by [[Amish]] people from [[Geauga County, Ohio]], and from northern [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/michigan-amish/ "Michigan Amish" at amishamerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Other local churches that now are affiliated with the Michigan Churches originally were not Amish, but were founded by evangelistic minded people of Old Order backgrounds, who were open to outsiders. Later these congregations joined the Michigan Churches.

The church at [[Manton, Michigan|Manton]], originally not Amish, was started by people, who came from [[Le Roy Township, Michigan|Le Roy, Michigan]], a horse-and-buggy, but eagerly evangelistic church that was founded in 1981 by Harry Wanner (1935 - 2012), an awakened minister of [[Stauffer Mennonite|Stauffer Old Order Mennonite]] background. In 1994 the church at Le Roy disbanded. The church at Manton eventually joined the Old Order Amish. The Church at [[Smyrna, Maine#Amish community|Smyrna, Maine]], originally affiliated with the [[Christian Communities (Elmo Stoll)|"Christian Communities"]] of [[Elmo Stoll]], also more evangelistic and open to seekers, affiliated with Manton after the "Christian Communities" disbanded after Stoll's early death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrollpublishing.com/store/peterhoover-real-anabaptists-4.html Peter Hoover: ''Radical Anabaptists Today - Part 4'' at scrollpublishing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Custom and Belief ==

It is stated that there are more people among the Michigan Churches that feel [[assurance of salvation|sure to be saved]] or consider themselves to be [[Born again (Christianity)|born again Christians]] than among other subgroups of Old Order Amish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapministry.org/articles/2011/11/08/are-the-amish-truly-born-again  Joe Keim: “Are the Amish Truly Born Again?”]&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance to that, [[G.C. Waldrep]] stated that the Michigan Churches show many spiritual and material similarities to the [[New Order Amish|New Orders]], while they are still technically considered a part of the larger Old Order group.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.C. Waldrep]]: "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Settlements and congregations ==

In 2011 the subgroup was present in 15 settlements in 3 states and had 20 congregations or church districts.&lt;ref name="Kraybill 2013 139"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amish|last=Kraybill|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Kraybill|author2=Karen M. Johnson-Weiner |author3=Steven M. Nolt |year=2013|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ Pr|location=|isbn=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Michigan the subgroup has settlements in Mio, [[Evart, Michigan|Evart]], [[Fremont, Michigan|Fremont]], Manton and [[Newaygo, Michigan|Newaygo]]. In Maine there were three settlements: Smyrna, [[Unity, Maine|Unity]] and [[Patten, Maine|Patton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/amish-maine/ "Maine Amish" at amishamerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amish near [[Pearisburg, Virginia]] are partly affiliated with the Michigan Churches while another part belongs to the [[Believers in Christ, Lobelville]], a [[para-Amish]] group.

The '''Miss World riots''' were a series of [[religion|religiously]]-motivated riots in the [[Nigeria]]n city of [[Kaduna]] in November 2002, claiming the lives of more than 200 people. The [[Miss World]] [[beauty pageant]], that was controversial in Nigeria, was relocated to [[London]] after bloody clashes between [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christianity|Christians]], caused by what some Muslims deemed to be a "[[blasphemy|blasphemous]]" article in the Christian newspaper ''[[ThisDay]]'' about the event. The Miss World riots were part of the [[Religious violence in Nigeria|Sharia conflict in Nigeria]], that started in 1999 when several predominantly Islamic states in Northern Nigeria decided to introduce [[Sharia]] law.

== Background ==
Because the 2001 contest was won by the Nigerian [[Agbani Darego]], [[Miss World 2002]] would take place in (and be aired from) the Nigerian capital [[Abuja]]. In the run-up to the pageant there were many controversies, like the fact that it coincided with the Muslim holy month of [[ramadan]], and the whole beauty contest was perceived by many conservative Muslims and also Christians to be [[Chastity|unchaste]].&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; The organisation conceded to the first complaint by moving the event from the end of November to 7 December, but did not act on the second complaint.&lt;ref name=Daniel/&gt; In several places, especially in the mostly Muslim North, peaceful protests were held against conducting Miss World in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/12302/section/4 |title=The "Miss World Riots": Continued Impunity for Killings in Kaduna |author= |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=23 July 2003 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism|Feminists]] argued the pageant was too [[sexism|sexist]] because it merely considered women's beauty and paid no attention to intelligence and character; the organisation conceded to them by altering the [[swimsuit]] parade to a [[photo shoot]].&lt;ref name=Daniel/&gt;

However, conservative Islamic groups turned even more strongly against the Miss World organisation when it took a stand in the case of the Nigerian woman [[Amina Lawal]]. Amina had been condemned to death by [[stoning]] by a regional Islamic court because of alleged [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2774232/2002/08/21/Steniging-na-overspel-alleen-voor-vrouwen.dhtml |title=Steniging na overspel alleen voor vrouwen |author= |publisher=[[Trouw]] |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, Miss Côte d'Ivoire Yannick Azébian and Miss Norway [[Kathrine Sørland]] indicated at the end of August 2002 that they would boycott the beauty contest; other Misses expressed their doubts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2786783/2002/08/29/Missen-tegen-stenen.dhtml |title=Missen tegen stenen |author= |publisher=Trouw |date=29 August 2002 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Belgium, Denmark, France and Spain too decided to stay away, Miss Holland ignored calls to do so; the chairman of the Miss Holland opined: "Then you are actually giving the people in the North what they want. They are stopping an event which is 'perverse' in their eyes and are just continuing their ridiculous legislation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2794744/2002/10/29/Miss-Nederland-negeert-oproep-tot-boycot-Miss-Worldverkiezing.dhtml |title=Miss Nederland negeert oproep tot boycot Miss Worldverkiezing |author=Tom van der Beek |publisher=Trouw |date=29 October 2002 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Misses also found that exactly by showing up in Abuja they could make a statement against conservative beliefs about women. Civil rights activists eventually were able to persuade the Miss World organisation as a whole to plead for the release of Amina Lawal to the Nigerian federal authorities, eventually convincing them to promise that the stoning would not be permitted.&lt;ref name=Daniel/&gt;

== Riots ==
After this, a [[Column (periodical)|column]] appeared in the [[Lagos]]-based Christian newspaper ''[[ThisDay]]'' on Saturday 16 November,&lt;ref name=Daniel&gt;Full original ''ThisDay'' column: {{Cite news |url=http://www.isioma.net/sds03002.html |title= Miss World 2002 – The World at their Feet... |author=Isioma Daniel |publisher=ThisDay |date=16 November 2002 |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which journalist [[Isioma Daniel]] wrote that the Islamic [[prophet]] [[Muhammad]] would probably have approved of the Miss World competition: 'The Muslims thought it was immoral to bring ninety-two women to Nigeria and ask them to revel in vanity. What would Mohammed think? In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from one of them.'&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; This sparked outrage among some [[Muslim|Muslims]], and from 20 till 23 November the city of Kaduna was the stage of bloody riots between Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref name="HRWleave"&gt;Human Rights Watch, "Leave Everything to God", p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years earlier, Kaduna had already seen [[2000 Kaduna riots|violent Christian-Muslim clashes]]. Many inhabitants had a strong sense of injustice because none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted afterwards.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; Moreover, the riots had caused Christians and Muslims to concentrate and isolate themselves in separate districts. The ''ThisDay'' incident caused latent tensions in the religiously-divided city to erupt.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2787077/2002/11/25/Hier-steekt-een-organisatie-achter.dhtml |title='Hier steekt een organisatie achter' |author=Ton Crijnen |publisher=Trouw |date=25 November 2002 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
*Already in the evening of 16 November, prominent Muslims angrily spread the message via [[fax]] and [[Short Message Service|SMS]].&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"/&gt; The Lagos office of ''ThisDay'' was inundated with telephone calls from furious Muslims; the editor told Daniel that she was to blame, and on Monday 18 November she was stripped of all her responsibilities.&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/17/gender.pressandpublishing |title='I lit the match' |author=Isioma Daniel |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 February 2003 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On Tuesday 19 November, the newspaper published a retraction on its front page and apologised, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;
*On Wednesday morning of 20 November, the ''ThisDay'' office in Kaduna was sacked and burned to the ground by "four busloads" of Muslim fanatics, while another group raided the offices of other newspapers elsewhere, picking out the copies of ''ThisDay'' and lighting them in public, according to an employee of the local opinion magazine ''Weekly Trust'', who suspected an organisation to be behind the attacks.&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"/&gt; The local office chief of ''ThisDay'' went in hiding.&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt; Also churches were assaulted by Muslims.&lt;ref name="Trouw22nov"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2581461/2002/11/22/Vijftig-doden-bij-rellen-om-Miss-World-verkiezing.dhtml |title=Vijftig doden bij rellen om Miss World-verkiezing |author= |publisher=Trouw |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel immediately quit her job at ''ThisDay'' when she heard about it, and stayed at home in the midst of death threats and worried colleagues, relatives and friends.&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;
*On Thursday 21 November, armed rioters attacked shouting ''[[Allahu akbar]]!'' ("God is great") and ''No Tazarene!'' ("No beauty contest"&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"/&gt;) and killing Christians, storming and looting Christian houses, companies and churches and burning them down.&lt;ref name="HRWleave"/&gt; Groups of Muslim youths built barricades with burning [[tire|car tyres]], passers-by in Christian neighbourhoods were attacked by them, drivers were pulled out of their vehicles and finished on the spot with [[machete]]s and [[axe]]s.&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"/&gt; Eyewitnesses reported that the attackers were between the ages of 12 and 26, armed with machetes, [[cutlass]]es, butcher's knives, sticks and guns, their faces painted unrecognisably with charcoal; they appeared not to be from the neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; Many local Hausa Muslims let Christians hide in their homes, or claimed that a Christian house belonged to them to prevent the attackers from lighting it on fire; there were however also some who told the attackers where the Christians lived.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; The attackers also slaughtered two Muslims students (who fiercely denied being Christians) by accident because they wore [[T-shirt]]s rather than traditional Islamic clothing.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; The [[riot police]] did little to nothing to stop the riots.&lt;ref name="Trouw22nov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"/&gt; That day, 50 people were killed and 300 wounded according to early estimates. Additionally, there were many burnt out cars and destroyed buildings.&lt;ref name="Trouw22nov"/&gt; The Sultan of [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]] called for calm and peace on national television, but the federal Minister for Abuja burst into tears in front of the cameras, crying that Daniel has blasphemed the prophet.&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;
*On Friday 22 November, Christian groups took revenge and killed Muslims and set fire to Muslim homes, companies and mosques.&lt;ref name="HRWleave"/&gt; At a road block, Christians in their twenties were stopping traffic. They asked people to recite [[John 3:16]]&lt;ref&gt;"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." ([[New International Version|NIV]])&lt;/ref&gt; to check who were Christians; Muslims were murdered.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; Christians from surrounding villages joined the counter-attacks against Muslim districts, several Muslims were killed and burned in the streets.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; A group of 500 Christian youths tried to assault a Muslim neighbourhood, but they were stopped by the military.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; The Christian vengeances led to new reprisals by Muslims after the [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]].&lt;ref name="Trouw25nov"/&gt; In the afternoon, the riots spread to Abuja, where Muslim youths set fire to cars. The police were quick to respond however, and there were no deaths.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; The Miss World organisation, that had already been preparing the event in Abuja for three weeks, decided in the evening of 22 November to move it to [[London]] instead, because fears had arisen for the safety of the participants, who themselves had indicated they would rather stay, even after hearing about the tens of manslaughters, to not give in to the pressure of the fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2769130/2002/11/23/Miss-Ik-ben-hier-om-me-in-te-zetten.dhtml |title=Miss: Ik ben hier om me in te zetten |author= |publisher=Trouw |date=23 November 2002 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel fled to neighbouring [[Benin]].&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;
*On Saturday 23 November, the clashes were finally quelled by security forces, who also killed tens of people in the process of restoring order.&lt;ref name="HRWleave"/&gt;

On 26 November, Islamic clerics from [[Zamfara State]] issued a [[fatwa]] against the journalist Isioma Daniel for insulting the prophet. The fatwa constituted a [[death sentence]], and all Muslims worldwide were called on to murder her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2581190/2002/11/27/Journaliste-ontvlucht-Nigeria-wegens-fatwa.dhtml |title=Journaliste ontvlucht Nigeria wegens fatwa |author= |publisher=Trouw |date=27 December 2002 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement that was later broadcast on local radio, the deputy governor [[Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi]] of Zamfara declared: "Like [[Salman Rushdie]], the blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed.

== Aftermath ==
The Kaduna riots claimed the lives of about 250 people, mostly men and boys; 20,000 to 30,000 people lost their homes.&lt;ref name="HRWimpunity"/&gt; More than 1,000 people were arrested on suspicion of inciting or partaking in the violence.&lt;ref name="HRWleave"/&gt; The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] and [[Amnesty International]] eventually helped Daniel to go in [[exile]] in Europe, because it was too dangerous for her to return to Nigeria.&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt; Among those killed were the parents of Nigerian footballer and international, [[Victor Moses]], who fled the country as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/14/victor-moses-interview-chelsea|title=Victor Moses: they should be proud of me, looking down being proud|last=Hytner|first=David|date=2012-09-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LayBuddhistPractices}}
'''Paritta''' ([[Pali]]), generally translated as "protection" or "safeguard,"&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 426, entry for "Paritta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;" (retrieved 08-14-2008 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:1923.pali) provides the following translations: "protection, safeguard; (protective) charm, palliative, amulet."  Also see Piyadassi (1999a) who translates ''paritta'' as "protection," and Anandajoti (2004) who translates it as "safeguard."&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the Buddhist practice of reciting certain verses and scriptures in order to ward off misfortune or danger, as well as to the specific verses and discourses recited as paritta texts. The practice of reciting or listening to the paritta suttas began very early in the history of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="piyadassi_paritta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/piyadassi/protection.html Piyadassi (1999a).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
In the Pali literature, these short verses are recommended by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as providing protection from certain afflictions.  The belief in the effective power to heal, or protect, of the ''[[sacca-kiriya]]'', or asseveration of something quite true is an aspect of the work ascribed to the ''paritta''.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.A.F. Rhys Davids]], ''Dialogues of the Buddha'', part 3, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also widely believed that all night recitations of paritta by monks bring safety, peace and well-being to a community.  Such recitations will also occur on auspicious occasions, such as the inauguration of a new temple or home or to provide blessings upon those who hear.  Conversely, paritta discourses are recited on inauspicious occasions as well, such as at a funeral or on the death anniversary of a loved one.  They may also be recited to placate antagonistic spirits.&lt;ref name="anandajoti_page_v"&gt;Anandajoti (2004), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The use of paritta to ward off menacing spirits can be found, for instance, in the [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] to both the Ratana Sutta and the Karaniya Metta Sutta.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourse types==
There are several paritta verses that are identified as such within the Pali Canon.

===Reverential===
Most paritta involve offering praise to the Buddha or, more broadly, the [[Triple Gem]] (Buddha, [[Dhamma]], [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]).  Of these paritta, one of the best known is the Ratana Sutta ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 2.1) where, for instance, it states in part:
:Whatever treasure there be either here or in the world beyond, whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds, there is nought comparable to the Tathagata (the Perfect One). This precious jewel is the Buddha. By this (asseveration of the) truth may there be happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.01.piya.html Piyadassi (1999d).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aid seeking===
A few paritta involve the asking directly for the aid of the Buddha.  Examples of this type of paritta verse can be seen in the Candima Sutta ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 2.9) and Suriya Sutta (SN 2.10) of the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]. In these two scriptures, the deities [[Chandra|Canda]] and [[Surya]] protect themselves from the attack of the eclipse deity [[Rahu]] by reciting short verses praising the Buddha and pleading for his protection:
:"O Buddha, the Hero, thou art wholly free from all evil. My adoration to thee. I have fallen into distress. Be thou my refuge."&lt;ref name="candima_sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn02/sn02.009.piya.html Piyadassi (1999b).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suriya_sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn02/sn02.010.piya.html Piyadassi (1999e).]&lt;/ref&gt;
In these cases, the Buddha is shown as specifically hearing and responding to the paritta; he enjoins Rahu to release the captive deities rather than have his "head split into seven pieces".&lt;ref name="candima_sutta" /&gt;

===Blessing===
Another type of paritta relies on the virtue of the individual who is ascribed as reciting the paritta in the Canon, rather than making reference to the virtues of the Buddha.  This type of paritta can be seen in the Angulimala Sutta, the story of the murderer-turned-monk [[Angulimala]].  On passing a pregnant woman experiencing a difficult labor, Angulimala is moved to provide assistance.  Asking the Buddha how he can help, the Buddha tells him to provide a sort of blessing to the woman by reciting a short verse proclaiming his own virtue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sister, since I was born in the noble birth, I do not recall intentionally killing a living being. Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you, wellbeing for your fetus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.086.than.html Thanissaro (2003).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204132906/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.086.than.html |date=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This verse is now used as a blessing for expectant mothers in the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Piyadassi (1999a), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/piyadassi/protection.html#preface "Preface."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of expression==
The Buddha and the [[arahants]] (the Consummate Ones) can concentrate on the paritta suttas without the aid of another. However, when they are ill, it is easier for them to listen to what others recite, and thus focus their minds on the [[dhamma]] that the suttas contain, rather than think of the dhamma by themselves. There are occasions, as in the case of illness, which weaken the mind (in the case of worldlings), when hetero-suggestion has been found to be more effective than autosuggestion.&lt;ref name="piyadassi_paritta" /&gt; In the ''Gilana Sutta'', even the Buddha Himself had the [[Seven factors of enlightenment|Seven Factors of Enlightenment]] recited to him by another monk to recover from a grave illness.&lt;ref name="gilana_sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn46/sn46.016.piya.html Piyadassi (1999c).]&lt;/ref&gt;

While paritta texts generally are recited aloud, other mediums are known as well.  In Thailand, paritta texts are printed on small pieces of cloth containing images of the Buddha or famous monks.  Similar text- often in the Khom script- is sometimes incorporated into tattoos believed to have protective powers, known as [[Sak Yant]].

==Collections==
Paritta discourses are widely used and known, even if not necessarily understood, throughout the [[Theravada]] Buddhist world.  Popular collections of paritta verses are among the most widely known Pali texts in many Theravada countries.

An example of such a collection is the Sinhala ''Pirit Potha'' ("The Book of Protection"), also known as ''Maha Pirit Potha'' and the ''Catubhanavarapali'' ("Text of the Four Recitals").  It has also been referred to as "The Buddhist Bible." This collection is typically given an important place in the Buddhist home, and is even treated with veneration. The book contains a collection of twenty-four or twenty-nine discourses (''[[Sūtra|suttas]]''){{refn|Of the twenty-nine ''paritta'' texts listed below, Piyadassi (1999a) does not include the first five texts as part of the twenty-four discourses that he includes in the collection, although he identifies the first five texts as preliminary material.  Anandajoti (2004) enumerates all twenty-nine texts as part of the ''paritta'' collection.|group=note}} almost all delivered by the Buddha, and found scattered in the five original collections (''nikayas'') in Pali, which form the [[Sutta Pitaka]], the "Canonical Discourses."&lt;ref name="piyadassi_paritta" /&gt;  Below, these discourses and related canonical sources are identified.{{refn|Table based on Anandajoti (2004), pp. ix-xi.|group=note}}

[[File:Pierre Henry Leroux (1797-1871).jpg|thumb|right|Pierre Leroux in exile, 1856.]]
'''Pierre Henri Leroux''' (7 April 1797 – 12 April 1871), [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], and [[political economy|political economist]], was born at [[Bercy]], now a part of [[Paris, France|Paris]], the son of an artisan.

== Life ==

His education was interrupted by the death of his father, which compelled him to support his mother and family. Having worked first as a mason and then as a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]], he joined P. Dubois in the foundation of ''[[Le Globe]]'' which became in 1831 the official organ of the [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simonian]] community, of which he became a prominent member. In November of the same year, when [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin|Prosper Enfantin]] became leader of the Saint-Simonians and preached the enfranchisement of women and the functions of the ''couple-prétre'', Leroux separated himself from the sect.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}} In 1834 he published an essay entitled "Individualism and Socialism" which, despite its message of scepticism towards both tendencies, introduced the term [[socialism]] in French political discourse.&lt;ref name="DAG83"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=David A.|year=1983|title=PIERRE LEROUX REDIVIVUS|journal=Nineteenth-Century French Studies|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|volume=12|issue=1-2|jstor=23536496}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} In 1838, with [[Jean Reynaud]], who had seceded with him, he founded the ''[[Encyclopédie nouvelle]]'' (eds. 1838-1841). Amongst the articles which he inserted in it were ''De l'egalité'' and ''Refutation de l'éclectisme'', which afterwards appeared as separate works.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}}

[[File:LerouxPierreStatueBoussac.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Pierre Leroux at Boussac.]]
In 1840 he published his treatise ''De l'humanité'' (2nd ed. 1845), which contains the fullest exposition of his system, and was regarded as the philosophical manifesto of the [[humanitarianism|Humanitarians]]. In 1841 he established the ''Revue indépendante'', with the aid of [[George Sand]], over whom he had great influence. Her ''Spiridion'', which was dedicated to him, ''Sept cordes de la lyre'', ''Consuelo'', and ''La Comtesse de Rudolstadt'', were written under the Humanitarian inspiration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}} Leroux also became embroiled in the philosophical controversy between [[F. W. J. Schelling|F.W.J. Schelling]] and the [[Young Hegelians]] in the early 1840s. A favourable comment about Schelling prompted a public reply from Hegel's disciple [[Karl Rosenkranz]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenkranz, K., ''Über Schelling und Hegel. Ein Sendschreiben an Pierre Leroux.'' Königsberg, 1843. An online version of the German text of Rosenkranz' piece can be found at: https://archive.org/details/ueberschellingu00rosegoog. [[Karl Marx]], in an 1843 letter to [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], attempted to gain the latter's co-operation with the ''Franco-German Annals'' and proposed that Feuerbach write a critique of Schelling. Marx wrote: "How cunningly Herr von Schelling enticed the French, first of all the weak, eclectic Cousin, then even the gifted Leroux. For Pierre Leroux and his like still regard Schelling as the man who replaced transcendental idealism by rational realism, abstract thought by thought with flesh and blood, specialised philosophy by world philosophy! To the French romantics and mystics he cries: "I, the union of philosophy and theology," to the French materialists: "I, the union of flesh and idea," to the French sceptics: "I, the destroyer of dogmatism," in a word, "I ... Schelling!" Cp. Marx to Feuerbach, October 3, 1843. Marx/Engels ''Collected Works'', Vol. 27, Moscow, 1962. Online at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/df-jahrbucher/feuer.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux continued to take an interest in German philosophy and literature; he also translated and commented on some writings by [[Goethe]].

In 1843 he established at Boussac ([[Creuse]]) a printing association organized according to his systematic ideas, and founded the ''Revue sociale''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}} In 1848 he joined the Freemasons.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} At the outbreak of the [[Revolution of 1848]] Leroux proclaimed the republic in the town of Boussac, becoming its mayor on February 25.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Subsequently he was elected to the Constituent Assembly, and in 1849 to the Legislative Assembly,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}} where he sat with the radical socialist deputies and often spoke, though his speeches were criticised as abstract and mystical. He also published numerous writings, including ''La Plutocratie'' (1848), another term he seems to have coined.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

An opponent of [[Louis Bonaparte]], Leroux went into exile after the ''[[coup d'état]]'' of 1851, settling with his family in [[Jersey]], where he pursued agricultural experiments and wrote his [[socialist]] poem ''La Grève de Samarez''.&lt;ref name="DAG83"/&gt;{{rp|106}} Marx nominated Leroux for the Central Committee of the [[International Workingmen's Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breckman|first=Warren|title=Adventures of the Symbolic: Postmarxism and Democratic Theory|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EcCrAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;ots=X2ydBWmqkn&amp;dq=Marx%20Pierre%20Leroux%20International&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=Marx%20Pierre%20Leroux%20International&amp;f=false|year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the definitive [[amnesty]] of 1869 he returned to Paris.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}} He supported the [[Paris Commune]] but died before its suppression.

[[File:Pierre Leroux par Cham.JPG|thumb|left|Caricature of Leroux in 1848-49 by [[Amédée de Noé|Cham]].]]
Leroux' thought is a unique medley of doctrines borrowed from Saint-Simonian, German Idealist,  [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhistic]] sources{{Citation needed|date= September 2013}}. His fundamental philosophical principle is that of what he calls the "triad"—a triplicity which he finds to pervade all things, which in [[God]] is "power, intelligence and love," in man "sensation, sentiment and knowledge".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}}

His religious doctrine is [[pantheistic]]; and, rejecting the belief in a future life as commonly conceived, he substitutes for it a theory of [[metempsychosis]]. In social economy he preserves the [[family]], [[country]] and [[property]], but finds in all three, as they now are, a [[despotism]] which must be eliminated. He imagines certain combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished. His solution seems to require the creation of families without heads, countries without governments and property without [[right of possession]]. In politics he advocates absolute equality — a [[democracy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=485}}

Leroux's significance in the [[history of ideas]] lies in his attempt to resuscitate spirituality and community in France in the wake of the revolutionary decades of the 1790s and the Napoleonic Era.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=this contradicts EB1911 that says "The writings of Leroux have no permanent significance in the history of thought."}} As was the case with many of his romantic socialist contemporaries, Leroux sought a basis on which to refound the human community that did not rely on the pillars of the old Regime, authority, hierarchy, and the Catholic Church. The span of his lifetime were years of the rise of capitalism and liberal trade policies, and also of the rise of an organized workers' movement.  Romantic socialism as a movement attempted to reconcile religious and material needs in society. Leroux' most thorough exposition of this idea is found in his ''Doctrine de l'Humanité'', published first in 1840. In this and other works he argues for a reciprocal notion of human need and identity, emphasizing [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]]'s interdependence in lieu of atomized individuality.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Praxis''', a transliteration of the Greek word πρᾶξις (derived from the stem of the verb πράσσειν, ''prassein'' "to do, to act"), means "practice, action, doing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=p&amp;p=41 Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  More particularly, it means either:
# practice, as distinguished from theory, of an art, science, etc.; or  practical application or exercise of a branch of learning;
# habitual or established practice; custom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/praxis Praxis definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodoxy and orthopraxis ==
[[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] writers, especially those in the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine tradition]], use the term "praxis" to refer to what others, using an English rather than a Greek word, call practice of the faith, especially with regard to [[asceticism|ascetic]] and [[liturgy|liturgical]] life.

Praxis is a key to understanding the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] tradition, which is observed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint [[Maximus the Confessor]]: "Theology without action is the theology of demons."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kF4cAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Theology+without+action+is+the+theology+of+demons%22&amp;dq=%22Theology+without+action+is+the+theology+of+demons%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C4mVVN-zNMvT7AafzoHoDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw Virginia Fabella, Sergio Torres (editors), ''Doing Theology in a Divided World''] (Orbis Books 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-88344197-8}}), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_7VKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 Paul W. Chilcote, ''Wesley Speaks on Christian Vocation''] (Wipf and Stock 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57910812-0}}), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburgh2010.org/fileadmin/files/edinburgh2010/files/docs/Mission%20among%20Other%20Faiths_Orthodox%20Perspective%20090820.doc Mission among Other Faiths: An Orthodox Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

Union with [[God]], to which Christians hold that [[Jesus]] invited man, requires not just [[faith]], but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the [[Biblical canon|Scriptures]] ([[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Cor]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=011&amp;l=2 11:2],
[[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thes]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=60&amp;ch=002&amp;l=14 2:14]) and the [[Church Fathers]], and is linked with the term ''praxis'' in Byzantine [[theology]] and vocabulary.[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/ortho-praxis/] In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of 'theory and practice'.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040606120041/http://arts.tuirgin.com/] Rather, it is a word that means, globally, all that Orthodox ''do''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040808164646/http://www.orthodoxpraxis.org/article.php?id=2&amp;menu=1] Praxis is 'living Orthodoxy'.[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/rose_wv.aspx]

Praxis is perhaps most strongly associated with [[worship]]. "[[Orthopraxis]]" is said to mean "right glory" or "right worship"[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/index.aspx]; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of [[liturgy]] (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the [[Western Christianity|West]], Christianity has been reduced "to intellectual, ethical or social categories," whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the [[Body of Christ]] and providing the path to "true religious education."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070510124549/http://www.sf.goarch.org/religioused/TheOrthodoxDifference.htm] A "symbiosis of worship and work" is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040702211116/http://www.syrianorthodoxarchdiocese.com/anagalpura.html]

[[Fasting]], another key part of the practice of the Christian faith, is mentioned as part of Byzantine praxis, in connection with the [[Sermon on the Mount]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=006 6]),[http://www.holytrans.org/Ministries/Catechism/Oratorical%20Festival%202003.htm] and in comparison with the history and commemorations of [[Lent]]en fasts.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040603102907/http://www.monachos.net/great_lent/index.shtml]

Praxis may also refer to proper religious etiquette.[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/index.aspx]

== Corresponding terminology in Latin Christianity ==
In the [[Latin Church]], parallel ideas of asceticism and worship exist. The word used in this regard is the regular English word "practice", since in English the term "praxis" is not normally used in this sense.

The simplest and most common understanding of the term "practising Catholic", a minimal interpretation of the phrase, is that the person has been baptized (or canonically received into full communion with the Catholic Church) and strives to observe the Church's precept of attending celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or [[Divine Liturgy]] on [[Sunday]]s and [[Holy Day of Obligation|holy days of obligation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdsc.org.uk/assets/pdf/Catholic%20Schools%20and%20the%20Definition%20of%20a%20%E2%80%98Practising%20Catholic%E2%80%99%20%20Revised%2007.04.09.pdf Catholic Schools and the Definition of a "Practising Catholic"]&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who does not fulfil even this minimum requirement for being considered "practising" is referred to as a [[lapsed Catholic]].

A more ample indication of what practice involves is given in a statement by Bishop Luc Matthys of [[Armidale]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad2000.com.au/articles/2006/nov2006p5_2381.html What distinguishes a practising Catholic?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025104159/http://ad2000.com.au/articles/2006/nov2006p5_2381.html |date=2010-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Living the Catholic faith involves much more than the minimum requirements referred to above.

Matters such as fasting have applications that vary according to place and according to the autonomous [[particular Church]] to which a person belongs. In each of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], practice is generally the same as in the associated [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]] with which it is not in full communion. Thus, practice in the Eastern Catholic Churches of [[Byzantine Rite]] is identical with that described above for the Churches that constitute the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], but differs from that of, for instance, the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]. Within the Latin Church too, there are variations in such matters in accordance with rules laid down by the [[episcopal conference]]s in view of local conditions and traditions.

== Modern meaning of "praxis" ==
In English the word "praxis" is more commonly used in the sense not of practice but with the meaning given to it by [[Immanuel Kant]], namely application of a theory to cases encountered in experience or reasoning about what there should be as opposed to what there is: this meaning [[Karl Marx]] made central to his philosophical ideal of transforming the world through revolutionary activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WHILCw0hDA4C&amp;pg=PA287 Simon Blackburn, ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''] (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-19-861013-0}}), pp.287-288&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Marxism, proponents of [[Latin America]]n [[liberation theology]] have used the word "praxis" with specific reference to human activity directed towards transforming the conditions and causes of poverty. Their "liberation theology" consists then in applying the Gospel to that praxis to guide and govern it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407709044/praxis.html D. A. Lane, "Praxis" in ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''presumption of priestly descent''' (or '''presumed kohen''' or '''status-quo kohen''') in Judaism is the attribution to a [[kohen]] of equivalent position as if there was proven descent from the priestly family of [[Aaron]]. This is evidenced not by genealogical records but by ''de facto'' priestly behavior as defined in rabbinical [[Halakha|halakhic]] texts.

In the [[Land of Israel]] it was the raising up of hands in the [[priestly benediction]], and sharing [[heave offering]] at the [[threshing floor]], whereas in Syria and Babylonia the raising up of hands constituted adequate grounds, but not sharing heave offering at the threshing floor&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Neusner]] ''The Comparative Hermeneutics of Rabbinic Judaism: Seder Moed'' 2000, Page 108 "T. 3:1 There are two presumptive grounds for a person's being deemed to be in the priesthood in the Land of Israel: Raising up hands [in the priestly benediction], and sharing heave-offering at the threshing floor."&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] [[Ketubot]] 2:7 and other texts.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud of the Land of Israel: An Academic Commentary  Volume 1 Jacob Neusner – 1998 "Gamaliel says, "Just as eating heave offering is presumptive evidence that a person is a priest in the case of the dividing of shares at the threshing floor], so first tithe is presumptive evidence that a person is a Levite in the case ...:&lt;/ref&gt;

The "presumed kohen" (''kohen mukhzaq'') ({{lang-he|כהן מוחזק}}, from [[:wikt:חזק|חזק]]) is a [[rabbinic]] title which legitimates kohen status to a kohen who—among multiple criteria—exhibits conduct exemplary of and is recognized by his peers and community as such.&lt;ref&gt;Such conduct includes—but not limited to—abstaining from becoming impure by contact with a corpse, abstaining from forbidden marriages, administering the [[Priestly Blessing]], ''[[Pidyon HaBen]]'' and more (see table of halakhic opinions below)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tannaim|tannaitic rabbi]] [[Jose ben Halafta]] extolled the soundness of the said "presumption" (''[[chazakah]]'') by calling it a basis for the entire [[Halakha|halakhic]] concept of ''chazakah'' ([[Bavli|B]].[[Nashim|Ketubot]] 24b). It is based on this presumption that all ''[[poskim]]'' agree, unanimously, to forbid presumptive kohanim from marrying a divorcee. Of note is that from among the opinions of the [[Acharonim]], the mentioned presumption is given the title "a sound presumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A sound Chazakah (see Bait Yitzchok) |url= http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41137&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=158|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Maimonides]], once he is established as a presumptive kohen it is a [[Mitzvah|commandment]] to [[The Mitzvah of sanctifying the Kohen|sanctify the kohen]] &lt;ref&gt;Maimonides ''Sefer HaMitzvot'' positive commandment 32&lt;/ref&gt; and assist him in abstaining from the [[Kohen#Ritual defilement|prohibitions]] that apply to a kohen. Maimonides considered that presumption of the kohen is deemed valid and in good standing unless a valid objection to his lineage is made before a [[Beit Din]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides on Mishna [[Ketubot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Hebrew Bible==
From the time of [[Aaron]] being chosen as [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] up to the times of the [[Babylonian exile]] the lineage of a kohen was taken as matter-of-fact. This changed by the onset of the [[Jewish]] nation's returning from Babylonian exile and the building of the temple anew. This national revival created a call for the kohanim to do their necessary priestly duty on the temple. However, due to the occurrence of intermarriage among the returnees in general and the kohanim as well, the need to ascertain that each kohen was lineage verifiable as being a male descendant, 'son after son', also termed 'a paternal grandchild', of Aaron the High Priest and ''[[kosher]]'' in the literal sense; "in line" with the directives of the Law', for example not an offspring of a forbidden marriage such as if a kohen were to marry a divorcee where the child would be disqualified from the priesthood.

This necessity created an investigation ordered by [[Nehemiah]] that produced the first recorded investigation questioning the authenticity of apparently legitimate kohanim:
{{quote|63 Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was named after them. 64 These searched among their ancestral registration, but it could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood. |Nehemiah 7:63–64 [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]}}

By first glance at the above verse it is understood that the mentioned families were rejected entirely from all duties and privileges exclusive to the kohanim. However, the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Rabbi Yossi]] adopted a more analytical approach based on the following verse:
{{quote|65 The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest arose with [[Urim and Thummim]]|7:65}}

Based on the latter verse making explicit what these persons may not eat from the most holy things it is apparent that consumption of simply holy things was allowed. [[Jose ben Halafta|Yossi]] gives the opinion that since the investigated families had prior to the investigation consumed only offerings from outside the Holy Land, from the point of investigative results and onward they were permitted to eat from offerings of the Land of Israel ([[Nashim|Ketubot]] 24b). He further explains that offerings from outside the Holy Land are prohibited to a non-kohen based on rabbinic command whereas offerings from the Holy Land are prohibited to a non-kohen by a direct Biblical directive. From the apparent unpleasant narrated event of the Beit Din of Nehemiah questioning the legitimacy of the mentioned Kohanic family, Yossi extracted the positive factor of the strength of the [[Chazakah]] form of ownership.

Yossi understood this from the fact that not only did Nehemiah allow the said kohanic family to consume the ''[[Terumah]]'' from outside of the Land of Israel but also allowed them to consume ''Terumah'' from Israel itself—an act punishable by death if performed by a non-kohen.&lt;ref&gt;Tractate ketubot page 24a&lt;/ref&gt;

As to why the investigators of Nehemiah were suspicious that the priestly family of the children of Chavaya were not qualified to function as kohanim is a matter of Talmudic and rabbinic debate.

The author of ''Avodah Tamma'' points out that this family was known to be descendants of Aaron for certain, the suspicion was that these male children were offspring of a woman forbidden to a kohen for marriage.

The [[Talmud Yerushalmi]] explains that Barzilai himself was a Jew, but his daughters were not born Jewish but converted before being three years of age,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi to Kiddushin 4:1 (page 42)&lt;/ref&gt; posing a (rabbinic) problem to a kohen marrying those daughters.

In discussing the reason as to why the verse chooses to penn{{what|date=July 2017}} the known lineage of the questioned kohanim&lt;ref&gt;i.e. "those who took from the daughters of Barzilai The Gileadite"&lt;/ref&gt; as being descendants of Barzilai the Gileadite, the 13th century Talmudic scholar, [[Menachem Meiri]] points out the wording of the verse transmit a unique message.

Barzilai the Gileadite, explained the Meiri, was reputed by Talmudic scholars to be a person of excessive sexual indulgence. Additionally, Barzilai was suspected as a common liar and entirely not versed in [[Torah]] law. These facts, Menachem concludes,&lt;ref&gt;Meiri to [[Talmud]] tractate Kedushin p. 69b, based on Talmud to Shabbos 152a&lt;/ref&gt; is why the verse chose to tell us this seemingly unimportant detail, since it was who these kohanim chose to marry that was the source of the unpleasant outcome of being the subject of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;The source of disqualification (based on talmud Kiddushin p. 69) is that of the concern of "Challal" see: [[Kohen]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case both according to [[Talmud Bavli]] and Yerushalmi, the root cause for suspicion of these kohanim was only ''[[D'Oraita and D'Rabbanan|MiDirabbanan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A rabbinic prohibition, as opposed to a Torah prohibition&lt;/ref&gt; and therefor at the conclusion of the investigation this Kohanic family was permitted to consume ''Terumah''.

==Lineage document==
As to the essential content of the lineage document—and its general appearance—little information is given by the Talmud. This being contrary to other Rabbinic documents that are described at somewhat greater length, for example the [[Ketubah]], the [[Get (divorce document)|Get]], various business documents (Shtarei Kinyan), and the document of freedom for a bondsman (Shtar Shichrur).

[[Rashi]], in his Torah commentary mentions that when the congregation of Israel were required to ascertain their lineage to join their respective tribe, this document was brought in tandem with the testifying of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi to Bamidbar 18:1&lt;/ref&gt; In the book of [[Books of Chronicles|Divrei HaYamim]], the lineage document is usually cited in relation to the soldiers of Israel joining their respective legions based on their patrilineal tribe.

[[Yair Bacharach]] noted that the lineage document was not commonly used by kohanim. To be deemed eligible for Kohanic service, explained Yair, is sufficient that two Kosher witnesses testify that the said kohen is of legitimate lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Chavot Yair, Hashmatot to page 154a&lt;/ref&gt; The Tur [[Shulchan Aruch]] follows a similar tone by stating that to be eligible for Kohanic service on the [[Mizbeach]] two witnesses is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Tur Even HaEzer 6:3 as quoted by Prisha in minor chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; According to the opinion of the Avodah Tamma, the option was available for the incoming kohen to either produce his lineage document or have two Kosher witnesses testify to his authenticity as a kohen.

==During the Temple period==
As to whom was appointed to verify the lineage of the kohanim during this pre-temple era is a matter of debate. The [[Mishnah]] state that, as part of the [[Sanhedrin|Great Beit Din]], there was a branch-commission occupied exclusively with this investigative task.&lt;ref&gt;Mishna Middot 4:8&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Sifri]] and Babylonian Talmud point out that it was a commission of kohanim themselves that investigated the legitimacy of fellow kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sifri]] to Devarim 17:18, Talmud Bavli Pesachim p. 3, Chasdei Dovid to [[Tosefta]] Chagiga 3:8, [[Malbim]] to Sifri Bamidbar 18:7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accurate lineage keeping in the Diaspora==
With the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and the Jews entry to exile hard-copy lineage recording was lost. In its stead came the actions exclusive to kohanim&lt;ref&gt;See examples given at beginning of article&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of a disqualifying objection in [[Beit Din]] that expressed that one was a legitimate kohen.&lt;ref&gt;For example: two "kosher" witnesses testifying that the individual is a descendant of a divorcee who married a kohen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a lengthy and highly-analytical responsum by the composer of the [[Sdei Chemed]], Rabbi [[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]] concluded that the modern ''Kohen Muchzak'' is considered a valid and true kohen for all purposes that a kohen is to fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sdei Chemed Maarechet 20, 19 |url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14154&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=183&amp;hilite=|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsum of Isaac ben Sheshet (1328–1408)==
The source of questioning the legitimacy of kohanim is rooted in a single responsum of [[Isaac ben Sheshet]].  This fourteenth-century responsum deals with a letter to Rabbi Yitzchok detailing an event where an individual publicly humiliated a kohen. The query was as to whether it is halachic to impose an increased monetary fine to the humiliator since the subjected was a kohen, or to suffice with the standard fine afforded a non-kohen.

Rabbi Yitzchok responded that "Although it is halacha that he who humiliates another by use of words is not liable, one who embarrasses a Kohen should be publicly rebuked and subject to request forgiveness from and to appease the Kohen — so long as the Kohen exhibits conduct expected from a son of Aaron". Isaac ben Sheshet continued and negated amplifying the penalty since the embarrassed kohen was not a learned [[Talmid Chacham]] kohen, but an unschooled [[am ha-aretz]] kohen. Ben Sheshet explained that even were the regular kohen to produce a lineage document certifying his direct lineage to Aaron the high priest the halachic ruling would stay, since it is found in the Talmud that the rabbis did not withhold from humiliating a "lineage-verified kohen" who was not well-versed in Torah (''Am Haaretz'') all the more so today's kohen who cannot produce his lineage document does not receive an amplified penalty". Of note is that the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (Tur Choshen Mishpat 420:24) rules that the humiliator of a kohen is liable to pay amplified compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Tshuvat HaRivash Chap. 94 [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19989&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=44  To view the response] (In [[Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac ben Sheshet's words "today's Kohen who cannot produce his lineage document", which he intended on using as a sidebar explanation to his final ruling of standard compensation, over time evolved into an underpinning foundation for [[Poskim]] who sought to approve rabbinically-questionable marriages to a kohen.

===Understanding Isaac ben Sheshet's response===
Leading Rabbinic authorities, such as [[Joseph Trani]] and [[Samuel Ashkenazi]], disputed reliance on the Isaac ben Sheshet's response for purpose of questioning the authenticity of the kohen. They, as part of various proofs, cited reasoning from a latter response from Isaac ben Sheshet himself (Tshuvat HaRivash res. 348) where he is stringent that a kohen who married a divorcee is obligated to cease his marriage, thus proving the Isaac ben Sheshet's fundamental stance of upholding the legitimacy of the presumptive kohen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Trani]] Mahari"t vol. 1 res. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Ashkenazi]] Yefei Mareh Berachot 8:2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbi Samuel de Medina's permission===
Rabbi [[Samuel de Medina]], in a response concerning a woman who was held captive as a young girl, ruled that a kohen is permitted to marry her. The logic, he explained, is one of a double uncertainty. One uncertainty being that we are unsure the woman was exposed to forced intimacy, which would disqualify the woman from marrying a kohen, and even where she have been the kohen is prohibited from wedding her only [[D'Oraita and D'Rabbanan|according to rabbinical decision]]. In addition, the [[Samuel de Medina]] wrote that he is unsure as to the authenticity of the modern kohen based on the response of the Isaac ben Sheshet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= For the response of the Rabbi Shmuel |url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1390&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=384&amp;hilite= |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This responsum of Samuel de Medina was met with a fiery reply from [[Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen]];

{{quote|I have seen in some responsa and have also heard (about) a few Rabbi's who seek to be lenient regarding today's kohen and label them as "uncertain", I forbid myself on agreeing with them.  Since they were already rebuked with one hundred (lashes from) metal-tipped whips from the hands of reputable rabbis making the issue forgotten to expose a falsehood on the authenticity of the Kohanim..let me not be with those responsa, not even as a sidebar to their opinion|''Knesset Yechezkiel'' Responsa 56}}

Rabbinic authorities such as Joseph Trani have come to the defense of Samuel de Medina by stating that the case brought before his court was one of Rabbinic degree, and never would Samuel de Medina have permitted a marriage prohibited in the Hebrew Bible marriage to presumptive kohen.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Joseph Trani]] (1538–1639) or [[Jacob Toledano]] (1697–1771) ''[[Maharit]]'' vol. 1 p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; They cite, as proof, additional responsa of Samuel where he is stringent on a presumptive kohen from continued marriage to his wife due to only the possible but not certain receipt of a [[Get (divorce document)|bill of divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel de Medina]] [http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1390&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=370 responsa Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion of Solomon Luria===
The opinion of [[Solomon Luria]] is somewhat obscure.  On the one hand Luria opines with the advice to give the "devoted things", both land and goods, as one of the ten priestly gifts applicable outside of Israel, to a presumptive kohen, provided the estate owner of the devoted property explicitly states to give it to a kohen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Luria]], ''Yad shel Shlomo,'' commentary to Tractate [[Bava Kamma]], ch. 5. paragraph 35 Hebrew&lt;/ref&gt; Luria also encouraged the giving of [[shoulder, cheeks and maw]] to a presumptive kohen.{{quotation|"It appears to me that all who fear heaven who slaughters for himself should give the gifts to the priest... as it is no more stringent that [[Pidyon Haben|gift to the firstborn]]"|[[Solomon Luria]] to [[Hullin]] 11:5}}
However, Luria writes of the basic questioning of the kohen as legitimate due to upheaval of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], writing that this and similar upheavals utterly confused the entire lineage tracking of Jews subjected to persecution in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Luria|Maharshal]], Yad shel Shlomo, commentary to Tractate [[Bava Kamma]], ch. 5. paragraph 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story about Elijah===
Luria quotes a story where Hai ben Sherira, [[Hai Gaon]] practiced a ''[[minhag]]'' to travel to Jerusalem for [[Sukkot]] and circle the [[Temple Mount]] with hundreds of kohanim with the company of [[Elijah the Prophet]]. One year a student of his noticed rav Hai laughing during the procession, at the completion of the procession he queried his rabbi as to why, to which rav Hai responded that Elijah revealed to him that, from among the hundreds of kohanim that accompanied him in a haughty way, none were legitimate kohanim aside for one kohen who proceeded [[humility|humbly]].

====Questioning the story====
Luria although quoting the story as one "known amongst the works of Rabbinic leaders" was not one of great familiarity amongst rabbinic writers.&lt;ref&gt;see avodah tammah p. 46 column 1. | "Levarech b'Ahava (Y. Engel) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The story was eventually traced by scholars to have originated in the [[Parma]] manuscript of [[Sefer Chasidim]], a manuscript with multiple textual differences to the common edition of "Sefer Chasidim." However, in addition to the story detail creating an [[anachronism]] of sorts in that the story portrays rav Hai and [[Evyathar Kohen-Tzedek]] as proceeding together in Jerusalem whereas they lived at separate times, some scholars have labeled the story as a [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Y. L. Fishman ''Mechkarim besafrut hageonim'' 1 2 side 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Others maintain that the story detail falls in line with the opinion spelled out by Hai Gaon in his letter to the [[priests of Djerba]],&lt;ref&gt;''Ginzei keddem'' vol. 4 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; where Hai expresses that [[humility]] is a proper virtue of the kohen and the kohen who does not possess this attribute is of questionable priestly lineage

===Opposition to Luria===
Luria's Talmudic explanation that put a damper on the legitimacy of Jewish priests was not readily accepted amongst some poskim. Some cited Luria's reasoning as "a feeble enough reason",&lt;ref&gt;''Even HaShoham'' responsa 29&lt;/ref&gt; while others validated Luria's reasoning solely outside of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;C. Benbenishti ''Knesset Hagedolah'' [[Beit Yosef (book)|Beit Yosef]] [[Yoreh De'ah]] 61:41&lt;/ref&gt; Some even went so far as to legitimize Luria's reasoning only to disqualify [[Ashkenazic]] priesthood while stating that [[Sephardic]] priesthood is of superior quality.&lt;ref&gt;''Biet Ephraim Orah Chayyim'' responsa 6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moses Sofer|Chatam Sofer]] rejected Luria's reasoning that the lineage of Ashkenazic priesthood was utterly confused.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses Sofer]] {{cite web |title= Chasam Sofer Yoreh Deah chapter 235 |url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1839&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=197&amp;hilite= |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion of Jacob Emden===
Regarding the [[Mitzvah|commandment]] of giving the five silver coins of [[Pidyon HaBen|the firstborn]] to the kohen. [[Jacob Emden]] opined that the presumed status of a presumptive kohen is insufficient to merit actually keeping those five silver coins.  Hence, he suggested the kohen agree to a conditional transaction, with the intent on returning the coins to the father of the [[Bechor|firstborn]], all this in order to skirt the potential prohibition of theft on the kohen's part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Emden]] ''Sheilat Yaabetz'' vol. 1 chap. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Poskim, however, did not agree with Emden on this issue, for example, Sofer wrote that this type of conditional transaction would invalidate the redemption of the firstborn itself and the child would not be halachically redeemed so long as any pressure is exerted on the kohen to agree to this type of conditional transaction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses Sofer]] responsa 291&lt;/ref&gt; A more extreme approach was taken by [[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]] who exclaimed, amongst a group of arguments, that Emden's advice created a cloud of uncertainty and doubt as to the otherwise legitimate lineage of the modern kohen. Medini concluded that the Emden's idea should not be relied on for the actual redemption of the firstborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]] ''Sdei chemed maarechet chof,'' chap. 92 page 186&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the lineage of a kohen, Emden, in another responsum, writes that it is possible to find a kohen with a lineage document up until his [[Priestly divisions|patrilinial priestly division]] in hand even though the rest of Israel do not have their lineage documents at all.&lt;ref&gt;Emden ''Sheilat Yaabetz, Siman 89''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Photo Shoot for NYT.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo Shoot for ''[[The New York Times]]'']]
Mark Oppenheimer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' placed Edward's book in the tradition of other performers—such as [[James Randi]], [[Harry Houdini]], and [[Penn &amp; Teller]]—who simultaneously "perform their crafts and debunk them".&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt; Oppenheimer also commented on the "conflicted" nature of the book, saying, "there is something tragic about his own ambivalence. From page to page, he cannot decide which side he is on. Sometimes he is crusading against the mountebanks and charlatans. Other times he defends his work as pure entertainment."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt; He called the book, "A strange mishmash of self-pity, self-justification, and genuine repentance—and a compelling look at the disputed territory where entertainment meets religion, where some practitioners actually think they can practice both at the same time."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt;

The subject matter of this book caused [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV's]] program [[This Morning (TV programme)|''This Morning'']] to invite Edward to speak about "supernatural swindlers" on May 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=DailyMail /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITV&gt;{{cite web|title=A Supernatural Swindler |url=http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/supernatural-week-psychic-conman-mark |website=ITV |accessdate=8 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726205121/http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/supernatural-week-psychic-conman-mark |archivedate=July 26, 2015 |date=1 May 2014 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|''Carmel'']] ''Pine Cone'' newspaper article noted, "The book has stirred up attention both in the United States and abroad", and, "His message is that so-called psychics don’t have supernatural powers—they're just master manipulators and are well versed in saying what people want to hear—and that most of them are simply frauds."&lt;ref name=PineCone&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmon|first1=Rachel|title=Secrets of Psychics to be Revealed|url=http://www.pineconearchive.com/downloads120921.html|accessdate=9 December 2015|issue=Vol. 98 No. 38|date=September 21, 2012|pages=12A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skepticism|Skeptical]] activist and [[podcast]]er John Rael&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.skepticality.com/about-us/|website=Skepticality|accessdate=8 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907204613/http://www.skepticality.com/about-us/|archivedate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also recognized the dual nature of the book. Writing in a Skeptic.com book review, Rael chided Edward for continuing to perform as a psychic entertainer while still recognizing the value of the book itself. “The greatest tragedy of this book is that Edward seems to miss out on his own lesson, and it’s a really good one: . . . that we should listen to each other and talk to each other much more than we do."&lt;ref name=Rael&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rael|first1=John|title=Inside the Psychic Mind|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/13-08-21/|website=Skeptic.com|accessdate=8 December 2015|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the book, Rael said: "[D]o you want to learn about psychics? The people, not the tricks? Do you want to understand who psychics are and not just how they operate? Here is your book."&lt;ref name=Rael /&gt;

Writing for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', [[Ray Hyman]] acknowledged Edward's "ambiguous role in the skeptical community,"&lt;ref name=Hyman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyman|first1=Ray|authorlink=Ray Hyman|title=An Inside Look at a 'Psychic's' World|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=November 2013|volume=37|issue=6|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that, "He is quite active in helping skeptical groups test psychic claims and debunk obviously phony psychics who exploit their clients. At the same time, Edward still performs as a 'psychic.' He does not claim to have psychic powers. On the other hand, he does not openly disclaim such powers."&lt;ref name=Hyman /&gt; Of the book itself, Hyman said, "Because it provides us a rare insight into a psychic's world, as well as raising some important ethical issues for skeptics to ponder, I highly recommend every skeptic carefully read and ponder this book's contents."&lt;ref name=Hyman /&gt;

'''Rudolf Christian Friedrich Lechler''' ({{zh|c=黎力基}}) (26 July 1824 – 29 March 1908), was a [[German people|German]] [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] [[missionary]] to [[China]], and is one of early leaders of the [[Basel Mission]] evangelizing to the [[Hakka people]]. Lechler spent 52 years in China. The Basel Hakka Mission that he administered was responsible for establishing over 51 mission stations, 56 schools with over two thousand members.&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Voskamp, "The Work of German Missions in China," in China Mission Yearbook, 1914, pg. 373-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lechler is known today for administering to the early [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Christian church and, together with his mission coworkers, facilitated in the resettling of Hakka Christian communities fleeing from persecution to Southeast Asian countries of which new congregations such as the [[Basel Christian Church of Malaysia]] and the [[Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore]] were subsequently formed. Lechler appreciated China's cultural heritage and was able to preach in several [[varieties of Chinese]], including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]], and [[Hakka language|Hakka]], the last of which he knew well enough to help prepare a Romanized Hakka edition of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;Early Hakka corpora held by the Basel Mission library: an introduction  Biographical dictionary of Chinese Christianity, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Hakka Christian community is estimated to have 150,000 members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=12054&amp;rog3=CH Joshua Project: People-in-Country Profile - The Hakka]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and early work==
Lechler was born on 26 July 1824 to [[pastor]] and [[Pietist]] Gottlob Lechler. He initially joined the merchant industry as an apprentice. During this time, an illness in which he contracted resulted in his Christian faith being strengthened and in 1844 committed himself to becoming a missionary by entering a Mission school run by the Basel Mission. It was during this time that he became acquainted with [[Theodore Hamberg]] &lt;ref&gt;W. Schlatter, Rudolf Lechler: ''A Biography of the Basel Mission in China'' (Basel Mission Bookshop, 1911), pp. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the missionary [[Karl Gützlaff]] began touring churches in Western Europe and calling for missionary work to begin on the inland areas of China where no Westerner had ventured before. The [[Rhenish Missionary Society]] and the [[Basel Mission]] heeded the call and arranged for Theodor and Lechler to set sail for China, arriving on [[Lutheran Church of China#The first Lutheran missions .281847-1890.29.|March 19, 1847]].

Krückeberg]] travelled to Macau to recuperate from an illness and during this time he met [[Karl Gutzlaff]] and began to take an interest in the mission work taking place in China. He recommendeded that the Basel Mission society also begin sending its workers to China. On the May 13, 1846, the [[Basel Mission]] commissioned pastors [[Theodore Hamberg]] and [[Rudolph Lechler]] to China. On the same year, the [[Barmen Mission]] resolved to send [[Heinrich Köster]] and [[Ferdinand Genähr]] to assist Gutzlaff. The four of them reached [[Hong Kong]] on March 19. The [[Berlin Missionary Society]] also sent pastors Newman and Schubert as missionaries to China. 
In the early year, the three mission societies had their own separate mission goals - Gutzlaff arranged for the [[Basel Church]] to be responsible for evangelizing the eastern [[Guangdong]] region, [[Rudolph Lechler|Lechler]] was to administer to the [[Teochew people]] in the [[Chaozhou]] and [[Shantou]] areas, whereas [[Theodore Hamberg|Hamberg]] was minister to the [[Hakka people|Hakka population]]. The Barmen Mission workers were to be assigned the southeastern and western parts of the province where the language of the local population is predominantly [[Cantonese]]. The Berlin Mission Society was allotted the [[Guangzhou]] area north of the [[Beijiang River]] to preach to both the local Hakka and Cantonese residents. This strategy continued until after the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Incident]] when all three mission socieites began to cooperate and jointly develop common goals amongst themselves.

'''''Ruse''''' is a [[comic book]] featuring detectives Simon Archard and Emma Bishop. Originally published by [[CrossGen]], it was revived in 2011 by [[Marvel Comics]] as part of its acquisition of CrossGen titles.

==Publication history==

Ruse ran for twenty-six issues from November [[2001 in comics|2001]] to January [[2004 in comics|2004]] before it was forced to end by the [[bankruptcy]] of CrossGen. The first half of the series was written by [[Mark Waid]] and the last half by [[Scott Beatty]]; nearly the entire series featured pencils by [[Jackson Guice|Butch Guice]]. The critically acclaimed series was known for complex plots, the witty repartee between the two protagonists, and being of an unusual genre in comic books ([[Victorian-era]] [[detective fiction]]).

The series also had three spin-off issues, each called ''Ruse: Archard's Agents'' and all written by [[Chuck Dixon]].

In 2010, [[Marvel Comics]] announced plans to revive CrossGen titles, and revealed that ''Ruse'' was scheduled to return as a four-issue miniseries in March 2011. Mark Waid was also announced as the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/14857/enter_crossgen|accessdate=2010-07-25|date=2010-12-16|title=Enter Crossgen|publisher=Marvel.com|author=Ben Morse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

===Original series===
The series takes place on the planet Arcadia, primarily in the fictional town of Partington, in a [[Victorian-era]] setting tinged with elements of magic and fantasy.  The most visible difference from real London is that it has living gargoyles which are regarded by the populace as creatures as commonplace as pigeons.

===Revived series===
The revived series established the city of Partington as a settlement in Victorian England, and made no mention of the Sigils or Negation characters from the original series. References were made to events and characters from the Crossgen series.

==Characters==
The series focused on two primary [[protagonist]]s: Simon Archard and Emma Bishop. The relationship between the two attractive leads is purely professional, although the two share great chemistry and other characters make numerous innuendos about their relationship.

'''Simon Archard''' is a [[detective]]. He is a master sleuth and extremely competent. He has an [[eidetic memory]]. He is feared by the criminals of Partington, and his presence apparently keeps the [[crime rate]] low. He is close to emotionless, remaining utterly calm in situations of crisis. He is also emotionally distant from other people. His character is based on [[Sherlock Holmes]].  It is implied that Simon Archard is his world's Sigil Bearer, but he does not receive the mark from anyone at the beginning of the series nor does he seem to have any special powers except his mental abilities (he does however wear the Sigil mark upon his tie pin). It is possible that Simon received the mark before the series began, gets his abilities from it and is able to hide it from everyone (and wears the mark on his tie pin as respect for the powers it gives him).

'''Emma Bishop''' is Simon Archard's assistant. She has mysterious magical powers which she is not supposed to use. Careful to maintain her identity, she conceals her powers (though it was revealed in the last issue of the series, #26, that Archard had secretly deduced her powers almost from the very beginning). The source of her abilities was never revealed in the series, though a reader familiar with the rest of the [[Sigilverse|CrossGen Universe]] could deduce from her powers and her orange eyes that she was one of the guides that accompanied Sigil-bearers.

'''Miranda Cross''' is the primary [[antagonist]] of the series. She initially appears to be a beautiful [[baron]]ess; however, it is revealed that she is evil, many centuries old, and from a different world. She also possesses magical powers, which are at least the equal of and probably stronger than those of Emma Bishop. She is possibly a [[demon]] of some sort, though the exact nature of her identity is not resolved by the end of the series. Some readers consider her dialogue in ''Ruse'' #18 (April 2003) to possibly hint that she is a [[Negation (comics)|Negation]] Lawbringer.

'''Malcolm Lightbourne''' is Simon Archard's former mentor and chief rival.  Lightbourne's main goal throughout the series is the retrieval of the Enigmatic Prism, which Archard stole from him at the end of their partnership.  Lightbourne also seeks to kill Archard and attempts to achieve both of his goals by destroying the city of Partington.

'''The Consortium of Aggrieved Man Servants''' are a group of Butlers that strive to achieve the impossible; kill Simon Archard.  This underground conspiracy has swelled in ranks over the years every time Archard has muttered the phrase "the Butler did it."  Even though the consortium has made many (botched) attempts on Archard's life, he seems un-characteristically unaware of their existence or perhaps he just doesn't care.

'''Archard's Agents''' are a network of people that Archard uses to gather information on cases. Members of the group include a former prize fighter, a child psychic, and a bearded lady.

==Plot==
While some issues were standalone issues in which Simon Archard and Emma Bishop solved some small mystery in Partington, most issues were concerned with the larger storyline running throughout the entire series.

This storyline focused on a mysterious [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] called the Enigmatic Prism, which incited evil desires, such as [[hate]], [[lust]], and a need to do [[violence]], within people. Miranda Cross wanted the Enigmatic Prism to do evil with, and to use it to return to her homeworld. Simon Archard and Emma Bishop sought to destroy the prism, to prevent the artifact from causing further harm.

== Quotes ==
*Emma, when asked what she has learned: "''I've learned that... that Simon Archard shows all the crimeside manner of a cactus.''"
*Simon: "''Begging your pardon, but would you two please repeat that exchange? I can barely hear it over the clamor of mysterious subtext.''"
*Miranda: "''All that you know, all you can conceive... I and others like me are fated to control it.''"
*Emma: "''Wait. Don't speak for a moment. I wish to bask in the warm glow of your praise.''"

Trees hold a particular role in [[Germanic paganism]] and [[Germanic mythology]], both as individuals ([[sacred trees]]) and in groups ([[sacred grove]]s). The central role of trees in Germanic religion is noted in the earliest written reports about the [[Germanic peoples]], with the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] stating that Germanic cult practices took place exclusively in groves rather than [[Heathen hofs|temples]]. Scholars consider that reverence for and rites performed at individual trees are derived from the mythological role of the world tree, [[Yggdrasil]]; [[Onomastics|onomastic]] and some historical evidence also connects individual [[Germanic gods|deities]] to both groves and individual trees. After [[Christianization]], trees continue to play a significant role in the [[folk belief]]s of the Germanic peoples.

==Terminology==
The pagan Germanic peoples referred to holy places by a variety of terms and many of these terms variously referred to stones, groves, and temple structures. From [[Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|xaruʒaz|italic=yes}} or {{lang|gem-x-proto|haruʒaz|italic=yes}}, a masculine noun, developed [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|[[hörgr|hǫrgr]]|italic=yes}} meaning 'temple, idol', [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|hearg|italic=yes}} 'temple, idol', and [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|harug|italic=yes}} meaning 'holy grove, holy stone'. According to [[Germanic philology|philologist]] [[Vladimir Orel]], the term was borrowed from the continental [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] *{{lang|cel|karrikā|italic=yes}} or, alternately, the same non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] source as the Celtic source.&lt;ref name="OREL-164"&gt;Orel (2003:164).&lt;/ref&gt; A more general term for a sacred place was {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[vé]]|italic=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;Simek (2004:355).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Proto-Germanic masculine noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|nemeðaz|italic=yes}}, which developed into [[Old Frankish]] {{lang|frk|nimid|italic=yes}} ('holy grove'), similarly either developed from, or is otherwise connected to, [[Gaulish]] {{lang|xtg|[[nemeton]]|italic=yes}}, [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[sacellum]]|italic=yes}} and [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|nemed|italic=yes}} 'holiness'.&lt;ref name="OREL-284"&gt;Orel (2003:284).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Vries 352"&gt;De Vries (1970:352).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries (1970:137).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Proto-Germanic masculine noun, {{lang|gem-x-proto|lauxaz|italic=yes}} or {{lang|gem-x-proto|lauhaz|italic=yes}}, has given rise to words with a variety of meanings in various Germanic languages, including [[Anglo-Saxon]] {{lang|ang|lēah|italic=yes}}, 'meadow', [[Middle Low German]] {{lang|gml|lo|italic=yes}}, 'bush', and [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|laoh|italic=yes}}, {{lang|goh|löh|italic=yes}}, 'grove, copse, bush'; it is cognate with Latin {{lang|la|lūcus|italic=yes}}, 'sacred grove'.&lt;ref name="De Vries 352"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orel (2003:238).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RINGE-90"&gt;Ringe (2006:90).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandinavian placenames occur with the name of a deity compounded with {{lang|non|lundr|italic=yes}}, 'grove', or {{lang|non|viðr|italic=yes}}, 'wood'.&lt;ref name="De Vries 352"/&gt;

==Attestations==
Sacred trees and groves are widely attested among the records of the ancient Germanic peoples. Some scholars hypothesize that they even predated the development of temples (according to [[Rudolf Simek]], "there were sacred woods long before there were temples and altars"&lt;ref name="SIMEK-310"&gt;Simek (2007:310).&lt;/ref&gt;). In his ''Germania'', Tacitus says that the Germanic peoples "consecrate woods and groves and they apply the name of gods to that mysterious presence which they see only with the eye of devotion",&lt;ref name="RIVES-42"&gt;Birley (1999:42).&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus describes the grove of the [[Semnones]] and refers to a ''castum nemus'' (chaste grove) in which the image of the goddess [[Nerthus]] was hallowed, and other reports from the Roman period also refer to rites held by continental Germanic tribes in groves, including the sacrifices in forest clearings of survivors by the [[Cherusci]] after their victory at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], recounted by Tacitus in his ''Annals'' based on a report by Germanicus.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries (1970:351–52).&lt;/ref&gt; Such groves were sometimes dedicated to a particular deity: in addition to the case of Nerthus, there was a ''silva Herculi sacra'' ("wood sacred to Hercules", an ''[[interpretatio romana]]'') near the River [[Weser]], and the [[Semnones]] reportedly held their rituals in honor of the ''regnator omnium deus'' (god the ruler of all). The scholar of Germanic religion [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] noted that placenames such as Frølund (Denmark), and Ullunda, Frösvi, and Mjärdevi (Sweden), in which the name of a deity is compounded with words meaning "grove" or "wood", suggest a continuation of the same practice, but are found almost exclusively in eastern Scandinavia; however, there is a ''Coill Tomair'' recorded near [[Dublin]], an oak forest apparently sacred to [[Thor]].&lt;ref&gt;De Vries (1970:352–53).&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred groves leave few archaeological traces, but two such sites may have been identified, both in Sweden: under the church in [[Frösö]] in [[Jämtland]], and on a farm near [[Strängnäs]] in [[Södermanland County|Södermanland]].&lt;ref name="ANDERSON-195-199"&gt;Andersson (2006:195-199).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverence for individual trees among the Germanic peoples is a common theme in medieval Christian denunciations of backsliding into paganism.&lt;ref name="SIMEK-335"&gt;Simek (2007:335).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeVriestree&gt;De Vries (1970:350–51).&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as [[Donar's oak]] felled by [[St Boniface]], these were associated with particular gods, and the association of individual trees with saints can be seen as a continuation of the tradition into modern times.&lt;ref name=DeVriestree/&gt; There is also a Scandinavian folk tradition of farmers making small offerings to a [[Vörðr#Warden tree|"warden tree"]] that is regarded as exercising a protective function over the family and land.&lt;ref name=DeVriestree/&gt; However, there are no indications that the trees were regarded in the pagan period as the abode of gods and spirits. Scholars presume that publicly revered trees such as [[sacred tree at Uppsala|that at the temple in Uppsala]] were regarded as counterparts to the mythic world tree Yggdrasil.&lt;ref name="SIMEK-335"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeVriestree/&gt;

==Notable examples==
The present section divides particularly notable examples into texts discussing the religious activities of the ancient Germanic peoples involving trees and groves (''Germanic paganism'') and their appearance in the myths of the Germanic peoples, particularly the [[North Germanic peoples]] (''Germanic mythology'').

===Germanic paganism===
Sacred trees and groves are mentioned throughout the history of the ancient Germanic peoples, from their earliest attestations among Roman scribes to references made by medieval monks.

|Possibly northern Germany
|According to Tacitus, the Semnones, a populous and powerful Germanic people, allowed none to enter the grove without being fettered and blindfolded. If the blindfolded falls, they must crawl out of the grove. There they venerated what Tacitus refers to as "[[regnator omnium deus]]" and regularly gather to execute a human sacrifice.

|[[Donar's Oak]]
|Near [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]
|Donar's Oak was a sacred tree located in an unclear location around what is now the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. According to the 8th century ''Vita Bonifatii auctore Willibaldi'', the Anglo-Saxon missionary [[Saint Boniface]] and his retinue cut down the tree earlier the same century. Wood from the oak was then reportedly used to build a church at the site dedicated to [[Saint Peter]].

The '''Shanghai Ghetto''', formally known as the '''Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees''', was an area of approximately one square mile in the Hongkew district of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-occupied [[Shanghai]] (the southern [[Hongkou District|Hongkou]] and southwestern [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]] [[districts of Shanghai|districts]] of modern Shanghai). The area included the community around the [[Ohel Moshe Synagogue]] but about 23,000 of the city's [[Jewish refugees]] were restricted or relocated to the area from 1941 to 1945&lt;ref name=CJ&gt;[http://www.chinajewish.org/JewishHistory.htm Shanghai Jewish History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529021238/http://www.chinajewish.org/JewishHistory.htm |date=2010-05-29 }} (Shanghai Jewish Center)&lt;/ref&gt; by the ''Proclamation Concerning Restriction of Residence and Business of Stateless Refugees''. It was one of the poorest and most crowded areas of the city. Local Jewish families and American Jewish charities aided them with shelter, food, and clothing.&lt;ref name=CJ/&gt; The Japanese authorities increasingly stepped up restrictions, but the ghetto was not walled, and the local Chinese residents, whose living conditions were often as bad, did not leave.&lt;ref name=AW&gt;[http://www.asianweek.com/2003_01_31/arts_shanghai.html ''Shanghai Ghetto'' Shows a Hidden Piece of WWII History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604050337/http://www.asianweek.com/2003_01_31/arts_shanghai.html |date=2011-06-04 }} By Kimberly Chun (AsianWeek)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GP&gt;[http://www.goletapublishing.com/jstamps/0302-3.htm The Jews of Shanghai: The War Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308053343/http://www.goletapublishing.com/jstamps/0302-3.htm |date=2005-03-08 }}, Murray Frost.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Jews in 1930s Germany ===
{{main article|History of the Jews in Germany}}

At the end of the 1920s, most German Jews were loyal to Germany, assimilated and relatively prosperous. They served in the German army and contributed to every field of German science, business and culture. After the [[Nazis]] were elected to power in 1933, the state-sponsored [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] persecution such as the [[Nuremberg Laws]] (1935) and the [[Kristallnacht]] (1938) drove masses of German Jews to seek asylum abroad, but as [[Chaim Weizmann]] wrote in 1936, "The world seemed to be divided into two parts—those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter."&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Guardian'', May 23, 1936, cited in A.J. Sherman, ''Island Refuge, Britain and the Refugees from the Third Reich, 1933–1939'', (London, Elek Books Ltd, 1973), p.112, also in [http://christianactionforisrael.org/antiholo/evian/evian.html The Evian Conference — Hitler's Green Light for Genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827082632/http://christianactionforisrael.org/antiholo/evian/evian.html |date=2013-08-27 }} by Annette Shaw&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evian Conference]] demonstrated that by the end of the 1930s it was almost impossible to find a destination open for Jewish immigration.

According to Dana Janklowicz-Mann:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Jewish men were being picked up and put into [[concentration camp]]s. They were told you have ''X'' amount of time to leave—two weeks, a month—if you can find a country that will take you. Outside, their wives and friends were struggling to get a passport, a visa, anything to help them get out. But embassies were closing their doors all over, and countries, including the [[United States]], were closing their borders. ... It started as a rumor in [[Vienna]]...  ‘There’s a place you can go where you don’t need a visa. They have free entry.’ It just spread like fire and whoever could, went for it.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=9354 Europe’s Harms to China’s Arms] by Sally Ogle Davis and Ivor Davis (''Jewish Journal'') October 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shanghai after 1937 ===
{{main article|Reformed Government of the Republic of China|History of the Jews in China}}

The [[Shanghai International Settlement|International Settlement]] of Shanghai was established by the [[Treaty of Nanking]]. Police, jurisdiction and passport control were implemented by the foreign autonomous board. Under the [[Unequal Treaties]] between China and European countries, visas were only required to book tickets departing from Europe.

Following the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937, the city was [[military occupation|occupied]] by the army of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], and the port began to allow entry without visa or passport. By the time when most German Jews arrived, two other Jewish communities had already settled in the city: the wealthy [[Baghdadi Jews]], including the [[Kadoorie family|Kadoorie]] and [[Sassoon family|Sassoon]] families, and the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]]. The last ones fled the [[Russian Empire]] because of anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s pushed by the tsarist regime and counter-revolutionary armies as well as the class struggle manifested by the Bolsheviks. They had formed the [[Harbin Russians|Russian community in Harbin]], then the [[Shanghai Russians|Russian community in Shanghai]].

=== Chiune Sugihara, Tadeusz Romer, and Ho Feng Shan ===
Many in the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish community were saved by [[Chiune Sugihara]], the Japanese consul in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]. They managed to flee across the vast territory of Russia by train to [[Vladivostok]] and then by boat to [[Kobe]] in Japan. The refugees in number of 2,185 arrived in Japan from August 1940 to June 1941. [[Tadeusz Romer]], the Polish ambassador in [[Tokyo]], had managed to get transit visas in Japan, asylum visas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, immigration certificates to Palestine, and immigrant visas to the United States and some Latin American countries. Finally, Tadeusz Romer arrived in [[Shanghai]] on November 1, 1941, to continue the action for Jewish refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[Krzysztof Kacperek] |url=http://www.polish-jewish-heritage.org/Pol/maj_03_Romer_pomogal_Zydom.htm |title=Kanadyjska Fundacja Dziedzictwa Polsko-Żydowskiego - Tadeusza Romera Pomoc Żydom Polskim na Dalekim Wschodzie |publisher=Polish-jewish-heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those saved in the Shanghai Ghetto were leaders and students of [[Mir Yeshiva (Poland)|Mir yeshiva]], the only [[yeshiva]] in occupied Europe to survive [[the Holocaust]].

Similarly, thousands of Austrian Jews were saved by the Chinese consul-general in Vienna [[Ho Feng Shan]], who issued visas during 1938-1940 against the orders of his superior the Chinese ambassador in Berlin, Chen Jie.

The refugees who managed to purchase tickets for luxurious Italian and Japanese cruise steamships departing from [[Genoa]] later described their three-week journey with plenty of food and entertainment—between persecution in Germany and squalid ghetto in Shanghai—as surreal. Some passengers attempted to make unscheduled departures in [[Egypt]], hoping to smuggle themselves into the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].

The first German Jewish refugees—twenty-six families, among them five well-known physicians—had already arrived in Shanghai by November 1933. By the spring of 1934, there were reportedly eighty refugee physicians, surgeons, and dentists in China. On August 15, 1938, the first Jewish refugees from [[Anschluss]] Austria arrived by Italian ship. Most of the refugees arrived after [[Kristallnacht]]. During the refugee flight to Shanghai between November 1938 and June 1941, the total number of arrivals by sea and land has been estimated at 1,374 in 1938; 12,089 in 1939; 1,988 in 1940; and 4,000 in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203234.pdf |title=Avraham Altman and Irene Eber.

Added to this mix were approximately 1,000 Polish Jews in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ISS/ISS2201/ISS2201e.pdf |title=Anthony Hughes.

In late 1940, they obtained visas from [[Chiune Sugihara]], the Japanese consul in [[Kaunas]], to travel from Keidan, then [[Lithuanian SSR]], via [[Siberia]] and [[Vladivostok]] to [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinajewish.org/JewishHistory.htm Shanghai Jewish History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813151839/http://www.chinajewish.org/JewishHistory.htm |date=August 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1941 the Japanese moved this group and most of others on to the Shanghai Ghetto in order to consolidate the Jews under their control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/ftinterface?content=a777426519&amp;rt=0&amp;format=pdf |title=Pamela Shatzkes.

Finally, a wave of more than 18,000 [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Poland]] immigrated to Shanghai until the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] by Japan in December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/magazine/la-tm-shanghai3jan15,0,1838881.story?coll=la-home-magazine |title=Return of a Shanghai Jew |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2006-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ohel Moshe Synagogue served as a religious center for the Russian Jewish community since 1907 (currently the [[Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum]], located at 62 Changyang Road, Hongkou District). In April 1941, a modern Ashkenazic Jewish synagogue was built (called the New Synagogue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;pg=PA517&amp;lpg=PA517&amp;dq=kaifeng+jin+seven+names+chinese&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uouH1OoyOB&amp;sig=aEACjVPc3Ck7OCQIfc4NIQ0Doao&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=XAskSs6lMsiR_Qbszr3CBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA163,^ |title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas.

Much needed aid was provided by International Committee for European Immigrants (IC),  established by [[Victor Sassoon]] and [[Paul Komor]], a Hungarian businessman, and Committee for the Assistance of European Jewish Refugees (CFA), founded by [[Kadoorie|Horace Kadoorie]], under the direction of Michael Speelman. These organizations prepared the housing in Hongkou, a relatively cheap suburb compared with the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] or the [[Shanghai French Concession]]. They were accommodated in shabby apartments and six camps in a former school.
The Japanese occupiers of Shanghai regarded German Jews as "[[stateless person]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport23.html |title=Péter Vámos.

In 1943, the occupying Japanese army required these 18,000 Jews to relocate to a 3/4 square mile area of Shanghai's Hongkou district where many lived in group homes called "Heime" or "Little Vienna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200511/11/eng20051111_220515.html |title=Feature: Former Jewish refugees revisit Shanghai Ark |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees ==
[[File:Girls of the Shanghai Ghetto.png|thumb|A Jewish girl and her Chinese friends in the Shanghai Ghetto, from the collection of the [[Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum]]]]
[[File:119-121 Huoshan Rd. in Shanghai Hongkew Ghetto.JPG|thumb|Former site of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]

The authorities were unprepared for massive immigration and the arriving refugees faced harsh conditions in the impoverished Hongkou District: 10 per room, near-starvation, disastrous sanitation and scant employment.

The Baghdadis and later the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC) provided some assistance with the housing and food problems. Faced with language barriers, extreme poverty, rampant disease and isolation, the refugees were able to make the transition from being supported by welfare agencies to establishing a functioning community. Jewish cultural life flourished: schools were established, newspapers were published, theaters produced plays, sports teams participated in training and competitions, and even cabarets thrived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gluckman.com/ShanghaiJewsChina.html The Ghosts of Shanghai] by Ron Gluckman&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Pearl Harbor (1941–1943) ===
After Japanese forces attacked [[Pearl Harbor]], the wealthy [[Baghdadi Jews]] (many of whom were British subjects) were interned, and American charitable funds ceased.  As communication with the US was banned and broken, [[unemployment]] and [[inflation]] intensified and times got harder for the refugees.

The JDC liaison [[Laura Margolis Jarblum|Laura Margolis]], who came to Shanghai, attempted to stabilize the situation by getting permission from the Japanese authorities to continue her fundraising effort, turning for assistance to the Russian Jews who arrived before 1937 and were exempt from the new restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.sympatico.ca/mighty1/special/laura.htm Special Tributes.

=== Further restrictions (1943–1945) ===
As World War II intensified, the Nazis stepped up pressure on Japan to hand over the Shanghai Jews. While the Nazis regarded their Japanese allies as "[[Honorary Aryans]]", they were determined that the [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] also be applied to the Jews in Shanghai. [[Warren Kozak]] describes the episode when the Japanese military governor of the city sent for the Jewish community leaders. The delegation included Amshinover [[rabbi]] [[Shimon Sholom Kalish]]. The Japanese governor was curious and asked "Why do the Germans hate you so much?"

&lt;blockquote&gt;Without hesitation and knowing the fate of his community hung on his answer, Reb Kalish told the translator (in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]): "''Zugim weil wir senen orientalim''—Tell him [the Germans hate us] because we are [[Oriental]]s." The governor, whose face had been stern throughout the confrontation, broke into a slight smile. In spite of the military alliance, he did not accede to the German demand and the Shanghai Jews were never handed over.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rabbi of 84th Street: The Extraordinary Life of Haskel Besser'' by Warren Kozak (HarperCollins, 2004) {{ISBN|0-06-051101-X}} p.177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:19430218 shanghai herald ghetto restrictions.jpg|thumb|"Residences, Businesses of City's Stateless Refugess Limited to Restricted Sector". (''[[Shanghai Herald]]'' newspaper, February 18, 1943)]]
According to another rabbi who was present there, Reb Kalish' answer was "They hate us because we are short and dark-haired." ''Orientalim'' was not likely to have been said because the word is an Israeli academic term in modern Hebrew, not a word in classical Yiddish or Hebrew.

On November 15, 1942, the idea of a restricted ghetto was approved, which was after the visit of Shanghai by Josef Meisinger. On February 18, 1943, the Japanese authorities declared a "Designated Area for Stateless Refugees" and ordered those who arrived after 1937 to move their residences and businesses within it by May 18, three months later. The stateless refugees needed permission from the Japanese to dispose of their property; others needed permission to move into the ghetto.&lt;ref name=AW/&gt; The English version of the order read:

{{blockquote|The designated area is bordered on the west by the line connecting {{abbr|Chaoufoong|Present-day Gaoyang Road (高阳路)}}, {{abbr|Muirhead|Present-day Haimen Road (海门路)}}, and {{abbr|Dent|Present-day Dantu Road (丹徒路)}} Roads; on the east by [[Yangtzepoo Creek]]; on the south by the line connecting {{abbr|East Seward|Present-day Dongchangzhi Rd (东长治路)}}, {{abbr|Muirhead|Present-day Haimen Road (海门路)}}, and {{abbr|Wayside|Huoshan Rd (霍山路)}} Roads; and on the North by the {{abbr|boundary|At about 31°16′42″ N}} of the [[Shanghai International Settlement|International Settlement]].{{refn|English decree cited by ''Exil Shanghai'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exil-shanghai.de/ghetto.html |title=Hongkou, der Ghettobezirk in Shanghai |trans-title=Hongkou, the Ghetto District in Shanghai|language=German |date=2001 |accessdate=15 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020206183231/http://exil-shanghai.de/ghetto.html |archivedate=6 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern forms of the old street names according to French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Paul|title=The Old Shanghai: A–Z|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|date=2010|isbn=9789888028894}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

While this area was not walled or surrounded with barbed wire, it was patrolled and a [[curfew]] enforced in its precincts. Food was rationed, and everyone needed passes to enter or leave the ghetto.&lt;ref name=AW /&gt;

[[File:Polish Jew's passport registration inside the ghetto1943.jpg|thumb|Polish Jew's passport registration inside the ghetto (1943)]]

According to Dr. David Kranzler,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, about half of the approximately 16,000 refugees, who had overcome great obstacles and had found a means of livelihood and residence outside the 'designated area' were forced to leave their homes and businesses for a second time and to relocate into a crowded, squalid area of less than one square mile with its own population of an estimated 100,000 Chinese and 8,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;''Japanese, Nazis and Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community in Shanghai, 1938–1945'' by David Kranzler, p.491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although a few temporary passes were issued to work and to 16 students of St. Francis Xavier College outside the ghetto, these were granted arbitrarily and were severely curtailed after the first year. But the fact that the Chinese did not leave the Hongkou ghetto meant the Jews were not isolated. Nevertheless, economic conditions worsened; psychological adjustment to ghettoization was difficult; the winter of 1943 was severe and hunger was widespread.&lt;ref name=GP /&gt;

The US air raids on Shanghai began in 1944. There were no bomb shelters in Hongkou as the water table was close to the surface.  The most devastating raid started on July 17, 1945, and was the first attack on Hongkou. The bombings by the US 7th Air Force continued daily until the Atomic Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, which ended the air raids.

Refugees in the ghetto, improvised their own shelters, with one family surviving the  bombing under a bed with a second mattress on top, mounted on two desks.  Thirty-eight refugees and hundreds of Chinese were killed in the 17 July raid.&lt;ref name="Voticky 2010 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Voticky | first=Anka | title=Knocking on every door | publisher=The Azrieli Foundation | location=Toronto | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-897470-20-6 | page=Kindle loc 1299–1317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jews of the Shanghai ghetto took part in the [[resistance movement]]. They participated in an underground network to obtain and circulate information and were involved in some minor sabotage and in providing assistance to downed Allied aircrews.&lt;ref name=GP /&gt;  In addition, over 90% of the residents were unable to leave the ghetto until after the liberation in August 1945.

== After liberation ==
The ghetto was officially liberated on September 3, 1945, after some delay to allow [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s army to take political credit for the liberation of Shanghai. With the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 and the fall of Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, almost all the Shanghai ghetto Jews left. By 1957, only 100 remained, and today only a few may still live there.&lt;ref name=GP/&gt;

The [[Government of Israel]] bestowed the honor of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] to [[Chiune Sugihara]] in 1985 and to [[Ho Feng Shan]] in 2001.

Since the establishment of [[China–Israel relations|diplomatic relations between Israel and China]] in 1992, the connection between the Jewish people and [[Shanghai]] has been recognised in various ways. In 2007, the Israeli consulate-general in Shanghai donated 660,000 [[Renminbi|Yuan]], provided by 26 Israeli companies, to community projects in [[Hongkou District]], in recognition of the safe harbour provided by the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;China News Agency. 2006-06-07 ''[http://world.people.com.cn/GB/1029/42361/5831463.html 以色列企业捐款上海 感谢二战时接纳犹太难民] (Israeli companies donate to Shanghai - gratitute for accepting Jewish refugees in World War II)''.

'''Steve "Wildman" Brill''' is an American [[naturalist]], [[environmental educator]] and [[author]]. He gained notoriety in 1986, when he was arrested in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] for eating a dandelion.

==Education==
Brill was a [[pre-med]] student at [[George Washington University]].&lt;ref name="ChicTrib"/&gt; He later changed his major to psychology, but learned botany, foraging, and gourmet vegan cooking on his own, after college.&lt;ref name="ChicTrib"&gt; Clark, Kenneth (September 23 1985) "Wild Man", ''Chicago Tribune'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Brill has been taking people on nature walks in New York's Central Park, and parks throughout the Greater NY area, since 1982.&lt;ref name="1986 news report"/&gt; Brill says his tours had the approval of the parks department until they began refusing to issue him a [[weed]]-picking permit in 1983.&lt;ref name="1986 news report"/&gt; He gained notoriety in 1986 when he was arrested by two undercover park rangers and charged with [[criminal mischief]] after allegedly eating a [[dandelion]] he had picked in New York's Central Park.&lt;ref name="1986 news report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harney|first=James|title=Don't Eat The Dandelions, Arrested Ecologist Ordered|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-04-03/news/8601200363_1_dandelions-central-park-rangers|accessdate=26 October 2011|newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=3 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brill was released with a "desk-appearance ticket" pending trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brill|first=Steve|title=Wild Foods and the Environment|url=http://www.rawfoodsnewsmagazine.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=28|publisher=Raw Foods News Magazine|accessdate=26 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626063316/http://www.rawfoodsnewsmagazine.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=28|archivedate=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brill, the [[New York City Parks Department]] "dropped the charges and hired me to lead the same tours I was busted for" until a change in park administration in 1990.&lt;ref name="gotham"&gt; Kharakh, Ben (August 13, 2007) [http://gothamist.com/2007/08/13/the_wildman_ste.php The Wildman: Steve Brill, Naturalist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515213743/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/13/the_wildman_ste.php |date=2012-05-15 }} ''Gothamist'', retrieved March 26 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1994, Brill published his book: ''Identifying and Harvesting Edible and Medicinal Plants in Wild (and Not So Wild) Places'' which explains how to identify and forage for edible or [[medicinal plants]].&lt;ref&gt; Steve Brill; Evelyn Dean, (1994) New York : Hearst Books, [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=Steve+Brill] retrieved March 26 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Brill published ''The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook: A Forager's Culinary Guide''; a 500 recipe wild and natural foods cookbook.&lt;ref&gt; Brill, Steve (2002) Boston, Mass. : Harvard Common Press [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=Steve+Brill] retrieved March 26 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he released his self-published "Shoots and Greens of Early Spring in Northeastern North America, and in 2014, he released his self-published "Foraging with Kids."
  
In 2011, Brill released an [[iPhone]] app called ''Wild Edibles Forage'' with Winterroot, which gives information on "250 common North American plants".&lt;ref&gt; Miller, Jenny (April 8, 2011) [http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2011/04/a_wild_new_app_for_foragers.html Plants App Hits iPhones] Grubb Street New York, ''New York'' magazine, retrieved March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They also created an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version. Both applications feature Brill's edible plant photos, his botanical illustrations, and hundreds of his vegan whole-foods recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Driver, Blake (October 31 2011)[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2097391,00.html Pick Pockets] ''Time'' (Vol. 178, No. 17|2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill is reported to be the foremost expert in The Northeast [[forage|foraging]] and works with nature centers, schools, day camps, libraries, parks departments, land trusts, nature centers, museums, health food stores, farmer's markets, teaching farms, and other organizations, to educate the public on foraging in the Northeastern US. Many of his tours are co-led by his foraging expert daughter, Violet Brill (born 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Mathew, Kirsten (2012)[http://www.nypost.com/p/lifestyle/food/the_man_who_ate_new_york_wildman_DEWLVkIaYMrfQMWR6xl7mL The Man Who Ate New York: Wildman Steve Brill] ''New York Post'', retrieved March 26 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surrogate''' (from [[Latin language|Lat.]] ''surrogare'', to substitute for), a deputy of a [[bishop]] or an [[ecclesiastical judge]], acting in the absence of his principal and strictly bound by the authority of the latter.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Surrogate |volume=26 |page=141 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon 128 of the canons of 1603 lays down the qualifications necessary for the office of surrogate and canon 123 the regulations for the appointment to the office. At present the chief duty of a surrogate in England is the granting of marriage licences, but judgments of the arches court of [[Canterbury]] have been delivered by a surrogate in the absence of the official principal.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Image:Temple relief of king Arqamani from Dakka by Dennis C. Jarvis.jpg|thumb|Relief depicting the Kushite king Arkamani presenting an offering to the gods]]
'''Ad-Dakka''' ([[Arabic language|Arab]]: الدكة, also el-Dakka, [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: Pselqet, [[Greek language|Greek]]: Pselchis) was a place in [[Lower Nubia]]. It is the site of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greco-Roman]] '''Temple of Dakka''', dedicated to [[Thoth]], the god of wisdom in the [[Egyptian pantheon|ancient Egyptian pantheon]]. The temple was initially a small one-room shrine or chapel, first begun in the 3rd century BC by a Meroitic king named [[Arqamani]] (or Ergamenes II) in collaboration with [[Ptolemy IV]] who added an antechamber and a gate structure.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy IX]] "subsequently enlarged the temple by adding a [[pronaos]] with two rows of probably three columns."&lt;ref name="Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.65"&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; During the Roman period, the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius further enlarged the structure with "the addition, at the rear, of a second sanctuary as well as inner and outer enclosure walls with a large pylon. The sanctuary contained a granite naos."&lt;ref name="Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.65"/&gt; The Temple of Dakka was transformed into a temple fortress by the Romans and surrounded by a stone wall, 270 by 444 metres long, with an entrance along the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, Oxford University Press, 1999. p.244&lt;/ref&gt; 

A large dromos leads to the [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]], which formed the entrance to the temple. Each of the pylon's towers is decorated in high relief and bears numerous graffiti from visitors, mostly in Greek but some in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Meroitic script]].{{cn|date=September 2013}} There are reliefs of cows offered as gifts to the god Thoth carved into the [[Naos (hieroglyph)|naos]] of the Temple of Dakka.&lt;ref&gt;László Török, The Image of the Ordered World in Ancient Nubian Art, Brill, 2002. p.260&lt;/ref&gt; While the temple of Dakka was similar architecturally to the temple of [[Wadi es-Sebua]], it lacked a front courtyard of [[sphinx]]es; however, its 12-metre-high pylon is in near perfect condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/egypt/wadi_seboua01.htm|title= Wadi es-Seboua: Temple of Dakka|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 55-metre-long processional approach ran from the temple's pylon to a cult terrace at the Nile.&lt;ref name="Arnold p.244"&gt;Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christian period of Egypt, the facade of the pronaos was converted for use into a church, and Christian paintings were still visible here in the 20th century before the temple was enveloped by the Nile floods.{{cn|date=September 2013}} 

The temple of Dakka collapsed in 1908–1909 and was subsequently rebuilt by [[Alessandro Barsanti]].&lt;ref name="Arnold p.244"/&gt;

==Relocation of Temple==
During the construction of the [[Aswan dam]] in the 1960s, the temple was dismantled and moved to the site of [[Wadi es-Sebua]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2000). ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its removal, some reused stone blocks from [[Thutmose III]], [[Seti I]] and [[Merneptah]] were discovered which originated from an earlier [[New Kingdom]] structure in or near [[Kubban]].&lt;ref name="Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.65"/&gt; The temple's pylon is now separated from the remainder of the temple due to the missing enclosure walls of the open court.

The [[Temple of Maharraqa]] was also moved and rebuilt at the [[New Wadi es-Sebua]] temple complex area.

'''''The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasonry, and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesus''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=ISBN+0-099-69941-9&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=0099699419 |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1996 book by [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] and [[Robert Lomas]].  The authors, both [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]s, present a theory of the origins of [[Freemasonry]] as part of their "true story" of the [[historical Jesus]] and the original [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]].

==Key points in theory==

The authors claim that their work proves the following:
* Freemasonry can trace its roots to the death of the Egyptian king [[Seqenenre Tao|Sequenenre]] in 1570 B.C.  at the hands of the [[Hyksos]]. 
* [[Moses]] merged this event with [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] mythology, symbols and philosophy, to create a putative 'royal line'. 
* [[Solomon]] incorporated these symbols into his [[Solomon's Temple|temple]] 
* [[Jesus]] and the [[Qumran]] community used a ritual based on this story  
* The early [[History of the Catholic Church|Roman Church]] effectively suppressed the original beliefs of this [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]]. 
* The [[Knights Templar]], discovering the Qumran communities' records in the vaults under the Temple in Jerusalem, transported them to [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]]. 
* When Scotland became unsafe for the Templars, they incorporated their beliefs and history into the rituals of [[Freemasonry]] as it is known today.

==Synopsis==

Knight and Lomas begin by quoting [[Henry Ford]], who was a Freemason,&lt;ref&gt;http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/ford_h/ford_h.html&lt;/ref&gt; as saying "all history is bunk". They express the belief that, though Ford's statement may be abrupt, it is accurate, as history is often not a completely accurate and comprehensive account of facts, but only what the dominant or orthodox view of the time has recorded for posterity.

The authors make their case through the use of [[dialectic]]s.  The technique requires the reader to accept a basic premise, and then proceeds in a logical order; requiring the reader to weigh the merit of each step on the way to a conclusion.  If the initial premise, and each of the steps in logic towards the conclusion have merit, the conclusion can represent a legitimate, possible explanation.

The authors of The Hiram Key propose a possible sequence of events that led to modern [[Freemasonry]], although much of their narrative has been debated by historians and other researchers. A criticism of their approach by those unfamiliar with the science of [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|"dialectical progression"]] is that the authors have gathered irrelevant and often unevidenced 'facts' to arrive at an equally unproven theory.  Even those familiar with the application of dialectics may concede that the conclusion of such logic is only as good as its weakest link.  All Historical study is based on dialectical appraisal of evidence, and all sources of information subject to interpretation as the "weakest link."

Knight and Lomas are not professional historians nor have they any qualifications in history or research, and their case is open to the criticism that they accept references that fit their theory and reject those that conflict with it.  .

Nonetheless they argue in the book that the foundations of the [[Christian]] religion are a distortion by the early [[Roman Catholic Church]] of the teachings of the real Jesus and his followers.  They claim to have found in Freemasonry a new 'key' to unlock the secrets of civilization. This key is also the key to the origins of Christianity and, they assert, proves that many of the beliefs of modern Religion may well have come to be, at least partly, through imprecise historical interpretation.

Knight and Lomas state that one of the main motivations in writing the book stemmed from a desire to ascertain the origins of Freemasonry, following their own experiences of being initiated into it. Did it arrive, fully formed at the foundation of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] on 24 June 1717, or was that the first public acknowledgement of something much older?

One widely held theory is that Freemasonry evolved out of [[guild]]s of [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]]. Traditional [[Masonic ritual]] claims that one of the first Freemasons was [[Hiram Abiff]], a widow's son from the tribe of [[Naphtali]], who was the Architect of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's Temple]]. His name has never been recorded as such historically, although there is a similar character in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], who is not named, but is described as a widow's son, in the First Book of Kings.

Although not apparently named in some translations of the bible, others, such as the [[Coverdale Bible|Coverdale]] translation and the original [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] translation do indeed refer to him as "Hiram Abiff" or as "Huram Abi". The word "abi" is translated as "father" or "my father" in other translations whilst the Luther and Coverdale translations treated it as a personal name. The [[Jewish English Bible translations|Jewish Study Bible]] suggests that the word "father" is an honorific title applied to a skilled craftsman. The use of "abu" meaning "father" as an honorific is still used in the Middle East today, hence "Abukir" named after "Father" or Saint Cyril.

The book's authors claim that the stonemason-origin theory could be discounted because it had so many apparent fallacies. Why would powerful and rich people have been attracted to join a fraternity that came from poor and uneducated stonemasons' Guilds? The theory of Freemasonry originating in London in 1717 is also regarded as unlikely, because there are earlier mentions of Freemasonry in other locations. The authors concluded that Freemasonry was actually as old as it claimed in its traditional ritual, dating back to the building of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]

Knight and Lomax claim to have analysed their sources rigorously, including the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]], ancient [[Judaism|Jewish]] texts, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Gnostic Gospels]], and Masonic rituals to support their conclusions.  They note the global significance of [[religion]] and that any major refutation of commonly held beliefs would meet resistance from the established and orthodox authorities in any particular religion.  In support of that point Knight and Lomax cite the treatment of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].They note that, 40 years after their discovery, only about half of the available material had ever been published or made available for independent review.  It was not until 1991 that public access restrictions were lifted.  The scrolls contained various versions of Biblical texts, all of which were more than 1000 years older than the oldest surviving Hebrew texts that were produced by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]] in AD 1008.  The texts of these scrolls are believed by the authors to have been written by ancestors of the same [[Qumran]] community of the Judaean hills that found them.  The authors also believe that the Qumran Community were [[Essenes]], and that they and the [[Mandaeism|Nasoreans]] and the original Jerusalem Church were all one and the same.  That is, the ancient Qumranians were the first Christians.

They decided that the story of Hiram Abiff was actually based on the initiation ceremonies of the ancient kings of Egypt. They also came to the conclusion, after analysis of the New Testament, the Gnostic Gospels, and Masonic ritual, that Jesus and the original Christians were thoroughly different from what the Roman Catholic Church and orthodox Christianity has taught they were.

The authors believe that Jesus did not claim to be divine, but was instead a [[messiah]] in the Jewish sense of the term, a good man and a freedom fighter, trying to liberate the Jews from [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation.

The authors do not claim that the [[Christianity]] is incompatible with the ideals and goals of Freemasonry.  Neither do they claim that the [[Judaism|Jewish Faith]] or the [[Islam|Muslim]] faith or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] faith are incompatible with the tenets of Freemasonry.  Although The Hiram Key highlights some inconsistent historical references within various [[dogma]]s, they do not claim dogma to be devoid of value to humanity.  The book is more an examination of historical references rather than an examination of religion.

Jesus did not claim to work [[miracle]]s, according to the authors. When Jesus claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead, it was intended as an [[Allegory|allegorical]] reference; followers were referred to as the "living" and others were referred to as the "dead" in certain Jewish [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] of the time. Similarly, Jesus' turning water into wine merely meant elevating people to a higher status within the framework of the sect.

The authors believe that Jesus' sect, the Jerusalem Church, operated some kind of "quasi-Masonic" initiation ceremonies and develop that line of thought to claim that Jesus was thus, in a sense, a Freemason.

In Chapter 5 of the Hiram Key, ''Jesus Christ: Man, God, Myth, or Freemason?'', the authors state: "We realise that this is a statement that will offend many Christians, and particularly many Roman Catholics," but the conclusion they came to, based upon historical context derived outside the accepted religious context, was that Jesus was a Freemason.

==Controversy==

The book contains a radical [[hypothesis]] about the origins of Freemasonry, seeking to demonstrate a heritage back through the [[Knights Templar]] to the Jerusalem Church and [[New Kingdom|Pharaoic]] [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], claiming to draw on a wide range of material to support this hypothesis.

The work has been subject to criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/reviews/hiram_key.html |title=The Hiram Key, a few observations |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; from within the established body of masonic-research, based on:

*Creeping assertion - caveats on statements are reduced as the statements are used as foundation for further development.
*Lack of critical assessment of sources.
*Use of symbolic ritual as a statement of historic fact.

[[Quatuor Coronati Lodge|Quatuor Coronati Lodge No 2067]] the principal Lodge of Masonic research under the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], has criticised the book as [[Pseudohistory]],&lt;ref&gt;Neville Barker Cryer, ''Ars Quatuor Coronatorum'', Volume 109, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and some Masonic libraries categorise the volume as [[fiction]].

Reviews of the work are commonly critical; publishers of this criticism include:

'''Tishtrya'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; (Tištrya) or [[Roozahang]] is the [[Avestan language]] name of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] benevolent divinity associated with life-bringing rainfall and fertility. Tishtrya is '''Tir''' in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] origin.

In a hymn of the [[Avesta]] (incorporated by [[Ferdowsi]], with due acknowledgement, in the [[Shahnameh]]), Tishtrya is involved in a cosmic struggle against the drought-bringing demon [[Apaosha]]. According to the myth, in the form of a [[White horse (mythology)|pure white horse]] the god did battle with the demon who, in contrast, had assumed the form of a terrifying black horse. Apaosa soon gained the upper hand over Tishtrya, who was weakened from the lack of sufficient prayers and sacrifices from humankind. The [[yazata]] proceeded to call upon the Creator [[Ahura Mazda]], who himself then intervened by offering a sacrifice to the overwhelmed god. Infused with the power brought by this sacrifice, Tishtrya was able to overcome Apaosa, and his rains were able to flow to the parched fields and pastures unabated by drought. This story serves to underscore the importance of votive offerings and sacrifice in religious tradition.

In the [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian religious calendar]], the 13th day of the month and the 4th month of the year are dedicated to Tishtrya/Tir, and hence named after the entity. In the [[Iranian calendar|Iranian civil calendar]], which inherits its month names from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 4th month is likewise named Tir.

During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] period, Tishtrya was conflated with Semitic Nabu-*Tiri, and thus came to be associated with the Dog Star, [[Sirius]]. The [[Tiregan]] festival, previously associated with *Tiri (a reconstructed name), was likewise transferred to Tishtrya. During the Hellenic period, Tishtrya came to be associated with [[Pythia]]n [[Apollo]], patron of [[Delphi]], and thus a divinity of oracles.

==The other names==

===In Persian===
The other names of Tishtrya in Persian is Tishter, [[Roozahang]], Shabahang and Varahang.&lt;ref&gt;[[محمدتقی بهار]]، [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2_N6WLdkppoNVg4a2gwMnhKejA/view?usp=drive_web کتاب پژوهشی در اساطیر ایران]، پانویس صفحه 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sanchi Great Stupa Torana.jpg|thumb|right|Torana of [[Sanchi Stupa]]. The stupa dates to the period of the [[Mauryan Empire]] (3rd century BC), but the torana itself dates to the [[Satavahana]] period, in the 1st century CE. The site is now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]

'''''Torana''''' is a free-standing ornamental or arched gateway for ceremonial purposes seen in the [[Hindu architecture|Hindu]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]] architecture of the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Southeast Asia]] and parts of [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000085631|title=Toraṇa {{!}} Grove Art|language=en|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000085631|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning and uses of ''torana''==
''Torana'' is a sacred or honorific gateway in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[architecture]]. Its typical form is a projecting cross-piece resting on two uprights or posts. It is made of [[wood]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and the cross-piece is generally of three bars placed one on the top of the other; both cross-piece and posts are usually sculpted.

Toranas are associated with Buddhist [[stupa]]s like the ''Great Stupa'' in [[Sanchi]], as well as with Jain and Hindu structures, and also with several secular structures. Symbolic toranas can also be made of flowers and even leaves and hung over the doors and at entrances, particularly in Western and Southern India. They are believed to bring good fortune and signify auspicious and festive occasions. They can also serve didactic and narrative purposes or be erected to mark the victory of a king.&lt;ref&gt;Parul Pandya Dhar, (2010). ''The Torana in Indian and Southeast Asian Architecture,'' (New Delhi: D K Printworld,).&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Vesak|Vesak festival]] of [[Sri Lanka]] it is a tradition to erect electrically illuminated colorful Vesak toranas in public places. These decorations are temporary installations which remain in public display for couple of weeks starting from the day of [[Vesak]].

Toranas are also referred to as vandanamalikas. There are many different types of toranas - dvara-toranas, patra-toranas, ratne-toranas and so on. These are mentioned in medieval Indian architectural treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Parul Pandya Dhar (2010): ''The Torana in Indian and Southeast Asian Architecture''. New Delhi: D K Printworld. {{ISBN|978-8124605349}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest archaeological evidence of Torana dates back to  [[Sanchi]] [[stupa]] built by [[Mauryan Empire]] in 3rd century BCE. The [[Sanchi]] torana and architecture is imitation of timber and brick construction in stone, which was popular feature in Indian architecture before 3rd century BCE.

Both Chinese [[paifang]] gateways and Japanese [[torii]] gateways have been derived from the Indian torana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gs1sFlMGy2AC&amp;pg=PA17]&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of all three are similar, but they generally differ based on their respective architectural styles, such as having multiple tiered and arched roofs and various "supporting posts" that are prevalent in East Asian architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China's old dwellings|author=Ronald G. Knapp|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=2000|page=85|ISBN=0-8248-2214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frommer's China|author1=Simon Foster |author2=Jen Lin-Liu |author3=Sharon Owyang |author4=Sherisse Pham |author5=Beth Reiber |author6=Lee Wing-sze |publisher=[[Frommers]]|year=2010|page=435|isbn=0-470-52658-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean gateway is also related to the Japanese torii, and similar structures exist in Thailand.

A great deal of cultural exchange between these countries took place in ancient times, so that many Indian, Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese cultural practices are related.  For example, [[Benzaiten]] is a Japanese name for the Hindu goddess [[Saraswati]], and the ancient [[Siddhaṃ script]], which disappeared from India by 1200 CE, is still written by monks in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In [[Kalinga architecture]] we can see the Toran in many temples built from the 7th to 12th centuries. [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], [[Rajarani Temple]] and [[Mukteshvara Temple, Bhubaneswar|Mukteswar Temple]] are the few example of Kalinga architecture having torana.

In [[Gujarat]], several ''Torana''s built during reign of [[Chaulukya dynasty]] (10th-12th century). They were mostly associated with temples.&lt;ref name="Senpramanik 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Senpramanik | first=Shushmita | title=TORAN ARCHITECTURE OF GUJARAT | website=Academia.edu | date=2015-08-03 | url=https://www.academia.edu/22423848/TORAN_ARCHITECTURE_OF_GUJARAT | language=en | access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|The highest heaven from [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrations to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]
'''Trinitarian Universalism''' is a variant of belief in [[universal salvation]], the belief that every person will be saved, that also held the [[Christianity|Christian]] belief in [[Trinity|Trinitarianism]] (as opposed to, or contrasted with, liberal [[Unitarianism]] which is more usually associated with [[Unitarian Universalism]]).  It was particularly associated with an ex-Methodist New England minister, [[John Murray (minister)|John Murray]], and after his death in 1815 the only clergy known to be preaching Trinitarian Universalism were Paul Dean of Boston and Edward Mitchell in New York.&lt;ref&gt;The Universalist quarterly and general review: Volume 5 – Page 393 1848 "At that time, it was supposed that the only Trinitarians, in our ministry, were Mr. Dean of Boston, and Mr. Mitchell of New York ; the latter of whom, though a highly respected preacher of Universalism, was never in formal fellowship as his attachments to Mr. Murray's peculiarities were so strong as to prevent him uniting with the denomination."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell E.

==History==
{{main|Universal Reconciliation}}
Traditionally, the doctrine of Universalism was traced by Universalist historians&lt;ref&gt;such as Allen  Eddy, ''History of the Unitarians and the Universalists in the United States''; H Ballou, ''Ancient History of Universalism''; Bell, ''The Life and Times of Dr. George DeBenneville, 1703 – 1793''; Eddy, R ''Universalism in America, a History''; Miller, ''The Larger Hope''; Pachull, ''Mysticism and Early South German – Austrian Anabaptist Movement, 1525 – 1531''; Skinner ''Hell's Ramparts Fell: The Life of John Murray''; Skinner, ''A Religion for Greatness and The Social Implications of Universalism''; Whittmore, ''The Modern History of Universalism''; [[George Huntston Williams]], ''American Universalism''. ''Universal Salvation?: The Current Debate''. editors: Robin A. Parry &amp; Christopher H. Partridge. 2003. {{ISBN|0-8028-2764-0}}. 'Universalism in the History of Christianity'. by Morwena Ludlow. Chapt. 10&lt;/ref&gt; back to the teachings of [[Origen]] of Alexandria (c.185–284), an influential early [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] and writer. Origen believed in [[apocatastasis]], the ultimate restoration and reconciliation of creation with God, which was interpreted by Universalists historians to mean the salvation and reconciliation with God of all souls which had ever existed, including Satan and his demons. However more recent research has shown that this analysis of Origen's views is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, John Anthony ''The Westminster Handbook to Origen'' Westminster John Knox Press. {{ISBN|978-0-664-22472-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Origen also believed in the pre-existence of souls and that glorified Man may have to go through cycles of sin and redemption before reaching perfection. The teachings of Origen were declared [[anathema]] at the Ecumenical Council of 553, centuries after his death, though [[Gregory of Nyssa]], another figure to whom Universalist historians attributed Universalist belief, was commended as an Orthodox defender of the faith by the same Council. Universalist historians have also identified [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (815–877){{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, and [[Amalric of Bena]] (c. 1200).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as Universalists.  Much of this research was incorporated by French priest Pierre Batiffol into an article on [[Apocatastasis]] later translated for the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01599a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Apocatastasis|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], all doctrines and practices of the Catholic (Universal) Church were re-examined and numerous sects formed, although none revived the belief (originally attributed to Origen) in universal reconciliation. In 1525, [[Hans Denck]] (1425–1527) was accused of being a Universalist,&lt;ref&gt;Reformers in the wings: from Geiler von Kaysersberg to Theodore Beza  By David Curtis Steinmetz p151&lt;/ref&gt; but this is now considered unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S002204690400990X | volume=55 | title=Why Was Hans Denck Thought To Be a Universalist? | year=2004 | journal=The Journal of Ecclesiastical History | pages=257–274 | last1 = Ludlow | first1 = Morwenna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Leade]] (1623–1704), a mystic who claimed to have seen heaven and hell, started a Universalist congregation, the Philadelphians, which dissipated after her death. She was a [[Behmenist]] rather than orthodox [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]].

[[John Murray (minister)|John Murray]] (1741–1815) was forced to leave the Methodist Church because of his Universalism. In 1770, he came to New England and is credited with being the Father of Universalism in North America. Although Murray was a Trinitarian (as was his mentor, [[James Relly]]), his successor, [[Hosea Ballou]] (1771–1852) was a strong Unitarian who opposed Trinitarianism, [[Calvinism]], and legalism. During his tenure, Universalism became linked with liberal theology as well as Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;http://uudb.org/articles/hoseaballou.html Biography of Hosea Ballou from UUA, retrieved Dec. 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Trinitarian Universalists include Robin Parry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theologicalscribbles.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-am-evangelical-universalist.html|title=I am the Evangelical Universalist|author=|date=|website=theologicalscribbles.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; an evangelical writer, who under the pseudonym of "Gregory MacDonald" released a book ''The Evangelical Universalist'', (2006)&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;MacDonald, Gregory (a pseudonym).

==Philosophy==
{{main|Universal Reconciliation}}
{{duplication|date=August 2013}}
[[Thomas Talbott]] offers three propositions which are biblically based, but which he asserts to be mutually exclusive:
#God is omnipotent and exercises sovereign control over all aspects of human life and history.
#God is omni-benevolent, is ontologically Love, and desires the salvation of all people.
#Some (many) persons will experience everlasting, conscious torment in a place of (either literal or metaphorical) fire.&lt;ref name="Talbott"&gt;Talbott, Thomas. ''The Inescapable Love of God''.1999. {{ISBN|1-58112-831-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional theology clarifies omnipotence or omni-benevolence to resolve the contradiction. [[Calvinism]] resolves it by positing a doctrine of limited atonement, which claims that God's love is restricted. Only a select number of people are elected to be saved, which includes redemption and purification. This demonstrates a special love, and most people (the 'eternally reprobate' or non-elect) are given only [[common grace]] and tolerance. This bifurcation of grace intends to retain a doctrine of God's [[omnibenevolence]] and a doctrine of hell. In comparison, [[Arminianism]] resolves the contradiction by rejecting divine omnipotence with respect to human will. This is commonly referred to as [[synergism (theology)|synergism]]. It posits that human beings have an inviolable [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]], which allows the choice of accepting or rejecting God's grace. Universalists disagree with the third claim, and argue that all people receive salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Talbott's views are most completely delineated in his book [[The Inescapable Love of God]]. A book entitled [[Universal Salvation?: The Current Debate]] has recently come to print, in which multiple authors from various fields (Theology, Philosophy, Church History, etc.) build arguments to either support or deny his Universalist tenets. See also: *http://www.thomastalbott.com/
*http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since traditional interpretations of multiple biblical verses seem to be about people experiencing everlasting conscious torment in hell, many Christians hold that Universalists must either [[#Bible teaches eternity of hell|refute or reinterpret]] these verses.  There are many verses of scripture supporting universal salvation with which supporters of eternal damnation must contend, including (but not limited to): Matthew 18:14, Luke 3:6, John 3:17, John 12:32, John 12:47, John 15:16, Romans 8:38-9, 1 Timothy 2:3–4, and 1 Timothy 4:9–10.

*'''God is Trinity'''
:God is One Being and Three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who indwell each other in a perichoretic communion of love.&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, T. F. ''The Trinitarian Faith''. 1995 {{ISBN|0-567-29219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''God is Love'''
:God is ontologically love ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20john%204:8;&amp;version=31;  1 John 4:8]), and everything that he is and does reflect his being love. His holiness is an aspect of His love and can be thought of as one thing: Holylovingkindness.

*'''Reconciliation is through Christ Jesus'''
:Jesus Christ is the incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity and he is both fully God and fully man. Because he created everything and everything inheres in him, all of creation was crucified and resurrected with him. ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%201:3-4;&amp;version=31;  John 1:3–4]), ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%201:15-20;&amp;version=31;  Col. 1:15–20]) Because divinity and humanity meets in him, mankind are now participants in the [[perichoresis]] or the divine dance of love within the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, C. Baxter. ''The Great Dance: The Christian Vision Revisited''.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Universal atonement of sins'''
:Jesus Christ's death on the cross paid the price for the sins of the world ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:15%20-19;&amp;version=31;  Rom. 5:15–19]) and all men are reconciled to God ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor%205:19;&amp;version=31;  2 Cor. 5:19]). No human being is alienated from God as he is their only source of life ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%201:3-4;&amp;version=31;  John 1:3–4]) and in him they live and move and have their being.

:Because all sins have been paid for, all sins are forgiven. Divine forgiveness precedes human response and this forgiveness is both love and judgment because to say, "I forgive you" is to say "I love you" and "You have sinned against me". Man can respond by agreeing with the judgment (repentance) and receive both the love and forgiveness or he can deny the judgment and refuse God's love and forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, James B.

[[File:Rembrandt-The return of the prodigal son.jpg|thumb|left|Rembrandt's The Return of the Prodigal Son]]
*'''Salvation is an objective reality and a subjective reality'''
:A personal response of faith is required before the objective saving act of God is made subjectively real in the individual's life. The response is transformative and changes with knowledge and experience. What has been accomplished ''for'' all mankind must be accomplished ''in'' each person's life which requires the individual's cooperation with the Holy Spirit. God is love and man is loved but he must be in relationship with him to know that love. It is the difference between ''being'' and ''knowing''.

*'''Hell, as described in the Bible, exists'''
:It is partially here as the Kingdom of Darkness that all men are born into.

:It will be fully present for those who persist in rejecting God's gift of salvation. However, God's grace and gift of faith reaches everyone while they are dead in their sins ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%202:1;&amp;version=31;  Eph. 2:1], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%202:13;&amp;version=31;  Col. 2:13]) and there is no biblical text that says his mercy and gift of salvation will end when one dies physically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/harrowing_of_hell.htm|title=The Harrowing of Hell|author=|date=|website=www.tentmaker.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus Christ is proclaimed to be the Lord of the dead and the living ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2014:9;&amp;version=31;  Rom. 14:9]).

*'''Hell is not retribution but rehabilitation'''
:The suffering in hell is the anguish of a soul persisting in rebellion against God, or the shame of a soul when it realizes how much it has sinned against a holy God as well as profound regret for what might have been.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Gregory. ''The Evangelical Universalist''. 2006. {{ISBN|1-59752-365-8}}. Chapt 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''The Good News is about the Kingdom of God'''
:The mission is not just to save people from hell but to bring them out of the Kingdom of Darkness and into the Kingdom of Light. All moral law can be summed up by the two Great Commandments: Love God and Love Others ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2013:8-10;&amp;version=31;  Rom. 13:8–10]) and these two commands are not distinct and exclusive. To love God is to love others and to love others is to love God.

*'''The Kingdom of God is here and yet not fully here'''
:Trinitarian Universalists live in that dialetic tension and in the hope of the future Kingdom. ([http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=fully+known&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=31&amp;bookset=2 1 Cor. 13:12])

*'''Wrath and judgment is another face of Love'''
:God's love is passionate and people can grieve him ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%204:30;&amp;version=31;  Eph. 4:30]) by thwarting his love and good intentions toward them. If man hurts himself or others, he will experience that divine love as wrath. Judgment accompanies wrath and judgment is salvific. It is a fire that purifies and refines, not one that destroys. ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mal%203:2;&amp;version=31;  Mal. 3:2]) If man is not judged and if he does not feel God's wrath, he will not be aware that he has sinned. Judgment and wrath encourages a man to stop what he is doing and repent (turn around). Then he will know forgiveness and feel God's love turn from wrath to warmth.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Brian. ''A Generous Orthodoxy''. 2004. {{ISBN|0-310-25747-6}}. pp. 93–97&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''True justice is restoration and reconciliation'''
:Justice is not fully met by punishing wrongdoers.  True justice is
:*restoration of what was stolen or destroyed
:*repentance and reformation of the sinner
:*reconciliation between the sinner and God and the person(s) sinned against

* '''The final word God speaks to Mankind is always reconciliation and redemption'''
:Sodom is portrayed as a very wicked place that was judged by God and destroyed by burning sulfur ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2019:1-29;&amp;version=31;  Gen. 19:1–29]). Jude writes that they "suffered the punishment of eternal fire" ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201%20:7;&amp;version=31;  Jude 1:7]). But Jesus knew what circumstances would have brought the people of Sodom to repentance and acknowledgement of God ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%2011:23;&amp;version=31;  Matt. 11:23]). The last word God speaks over Sodom is restoration in an eschatological prophecy by Ezekiel ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2016%20:53-55;&amp;version=31;  Ezk. 16:53–55]).

==Universalism and heresy==
[[Heresy]] is "adherence to a religious opinion contrary to church dogma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/heresy|title=Definition of HERESY|author=|date=|website=www.m-w.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because dogma varies among denominations, what is considered heresy by one denomination or congregation may be accepted as doctrine or opinion by another.  In a socially free world, free moral agents may identify with whichever perspectives and positions, persons and communities, and traditions (or subtraditions) they find most intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually palatable.  However, the results of their exercise of this operational freedom may be understood or interpreted differently by different persons.

There are three (3) generally accepted understandings of [[hell]]:
# A literal place of fire where the damned suffer eternal conscious torment.
# A metaphorical hell where the suffering is real but is not literally fire and brimstone. The pain may be physical, emotional or spiritual.
# Conditional, where souls are punished until retributive justice is met or accomplished, after which these punished souls are annihilated &lt;ref&gt;Four Views on Hell. William Crockett, editor. {{ISBN|0-310-21268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the doctrine of purgatory, distinct from hell, where imperfect souls are cleansed and made ready for heaven. It may be a place of rehabilitation, correction, or retribution.

Universalists believe that every person will be saved, where more orthodox Roman Catholics believe that only those who died in God's grace will find purgation for their venial sins in Purgatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Purgatory|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Argument'''''

There are four (4) major theories about human salvation in Christendom:
# [[Religious exclusivism#Christian exclusivism|Exclusivism]]: Salvation is exclusively found in Christianity. Anyone who is not a Christian will go to hell.
# [[Inclusivism#Christianity|Inclusivism]]: Some adherents of other religions may find salvation, but it is still only Jesus Christ who can (and may or will) save them.
# [[Religious_pluralism#Christian_views|Pluralism]]: One's own religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth; salvation, in principle, may be found in any religion, although salvation is not necessarily found in one's search of any (other) religion(s).
# [[Christian Universalism|Universalism]]: All persons (and peoples?) will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theologicalstudies.org/pluralism.html|title=Vlach, Michael J., PhD. What Are Pluralism, Inclusivism, and Exclusivism? Theologicalstudies.org. retrieved Dec. 12, 2006|author=|date=|website=theologicalstudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian denominations and churches will generally profess one of the above to be true and the others as error; however, they are not all mutually exclusive. For example, some who hold to #4 "Universalism" also hold to #1 "Exclusivism." For these, anyone who is not a Christian will go to hell, but ultimately everyone will become a Christian and therefore be saved. Others may be #2 "Inclusivists" and #3 "Pluralists."  For those who might hold to these, because God may use the tools of any particular religion or culture to reveal his grace in Christ (Inclusivism), other religions therefore, potentially exhibiting the effects of this work, may in fact hold valuable insights to truth for theology (Pluralism), consequently calling the members of a particular congregation/denomination/religion to be open to that possibility.

===Hell needed as a deterrent===
[[File:Hosea Ballou 2.png|100px|thumb|right|Hosea Ballou]]
This anecdote by Rev. Elizabeth Strong, a Unitarian Universalist, sums up the issue:
:Hosea Ballou was riding the circuit in the New Hampshire hills with a Baptist minister one day, arguing theology as they traveled. At one point, the Baptist looked over and said, "Brother Ballou, if I were a Universalist and feared not the fires of hell, I could hit you over the head, steal your horse and saddle, and ride away, and I'd still go to heaven."

:Ballou looked over at him and said, "If you were a Universalist, the idea would never occur to you." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/2745.shtml|title=Of sand bars and circuit riders|publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations|year=1993|accessdate=2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible teaches eternity of hell===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
{{Original research|section|date=February 2008}}
{{Off-topic|date=February 2011}}
The following are problematic verses for Trinitarian Universalists and which they usually seek to qualify in some way.

;The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats
:&lt;u&gt;Matthew 25:14–30&lt;/u&gt;
:Jesus is teaching a principle of Kingdom living: small acts of kindness have eternal value. This is not a teaching about what merits salvation and what merits damnation and it is definitely not a teaching about the eternity of hell. Also, the Greek word 'aion' can be interpreted as "a long time" as well as "eternal". Finally, this passage may not be dealing with personal eschatology at all, but rather with the judgement of Christ on nations based on how they treat his children. On this view, the passage teaches that nations that abuse Christians will be subject to enduring chastisement while those who protect Christians will enjoy enduring life.

;Pauline writings
:&lt;u&gt;2 Thessalonians 1:9&lt;/u&gt;
:The phrase "everlasting destruction" could be translated as "destruction of the coming age" which makes it a reference to eschatological judgment. The phrase "and shut out" should be translated as "that comes from". Therefore the verse should be read as: "They will be punished with destruction of the coming age that comes from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power." The imagery is that of the holiness of God burning away forever the sinful nature of unrepentant man.&lt;ref&gt;Bonda, Jan. ''The One Purpose of God: An Answer to the Doctrine of Eternal Punishment.'' 1993. {{ISBN|0-8028-4186-4}}. pp 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;

;Eschaton in Revelation
:&lt;u&gt;Revelation 14:11&lt;/u&gt;
:In view of the overwhelming evidence for Universalism in the Bible, especially in the writings of Paul, this description is hyperbole. Revelation images are metaphorical and no one knows what they really mean.

Some attempts to explain the passage note the ancient uses of burning sulfur for ritual purification and even medicinal therapy, that the Greek word for 'torment' -basanazo- refers to applying a touchstone 
to determine the presence of gold, and that the Greek word for sulfur 'theoin" is rooted in the Greek 'theos' for 'god'. Thus, the passage could be paraphrased that those who worship the Beast would 
be tested, tried, even purged and healed through the "burning sulfur" of the Divine Presence, and that such an ordeal will endure for aions of anions, however long is needed for their restoration. 
:&lt;u&gt;Revelation 19:3&lt;/u&gt;
:This refers to the whore of Babylon which is a metaphor for corrupt political systems and/or economic policies. It is not a reference to the eternal suffering of people.

:In Revelation, the kings of the earth are depicted as in league with the Whore of Babylon, which is probably symbolic of corrupt political and/or socioeconomic systems, and they are drunk on the maddening wine of her adulteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|20:2|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They weep and mourn when she is finally thrown into the Lake of Fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|18:9|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then they gather on the plains of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] with the Beast to fight the "King of kings and Lord of lords" and the armies of heaven in the final battle, [[Armageddon]]. They are defeated and the Beast and his False Prophet are thrown into the Lake of Fire. Those who followed them are slain with "the sword that came out of the mouth" of the Word of God which is probably symbolic of the Gospel or Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|20:11–21|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the last scene in New Jerusalem, where the gates are ever open, where the leaves of the trees are for the healing of the nations, the kings of the earth are expected to enter, bringing their splendor with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|21–22|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvinist objections===
{{duplication|date=August 2013}}
Romans 9, according to [[Calvinism]], teaches that some people are natural objects of God's wrath, created and prepared for the purpose of being destroyed. Judas was predestined to be the [[Son of Perdition]], the one prophesied to betray Jesus. It is written that "It would be better for him if he had not been born" (despite the fact that, without Judas' betrayal there would have been no crucifixion, no resurrection and therefore no salvation). God foreknew all those he would save and that some people are destined for eternal damnation. Also, according to Calvinism, justice requires that sins against an infinite, holy God merit eternal punishment, especially for those who reject his gift of salvation. God is love and also holy. Thirdly, Calvinists would contend that nowhere in the bible does it even hint at the possibility of post-mortem salvation. After death comes judgment.

Trinitarian Universalists might answer that, if all are created totally lost in sin, it would therefore not be logical or (more importantly) just for God, the epitome of justice himself, to hold them accountable for their actions or liable for their state of being without providing them a way to find redemption, and this could be said even of a being that is not all-merciful and all-loving, as God is.  Romans 9 deals with God's hidden will to choose some to salvation in this life (the elect) and pass others, called reprobates, by in this life. That is not the final word God speaks to those individuals he passes by. Jesus said, as he was dying on the cross, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do."  He also promised "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw (or, literally, "drag" in the Greek) all men unto me." Surely these global statements cover all of humanity.

F.W. Farrar offers this possible interpretation to Jesus' remarks regarding Judas. When Jesus said, "it would be better for him if he had not been born," the "him" was referring to the Son of Man (Jesus) and the "he" to Judas. Thus he meant that it would have been better for the Son of Man if Judas had not been born. Another view is that although everyone else is to be saved, perhaps Judas will be punished and then annihilated. At any rate the passage does not disprove universalism and certainly does not prove eternal torment.

Pointing to God's eternality is not a satisfactory explanation as to why a temporal sin logically entails unending punishment, though it may be for that reason eternally grave. God's attributes can never conflict with one another, lest God be an imperfect being who is subject to internal strife. God's mercy can never violate his justice, as if God's Love pushes him in one direction whereas his holiness pushes him in another. Universalism brings all his attributes into harmony by pointing out the way in which they describe the one single will of God. The early twentieth century theologian Paul Tillich described this relationship between God's justice and mercy as "creative justice" and as "the strange work of love" in ''Love, Power, and Justice''. Creative justice refers to justice under the principle of agape, or unambiguous and unconditional love. Because it drives towards the reunion of the separated (eros) unconditionally (agape), it makes amends with s/he whom is separated by severing from their personal center that which entrenches the separation (i.e. "the strange work"). This ultimately entails being faced with the Law, or the unconditionality of the moral imperative, and recognizing the need for reconciliation and forgiveness. This "destructive" work of love is always for the sake of building up love's object as and into a subject. [[Gestalt therapy]] and psychotherapy are modern examples of love doing this strange work: the process is painful and entails major reform, but health and well-being are its intention. [[Martin Luther]] said "the love of God creates its own object."

From the point of view of Trinitarian Universalism the following questions could be asked of more "orthodox" believers: If there is no hint of post-mortem salvation in the Bible, then why does Paul refer to people being baptized for the dead?  Why did Jesus preach to those in hell?  Why did the majority of church fathers, including Augustine and Luther, believe in the possibility of post-mortem salvation?

===Arminian objections===
[[Arminianism]] holds that God will not abrogate humanity's free will because love must be chosen, not forced, and that some people will choose alienation from God over consummation, and so God has "graciously" provided a place for them to exist. [[C.S. Lewis]] speculated, through literary allegory, that hell is locked from within but few will leave because over a lifetime and through the coming ages, they will become more and more at home in hell.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S. ''The Great Divorce''. 1973. {{ISBN|0-06-065295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Trinitarian Universalist believer might counter that for God to allow his misguided and confused children to suffer eternal separation from him is the very opposite of grace, runs counter to his loving and sovereign nature, and would compare unfavorably to the attitude and behavior of even average human parents toward their children.  The Bible seems to teach that those who believe do so because God caused them to believe, not by any freedom of choice of their own (Ephesians 2:8–10), and they might cite the following in support their answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He choose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved." Ephesians 1:4–6

"For He says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.' So then it {does} not {depend} on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy." Romans 9:15–16
(See also: John 15:16, Philippians 1:29, Ephesians 1:11)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, the Bible in several places refers to freedom being only for those freed through Christ, and that those who are not in Christ are in darkness under the dominion of Satan (Acts 26:18), and are slaves to sin (John 8:34). Therefore, it would make no sense to maintain that someone can have the "freedom" to "reject God"—it is only by sin that people reject God.  Those in sin are slaves to sin and Satan, and therefore it is only God who can, by his grace, release them from that bondage and make them able to believe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses {and escape} from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the idea that God wills us to have real love, and that therefore the love cannot be forced upon us, is not to say that, therefore, the only other alternative is absolute and total freedom, even freedom to condemn ourselves. A good parent would certainly allow their son or daughter to develop into their own genuine person, making free choices.  That doesn't mean, however, that the parent's earnest desire for authenticity in their child's life, based on the child making real, honest, personal choices, would therefore lead them to not intervene if the child were about to jump in front of a moving train, or take a fatal dose of sleeping pills. To say that God either gives us absolute and total freedom to accept or reject him, or else we are mindless robots or marionettes is a false dichotomy. It also conveniently ignores the blatant fact that almost nothing in our life is under our control, from when and where we are born, to our economic status, to what sorts of beliefs we are taught and raised with—all of which have a bearing on our decision to accept or reject Him. No matter how much we would like to pretend otherwise, the decision to have faith in Christ is not as much "free will" as it is the enormously personal culmination of all the circumstances of our lives, and therefore enormously influenced by the myriad external, uncontrollable factors that have shaped our hearts and minds.

===Mortalist objections===
[[Soul sleep|Mortalists]] object that, in their view, the Bible does not teach torment of souls, either in [[Hades]], nor at the [[End time|Last Day]] in [[Gehenna]].

==Hope of universal salvation==
{{duplication|date=August 2013}}
Apart from the dogmatic belief that a sentence of endless torment in hell is incompatible with God's moral character there are notable theologians who believe that God wants everyone to be saved and that it is possible for God to save everyone but, at the same time, they will not limit God's sovereign right to choose not to save everyone.
