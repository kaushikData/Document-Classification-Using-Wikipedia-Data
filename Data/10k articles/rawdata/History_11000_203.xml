'''Adrián Recinos''' (1886–1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n82-36034}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Guatemala]]n historian, essayist, [[Mayanist]] scholar and translator, and diplomat. Recinos was a great student of national history, mainly of the [[Maya civilization]] and the ancient history of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] and [[Kaqchikel people]].

It was he who made the first edition in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of the [[Popol Vuh]], based on his translation of the manuscript found in the [[Newberry Library]], [[Chicago]], the [[United States]]. He also published his translations of other ancient Mayan manuscripts, including the ''[[Anales de los Cakchiqueles]]''.

==Biography==
Adrián Recinos was born on July 5, 1886, in [[Antigua Guatemala]], as the son of Teodoro M. Recinos and Rafaela Ávila de Recinos.&lt;ref name="Hilton" /&gt; He married María Palomo and had five children, Beatrice, Isabel, Mary, Adrian Jr., and Laura.&lt;ref name="Hilton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilton |first1=Ronald |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Who's who in Latin America: A biographical dictionary of notable living men and women of Latin America |year=n.d. |edition=Third edition, revised and enlarged |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location= |language= |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All four of his daughters would remain in Guatemala for the majority of their lives, and Adrian Jr. would attend [[Harvard University]], and later became an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in the U.S. while residing in [[Washington D.C.]].

Recinos obtained his bachelor's degree of Sciences and Letters in 1902, and graduated from the School of Law in Guatemala in 1907. He pursued a public career as a diplomat and was Secretary of Legation in El Salvador (1908), Under-Secretary of State (1910–1920), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1922–1923), Ambassador to France, Spain, and Italy (1923–1925), President of the Legislative Assembly (1926), and Ambassador to the USA (1928–1943). In 1944 he ran as a candidate to the Presidency of the Republic, but lost the elections to [[Juan José Arévalo]].&lt;ref name="Hilton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Handy |first1=Jim |title=Revolution in the countryside: Rural Conflict and Agrarian Reform in Guatemala, 1944-1954 |year=1995 |edition= |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location= |language= |pages=32, 145–6 |isbn=978-0-8078-4438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman was politically inactive until 2013 when she joined [[Mirela Holy]] in founding [[Sustainable Development of Croatia]] party (ORaH). She left the party in 2014 citing disagreement with the political direction of the party, the question of support to [[Ivo Josipović]] (with whom she didn't agree) and bad interpersonal relations between members. At the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Croatia)|2014 European Parliament election]], she was at the second place on the ORaH's electoral list, and was short a handful of votes to get elected to the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Andrea-Feldman-istupila-iz-ORaH-a-i-zbog-Josipovica|title=Andrea Feldman istupila  iz ORaH-a i zbog  Josipovića / Novi list|first=Neomedia|last=Komunikacije|website=www.novilist.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubrovniknet.hr/novost.php?id=30466#.Whq1D9KnGUk|title=Andrea Feldman, dubrovačka nevjesta u utrci za EU parlament|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Le Fèvre Dacier''' (1647 – 17 August 1720), better known during her lifetime as '''Madame Dacier''', was a French [[scholar]], [[translation|translator]], commentator and editor of the [[classics]], including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. She sought to champion ancient literature and used her great capabilities in Latin and Greek for this purpose as well as for her own financial support, producing a series of editions and translations from which she earned her living.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|last=Frade|first=Sofia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780198725206|editor-last=Wyles|editor-first=Rosie|location=Oxford|pages=|chapter=Ménage's Learned Ladies: Anne Dacier (1647-1720) and Anna Maria van Schurman (1607-1678)|editor-last2=Hall|editor-first2=Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the dedicatee of [[Gilles Ménage]]'s ''Historia mulierum philosopharum,'' whose characterisation of her and of [[Anna Maria van Schurman]] was used to provide leading examples in treatises arguing for female education across the following centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198725206.001.0001/acprof-9780198725206-chapter-4|title=Ménage’s Learned Ladies - Anne Dacier (1647–1720) and Anna Maria van Schurman (1607–1678) - Oxford Scholarship|last=|first=|date=22 November 2017|website=Oxford Scholarship|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198725206.003.0004|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education ==
The exact date of her birth is not known and sources differ in their opinions: 1647 is proposed by Frade and Wyles and also Conley in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]; the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] suggests 1654;  and the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] 1651. The only known portrait of her, dated 1854, has her death at the age of 68,&lt;ref name="Delisle2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_JyNodKmNwC|title=Portraits de traductrices|author=Jean Delisle|date=1 January 2002|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=978-2-7603-0546-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting 1651–52. Dacier was raised in [[Saumur]], a town in the [[Loire Valley|Loire region]] of France, and taught both [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]] by her father, [[Tanneguy Le Fèvre]]. In 1683 she married one of her father's students, [[André Dacier]] (also engaged in classical studies and translations albeit his work is considered by encyclopedia editors to be far inferior to hers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anne-Dacier|title=The Encyclopedia Britannica|last=|first=|date=24 November 2017|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==Classical editions and translations==
Her father died in 1672, after which she moved to [[Paris]], carrying with her part of an edition of [[Callimachus]], which she published in 1674.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} She gained further work through a friend of her father, [[Pierre-Daniel Huet]], then assistant tutor to [[Dauphin of France|the Dauphin]] and responsible for the ''Ad usum Delphini'' series of editions (commonly known as the [[Delphin Classics]]). He commissioned her to produce editions of: [[Publius Annius Florus]] (1674), [[Dictys Cretensis]] (1680), [[Sextus Aurelius Victor]] (1681) and [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] (1683).

In 1681 her prose version of [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Sappho]] appeared, and in the next few years, she published prose versions of [[Terence]] and some of the plays of [[Plautus]] and [[Aristophanes]]. In 1684 she and her husband retired to [[Castres]], with the object of devoting themselves to [[theological]] studies. In 1685 the Daciers were rewarded with a pension by [[Louis XIV of France]] for their conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dacier, André |display=Dacier, André s.v. Anne Lefevre |volume=7 |pages=727-728}} This cites:

*J. F. Bodin, ''Recherches historiques sur la ville de Saumur'' (1812–1814)

*''Mémoires de Saint-Simon'', iii.
*H. Rigault, ''Histoire de la querelle des anciens et des modernes'' (1856).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699 her prose translation of the ''[[Iliad]]'' appeared, which earned her the esteem in which she is held in [[French literature]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It was followed nine years later by a similar translation of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', which [[Alexander Pope]] found useful. Dacier in turn published in 1724 remarks on Pope's translation of the former (1715–20), which gained her some fame in England as well.&lt;ref&gt;''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The ''[[Iliad]]'', which made [[Homer]] known for the first time to many French men of letters (including [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]]) gave rise to a famous literary controversy. In 1714, La Motte published a poetical version of the ''Iliad'', abridged and altered to suit his own taste, together with a ''Discours sur Homère'', stating the reasons why Homer failed to satisfy his critical taste. Mme. Dacier replied in the same year in her work, ''Des causes de la corruption du goût (“Of the Causes of the Corruption of Taste”).''{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In defending Homer, Dacier "developed her own philosophical aesthetics. She insists on the centrality of taste as an indicator of the level of civilization, both moral and artistic, within a particular culture."&lt;ref&gt;John J. Conley in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dacier-a/ Retrieved 5 December 2015]. This provides a thorough account of Dacier's thinking.&lt;/ref&gt;

La Motte carried on the discussion with light gaiety and ''badinage'', and had the happiness of seeing his views supported by the abbé [[Jean Terrasson]], who in 1715 produced two volumes entitled ''Dissertation critique sur L'Iliade'', in which he maintained that [[science]] and [[philosophy]], and especially the science and philosophy of [[René Descartes]], had so developed the human mind that the poets of the eighteenth century were immeasurably superior to those of [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the same year, [[Claude Buffier]] published ''Homère en arbitrage'', in which he concluded that both parties were really agreed on the essential point that Homer was one of the greatest geniuses the world had seen, and that, as a whole, no other poem could be preferred to his; and, soon after (on 5 April 1716) in the house of [[Jean-Baptiste de Valincourt]], Mme. Dacier and La Motte met at supper, and drank to the health of Homer.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4786">"'''Arab rejectionism'''," sometimes called "'''Palestinian rejectionism'''" is the alleged refusal by Arabs to recognize the legitimacy of the national rights of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;Kuperwasser, Yosef, and Shalom Lipner. “The Problem Is Palestinian Rejectionism: Why the PA Must Recognize a Jewish State.” [[Foreign Affairs]], vol. 90, no. 6, 2011, pp. 2–9. www.jstor.org/stable/23039624.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab rejection of Israel==
[[Yossi Klein Halevi]] characterizes "Arab rejectionism" as being "at least partly responsible" for the "uprooting and occupation" of Palestinian Arabs, referring to the rejection by Arab leaders of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Halevi, Yossi Klein. "The Asymmetry of Pity." [[The National Interest]], no. 65 (2001): 37-44. https://www.jstor.org/stable/42897355.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] described [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] support for "Arab rejectionism" as demonstrating that the USSR was "concerned only to cause trouble and block peace."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. "Thought Control in the US: The Media and the "Peace Process"" [[MERIP]] Middle East Report, no. 143 (1986): 25-29. doi:10.2307/3012012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book [[Right to Exist: a Moral Defense of Israel's Wars]], [[Yaacov Lozowick]] asserts that Arab rejectionism is responsible for having made the murder of Jewish civilians into a persistent feature of Arab policy that has been ongoing since the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots]] and that continues in modern terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Chad Alan. "Politicide Revisited." [[Contemporary Sociology]] 34, no. 3 (2005): 229-32. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4147235.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Pipes]] regards the question "Should Israel exist?" as the "core issue" of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].  According to Pipes, "most Arabs at most times have emphatically replied with a "no." This attitude—what I call rejectionism—stubbornly holds that the Jewish state must be destroyed, with its inhabitants either subjugated, exiled or killed."&lt;ref name="PipesFirstAcceptIsrael"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pipes|first1=Daniel|title=First, Accept Israel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/31/local/me-40547|accessdate=2 February 2017|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=31 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to anthropologist [[Philip Carl Salzman]], Arab Rejectionism is best understood in the context of Arab [[tribalism]].  Far from being irrational, as it can seem to non-Arab observers when, in Salsman's example, Arab states refuse to accept expert aid from Israel after earthquakes and other disasters, rejectionism is consistent with a culture rooted in tribalism because it utilizes hatred of an external enemy to "diffuse internal discontent,"  draws on "Arab organizational principles based on opposition," and is seen as a way to defend "honor of the Arabs," viewed as having been challenged by Israel's existence.&lt;ref name="SalzmanTribal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salsman|first1=Philip Carl|title=The Middle East's Tribal DNA|journal=Middle East Quarterly|date=Winter 2008|volume=15|issue=1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejectionist Palestinian organizations==
The [[Rejection Front]] of the 1970s and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], which identified with the Rejection Front, were and continued to be strongly rejection.&lt;ref&gt;As'ad AbuKhalil. "Internal Contradictions in the PFLP: Decision Making and Policy Orientation." Middle East Journal 41, no. 3 (1987): 361-78. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4327585.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslih, Muhammad Y. "Moderates and Rejectionists within the Palestine Liberation Organization." Middle East Journal 30, no. 2 (1976): 127-40. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4325481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanaan, George. "Syria and the Peace Plan: Assad's Balancing Act." MERIP Reports, no. 65 (1978): 10-11. doi:10.2307/3010876.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The end of Arab rejectionism==
According to Secretary of State [[James Baker]], the unity of "Arab rejectionism" was defeated in the [[Gulf War]] along with the more "radical" Palestinian factions.&lt;ref name="BakerLookingBAck"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=James|title=Looking Back on the Middle East: James A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6498">The medieval state of '''[[Kievan Rus']]''' incorporated parts of what is now modern [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Belarus]], and was centered on [[Kiev]] and [[Novgorod]]. Its '''architectural style''' quickly established itself after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988 and was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. After the disintegration of [[Kievan Rus']] followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]] in the first half of the 13th century, the architectural tradition continued in the principalities of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Galicia-Volhynia]] and eventually had direct influence on the [[Russian architecture|Russian]], [[Ukrainian architecture|Ukrainian]], and [[Belarusian architecture|Belarusian]] Architecture.

==Church architecture==
[[File:Maket Sofii.JPG|thumb|300px|Before its reconstruction in the 18th century, St. Sofia in Kiev was a prime example and a model for all churches in Kievan Rus]]

The great churches of Kievan Rus', built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state which quickly established itself was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like.

The 10th-century [[Church of the Tithes]] in Kiev was the first cult building to be made of stone. The earliest Kievan churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters.

Another great example of an early church of Kievan Rus' was the thirteen-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037–54), built by [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. Much of its exterior has been altered with time, extending ove the area and eventually acquiring 25 domes.

[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1045-1050), {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} on the other hand, expressed a new style that exerted a strong influence on Russian church architecture. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe.

Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117–19), and St George's (1119).

Along with cathedrals, of note was the architecture of monasteries of these times.

The 12th-13th centuries were the period of feudal division of Kievan Rus into princedoms which were in nearly permanent feud, with multipication of cathedrals in emerging princedoms and courts of local princes ''[[knyaz]]es''.

[[File:Bogolyubovo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most famous Russian medieval churches.]]
By the end of the 12th century the divide of the country was final and new centers of power took the Kievan style and adopted it to their traditions. In the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] the local churches were built of white stone with help of Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Suzdal style is also known as "white-stone architecture" ("белокаменное зодчество"). The first white-stone church was the [[St. Boris and Gleb Church]] commissioned by [[Yuri Dolgoruky]], a church-fortress in [[Kideksha]] near Suzdal, at the supposed place of the stay of knyazes Boris and Gleb on their pilgrimage to Kiev. The white-stone churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Rus' architecture. The most important churches in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and [[St Demetrios Cathedral]] (built 1194-97).

In the western splinter of [[Kingdom of Halych-Volhynia]] churches in a traditional Kievan style were built for some time, but eventually the style began to drift towards Central European Romanesque tradition.

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus', particularly the [[Svirskaya Church]] of [[Smolensk]] (1191–94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church (1196–99) in [[Chernigov]] (modern Chernihiv, Ukraine), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

==Secular architecture==
There were very few examples of secular (non-religious) architecture in [[Kievan Rus]]. [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of the pre-Mongolian period.

In Kiev, the capital of the country, no secular monuments survived aside from pieces of walls and ruins of gates. The [[Golden Gates of Kiev]] were destroyed completely over the years with only the ruins remaining. In the 20th century a museum was erected above the ruins, it is mirror image of the gates of the Kievan Rus period but is not a monument of the time.

One of the best examples, the fortress of [[Belgorod Kievskiy]], is still lying under the ground waiting major excavation.

In the 1940s, the archaeologist [[Nikolai Voronin]] discovered the well-preserved remains of [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]]'s palace in [[Bogolyubovo]], dating from 1158-65.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2434">'''Arthur Hill Cash''' (February 4, 1922{{snd}}December 29, 2016) was an [[United States|American]] [[scholar]] of 18th-century [[English literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/books/arthur-cash-dead-laurence-sterne-biographer.html|title=Arthur H. Cash, Writer of British Biographies, Dies at 94|date=31 December 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cash is best known as the author of the definitive two-volume biography of [[Laurence Sterne]], published between 1975 and 1986. He also wrote a popular biography of the 18th-century politician [[John Wilkes]], who was influential in developing ideas concerning [[civil liberties]] in [[England]] and the [[United States]]. The book, titled ''John Wilkes: The Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty'', was one of three finalists for the [[2007 Pulitzer Prize]] for biography. 

Cash taught university literature courses for forty-five years, including popular classes in the Bible and Greek and Roman literature. He retired from the [[State University of New York at New Paltz]] as one of a handful of faculty with the title of Distinguished Professor.

'''Baba House''' (also referred to as '''NUS Baba House''') is a museum in [[Singapore]], showcasing [[Peranakan]] history, architecture and heritage. It is a traditional [[Peranakan]] pre-war terrace-house which was formerly owned by the family of a 19th-century shipping tycoon [[Wee Bin]] who settled in Singapore, after arriving from the southern Chinese province of [[Fujian]]. The Baba House is also an outpost of the [[NUS Museum|National University of Singapore (NUS) Museum]] and co-managed by the NUS Centre for the Arts.&lt;ref name="pride"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suan Chiang|last=Tay|title=Peranakan Pride|publisher=Straits Times|date=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Built in the 1890s, 157 Neil Road is a residential terrace house located in the Residential Historic District of Blair Plain. The house and the surrounding area was gazetted for conservation by the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] of Singapore, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/publications/research-resources/books-videos/2009-03_neil_road_157.aspx|title=URA-NUS demonstration project : No. 157 Neil Road - The richness of Straits-Chinese architecture restored|website=Urban Redevelopment Authority|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2005, a S$4 million donation was made to the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) by Ms Agnes Tan, the last surviving daughter of the founder of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), the late Tun [[Tan Cheng Lock]]. This donation was given to the University to acquire the Wee family's  traditional Peranakan house along Neil Road. 

The house came into the Wee Family in 1910 when a matriarch of the family bought the house for her grandson, Wee Eng Cheng. 

The house was last owned and managed by Mr Wee Lin, the sixth-generation descendant of [[Wee Bin]].&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/arts-entertainment/the-gift-of-space|title=The gift of space|last=Yusof|first=Helmi|date=18 September 2015|website=The Business Times|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another donation of S$1.5 million was made to the University, for acquisition of two other shophouses along Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock in [[Malacca]]. These acquired houses will be restored and used for educating younger generations about Peranakan history, culture and architecture, while the two houses in Malacca to be used for study on conservation techniques of historical buildings. In gesture of appreciation for the donation, the University named the Singapore house as the ''Tan Cheng Lock Baba House''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sandra|last=Davie|title=Daughter of late businessman wants the young to learn the legacy|location=Singapore|publisher=Straits Times|date=2005-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House was officially opened by President of Singapore Mr [[S R Nathan]] on September 4, 2008 as the ''Baba House'', and opened to the public on September 15, 2008. Staff and students from NUS' School of Design and Architecture and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences' South-east Asia Studies Programme were involved in the restoration, which has elaborate and intricately carved wooden windows, doors and partition screens. About 70 per cent of the furniture in the House belonged to the Wee estate, while the rest of the items were acquired from Peranakan families in Singapore and Malacca. The first two storeys of the House showcase the Peranakan domestic interior, while artists showcase modern interpretations of Peranakan culture through the exhibition gallery on the third storey. At the same time, the House will also be a venue for Peranakan culinary and craft workshops to be organized by the [[NUS Museum]].&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;

==Display==
In contrast to the [[Peranakan Museum]], the Baba House enables visitors to experience more intimately how typical Peranakan homes looked and functioned in the 1920s, the Golden Era of Peranakan culture in Singapore. It is a showcase of lavishly carved antique furniture and items used by Chinese Peranakans of that time. 

The venue may be booked for culturally relevant events as part of the experience-making process.&lt;ref name="differently"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shetty |first=Deepika |url=http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,11008, |title=Telling Baba story differently |publisher=Straits Times |date=2008-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316152219/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View%2C11008%2C |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House can be visited by appointment only and bookings to join the weekly guided tours (limited to 14 people per tour) can be made through the NUS Museum.

[[File:Compass rose from Catalan Atlas (1375).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Detail of Catalan Atlas, the first [[compass rose]] depicted on a map.]]
The '''Catalan Atlas''' ({{lang-ca|Atles català}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈalːəs kətəˈla|ec}}, archaic spelling: ''Atlas Catalan'') is the most important map of the [[medieval]] period in the [[Catalan language]] (drawn and written in 1375).&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The late medieval age of crisis and renewal, 1300-1500" /&gt; It was produced by the [[Majorcan cartographic school]] and is attributed to [[Cresques Abraham]] (also known as "Abraham Cresques"), a Jewish book [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminator]] who was self-described as a master of the maps of the world as well as compasses.&lt;ref name="To the Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps that Change the World" /&gt; It has been in the royal library of France (now the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) since the time of [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]]. The Catalan Atlas originally consisted of six [[vellum]] leaves (each circa 65cm by 50cm) folded vertically, painted in various colors including gold and silver. These were cut in half later, and mounted on wooden panels enclosed in a leather binding. 

The first two leaves contain texts in Catalan covering [[cosmography]], [[astronomy]], and [[astrology]]. These texts are accompanied by illustrations. The texts and illustration emphasize the Earth's spherical shape and the state of the known world. They also provide information to sailors on tides and how to tell time at night. 

The four remaining leaves make up the actual map, with [[Jerusalem]] located close to the centre; two depict the Orient and the remaining two Europe and North Africa. The map is around 1.3 square metres in size. The map shows illustrations of many cities, Christian cities with a cross, other cities with a dome, and with each city's political allegiance indicated by a flag. Wavy blue vertical lines are used to symbolize oceans. Place names of important ports are transcribed in red, while others are indicated in black. The illustrations and most of the text are oriented towards the edges of the map, suggesting it was intended to be used by laying it flat and walking around it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Botton |first1=Jerry |title=Great Maps |date=2014 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=9781465435613 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HkRBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oriental portion of the Catalan Atlas illustrates numerous religious references as well as a synthesis of medieval ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'' and the travel literature of the time, especially [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Book of Marvels'' and [[Sir John Mandeville|Mandeville]]'s ''Travels and Voyage of Sir John Mandeville''. Many Indian and Chinese cities can be identified. The explanatory texts report customs described by Polo and catalogue local economic resources, real or supposed.

The Western portion is similar to contemporary [[portolan chart]]s, but contains the first [[compass rose]] known to have been used on such a chart.

A '''''condaghe''''' (&lt;small&gt;also spelled as&lt;/small&gt; ''condache'' &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; ''condake'', {{IPA-srd|konˈdaɣe}}; &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; ''fundaghe''), from the medieval [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] term ''kondake'' (from {{lang-grc-x-byzant|κοντάκιον|[[kontákion]]|the pole around which a scroll is wound}}), was a kind of administrative document used in the [[Sardinia]]n [[Giudicati|judicates]] between the 11th and 13th centuries. They are one of the earliest witnesses for the development of the Sardinian language and are an important source for historians of medieval Sardinia.

The original ''condaghes'' ({{lang-it|condaghi}}) were collections of acts of donations to churches or monasteries. Later ''condaghes'' were kept by noble families for recording inheritances, purchases, donations (''datura''), transactions (''tramutu'') and litigation (''kertu''), principally when relating to the church. The chief object of such records was to provide precise dates in case of legal dispute.

Physically, the first ''condaghes'' were scrolls: overlapping parchment manuscripts wound tightly around a ''kontákion''. Over time they took on the familiar form of a [[codex]] (like modern books). They were produced in the [[scriptoria]] of monasteries and cathedrals, but the great majority have been lost. Only some ''condaghes'' have been preserved, with most of them being of ecclesiastical kind like the ''condaghes'' of the monasteries of [[Santa Maria di Bonarcado]] (''Sancte Marie de Monarcanto'' or ''Bonorcadu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfsvirdis/bonarcado_edizione.pdf Condaghe of Saint Mary of Bonarcado]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[San Michele di Salvennor]] (''San Miguel de Salvennor'', the document of which we have only a translation into Spanish from an original Sardinian copy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfssalvennor/salvennor_condaghe.pdf Condaghe of Saint Miguel de Salvennor]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[San Nicola di Trullas]] (''Sanctu Nichola de Trullas''), [[San Pietro in Silki]] (''Sanctu Petru de Silki''), and of the [[Basilica of San Gavino]] (''Sanctu Gavinu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/files/documenti/pubblicazioni_pdf/cfssangavino/02condaghe.pdf Condaghe of Saint Gavin]&lt;/ref&gt;). There is only a single condaghe of laical kind left, the one of Judge [[Barisone II of Logudoro]].

The '''Custody Notification Schemes''' ('''CNS''') is a 24-hour legal advice and support telephone hotline for any Australian Aboriginal person brought into custody, connecting them with lawyers from the [[Aboriginal Legal Service]]. It is intended to reduce the high number of [[Aboriginal deaths in custody]] by counteracting the effects of [[institutional racism]].

[[File:Julieka Dhu Protest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|A protest calling for reform to prevent [[Aboriginal deaths in custody]].]]

The incumbent [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] voiced their opposition to the program, while the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] said they would consider the scheme though had made no commitments. The Labor Party did voice its support for the end of [[debtor's prison|jailing people for unpaid fines]].&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

In October 2017, the Australian federal government was reported to be urging states and territories to implement a CNS. [[Attorney-General of Western Australia]] [[John Quigley (politician)|John Quigley]] supported such a program, saying "I think it [is] life-saving legislation. I'm sure if they took [[Death of Ms Dhu|the late Ms Dhu]] into custody ... if the Aboriginal Legal Service [had] been contacted on day one it would have been a very different outcome." An online petition calling for the scheme was signed by almost 20,000 people in less than one week.&lt;ref name=cns/&gt;

On 21 May 2018, it was announced that the WA state government had reconsidered the offer from the federal government to fund a CNS, and that the service would be operational by the end of the year. The [[Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia]] will operate the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nit.com.au/wa-adopts-custody-hotline-in-wake-of-dhu/ |title=WA adopts custody hotline in wake of Dhu |date=May 30, 2018 |work=[[National Indigenous Times]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620143731/https://nit.com.au/wa-adopts-custody-hotline-in-wake-of-dhu/ |archivedate=20 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/wig-chamber/23368-wa-s-new-24-hour-welfare-line-to-reduce-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody |title=WA's new 24-hour welfare line to reduce Aboriginal deaths in custody |last=Coade |first=Melissa |date=4 June 2018 |work=Lawyer's Weekly |archiveurl=http://archive.today/2018.06.20-143832/https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/wig-chamber/23368-wa-s-new-24-hour-welfare-line-to-reduce-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody |archivedate=20 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://junkee.com/custody-notification-service-indigenous/159694 |title=WA Is Finally Taking Steps To Help Prevent Indigenous Deaths In Custody |last=Langford |first=Sam |date=22 May 2018 |work=[[Junkee]] |archiveurl=http://archive.today/2018.06.20-143247/http://junkee.com/custody-notification-service-indigenous/159694 |archivedate=20 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 29 August the system has not been implemented due to inadequate funding, though negotiations for funding were ongoing, with John Quigley saying he hoped the service would be operational soon.&lt;ref name=August&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/29/states-failing-to-take-up-lifesaving-phone-service-for-indigenous-prisoners |title=States failing to take up lifesaving phone service for Indigenous prisoners |last1=Wahlquist |first1=Call |last2=Allam |first2=Lorena |date=August 29, 2018 |work=[[Guardian Australia]] |archiveurl=http://archive.today/2018.08.29-132922/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/29/states-failing-to-take-up-lifesaving-phone-service-for-indigenous-prisoners |archivedate=August 29, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2018, the Northern Territory has agreed to implement a CNS, though other states had not. Representatives from South Australian and Queensland argued they already had their own adequate systems in place, while Tasmania said they were considering the system though had not made a decision. Victoria is expected to be the next state to introduce a CNS.&lt;ref name=August/&gt;

'''Daniel J. Kevles''' (born 2 March 1939 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an American [[history of science and technology|historian of science]] best known for his books on American physics and eugenics and for a wide-ranging body of scholarship on science and technology in modern societies. He is Stanley Woodward Professor of History, Emeritus at [[Yale University]] and J. O. and Juliette Koepfli Professor of the Humanities, Emeritus at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://history.yale.edu/people/daniel-kevles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hss.caltech.edu/content/daniel-j-kevles&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Kevles received the [[George Sarton Medal]] of the [[History of Science Society]], awarded for "a lifetime of scholarly achievement". In 1999 his book ''The Baltimore Case'' was awarded the History of Science Society's [https://hssonline.org/about/honors/watson-davis-and-helen-miles-davis-prize/ Watson Davis Prize] for best book in the history of science directed to a wide public. Kevles is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and the [[Society of American Historians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oah.org/lectures/lecturers/view/959|title=Organization of American Historians: Daniel J.

In 2000 the mathematician [[Serge Lang]] waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent Kevles from being granted tenure at Yale, claiming that Kevles' book ''The Baltimore Case'' was too sympathetic to [[David Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim R.A. Cooper,"Yale to tenure two science history stars; Professors to boost ailing humanities program" (''[[Yale Daily News]],'' 20 Jan. 2000, pp. 1, 4); T.R.A.

== Research ==
Kevles' research has focused primarily on the history of [[science in America]] and the interactions between [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|science and society]]. A central theme in much of his work has been the tension between elite science and the norms of democratic control. He is best known for his accessible and original interpretative [[History of physics|histories of physics]] and [[eugenics]], and for an extensive body of scholarship that ranges widely across the histories of the physical sciences, life sciences, and technology.

His books include ''The Physicists'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31412171|title=The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America|last=Kevles|first=Daniel J.|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674666569|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=31412171}} See also {{cite journal|author=Samios, N.

The story of  '''Daniel in the lions' den''' (chapter 6 in the [[Book of Daniel]]) tells how [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] is raised to high office by his royal master [[Darius the Mede]], but jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree which condemns Daniel to death. Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, but unable to save him, the king has him cast into the pit of lions. At daybreak he hurries back, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, "because I was found blameless before him." The king has those who had conspired against Daniel, and their wives and children, thrown to the lions in his place, and commands to all the people of the whole world to "tremble and fear before the God of Daniel".{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=85-86}}

Modern scholarship agrees that Daniel is a legendary figure.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The book of which he is the hero comprises two parts, a set of tales in chapters 1–6, and the series of visions in chapters 7–12:{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}} the tales are no earlier than the [[Hellenistic]] period, and the visions date from the [[Maccabean]] era (the mid-2nd century BC).{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The stories were probably originally independent, but were collected in the mid-2nd century by the author of chapter 7 and expanded again shortly afterwards with the visions in chapters 8-12 to produce the modern book.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=7-8}}

Chapter 6, the story of Daniel in the lions' den, parallels chapter 3, the story of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|the "fiery furnace"]]: each begins with the jealousy of non-Jews towards successful Jews and an imperial edict requiring the Jews to compromise their religion, and concludes with divine deliverance and a king who confesses the greatness of the God of the Jews and issues an edict of royal protection.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=86-88}}

==Summary==
{{Daniel chapters}}
[[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] is raised to high office by his royal master [[Darius the Mede]]. Daniel's jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree that for thirty days no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but Darius himself; any who break this are to be thrown to the lions. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and the king, although deeply distressed, must condemn Daniel to death, for the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered.  Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, he has him cast into the pit. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and cries out anxiously, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that his God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, "because I was found blameless before him." The king commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children, and writes to all the people of the whole world commanding that all should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=85-86}}

==Composition and structure==

It is generally accepted that the [[Book of Daniel]] originated as a collection of [[Folklore|folktale]]s among the Babylonian diaspora, the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and [[Hellenistic]] periods (5th to 2nd centuries BC).{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=29,34-35}} Chapters 4–6, which includes the tale of Daniel in the lions' den, may belong to the earliest stage, as these differ quite markedly in the oldest texts.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=176-177}} Although the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, the tales of chapters 1-6, including the story of the lion's den, are the voice of an anonymous narrator (except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar).{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=295}} It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}}

Chapters 2-7 are in [[Aramaic]], and are in the clear form of a [[chiasmus|chiasm]] (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side):{{sfn|Redditt|2009|p=177}}
* A. (2:4b-49) – A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth
** B. (3:1–30) – Daniel's three friends in the fiery furnace
*** C. (4:1–37) – Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar
*** C'. (5:1–31) – Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar
** B'. (6:1–28) – Daniel in the lions' den
* A'. (7:1–28) – A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth

The story of Daniel in the lions' den in chapter 6 is paired with the story of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] and the "fiery furnace" in Daniel 3. The parallels include the jealousy of non-Jews, an imperial edict requiring Jews to compromise their religion on pain of death, and divine deliverance. Each story climaxes with the king confessing the greatness of the God of the Jews and issuing an edict of royal protection. In each case life is preserved through divine presence in the fire or the pit.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=86-88}}

The structure of Daniel 6 itself is also in the form of a chiasm:{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=124}}
:A. Introduction: Daniel’s success (vv.1-3)
::B. Darius’s edict and Daniel’s response (vv.4-10)
:::C. Daniel’s opponents plot his death (vv.11-15)
::::D. Darius hopes for Daniel’s deliverance (vv.16-18)
::::D'. Darius witnesses Daniel’s deliverance (vv.19-23)
:::C'. Daniel’s opponents sentenced to death (v.24)
::B'. Darius’s edict and doxology (v.25-27)
:A'. Conclusion: Daniel’s success (v.28)

{{further|Daniel in rabbinic literature}}
According to [[Josippon]], "the beasts in the den received Daniel as faithful dogs might receive their returning master, wagging their tails and licking him."  The [[Midrash Tehillim]] says that "the mouth of the den was closed with a huge stone, which had rolled of itself from Palestine to Babylon for that purpose" and that "upon this stone sat an angel in the shape of a lion, so that Daniel's enemies might not harass him."&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4871-daniel Daniel], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diaper''' is any of a wide range of decorative patterns used in a variety of works of art, such as [[stained glass]], [[heraldic shield]]s, architecture, and silverwork. Its chief use is in the enlivening of plain surfaces.

==Etymology==
For the etymology see "[[diaper]]". The Oxford dictionary gives the Greek ''dia'' for "cross" as in "diamond" or "diagonal," and ''aspros'', Greek for "white". A white diamond or white cloth is used on the diagonal, hence the diagonal lattice or reticulation in patterning.

==In art==
[[File:Diaper Flushwork (1608) at Bank Hall, Bretheton.JPG|thumb|Diamond or lozenge pattern diaper work from 1608 on the walls of [[Bank Hall]], Bretherton]]
In [[architecture]] and other [[decorative art]]s,  diaper is applied as a decorative treatment of a surface with a repeat pattern of squares ([[check (pattern)|chequers]]), rectangles, or [[lozenge]]s. Diaper was particularly used in mediaeval [[stained glass]] to increase the vividness of a coloured pane, for example the field in a shield of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell, Charles, Heraldry Historical &amp; Popular, London 1863, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; A stone wall may be decorated with such a pattern sculpted in [[relief]]; in [[brickwork]] the effect may be achieved by using bricks of  different colours, or by allowing certain bricks to protrude from the wall's surface to create a regular diamond-shaped pattern. In English [[flushwork]], limestone and dark knapped [[flint]] are used. [[Architectural glass|Windows]] may be set in a diamond-shaped lattice.&lt;ref name="vadnal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Medieval Art and Architecture: Diaper|last=Vadnal|first=Jane|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~medart/menuglossary/diaper.htm|accessdate=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese [[carved lacquer]], a convention developed by which the areas of sky, water and floor or ground that would be left largely blank in paintings are filled in with discreet patterns derived from textiles, known as "diaper backgrounds" and also "[[brocade]]-grounds"; this convention has continued to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Harry. "Diaper Backgrounds on Chinese Carved Lacquer", ''Ars Orientalis'', vol. 6, 1966, pp. 165–189. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629227 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
In [[heraldry]], '''diapering'''  is a technique in which those who emblazon, draw, paint, or otherwise depict [[Coat of arms|achievements of arms]] decorate large areas of flat colour by drawing [[hatching|crosshatches]] or [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s. There is no standard, and each artist is allowed individual idiosyncrasies.

===Excluded from blazon===
With very rare exceptions, diapering is not  a part of  the [[blazon]], but is mere decoration, or ornamental accessory. Thus a [[shield]] with diapering is considered the same as a shield of the same design but without diapering. For this reason diapering must not be so obtrusive or so heavily drawn that it could be mistaken for a substantive [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] or for a [[variation of the field]]. This is especially the case with diaper of simple cross-hatching which might be mistaken for a field of [[lozengy]].

===Exceptions===
There are at least three Scots coats whose blazon includes diaper: 
*Fulton of Lochliboside, ''Az. diapered or semy of fleurs de lys of the last, on a fess arg. two boar's heads erased of the field'' (Public Register vol 1, p 551, 1789);&lt;ref name=HandJB&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yINEv1wtFEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=Fulton+of+Lochliboside&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VXc91iiQ4Y&amp;sig=2lKF5kIRFVD76rrjlmdezKwFCPU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMgtPskcbZAhXK2KQKHRRIDQsQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fulton%20of%20Lochliboside&amp;f=false Hastings Paul and James Balfour Paul, An Ordinary of Arms: Contained in the Public Register of All Arms and bearings in Scotland, p. 159] Accessed 1 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FM12 NBC Respirator''' is a military [[gas mask]] produced by [[Avon Rubber|Avon]] in service with the [[British Armed Forces]] and various police forces.

==History==
The FM12 was introduced in 2000 as an intended replacement for the standard issue [[S10 NBC Respirator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avon FM12|url=http://gasmasksukreferences.webs.com/britain.htm|accessdate=2012-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904195427/http://gasmasksukreferences.webs.com/britain.htm|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in service from the 1980s. However the FM12 was never widely adopted by the military as it was deemed too similar to the S10 to warrant total replacement of all existing S10s.

It was used however when an individual could not be found an S10 that fitted his face, due to strange facial dimensions. They can occasionally be found on the surplus market but are considerably rarer than the S10.

==Characteristics==
Two filter canisters are issued for the FM12, as with the S10; a light pressed metal type for riot control situations or training (marked with a painted red stripe or red tape), and a heavier plastic encased type for protection against NBC agents. The latter have a maximum shelf-life of 10 years, and the mask itself (the facepiece) of 20 years. The mask was designed around the S10, but has several design differences. The characteristics it shares in common with the S10 are the fail-safe drinking device, a SST(Secondary Speech Transmitter), and the ability to accept corrective lenses on the inside of the eyepiece.

However, the voice emitter and exhale valve cover is smaller than that of the S10, as are the lenses. The FM12 has an overall lower profile than the S10 and sits closer to the wearer's face. The FM12's drinking tube is also longer than that of the S10, making drinking easier while wearing the mask. The FM12 also has an inner mask to prevent fogging of the lenses. The 'ridge' present around the edge of the S10 is also absent from the FM12.

The main noticeable difference between the FM12 and the S10 is the ability of some FM12's to mount 2 filters to the mask simultaneously, as was done by the SBS in the [[Gulf War]]. When only 1 filter is fitted to a mask that has the ability to accept 2 filters, a blanking plug must be used.

The harness of the FM12 consists of elastic strips, which connect to a mesh fabric piece on the back of the wearer's head. This change from the old style rubber straps on the S10 to the new elastic/fabric mesh was designed to enable the mask to be worn for longer periods of time without discomfort, and also to hold the mask tighter to the face for a better seal.

==Variants==

===CT12===
Respirator used for counter-terrorism operations. The difference between the FM12 and the CT12 is that the CT12 has had the drinking straw removed and sealed at the factory. This is to reduce the overall weight of the respirator as the drinking straw is rendered useless in a counter terrorist situation. This variant is considerably rarer than the FM12, which is rare enough in itself. These are only rarely found on the collectors market, and usually have a high asking price.

The '''Findern Manuscript''' (CUL MS Ff.1.6) is a paper codex written entirely in [[Middle English]] and compiled in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries by a series of [[gentry]] who were neighbors in the countryside of [[Derbyshire]]. A list of its major texts creates a “greatest hits” of fourteenth-century secular love literature; however the volume also contains around two dozen anonymous lyrics, which have been added in the blank spaces left at the bottoms of pages and the ends of quires.  There are several names and scribal signatures written into the book, including the names of five women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beadle|first=Richard|title=The Findern Manuscript: Cambridge University Library MS CUL Ff.1.6|year=1977|publisher=The Scholars Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Kate|title=The Origins and Make-up of Cambridge University Library Ms Ff.1.6|journal=Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society|year=1983|volume=8|issue=3|pages=299–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genocide denial''' is the  attempt to deny or minimize statements of the scale and severity of an incidence of [[genocide]]. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] defines the denial as the final stage of a genocidal process and the erasing of the memories of the victim group: "Following the physical destruction of a people and their material culture, memory is all that is left and is targeted as the last victim. Complete annihilation of a people requires the banishment of recollection and suffocation of remembrance. Falsification, deception and half-truths reduce what was to what might have been or perhaps what was not at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hovannisian |first=Richard G. | title=Remembrance and Denial: The Case of the Armenian Genocide | date=1998 | publisher=Wayne State University Press | isbn=081432777X | page=202 | url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kiBHkRtRmIIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23 | language=en | chapter=Denial of the Armenian Genocide in Comparison with Holocaust Denial}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial of genocide is usually considered a form of illegitimate historical revisionism. The distinction between respectable academic historians and those of illegitimate [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionists]] rests on the techniques used to write such histories. Accuracy and revision are central to historical scholarship. As in any academic discipline, historians' papers are submitted to [[peer review]]. Instead of submitting their work to the challenges of peer review, illegitimate revisionists rewrite history to support an agenda, often political, using any number of techniques and [[fallacy|rhetorical fallacies]] to obtain their results.

The [[European Commission]] proposed a European Union–wide anti-racism law in 2001, which included an offense of genocide denial, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. After six years of wrangling  a watered down compromise was reached in 2007 giving states freedom to implement the legislation as they saw fit.&lt;ref name=EthanMcNern&gt;Ethan McNern.

==Writing on genocide denial in general==
Gregory H. Stanton, formerly of the US State Department and the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], lists denial as the final stage of [[Genocide#Stages of genocide and efforts to prevent it|genocide development]]:

{{quote|Denial is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further [[genocidal massacre]]s. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Stanton, [http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm Eight Stages of Genocide], Genocide Watch&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Orwell]] writes in 'Notes on Nationalism' that

{{quote|The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English russophiles. Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one's own mind.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, [http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Israel Charny]], Executive Director of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in [[Israel]], describes genocide denial by putting it into the following categories:

{{quote|1. Innocence-and-Self-Righteousness
The respondents claim that they only intend to ascertain the truth. Moreover, they do not believe that human beings could have been so evil as the descriptions of the genocide imply. Furthermore, even if many deaths took place a long time ago, it is important to put them aside now and forgive and forget.

2. [[Pseudoscience|Scientificism]] in the service of confusion

The position taken is seemingly an innocent one that we do not know enough to know what the facts of history were, and rather than condemning anyone we should await the ultimate decision of research. This is a manipulative misuse of the valued principle in science that facts must be proven before they are accepted in order to obfuscate facts that are indeed known, and to confuse the minds of fair-minded people who do not want to fall prey to myths and propaganda. The very purpose of science, which is to know, is invoked in order to justify a form of know-nothingness.

3. Practicality, [[pragmatism]] and [[realpolitik]]

Here the claim is made that dealing with ancient history is impractical, it will not bring peace to the world in which we live today. One must be realistic and live through realpolitik.

4. Idea linkage distortion and time-sequence confusion

This is a dishonest linkage of different ideas, often out of time sequence, to excuse denials of the facts. Present needs, whether justified or not, are taken as a reasonable basis for censoring or changing the record of past history.

5. Indirection, definitionalism, and maddening

These are responses which avoid the issue by failing to reply, or no less by going off on tangents about trivial details that avoid the essential issue whether genocide took place. The avoidance can also be done in a seductive manner of acknowledging that the issue should be discussed, but then it never is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideajournal.com/articles.php?id=27 The Psychological Satisfaction of Denials of the Holocaust or Other Genocides by Non-Extremists or Bigots, and Even by Known Scholars – by Israel W. Charny&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Harms of Denial ==

Genocide denial has an immense impact on both victim and perpetrator groups. The denial not only affects the relations and the possible reconciliation between victim and perpetrator, but it also affects the identity of the respective group, impacting at large the society they live in. While confrontation of the committed atrocities can be a tough process in which the victim feels humiliated anew by reliving the past,&lt;ref name=”Margalit”&gt;{{cite book | last= Margalit | first= Avishai | title= The Ethics of Memory | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=HHG5mRuVXN4C | year=2002|publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-00941-X}}{{rp|61-64}}&lt;/ref&gt; it still has a benign therapeutic effect, helping the society to come to the terms with the past.&lt;ref name=”Amstutz”&gt;{{cite book | last= Amstutz | first=Mark R. | title= The Healing of Nations: The Promise and Limits of Political Forgiveness | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=gTFnh2GuD8EC | year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn=0-7425-3580-0}}{{rp|24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a therapeutic point of view, letting the victim confront the past atrocity and its related painful memories is one way to reach a closure and to understand that the harm has occurred in the past.&lt;ref name=”Colvin”&gt;{{cite book | last= Colvin | first= Christopher J. | chapter= The Healing of Nations: The Promise and Limits of Political Forgiveness | editor-first1= Katherine | editor-last1=Hodgkin | editor-first2= Susannah | editor-last2= Radstone | title = Contested pasts: The politics of memory | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=J0VkXJT_zXoC | year=2003 | publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28647-6}}{{rp|156}}&lt;/ref&gt; By acknowledging the past errors, the relating memories are co-processed, “sometimes resulting in the narrator feeling a little better and the listener a little worse.”&lt;ref name=”Adler”&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1=Adler | editor-first1=Nanci | editor-last2= Leydesdorff | editor-first2=Selma | editor-last3= Chamberlain | editor-first3=Mary | editor-last4= Neyzi | editor-first4=Leyla | title= Memories of Mass Repression: Narrating Life Stories in the Aftermath of Atrocity | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=hTYrDwAAQBAJ | year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4128-0853-8}}{{rp|xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also helps the memories to enter the shared narrative of the society, thereby becoming a common ground on which the society can build its future on.&lt;ref name=”Avedian2018”&gt;{{cite book | last=Avedian | first=Vahagn | title=Knowledge and Acknowledgement in the Politics of Memory of the Armenian Genocide | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Tv7iuQEACAAJ | year=2018 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-13-831885-4}}{{rp|45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, denying recognition will have a negative effect, further victimizing the victim which will feel not only wronged by the perpetrator but also by being denied recognition of the occurred wrongdoing. This implies that the denial also has a pivotal role in shaping the norms of a society since the omission of any committed errors, and thereby the lack of condemnation and punishment of the committed wrongs, risks normalizing similar actions, rising the society’s tolerance for future occurrences of similar errors.&lt;ref name=”Avedian2018” /&gt;{{rp|110}} Scholars exemplify the latter aspect in the case of Republic of Turkey and how the Turkish state's [[Armenian Genocide denial]] has had far-reaching effects on the Turkish society throughout its history in regard to both ethnic minorities, especially the Kurds, but political opposition in general.&lt;ref name=”Avedian2018” /&gt;{{rp|48}} The denial also affects the self-image of the perpetrator by omitting the “righteous” individuals among its own ranks. This lack of differentiation between "we" (the righthous") and "them" (the wrongful "other") could result in a rather homogeneous perception of the nation in question, thus making the victim (but also third parties) to project the perpetrating role onto the entire society/nation, aggravating the prospects of future reconciliation.&lt;ref name=”Avedian2018” /&gt;{{rp|24}}

Denial of past committed wrongdoings by making calls to “let’s forget the past and look to the future” should generally be regarded as veiled attempts to escape responsibility. Bhargava notes that “[m]ost calls to forget disguise the attempt to prevent victims from publicly remembering in the fear that ‘there is a dragon living on the patio and we better not provoke it.’”&lt;ref name=”Bhargava”&gt;{{cite book | last= Bhargava | first= Rajeev | chapter= Restoring Decency to Barbaric Societies | editor-first1= Robert I. | editor-last1= Rotberg | editor-first2= Dennis F. | editor-last2= Thompson| title = Truth v. Justice: The Morality of Truth Commissions | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Y2h0bqpNh2UC| year=2000|publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-05071-6}}{{rp|52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bhargava’s words “It is well known that remembrance of past harm reinforces asymmetries of power. The fear of physical suffering in the future feeds on the remembrance of past acts of repression. Such thinking encourages passivity and obedience in victims, and this in turn serves the interest of the powerful. But such remembrance can cut both ways. If memory of suffering is kept alive, reprisal may occur at future, inopportune moments.”&lt;ref name=”Bhargava” /&gt;{{rp|52}} In the Armenian case, one could point to the committed terrorist acts during 1970s and 1980s (e.g. [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia| ASALA]] and [[Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide | JCAG ]] as a direct result of the Turkish state denial of the genocide.&lt;ref name=”Avedian2018” /&gt;{{rp|110}}

However, political contingencies could in certain cases necessitate some degree of denial (or at least holding back the entire truth) in order to promote a recovery and re-building a society. This approach is especially conspicuous in post-conflict societies where the prevailing power constellation might require a political trade-off in regard to past committed wrongs. This aspect was true in post-Apartheid South Africa where the perpetrating group was still in possession of power (judicial, police, army), risking political instability if they were put on trial and risked punishment.&lt;ref name=”Gutman”&gt;{{cite book | last1= Gutman| first1= Amy | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Dennis F. | chapter= The Moral Foundations of Truth Commissions | editor-first1= Robert I. | editor-last1= Rotberg | editor-first2= Dennis F. | editor-last2= Thompson| title = Truth v.

However, the society at large and the victims in particular will perceive this kind of tradeoffs as “morally suspect,”&lt;ref name=”Rotberg”&gt;{{cite book | last1= Rotberg| first1= Robert I. |  chapter= Truth Commissions and the Provision of Truth, Justice, and Reconciliations | editor-first1= Robert I. | editor-last1= Rotberg | editor-first2= Dennis F. | editor-last2= Thompson| title = Truth v.

Thus, a common refrain in regard to the Final Report (1998) by South Africa’s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was “We’ve heard the truth. There is even talk about reconciliation.

In some cases, e.g. the [[Armenian Genocide]], this denial is done explicitly, while in some other cases, e.g. in the case of the “[[Comfort women]]” and the role of the Japanese State, the denial is more implicit. The latter was evident in how an overwhelmingly majority of the surviving victims refused to accept a monetary compensation since the Japanese government still refused to admit its own responsibility (the monetary compensation was paid through a private fund rather than by the state, a decision perceived by the victims about state's refusal to assume any direct responsibility).&lt;ref name=”Minow”&gt;{{cite book | last=Mionw | first=Martha | title= Between Vengeance and Forgiveness: Facing History After Genocide and Mass Violence | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=8MRQCwAAQBAJ | year=1998 | publisher= Beacon Press, cop. |isbn= 0-8070-4506-3 }}{{rp|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George McCall Theal''' (11 April 1837, [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] – 17 April 1919, [[Wynberg, Cape Town]]), was the most prolific and influential South African historian, archivist and genealogist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

==Life history==

The son of Canadian physician, William Young Theal, who wanted him to become an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] minister, Theal left home early, sailing with his uncle, Captain Francis Peabody Leavitt,{{efn|see [[Thomas Leavitt (banker)]] }} and lived briefly in the United States and Sierra Leone before emigrating to South Africa. There he became a teacher but soon moved to journalism, publishing, and an unsuccessful stint as an amateur diamond miner, all in South African frontier communities. His career as a historian began with the publication of his ''Compendium of South African History and Geography'' in 1873 following his return to teaching.

Theal spent five years at the [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]] Seminary outside [[Alice, Eastern Cape|Alice]] in the [[Eastern Cape]], working amongst missionaries and Africans. Lovedale was an important institution in the early 1870s, being a non-sectarian and non-denominational theological seminary and Christian school, founded by Presbyterian missionaries in 1841. Lovedale's principal, Dr. James Stewart, attached great importance to the teaching of printing and bookbinding. In 1872 Stewart needed someone who could teach and manage the printing works – Theal was the man. He had taught first at an elementary school in [[Knysna]] and from 1867 at a public school in [[King William's Town]], later to become [[Dale College Boys' High School]]. He had also been editor of three minor British Kaffrarian newspapers between 1862 and 1865, and later worked for the ''Kaffrarian Watchman'' in King William's Town, where he printed his first contribution ''South Africa As It Is'' in 1871. From King William's Town he had travelled to [[Du Toit's Pan]], then seen as the richest diamond mine in the world, and was present when Britain raised the Union Jack over the area. Theal wrote some articles for the ''Diamond News'' and called the takeover "a most disastrous change". Having failed to make his fortune on the diamond fields, he returned to the Eastern Cape. Theal was a religious man, and thus believed that it was the civilised white man's duty to rescue the black man from ignorance and barbarism (in common with others of that period, he saw it in racial terms as well) This made him ready to accept the Lovedale post. 

While living in King William's Town, he had read everything available on the history of South Africa and had started on an outline of his own rendition which was a synthesis of all he had read.

By 1875 at Lovedale he was teaching history, geography, English grammar and history of the Bible, and also being in charge of the printing department. He was responsible for the monthly publication of the ''[[Xhosa language newspapers|Kaffir Express]]'' (later the ''Christian Express'') and for the Xhosa version. The press published mainly religious and educational works. Between 1879 and 1882 Theal wrote a large number of articles for various periodicals on South African history. His knowledge of the Bantu was so extensive that in 1877 he was requested by Sir [[Bartle Frere]] to persuade some belligerent Bantu chiefs to moderate their attitude. Theal's success in this role led to his being offered a post in the Treasury. He accepted this position, aware that he would then have access to the State archives which were housed in the Surveyor-General's office.

'''Gruffydd Aled Williams''' , BA, PhD, FLSW (born 1943) is a scholar who specialises in Welsh medieval poetry and [[Renaissance literature]]. He was brought up in [[Dinmael]], Denbighshire, and [[Glyndyfrdwy]] in the former county of Merioneth (now in Denbighshire). Educated at Glyndyfrdwy Primary School, Llangollen Grammar School (later Ysgol Dinas Brân) and the [[University College of North Wales]], Bangor, he graduated in Welsh in 1964. From 1965 to 1970 he was Assistant Lecturer in Welsh at [[University College, Dublin]], and from 1970 he was Lecturer, Senior Lecturer (1984) and Reader (1991) in the Department of Welsh at the [[University of Wales, Bangor]]. In 1995 he was appointed Professor of Welsh and Head of the Department of Welsh at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] (later Aberystwyth University), a post he held until his retirement in 2008. He is now an Emeritus Professor of the university.

Williams is the author of over 50 articles on medieval poetry and Renaissance literature in periodicals and academic journals on medieval poetry and Renaissance literature. His book ''Ymryson Edmwnd Prys a Wiliam Cynwal'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;(Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1986), pp. cxcv + 347.&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded the University of Wales' Sir Ellis Griffith Prize. In 1994 he published an edition of the poetry attributed to Owain Cyfeiliog (d. 1170).&lt;ref&gt;In ''Gwaith Llywelyn Fardd I ac Eraill o Feirdd y Ddeuddegfed Ganrif'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1994), 194-277.&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring he has concentrated his research on the history of Owain Glyndŵr and the literature associated with him. He delivered the British Academy's Sir John Rhŷs Memorial Lecture in 2010 on "More than 'skimble-skamble stuff': the Medieval Poetry Associated with Owain Glyndŵr"" (published 2012),&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the British Academy'', 181 (2012), 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 he contributed two articles to ''Owain Glyndŵr: A Casebook'', ed. J. K. Bollard and Michael Livingston.&lt;ref&gt;'Owain Glyndŵr: the Name', ''op.cit.'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2013), 431-4; 'The Later Welsh Poetry Referencing Owain', ''ibid.'', 519-550.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 his book ''Dyddiau Olaf Owain Glyndŵr'' (2015)&lt;ref&gt;(Talybont: Y Lolfa, 2015), pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; won the Creative Non-fiction category in Literature Wales's Book of the Year competition.

Williams edited ''Llên Cymru'', the leading academic journal in the field of Welsh literary history, from 1997 until 2012. He is the President of the Merioneth Historical and Record Society and a member of the Council of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]]. He was elected to the White Robed Order of the Gorsedd of Bards in 2002 and as a Fellow of the [[Learned Society of Wales]] in 2014.

Williams is married to Éimear (née Ní Fhloinn) and they have two sons and one daughter.

'''Veleia''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town in [[Hispania]], now located in the  [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]], [[Spain]]. The site is located in the municipality of [[Iruña de Oca]], 10&amp;nbsp;kilometers west of [[Vitoria (Spain)|Vitoria]]. The town was an important station on the [[Roman road]] ''[[ab Asturica Burdigalam]]'' that ran parallel to the coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]]. At its apogee, the city could have been inhabited by some five to ten thousand people,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and apparently went through different cycles of prosperity and decline into the [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] until it was finally abandoned.

It has been argued (e.g. J.M.Lacarra) that the location of Iruña is actually the ''Victoriacum'' founded by [[Liuvigild]] in his campaigns against the [[Vascones]] (581), since only a very small portion of the actual town has been unearthed so far by archaeologists.

The archaeological site of Iruña-Veleia is the most important from the Roman period in the Basque Country.&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/pais/vasco/Alava/querella/responsables/fraude/Veleia/elpepuespvas/20090325elpvas_11/Tes "Álava se querella contra los responsables del fraude de Veleia"], ''El País'', 2009-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged to contain the oldest known texts written in the [[Basque language]] as well as, allegedly, the oldest representation of the [[calvary|crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]] found to date, but later it was said that the findings were [[archaeological forgery|forgeries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{eu icon}} [http://sustatu.com/1227160971 "Veleia: disparateen zerrenda"], ''Sustatu'',  2008-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/pais/vasco/arqueologos/abandonaron/Veleia/hallazgos/2006/elpepuespvas/20081122elpvas_12/Tes "Tres arqueólogos abandonaron Veleia tras los hallazgos de 2006"], ''El País'', 2008-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Iruna-Veleia/culebron/arqueologico/elpepicul/20081206elpepicul_1/Tes "Iruña-Veleia, culebrón arqueológico"], ''El País'', 2008-12-06,&lt;/ref&gt; based on the opinions of some scholars. However, other authors favor their genuinely ancient provenance, in agreement with the stratigraphic dating performed by the archaeologists who made the discoveries. The dispute is currently unresolved.

==Chronology==

===Bronze and Iron ages===

The town was founded in the 8th century BC, in the Late [[Bronze Age]]. The houses from this period, rectangular and round with adobe walls and thatched roofs, are similar to those found at the nearby site of Atxa (Vitoria).

===Roman period===

In the first half of the 1st century some of these houses were replaced by others of Roman style (''[[domus]]''). This architectural romanization continued as the century advanced.

The late Roman city (3rd and 4th centuries) is better known. It shows signs of decay and the construction of a wall that encloses an eleven hectare area. The town survived into the 5th century after Roman power had disappeared from the region, but by the end of the century only burial plots in abandoned buildings are found.

===Modern age===

There was an abbey at the site at least since the 16th century whose buildings remained visible until the mid 19th century.

==Sensational findings and forgery case==

The Iruña-Veleia site had been granted 3.72 million [[euro]]s funding by the Basque regional government. In 2006, a series of sensational findings at Iruña-Veleia were announced to the press by the director of the archaeological mission. These included what would have been the oldest non-[[onomastic]]al texts in [[Basque language|Basque]], which were hailed as the first evidence of written Basque.

Also, it was announced the discovery of a series of inscriptions and drawings on pottery fragments, some of which refer to [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian history]] and even some written in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Finally, it was announced the finding of the earliest representation of the [[Calvary]] (crucifixion of Jesus) found anywhere to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.noticiasdealava.com/ediciones/2006/06/09/sociedad/alava/d09ala14.375086.php "Un maestro entre el Nilo y el Zadorra"]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''Diario de Noticias de Álava'', 2006-06-09; [http://www.noticiasdealava.com/ediciones/2006/06/09/sociedad/alava/d09ala14.375087.php "En Veleia hubo alguien muy culto y de alto 'status', que dominaba la historia egipcia y sabía escribir jeroglíficos"], ''El País'', 2006-06-09; [http://www.noticiasdealava.com/ediciones/2006/06/09/sociedad/alava/d09ala6.375101.php "Aparecen en Veleia restos de inscripciones en euskera del siglo III y de temática cristiana"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006151031/http://www.noticiasdealava.com/ediciones/2006/06/09/sociedad/alava/d09ala6.375101.php |date=2007-10-06 }}, ''Noticias de Álava'', 2006-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, a committee of experts, the "Comisión Científica Asesora" ("Scientific Advisory Committee") was constituted by the provincial government of Álava to study the findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=López de Lacalle Arizti|first1=Lorena|title=Nota de la Diputada de Euskera, Cultura y Deportes, Lorena López de Lacalle Arizti|url=https://www.araba.eus/publicar/Veleia/AFADFA_IV_Nota.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was made up of nine academics, all professors of the University of the Basque Country in Vitoria, along with three members of the provincial government of Álava, the director of the Provincial Museum of Archaeology, and the director of the excavation, and was presided over by one of the members of the provincial government of Álava.

On November 19, 2008, it was publicly announced that all these inscriptions, some 400 in total, were [[archaeological forgery|forgeries]], a conclusion allegedly reached, unanimously, by the members of the committee who analyzed the data for almost 10 months. According to the press releases, the texts were described in some reports as "crude manipulation," "incoherent," having texts and words both "incorrect and non-existent", and as being so "obviously false as to be almost comical."&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/11/19/cultura/1227128228.html "Los expertos concluyen que los grafitos en euskera del siglo III son 'totalmente falsos'"], ''El Mundo'', 2008-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dubbed by some as the "biggest archaeological fraud in the history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/pais/vasco/Diputacion/alavesa/relega/Amelia/Baldeon/museo/segunda/fila/elpepuespvas/20090304elpvas_11/Tes "La Diputación alavesa relega a Amelia Baldeón a un museo de segunda fila"], ''El País'', 2009-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the product of an elaborate hoax."&lt;ref&gt;{{eu icon}} Barandiaran, Alberto, [http://paperekoa.berria.info/plaza/2012-11-30/042/001/iruzur_bitxiena_eta_ikusgarriena.htm «Iruzur bitxiena eta ikusgarriena»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207044632/http://paperekoa.berria.info/plaza/2012-11-30/042/001/iruzur_bitxiena_eta_ikusgarriena.htm |date=2012-12-07 }}, ''Berria'', 2012-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ultimately, one of the members of the committee, Prof. Julio Núñez, became the new director of the Iruña-Veleia archaeological excavations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La UPV-EHU, con Julio Nuñez al frente, redactará el Plan Director de Iruña-Veleia|url=http://gara.naiz.eus/paperezkoa/20091106/165189/es/La-UPV-EHU-Julio-Nunez-frente-redactara-Plan-Director-Iruna-Veleia|publisher=Gara|date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provincial government of Alava pursued legal actions against the alleged perpetrators of the supposed fraud.&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elcorreodigital.com/alava/20090303/sociedad/diputacion-aporta-fiscal-nuevas-20090303.html "La Diputación aporta al fiscal nuevas pruebas sobre el engaño de Veleia. Una empresa alemana afirma que los gráficos aportados por Cerdán para autentificar los hallazgos «son una copia» de su manual"], ''El Correo'', 2009-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The sponsors of the project (Euskotren) also brought charges against the archaeological team, but the case was dismissed, and only the lawsuit filed by the provincial government of Alava remains in force.

==Expert opinions favorable to the authenticity of the findings at Iruña-Veleia==

The  provincial government of Álava, together with several members of the expert committee constituted by it, publicly announced on November 19, 2008, that the opinion reached by this committee had been unanimous, namely that the findings at the Iruña-Veleia site were forgeries. The committee did not produce any formal consensual agreement.&lt;ref name=DFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Veleia: documentación|url=https://www.araba.eus/publicar/Veleia/|website=araba.eus|publisher=Diputación Foral de Álava}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the 14 reports authored by its members or their external advisors explicitly asserted that the graffiti found at the site were forgeries.&lt;ref name=DFA /&gt; The analyses of physical evidences were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madariaga|first1=Juan Manuel|title=Estudio e investigación del yacimiento de Iruña-Veleia. Análisis químicos|url=https://www.araba.eus/publicar/Informes/Veleia_Inf_24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist Dominic Perring, who acted as external advisor to the committee, stated that "The final word on the subject must await definitive publication by leading scholars of the epigraphy and textual sources of the period […] Above all, the conclusions drawn need to be peer-reviewed by leading international scholars in the field" and proposed carrying out control excavations at the site by independent archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perring|first1=Dominic|title=An evaluation of the reliability of the stratigraphic sequences and findings described in the "Report on the discoveries of exceptional graffiti in the Roman city of Veleia (Iruña de Oca, Alava)" prepared by Idoia Filloy Nieva and Eliseo Gil Zubillaga|url=https://www.araba.eus/publicar/Informes/Veleia_Inf_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 no peer-reviewed study has been published supporting the falsehood of the findings and no control excavations have been performed at the site. Subsequently to the announcement of November 2008, a number of reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reports on Iruña-Veleia|url=http://www.sos-irunaveleia.org/informes|website=SOS Iruña-Veleia|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; conference presentations, books, journal articles and videos favoring the authenticity of the Iruña-Veleia findings have been made public, many authored by scholars in different fields, including archaeologist [[Edward Harris (archaeologist)|Edward Harris]], author of the stratigraphic method used by the archaeologists at Iruña-Veleia and by most archaeologists today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Edward|title=Iruña-Veleia archaeological assessment|url=http://sos-veleia1.wdfiles.com/local--files/harris/Info-Harris.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Edward|title=Iruña-Veleia: they did a superb job (1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8BXT0fwa9U&amp;feature=youtu.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Edward|title=Iruña-Veleia: they did a superb job (2)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMIcxerbY-o&amp;feature=youtu.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Edward|title=Es imposible falsificar los 400 grafitos de Iruña-Veleia|url=http://www.naiz.eus/es/hemeroteca/gara/editions/2015-11-18/hemeroteca_articles/es-imposible-falsificar-los-400-grafitos-de-iruna-veleia|publisher=Gara}}&lt;/ref&gt; epigraphist and Professor of Ancient History at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, Antonio Rodríguez Colmenero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodríguez Colmenero|first1=Antonio|title=Iruña-Veleia: sobre algunos grafitos singulares aparecidos en las excavaciones arqueológicas de la ciudad romana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">'''Johannes''', or '''Johann Friedrich Gottlieb Falke''' (20 April 1823 – 2 March 1876) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]].

He was born at [[Ratzeburg]]. Entering the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] in 1843, he soon began to devote his attention to the history of the [[German language]] and literature, and in 1848 went to [[Munich]], where he remained five years, and diligently availed himself of the use of the government library for the purpose of prosecuting his historical studies. In 1856 he was appointed secretary of the German museum at [[Nuremberg]], and in 1859, keeper of the manuscripts.

With the aid of the manuscript collections in the museum he now turned his attention chiefly to [[political history]], and, with Johann H. Muller, established a historical journal under the name of "Zeitschrift für deutsche Kulturgeschichte" (4 vols., Nuremberg, 1856-1859). To this journal he contributed a history of German taxation and commerce. On the latter subject he published separately ''Geschichte des deutschen Handels'' (2 vols., Leipzig, 1859-1860) and ''Die Hansa als deutsche See- und Handelsmacht'' (Berlin, 1862).

In 1862 he was appointed secretary of the state archives at [[Dresden]], and, a little later, keeper. There he began the study of Saxon history, still devoting his attention chiefly to the history of commerce and economy, and published ''Die Geschichte des Kurfürsten August von Sachsen in volkswirthschaftlicher Beziehung'' (Leipzig, 1868) and ''Geschichte des deutschen Zollwesens'' (Leipzig, 1869). He died at Dresden.

'''Juraj Sklenár''' (Georgius Szklenár) (25 February 1745 &amp;ndash; 30 January 1790) was a Slovak historian, pedagogue and Catholic priest.

== Life ==
He was born in Tiba, a manor-house near [[Levoča]]. Sklenár entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] as a novice in 1764 and become a doctor of philosophy. He worked in [[Levoča]], [[Trnava]], [[Prešov]] and [[Košice]]. After the abolition of the Jesuit order, he worked as a professor of rhetoric and deputy director at main royal grammar school in Pressburg (today's [[Bratislava]]). A part of Sklenár's works are [[Latin]] [[ode]]s and occasional speeches related to his pedagogic position. In the 1770s, he already become more known among scientists. In the ''Geographic Lexicon of the Kingdom of Hungary'' (1876) he is mentioned as the pride of [[Bratislava|Pressburg]].{{sfn|Tibenský|1958|p=93}} Sklenár, together with [[Juraj Papánek]], [[Juraj Fándly]] and [[Samuel Timon]] created the first scientific works about the earliest history of Slovaks. Slovak enlightenment historians already paid attention to [[Great Moravia]] and the mission of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], but did not adopt yet a deciding position. In 1784, Sklenár published his most important work ''Vetustissimus magnae Moraviae situs et primus in eam Hungarorum ingressus et incursus, geographice, historice, critice descriptus''. He tried to separate the history of Great Moravia from the Slovak history and proposed the location of its center to [[Sremska Mitrovica]]. According  to [[Richard Marsina]], regardless of this mistake, Sklenár belonged among most qualified and most critical historians of [[Anton Bernolák|Bernolák]]'s generations.{{sfn|Marsina|2014|p=3}}

'''Medina''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|d|iː|n|ə}}; {{lang-ar|المدينة المنورة}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Madīnah al-Munawwarah}}'', "the radiant city"; or {{lang|ar|المدينة}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Madīnah}}'' ({{IPA-acw|almaˈdiːna}}), "the city"), also transliterated as '''Madīnah''', is a city in the [[Hejaz]] region of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and administrative headquarters of the [[Al Madinah Region|Al-Madinah Region]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]. At the city's heart is [[al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] ('The Prophet's Mosque'), which is the burial place of the [[prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], and it is the second-holiest city in [[Islam]] after [[Mecca]].

Medina was Muhammad's destination of his [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijrah]] (migration) from Mecca, and became the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire, under Muhammad's leadership. It served as the power base of Islam in its first century where the early Muslim community developed. Medina is home to the three oldest mosques, namely the [[Quba Mosque]], al-Masjid an-Nabawi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hajinformation.com/main/h2022.htm |title=Masjid Quba' – Hajj |location=Saudi Arabia |publisher=Hajinformation.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] ('The mosque of the two [[Qibla]]s'). Muslims believe that the chronologically final [[sura]]hs of the [[Quran]] were revealed to Muhammad in Medina, and are called [[Medinan sura]]hs in contrast to the earlier [[Meccan sura]]hs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcMHD5WWL7AC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=quran+revealed+medina+Mecca&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n9wFTvG7F8q68gPK2IHfDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Historical value of the Qur'ân and the Ḥadith] A.M.

Just like Mecca, the city center of Medina is [[closed city|closed]] to anyone who is considered a non-Muslim, including members of the [[Ahmadiyya movement]], by the [[Politics of Saudi Arabia#National government|national government]]; however, other parts of the city are not closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What everyone needs to know about Islam |last=Esposito |first=John L. |authorlink=John Esposito |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2011 |page=25 |quote=Mecca, like Medina, is closed to non-Muslims |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wSVQI3Ya2EC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=non-muslims+in+Mecca&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fgNZT5LBC-mqiQK3iLiaCw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=non-muslims%20in%20Mecca&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mackeyMecca&gt;[[Sandra Mackey]]'s account of her attempt to enter Mecca in {{cite book|last=Mackey|first=Sandra|title=The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom|year=1987|pages=63–64|publisher=W.

==Etymology==
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Madīnah}}'' ({{lang|ar|المدينة}}) simply means 'the city'. Before the advent of Islam, the city was known as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Yathrib}}'' ({{IPA-ar|ˈjaθrib|pron}}; {{lang|ar|يثرب}}). The word ''Yathrib'' has been recorded in [[Sura]]t [[al-Ahzab]] of the [[Quran]].{{cite quran|33|13}}

Also called Taybah (Good) ({{IPA-ar|ˈtˤajba|}}; {{lang|ar|طيبة}}). And Tabah (in Arabic "طابة) (Similar in meaning to the latter) An alternative name is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Madīnah an-Nabawiyyah}}'' ({{lang|ar|المدينة النبوية}}) or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Madīnat an-Nabī}}'' ({{lang|ar|مدينة النبي}}, "the city of the prophet").

==Overview==
{{As of|2010}}, the city of Medina has a population of 1,183,205.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.sa/sites/default/files/ar-maddinah_1.pdf|title=The population of Medina 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhabitants during the pre-Islamic era Yathrib also included Jewish tribes. Later the city's name was changed to ''Madīna-tu n-Nabī'' or ''al-Madīnatu 'l-Munawwarah'' ({{lang|ar|المدينة المنورة}} "the lighted city" or "the radiant city"). Medina is celebrated for containing al-Masjid an-Nabawi and also as the city which gave refuge to him and his followers, and so ranks as the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;However, an article in [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200606/Saudi Aramco World] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} by John Anthony states: "To the perhaps parochial Muslims of North Africa in fact the sanctity of [[Kairouan]] is second only to Mecca among all cities of the world." [[Saudi Aramco]]'s bimonthly magazine's goal is to broaden knowledge of the cultures, history and geography of the Arab and Muslim worlds and their connections with the West; pages 30–36 of the January/February 1967 print edition [https://web.archive.org/web/20040624130307/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196701/the.fourth.holy.city.htm The Fourth Holy City]&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was buried in Medina, under the [[Green Dome]], as were the first two [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], who were buried next to him in what used to be Muhammad's house.

Medina is {{convert|210|mi|abbr=out}} north of Mecca and about {{convert|120|mi|abbr=out}} from the [[Red Sea]] coast. It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejaz territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.

The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.

The graves of [[Fatimah]] (Muhammad's daughter) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] (Muhammad's grandson), across from the mosque at [[Jannat al-Baqi]], and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of Muhammad's wife, [[Aisha]]), and of Umar (Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here. The mosque dates back to the time of Muhammad, but has been twice reconstructed.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;1954 [[Encyclopedia Americana]], vol. 18, pp.587, 588&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the Saudi government's religious policy and concern that historic sites could become the focus for [[idolatry in Islam|idolatry]], much of Medina's Islamic physical heritage has been [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|altered]].

==Religious significance in Islam==
{{Main|Muhammad in Medina}}
[[File:Dome_of_Prophet's_Mosque_-_Medina.jpg|thumb|The Green Dome of the Prophet's Mosque]]

Medina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of al-Masjid an-Nabawi. The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.

The first mosque built during Muhammad's time is also located in Medina and is known as the Quba Mosque. It was destroyed by lightning, probably about 850 CE, and the graves were almost forgotten. In 892, the place was cleared up, the graves located and a fine mosque built, which was destroyed by fire in 1257 CE and almost immediately rebuilt. It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.&lt;ref name="EA"/&gt;

[[Masjid al-Qiblatain]] is another mosque also historically important to Muslims. It is where the command was sent to Muhammad to change the direction of prayer ([[qibla]]) from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Mecca]] according to a [[Hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dawntravels.com/performing-hajj-umrah/ |title=Place Pilgrims Visit During or After Performing Hajj / Umrah |publisher=Dawntravels.com |date= |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Mecca, the city of Medina only permits Muslims to enter, although the [[Haram (site)|haram]] (area closed to non-Muslims) of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca, with the result that many facilities on the outskirts of Medina are open to non-Muslims, whereas in Mecca the area closed to non-Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built-up area. Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their [[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of [[Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.

Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Mecca counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&amp;translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:
{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, "Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people."}}

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Medina}}

===Before Islam===
By the fourth century, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad|tribes]] that inhabited the city into the 7th century AD: the [[Banu Qaynuqa]], the [[Banu Qurayza]], and [[Banu Nadir]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia 1"&gt;[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=326&amp;letter=M Medina]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] later reported that during the [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]]'s domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as [[tax collector]]s for the Persian [[Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;Peters 193&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:المدينة المنورة.PNG|thumb|left|Historic Medina]]
The situation changed after the arrival from [[Yemen]] of two new [[Arab]] tribes named Banu Aus (or Banu 'Aws) and Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became independent.&lt;ref name="Medina"&gt;"Al-Medina." ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the 5th century,&lt;ref&gt;for date see "J. Q. R." vii. 175, note&lt;/ref&gt; the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that "by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia 1"/&gt;

Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Peters 193; "Qurayza", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.&lt;ref name="Medina"/&gt;

Early Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of a pre-Islamic conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of "Tubba".&lt;/ref&gt; and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place "to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place." The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Ka'ba]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king "to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts." On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume 7–9, Peters 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 AD/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.&lt;ref name="balagh.net"&gt;Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.&lt;ref&gt;For alliances, see Guillaume 253&lt;/ref&gt; They fought a total of four wars.&lt;ref name="Medina"/&gt;

Their last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]&lt;ref name="Medina"/&gt; that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia 1"/&gt; The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.

===Muhammad's arrival===
{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}
In 622 AD/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background—pagan Arab or Jewish—were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' ("the Patrons" or "the Helpers"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.

According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim [[Muhajirun]] from Mecca, the local Muslims ([[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of [[Muhammad]]. The nature of this document as recorded by [[Ibn Ishaq]] and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this "treaty" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement—whether a single document originally or several—is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; "Muhammad", "Encyclopaedia of Islam"; "Kurayza, Banu", "Encyclopaedia of Islam".&lt;/ref&gt; In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kitāb ḏimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites – History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288–299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Badr====
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}
{{Main|Battle of Badr}}
[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]
The Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca.

In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]] and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.

As the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900–1,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hishām]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.

The battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three mêlée, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now both armies began firing arrows at each other. Two Muslims and an unknown number of Quraysh were killed. Before the battle started, Muhammad had given orders for the Muslims to attack with their ranged weapons, and only engage the Quraysh with [[melee]] weapons when they advanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2658 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2658] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2658 |date=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now he gave the order to charge, throwing a handful of pebbles at the Meccans in what was probably a traditional Arabian gesture while yelling "Defaced be those faces!"&lt;ref name="armstrong176"&gt;Armstrong, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lings148"&gt;Lings, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim army yelled ''"Yā manṣūr amit!"''&lt;ref&gt;"O thou whom God hath made victorious, slay!"&lt;/ref&gt; and rushed the Qurayshi lines. The Meccans, although substantially outnumbering the Muslims, promptly broke and ran. The battle itself only lasted a few hours and was over by the early afternoon.&lt;ref name="armstrong176"/&gt; The [[Quran]] describes the force of the Muslim attack in many verses, which refer to thousands of [[angel]]s descending from [[Heaven]] at Badr to slaughter the Quraysh.&lt;ref name="lings148"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran: [[Al-i-Imran]] {{cite quran|3|123|end=125|t=y|tn=y|style=nosup|expand=no|quote=Allah had helped you at Badr, when ye were a contemptible little force; then fear Allah; thus May ye show your gratitude.'''§''' Remember thou saidst to the Faithful: "Is it not enough for you that Allah should help you with three thousand angels (Specially) sent down?'''§''' "Yea, – if ye remain firm, and act aright, even if the enemy should rush here on you in hot haste, your Lord would help you with five thousand angels Making a terrific onslaught.'''§'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Muslim sources take this account literally, and there are several [[hadith]] where Muhammad discusses the Angel [[Gabriel|Jibreel]] and the role he played in the battle.

Ubaydah ibn al-Harith (Obeida) was given the honour of "he who shot the first arrow for Islam" as Abu Sufyan ibn Harb altered course to flee the attack. In retaliation for this attack Abu Sufyan ibn Harb requested an armed force from Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answering-islam.de/Main/Books/Muir/Life2/chap4.htm The Biography of Mahomet, and Rise of Islam.

Throughout the winter and spring of 623 other raiding parties were sent by Muhammad from Medina.

====Battle of Uhud====
{{Main|Battle of Uhud}}
[[File:Mount Uhud.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Uhud]]]]

In 625, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, Chieftain of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] of Mecca, who paid tax to the Byzantine empire regularly, once again led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew.
With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.

However, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.

However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.

====Battle of the Trench====
{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}

In 627, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).&lt;ref name="mantran"&gt;Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&amp;nbsp;— from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.&lt;ref name="mantran"/&gt;

===Capital city of early Islam and the caliphate===
[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]

In the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 AD/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[kaaba]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].

''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' ("city of the Prophet" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Under the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 AD/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.

In 1256 AD Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth,C. Edmund: Historic Cities of the Islamic World, p. 385 – "Half-a-century later, in 654/1256, Medina was threatened by a volcanic eruption. After a series of earthquakes, a stream of lava appeared, but fortunately flowed to the east of the town and then northwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fragmentation of the caliphate, the city became subject to various rulers, including the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] of [[Cairo]] in the 13th century and finally, in 1517, the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=jGZQL41tg_oC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=medina%20mamluks%20ottoman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jgsvGWUayD&amp;sig=I0CRjwIiRwYy_qbZSbo7NrrmSIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAmoVChMIs8XCloaZyAIVCzsUCh1dKQ2H#v=onepage&amp;q=medina%20mamluks%20ottoman&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|first=Selcuk Aksin|last=Somel|date=13 February 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I to Saudi control===
In the beginning of the 20th century, during [[World War I]], Medina witnessed one of the longest sieges in history. Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Francis (1994). ''Mecca: A Literary History of the Muslim Holy Land''. PP376-377. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-03267-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly sent the [[Relics of Muhammad|Sacred Relics]] of Medina to Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;Mohmed Reda Bhacker (1992). ''Trade and Empire in Muscat and Zanzibar: Roots of British Domination''. Routledge Chapman &amp; Hall. P63: Following the plunder of Medina in 1810 'when the Prophet's tomb was opened and its jewels and relics sold and distributed among the Wahhabi soldiery'. P122: the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II was at last moved to act against such outrage.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1920, the [[British people|British]] described Medina as "much more self-supporting than Mecca."&lt;ref name=Prothero103&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=103|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/103/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the First World War, the Hashemite [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sayyid Hussein bin Ali]] was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, in 1924, he was defeated by [[Ibn Saud]], who integrated Medina and the whole of the [[Hejaz]] into the modern kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]].

===Medina today===
[[File:Modern Medina.JPG|thumb|right|Modern city of Medina]]
Today, Medina ("Madinah" officially in Saudi documents), in addition to being the second most important Islamic [[hajj|pilgrimage]] destination after [[Mecca]], is an 
important regional capital of the western Saudi Arabian province of Al Madinah. Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.

==Geography==
The soil surrounding Madinah consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.

Al Madinah Al Munawarah is located at Eastern Part of Al Hijaz Region in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on longitude 39º&amp;nbsp;36'&amp;nbsp;E and latitude 24º&amp;nbsp;28'&amp;nbsp;N.

Madinah is located in the north-western part of the Kingdom, to the east of the Red Sea, which lies only {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} away from it. It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. Madinah is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh. For this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. The city is {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. Madinah lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39º36' east and latitude 24º28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.

Al Madinah Al Munawwarah is a desert oasis surrounded with mountains and stony areas from all sides. It was mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilisation during the thousand years before Christ.

==Climate==
Medina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May.

==Religion==
As with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion adhered by the majority of the population of Medina. Sunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the [[Nakhawila]]. Outside the city centre (reserved for Muslims only), there are significant numbers of non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.

The [[Knowledge Economic City, Medina|Medina Knowledge Economic City]] project, a city focused on knowledge-based industries, has been planned and is expected to boost development and increase the number of jobs in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1830/Economic_cities_a_rise.html Economic cities a rise] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924053753/http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1830/Economic_cities_a_rise.html |date=24 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is served by the [[Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport]] which opened in 1974. It handles on average 20–25 flights a day, although this number triples during the Hajj season and school holidays.

With the increasing number of pilgrim visiting each year, many hotels are being constructed.

{{See also|Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to [[Shirk (Islam)|''shirk'']] (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-destruction-of-Mecca-saudi-hardliners-are-wiping-out-their-own-heritage-8023992.html |title=The destruction of Mecca: Saudi hardliners are wiping out their own heritage |date=6 August 2005 |accessdate=17 January 2011 |last=Howden |first=Daniel |work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have described this as "Saudi vandalism" and claim that in Medina and [[Mecca]] over the last 50 years, 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicpluralism.org/764/islamic-heritage-lost-as-Makkah-modernises ''Islamic heritage lost as Makkah modernises''], Center for Islamic Pluralism&lt;/ref&gt; In Medina, examples of historic sites which have been destroyed include the Salman al-Farsi Mosque, the Raj'at ash-Shams Mosque, the [[Jannatul Baqee]] cemetery, and the house of Muhammed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/shrines/baqi.htm History of the Cemetery of Jannat al-Baqi] retrieved 17 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihail Roller''' ({{IPA-ro|mihaˈil ˈrolər}}, first name also ''Mihai'', also known as '''Rolea''' or '''Rollea''';&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Stoian, [http://www.romlit.ro/mihail_roller_ntre_nemuritorii_de_ieri_si_de_azi "Mihail Roller între 'nemuritorii' de ieri și de azi"], ''[[România Literară]]'', 32/1999&lt;/ref&gt; May 6, 1908 – June 21, 1958) was a [[Romania]]n communist activist, historian and propagandist, who held a rigid ideological control over Romanian historiography and culture in the early years of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. During his training in engineering, he rallied with the communist cells in Romania and abroad, joining the [[Romanian Communist Party]] while it was still an underground group. He collaborated with the [[Agitprop]] leaders [[Leonte Răutu]] and [[Iosif Chișinevschi]], spent time in prison for his communist activity, and ultimately exiled himself to the [[Soviet Union]], where he trained in [[Marxist historiography]].

Returning to Romania upon the close of World War II, Roller carried out communist assignments in the field of culture. Under Răutu, he helped draft the official history textbook, monopolizing the historical narrative for over a decade. Turning the focus away from nationality and on [[class struggle]], Roller's work sought to reeducate the traditionalist public, and depicted Romania as strongly linked to [[Slavic Europe]]. In advancing such theses, Roller censored out historical events, and, in one instance, recounted events that never took place in real life.

In the later 1950s, Roller found himself shut out by his communist peers. He was branded a [[Deviationism|deviationist]] by the party leadership members, probably because he had unwittingly exposed their secondary roles in early communist history. Roller died in mysterious circumstances, which do not exclude the possibility of suicide.

==Biography==

===Early life, education and underground activity===
Roller was born in [[Buhuși]], then a [[Communes of Romania|commune]] in [[Neamț County]], to a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family; his father was a functionary.&lt;ref name="plesa166"&gt;Pleșa, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; The boy completed his secondary education in [[Bacău]],&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; and soon became a sympathizer of the [[far left]] cause. The date of his affiliation with the banned Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), later Workers' Party (PMR), remains disputed. The formerly communist writer Mihai Stoian gives 1926, noting that it coincided with a strike action in Buhuși.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; Other sources suggest that he only joined in 1931.&lt;ref name="fantoma"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/mihail-roller-fantoma-rosie-a-istoriografiei-romanesti-924319.html "Mihail Roller, 'fantoma roșie' a istoriografiei românești"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Lucian Boia]] writes that Roller, like other communist men of his generation, could not have been a card-carrying member at that stage, since that would have formed material proof of conspiratorial activity. More likely, Roller was inducted through a verbal statement.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

A student at [[Berlin Institute of Technology]] and [[ParisTech]] between 1925 and 1931, Roller also joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in 1926 and the [[French Communist Party]] in 1928, working on their publications.&lt;ref name="plesa166"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt; Professionally, he qualified as a road and highway [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendent]].&lt;ref name="vasile136"&gt;Vasile, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to the country in 1931, he was made editor of the PCdR's main gazette, ''{{Lang|ro|[[Scînteia]]}}''.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt; As later noted by researcher Victor Frunză, the PCdR's clandestine nature and inner struggles make it impossible to know for sure who was in charge of ''{{Lang|ro|Scînteia}}'' by that moment in time. Frunză believes that Roller was one of the young men working under senior activist [[Ana Pauker]]; the others were Răutu, Chișinevschi, [[Vasile Luca]], [[Gheorghe Stoica]], [[Sorin Toma]], [[Gheorghe Vasilichi]] and [[Ștefan Voicu]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.241&lt;/ref&gt; Another fellow communist, [[Belu Zilber]], later noted that Roller was already designated the PCdR historian, and promised an official post in the event of a communist takeover.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; Such historiographic ambitions prompt historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]] to call Roller a "fantasizer" in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], Roller was also one of the Jewish and [[Bessarabia]]n "déclassés" who gained top PCdR positions in the Chișinevschi–Răutu faction, and in fact a staunch [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]].&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.102, 149-50, 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Roller was instructor for the central committee and served as secretary for its Lower Danube committee in the [[Galați]] area.&lt;ref name="plesa166"/&gt; He was arrested in 1933, 1934 and 1938, although never sentenced due to lack of evidence. Known as "engineer Roller" or "Rolea" in the files of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s {{Lang|ro|[[Siguranța]]}} secret police, he first attracted the authorities' attention following the discovery of a secret printing press in the national capital [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt; According to PCdR documents, between his arrests Roller negotiated [[popular front]] alliances with other socialist groups: in 1934, he was one of several "[[antifascist]] committee" members who carried out fusion talks with the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU) of [[Constantin Popovici (politician)|Constantin Popovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasile G. Ionescu, "Activitatea desfășurată în România pentru făurirea Frontului Unic Muncitoresc ca bază a unui larg front patriotic antifascist (1933—1936)", in [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]] (ed.), ''Din lupta antifascistă pentru independența și suveranitatea României'', [[Editura Militară]], Bucharest, 1971, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Roller, who also supervised the creation of workers' antifascist sections in Bucharest in September 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p.337&lt;/ref&gt; is mentioned as one of the PCdR and PSU activists who signed a formal protest against "the numerous abusive and illegal acts perpetrated by the organs of repression".&lt;ref&gt;[[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], ''În anii socialismului victorios'', [[Editura Politică]], Bucharest, 1976, p.193-4&lt;/ref&gt; His works of the time included political articles such as ''Fascismul și baza sa socială'' ("Fascism and Its Social Basis").&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{Lang|ro|Siguranța}} note of May 1937 mentions the publication of his first standalone brochure, titled ''{{Lang|ro|Din istoria drepturilor omului}}'' ("From the History of the Rights of Man") and prefaced by philosopher [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]. It was largely a posthumous homage to activist [[Constantin Costa-Foru]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.89&lt;/ref&gt; The police mentioned that this was already being sold in bookstores and by distributors of communist publications, and believed it was partly financed by the city's [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptist community]], to whom a chapter was dedicated. The brochure, found by the police to contain "extremist" passages, was in their view only being purchased by persons "suspected of communism". Once they found that it had not been approved by the state censorship apparatus, it was banned and all copies on sale ordered confiscated. A note from that October indicates that Roller was planning a new work about the [[1920 Romanian general strike|1920 general strike]], to be financed by the party.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt; The same year, he issued another concise tract, ''{{Lang|ro|Contribuție la istoria socială a României}}'' ("A Contribution to the Social History of Romania").&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

In 1938, Roller spent a brief term at [[Jilava prison]]. In his autobiography, Sorin Toma notes that conditions there were not as bad as at [[Doftana prison|Doftana]], but that 26 prisoners were given two buckets per day of drinking water and two to use as [[chamber pot]]s. Roller, suffering from a chronic disease, would drain one of the buckets himself and fill the other.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt; In 1940, Roller left for Bessarabia after the former province of Romania had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviets]]. Drawn into the PCdR group in Moscow, he worked under Ana Pauker. During World War II, he also attended the History faculty of [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plesa166"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;

Little is known about Roller's activity in early 1944, when the change of fortunes on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] signaled a Soviet victory over the [[Axis Powers]]. Reputedly, he stopped paying his PCdR membership fee, which may indicate that he was busy with party work, and prepared for a career in [[Communization|communized]] Romania.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

===Rise to power===
Back in Bucharest in autumn 1944 following the [[King Michael Coup]], Roller, using his Soviet ideological training to his advantage, joined the party's propaganda structures, in 1945 becoming deputy head of science and education at the central committee's [[Agitprop]] directorate, led by Leonte Răutu, and remaining in that post until 1955.&lt;ref name="plesa166"/&gt; The team comprising Roller, Răutu, Chișinevschi, Toma, [[Nicolae Moraru]] and [[Ofelia Manole]] was effectively in control of the entire directorate until 1953, and helped reconfigure [[Romanian culture]] in conformity with the [[Zhdanov Doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.148, 195, 212, 220, 304, 342-3. See also Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.326&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tismăneanu, Roller had become a "scribe" of Romanian communism,&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; one of several "fanatics" and "dilettantes" pushed up through PCdR promotions.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.17"&gt;Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihail Roller signaled his return to Romanian historiography with the 1945 essay ''{{Lang|ro|Pagini ignorate din istoria României moderne}}'' ("Pages Ignored from the History of Modern Romania"). It announced that the communist effort to reinterpret history had gained momentum: "The outlook of [[Dialectical materialism|dialectical]] and [[historical materialism]] also arms us with the basic principles of scientific historical research." Roller went on to state that the capitalist historians had turned history into an occult science, since "it was in the interest of [[imperialism]] abroad, and of the exploiting classes within, that the history of the people and its struggles become public." This process, he proposed, was reversible.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

However, political propaganda was still Roller's main task at that early a stage; for instance, he authored a series of articles in ''{{Lang|ro|Scînteia}}'' meant to combat the [[National Peasants' Party]] prior to the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.166, 171&lt;/ref&gt; His editorials in the communist press made successive returns into the realm of [[Marxist-Leninist]] historiography. At ''[[Contemporanul]]'', he outlined his suggestions about changing the chronology of Romanian history, and reinterpreted seminal events, such as the [[United Principalities|1859 union of Romania]], through a Marxist lens.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.292&lt;/ref&gt; Other such texts helped enshrine the myth of "illegalists" (clandestine communists of the 1930s and '40s) as freedom fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Șerban, "Ilegaliștii", in Boia, ''Miturile...'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

Also then, Frunză notes, Roller took part in the semi-compulsory [[Russification]] campaign, launching the agitprop slogan ''{{Lang|ro|Să învățăm limba lui Lenin și Stalin!}}'' ("Let's learn the language of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]!").&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.377&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-Soviet enterprise [[Editura Cartea Rusă]] published his tract ''Pedagogia în URSS'' ("Pedagogy in the USSR"), recommending the imitation of [[Education in the Soviet Union|Soviet schooling]].&lt;ref name="Vasile, p.269"&gt;Vasile, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1947, Roller's other party work involved exercising direct communist control over a left-wing student movement (the Democratic University Front) and instigating a purge of the "[[reactionary]]" professors.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p.188, 197.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputedly, Roller is also responsible for the refusal to accept a gift of [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s modernist sculptures, thus depriving the Romanian state of a major art collection.&lt;ref name="vasile136"/&gt; He also made a controversial contribution to the field of [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], joining up with Chișinevschi in the task of supervising [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasile, p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1948, following the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], he was elected to the [[Romanian Academy]] subsequent to the purge of a large number of members. Roller was part of a wave of new academicians, most of whom were of peripheral importance in their fields but were staunch adherents of communism and ready to act as ideological enforcers.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.286-9; Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.111, 301-2&lt;/ref&gt; Elected the Academy's Vice President (seconding [[Traian Săvulescu]]),&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; he also headed the Section for History, Philosophy, Economics and Law from 1949 to 1955. Roller believed the academy should shift from its former position of "a feudal caste, a closed circle, isolated from the masses and the people's needs" into "a living and active factor in the development of our science and culture". Moreover, he exhorted members, regardless of their specialty, to apply Marxist-Leninist teaching on society and its development, proletarian revolutions, the building of socialism and the victory of communism.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.166-7&lt;/ref&gt; When Săvulescu suggested that Academy publications should go uncensored, Roller intervened and reimposed "control", noting: "I am here to supervise and cut out those bits that catch my eye."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.309&lt;/ref&gt; Even the more traditionalist members of the communist academic establishment were irritated by Roller's interventions. Scholar [[Mihai Ralea]] allegedly called him "an incompetent, evil rube".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early program===
Reviewing the impact of such directives, Lucian Boia calls Roller "the little dictator" of Romanian historiography, unchallenged after the "earthquake" of 1948 had invented a Romanian Marxist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.109&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 to 1955, Roller was professor as well as chairman of the Romanian History department at the [[Carol I National Defence University|Political Military Academy]].&lt;ref name="plesa166"/&gt; In 1948, he published his own synthesis on the [[Revolutions of 1848]] among the Romanians: ''Anul revoluționar 1848'' ("1848, the Revolutionary Year"). That historical period was to be the main focus of his articles and exposes, well into the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanu, p.101, 103, 108-9, 112, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Roller was also a "historical reviewer" for a propaganda film retelling the 1848 events, with [[Geo Bogza]] as the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Cabel, ''Victor Iliu'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1997, p.33, 57-8.  {{ISBN|973-33-0366-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|1948 election]], Roller became a member of the [[Great National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.310-1; Pleșa, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1949, he and Răutu were delegates to the [[World Peace Council|Congress of Advocates of Peace]] under [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] (who reputedly eclipsed them both).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie Rad, [[Mircea Malița]], [http://www.romlit.ro/acad._mircea_malia_roller_i_rutu_nu_ieeau_din_vorba_lui_sadoveanu "Roller şi Răutu nu ieşeau din vorba lui Sadoveanu"], ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2013&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Roller rose to head the Agitprop section's education committee. This body was charged with writing school textbooks for use throughout the [[Romanian educational system|educational system]], most of them translated from [[Russian language|Russian]]. Under his direct tutelage, primary school pupils began learning about the "new teachers of the working class" ([[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], Lenin and Stalin), while Russian-language education began in 4th grade and continued through the third year of university.&lt;ref name="plesa166"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;

As a means of solidifying his control over Romanian historiography, Roller promoted his supporters at the academy's history institutes, especially the [[Nicolae Iorga Institute|Bucharest branch]], headed from 1953 by Victor Cheresteșiu and his deputy Aurel Roman. He was himself supported by a number of young researchers whom he had promoted and sent to study in the Soviet Union. He focused keenly on introducing ideology into higher education and party control over universities, and his general duties included supervision over science as a whole, not only history. His functions and execution of party orders meant that Roller essentially controlled all the historiography produced between 1948 and 1955. His words indicated the limits within which historians could practice their craft. In the view of historian Liviu Pleșa, Roller's activities sought to "uproot traditional values from the Romanian mindset" and replace them with the new regime's propagandistic themes.&lt;ref name="plesa167"&gt;Pleșa, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roller directives are infamous for emphasizing the supposed grandeur of the Soviet Union under Stalin, but also for praising [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] and the [[Slavic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.167; Tismăneanu, p.220, 326&lt;/ref&gt; The other ideas emphasized included the condemnation of other foreigners, particularly Westerners, starting with Ancient Rome—the French, Italian and American libraries were shut down, their patrons arrested; condemnation of the formerly dominant [[boyar]]s ("traitors" to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]) and [[bourgeoisie]] ("cosmopolitan" and "serving imperialist capitalists"); and minimization of the role played by historic Romanian figures.&lt;ref name="plesa167"/&gt; Described by traditionalist historians as Romania's war of national unity, World War I was treated by Roller and other Marxist-Leninists as an "imperialist war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''"Germanofilii". Elita intelectuală românească în anii Primului Război Mondial'', Humanitas, Bucharest, 2010, p.12-3.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania during World War I|Romania's participation]] was therefore an "imperialist action", as were the occupation of [[Bessarabia]] and the [[Hungarian–Romanian war of 1919|intervention in Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.167-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The official view of Romanian history that these ideas represented was developed by Agitprop activists and the PMR's own History Institute, later becoming dogma when approved by party plenaries and congresses. Authoritative texts included the writings of Stalin, the ''"Short Course" History of the Soviet Communist Party'', the decisions of the PMR's central committee and the writings and speeches of Gheorghiu-Dej. In the early years of the regime, scholars often imbued their work with an ideological tint by quoting Stalin or, to a lesser degree, Lenin. Taking their cue from a 1946 speech by [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Răutu and Roller sought to replace the "bourgeois-reactionary" and "anti-Romanian" old historiography with dialectical materialism; the latter warned that failure to write a new history "would have left in the hands of the class enemy an ideological weapon against the working class".&lt;ref name="plesa168"&gt;Pleșa, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Istoria R.P.R.''===
His history textbook, the first [[Marxist historiography|Marxist synthesis]] of Romanian history, appeared in 1947, in one edition for advanced pupils and another for younger ones. It portrayed the country's history through the lens of [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist stages of history]]: primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and socialism, advancing all the while through [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt; Initially called ''Istoria României'' ("The History of Romania") but later ''Istoria R.P.R.'' ("The History of the R[omanian] P[eople's] R[epublic]"), it appeared between 1947 and 1956 and was used until the 1961–1962 school year. Appearing very quickly ("in record time", according to Mihai Stoian),&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; it was not written from scratch by Roller and his collaborators, but rather used documents from the PCR's period of illegality, especially the theses adopted by the fifth party congress held near Moscow in 1931, which criticized the 1859 union, the [[Great Union Day|1918 union]], the constitutional government, democratic reforms, the monarchy, parliamentarism, the activity of the historic parties' leaders and foreign policy, with all these criticisms entering the textbook.&lt;ref name="plesa168"/&gt;

''Istoria R.P.R.'' earned its author the Romanian State Prize for 1949,&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; while Agitprop presented it as a huge success. Its claims (instantly sold-out editions, millions of copies in circulation) were in fact irrelevant, as there was no actual competition in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile, p.263-4, 270-1&lt;/ref&gt; The only history textbook allowed in schools, it has been described by [[Șerban Papacostea]] as "the vastest work of political mystification of Romania's past", making Roller "a symbol of the effort to adapt the Romanian past to the imperatives of the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] and the '[[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]' regime" imposed on the country.&lt;ref name="plesa168"/&gt; Boia also notes that, especially after adopting an acronym in its title, ''Istoria...'' overturned the logic of previous historiographic discourse, from the "national idea" to "the internationalist spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Stoian additionally suggests that ''Istoria...'' is a failure from a literary point of view. It is written in "[[Wooden language|wooden tongue]]" and its phrases have "the taste of sud".&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

The textbook's political ideas became historiographic theses and quickly turned into requirements for all the official history writing of the period. Class struggle was presented as the driving force of history, with social conflicts taken out of context and exaggerated in importance. A special case is the ancient history chapter, on [[Roman Dacia]]. There, commentators note, Roller veers into [[pseudohistory]], creating a narrative about social revolts among the [[Dacians]], none of which actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.110, 154-5; Pleșa, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Historic figures were relegated to the exploitative classes, the suppression of these classes by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] being justified by their centuries of misdeeds.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.110-1; Pleșa, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union was lavished with praise, the contributions of Slavs in Romanian history being highlighted, from the [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|migratory period]] to the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|medieval period]], to the [[Romanian War of Independence|War of Independence]] and the present.&lt;ref name="plesa169"&gt;Pleșa, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; The very [[origin of the Romanians]] was narrated differently than before: Roller himself concluded that the influence of Slavic polities—[[First Bulgarian Empire|Danube Bulgaria]], [[Kievan Rus']], [[Principality of Halych|Halych]]—was fundamental in shaping the lives of early Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.166-7&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Western values were attacked, more violently in later editions as the [[Cold War]] deepened.&lt;ref name="plesa169"/&gt;

The iconography of [[National awakening of Romania|national awakening]] was consciously modified. [[Michael the Brave]], previously depicted as a national unifier, was presented as a tool of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.208-9; Pleșa, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transylvanian School]] was renamed the "Latinist School", its leaders accused of hiding Slavic and Russian influence on Romanians and of promoting [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name="plesa169"/&gt; The 1848 rebellions, and in particular the successful [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution]], were described as precursors of Marxism-Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanu, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Of the leaders, only [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] was appreciated for combating feudalism and siding with Tsarist Russia; at the other end, [[Avram Iancu]] was chided for collaborating with the [[Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanu, p.108-9; Pleșa, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Roller's views of Bălcescu were almost entirely positive, and developed into a communist [[personality cult]]: counterfactually, Roller described Bălcescu's [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|left-liberalism]] as a highly advanced form of [[utopian socialism]] and proto-Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanu, p.103, 108-12; Cristian Ilie, "Anticomunistul Nicolae Bălcescu", ''Magazin Istoric'', July 2010, p.38-40&lt;/ref&gt; The 1859 [[United Principalities|union of the principalities]] only benefited the bourgeoisie by expanding the market for their products, and favored their class only, rather than the masses and the nation as a whole.&lt;ref name="boia110209; plesa169"&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.110, 209; Pleșa, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], who ruled over the unified state, was criticized as a hesitant reformer.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.328&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of [[Greater Romania]] in 1918 was viewed, as regards the absorption of Bessarabia, as an "imperialist intervention against the socialist revolution in Russia". Likewise, the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|union of Transylvania]], was an "intervention against the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|revolution in Hungary]]".&lt;ref name="boia110209; plesa169"/&gt; The modern era was considered to have begun not with the union of 1918 but with the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917; the paleolithic became "wild man" and the neolithic, "barbarism".&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plesa169"/&gt; Communist strikes and demonstrations during the [[interwar period]] were detailed and blown out of proportion, so that the 1917–1948 period was viewed mainly through the lens of PCdR history. Official history was laicized by greatly de-emphasizing the role of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Recent history presented in a negative light the political parties, the monarchy (according to Roller, "the most reactionary exemplar of its political class and the greatest owner of [[latifundia]]"), the democratic regime and its institutions.&lt;ref name="plesa170"&gt;Pleșa, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; The interwar chapter was headlined "The Increase in Romania's Enslavement to American, English and French Imperialism".&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

In this way, the class struggle and especially repression against the upper classes were legitimized: if the latter had stood against the masses for centuries, then taking away their properties through [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]] and incarcerating them seemed just. The events near the end of World War II were depicted as follows: the King Michael Coup was a "liberation by the Soviet Army" defending the country from imperialists; [[Northern Transylvania]] was restored thanks to the Soviets; the [[SovRom]]s aided in the country's economic recovery; the clauses favorable to Romania in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] were due to the Soviets, while punitive ones originated with the imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.169-70&lt;/ref&gt; Largely reliant on fabricated and backdated documents, the political history sections justified the PCdR/PMR repression of its enemies, including the "[[Social fascism|right-wing social democrats]]" and the [[Zionism|Zionists]].&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

Criticism from Romanian and especially Soviet historians, acting on instructions from the Kremlin, found the text insufficiently Marxist-Leninist. In 1950, one Soviet took issue with the way the Transylvanian School was presented, considering that its Latinist orientation made it a "vassal of the Papacy" and charging it with chauvinism against Slavs and [[Hungarians]]. A Soviet delegation that visited Romania in 1949 ended by criticizing a number of elements in Roller's text.&lt;ref name="plesa170"/&gt;

===Documentary, writing and enforcement activities===
At Roller's initiative, a vast number of historic documents were published. However, these were carefully selected to conform to the party's vision, particularly in volumes on the War of Independence and on the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt]]. For the first, documents casting Russia in an unfavorable light were removed, while for the second, documents not advancing the regime's desire to show the "savage repression of the bourgeois-landowning governments" were not published. Other collections were similarly doctored. For his work on the volume dealing with the peasants' revolt, Roller was again awarded the State Prize, first class, in 1951.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.170-1&lt;/ref&gt; Pleșa does give credit to Roller for ordering publication of documents from the country's medieval period, previously missing from print nearly in their entirety, and of an index to the [[Hurmuzachi]] collection that had become virtually unusable. Although professional historians worked on these projects, he also notes that Roller did not consent to have the documents published in their original form, especially due to the exigencies of working at a [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovite]] pace, and that the finished products did not reach a very high standard.&lt;ref name="plesa171"&gt;Pleșa, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped plan the Romanian-Russian Museum in Bucharest and the Maxim Gorky Institute of Higher Education, devoted to training teachers of Russian language and literature. The magazine of which he was editor-in-chief, ''{{Lang|ro|Studii}}'' ("Studies"), first appeared in 1948. This was quarterly until 1955, then bimonthly until 1974, when it became monthly and its name was changed to ''[[Revista de Istorie]]''. At the same time, magazines on a similar theme were shuttered: ''Revista Istorică'', founded by [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Constantin C. Giurescu]]'s ''Revista Istorică Română'', [[Victor Papacostea]]'s ''Balcanica'' and ''Revue des Études Sud-Est Européennes''.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;

A frequent target of Roller's many articles in ''{{Lang|ro|Scînteia}}'', ''{{Lang|ro|Lupta de Clasă}}'' and ''{{Lang|ro|Studii}}'' was the pre-communist historiography, which he accused of falsifying the role of the working class and of the masses more broadly. He reiterated that pre-communist historians served the "bourgeois-landowning" regimes dominated by "foreign imperialists", who wished the Romanian people to remain ignorant of their history so they could more easily be exploited.&lt;ref name="plesa171"/&gt; The rise of Roller coincided with a concerted effort by the new regime to wipe away traces of previous writers, so that works by historians including Giurescu, Papacostea and [[Nicolae Benescu]] were eliminated from the curriculum, while some historians, such as [[Gheorghe Brătianu]] and [[Ion Nistor]] died in prison, their works hidden from public view.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;

Roller also saw enemies among the ranks of older teachers he believed blocked the "cultural revolution", and promoted "re-education of the teaching staff". He sought to imbue the educational system with a class character and make it serve the interests of workers, peasants and "progressive intellectuals", including those who had rushed to the new regime's side.&lt;ref name="plesa171"/&gt; Already in 1947, students were encouraged to form Marxist "cells", verifying the dogmatic purity of history lessons, and holding the teachers accountable.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, Roller explained that, as long as the old teaching staff could include a "war criminal" such as [[Ion Petrovici]], his own colleagues, Răutu and Chișinevschi, were fit to lecture in Marxism-Leninism at the [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="Vasile, p.269"/&gt; He continued to have a plenary take on education, and insisted that music should form part of schooling. Unintentionally, his position on the subject allowed educators and students to evade politicization for at least part of the school week.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile, p.292-3&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Roller intervened on behalf of certain historians the regime considered undesirable, including the medievalist [[P. P. Panaitescu]]. When the [[Securitate]] secret police, charging past membership in the [[Iron Guard]], arrested archaeologist [[Vladimir Dumitrescu]] while he was excavating at [[Hăbășești]], Roller intervened several times with the police leadership, in particular [[Alexandru Drăghici]] and [[Gheorghe Pintilie]], until his release was ultimately obtained. Other historians, after their release from prison, also asked Roller for help to start working again.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.172-3. See also Boia, ''Capcanele istoriei'', p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on archaeology===
One particular area into which Roller injected communist ideology was [[Romanian archaeology]]. He shifted the emphasis from Roman Dacia to pre- and post-Roman periods, reflecting Marx' and Engels' view of the Roman Empire as supremely exploitative. He also adapted Stalin's remarks on the "unscientific position of old bourgeois historians" whose study of Russia reportedly began with Kievan Rus' and ignored what came before. In a Romanian context, this meant reversing the "denial of the development of human society prior to [[Second Dacian War|Dacia's conquest]]" by previous historians. He also emphasized Gheorghiu-Dej's position that Romanian territory had for over a millennium been robbed by Romans and barbarians, just as it had been by French, British or German imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, in an article on excavations made the previous year, he criticized [[Emil Condurachi]], who had explored [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], for not studying the native population before the "exploitative" Romans, urging a focus on the battles between [[Dacians]] and unconquered peoples against the Romans. He took issue with [[Ion Nestor]] for refusing to claim the presence of slaves at [[Monteoru]]: "some are afraid to place themselves on the proletariat's class position". Along with [[Radu Vulpe]], he was berating for issuing field reports that were purely technical rather than ideologically shaded, concluding that "they do not seek to shed light, using scientific concepts, on the problems of the ancient history of the Romanian People's Republic". Condurachi was singled out for not using his report to attack [[Scarlat Lambrino]], the previous head excavator at Histria, who as an exile in the West was "a sellout to Anglo-American imperialism".&lt;ref name="plesa172"&gt;Pleșa, p.172&lt;/ref&gt; Roller's ideas on class struggle in Roman Dacia imposed the term "[[free Dacians]]" into the archaeological nomenclature. The name implicitly distinguished between Dacians in Roman territory, who were "unfree", and those roaming further east.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

Roller instructed that "we must mercilessly unmask the enemies of science and the lackeys of the former bourgeois-landowning regime". Nevertheless, archaeology did become a more ordered field, in contrast to the individual and sporadic efforts that came before. A team of specialists would excavate a site thoroughly, and the regime lavished funds on such studies. Emphasis was laid on finding traces of Slavic settlement, so that this people could be shown to have had an important role in the development of Romanian society.&lt;ref name="plesa172"/&gt;

===Fall from grace===
[[File:Funeralii Stalin Dej.jpg|thumb|320px|Roller (second row, in glasses) at [[Aurel Vlaicu International Airport|Băneasa Airport]] in March 1953, greeting Gheorghiu-Dej upon his return from Stalin's funeral]]
In the mid-1950s, Roller's position started losing ground. The death of Stalin and the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] had echoes within Romania: the country's leader, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], with an eye to [[United Nations]] membership, relaxed repressive measures. [[Collectivization in Romania|Collectivization]] and industrialization were slowed down, certain political prisoners were freed, and the new climate had its effect on the cultural realm as well. Among the prisoners released were intellectuals who were gradually brought back into universities and research institutes. In 1955, a party science and culture section was established, headed by [[Pavel Țugui]] and meant to counteract the grip on culture held by the Răutu–Roller Agitprop section. Gheorghiu-Dej spoke out against the "monopoly and dictate of Roller", especially on history but also on culture in general, and blamed the two for the crisis in the field and the party's poor relationship with intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.173-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Țugui, by explaining Roller's errors, managed to attract [[Gheorghe Apostol]] and [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] as supporters. He also drew to his side the Romanian Academy members [[Constantin Daicoviciu]], [[David Prodan]] and [[Andrei Oțetea]], as well as [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|education minister]] [[Ilie Murgulescu]], and later some of Roller's former collaborators, including Vasile Maciu, Victor Cheresteșiu and Barbu Câmpina. In early 1956, Oțetea, Daicoviciu and Câmpina sent Gheorghiu-Dej a document accusing Roller and close collaborators of plagiarism and unscientific scholarship. One effect of the moves against Roller was the 1955 firing of Aurel Roman as editor of ''Studii'' and his replacement with Oțetea (who the following year also replaced Cheresteșiu as head of the [[Nicolae Iorga Institute|Bucharest History Institute]]), so that articles started to appear without Roller's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Pleșa, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, he also lost his position at the Agitprop section and was transferred to become deputy director of the PMR History Institute, wielding more power than the titular head, [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]].&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plesa1745"&gt;Pleșa, p.174-5&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Roller was directing the effort to preserve samples of [[oral history]], interviewing the former "illegalists" and building up a large collection of [[magnetic tape]] recordings. Reputedly, Roller's experiment in oral history had unwittingly managed to embarrass the communist leader: it presented Gheorghiu-Dej as more the secondary figure than the "illegalist" leader fashioned in official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.50, 106&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1958, as the party celebrated 25 years since the [[Grivița Strike of 1933]], the PMR Institute collection of recordings was in focus. A number of the "illegalists", especially those who did not receive the posts they expected after 1944, began to question whether Gheorghiu-Dej had played the leading role he claimed for himself during the strike, as well as criticizing the country's direction. The latter hastily called a plenary session of the central committee for June 9–13, where a group of [[Deviationism|deviationists]] was "unmasked". The group was entirely composed of members who had belonged to the party when it was banned and included prominent figures such as [[Constantin Doncea]] and [[Grigore Răceanu]]. Officially, they were sanctioned for criticizing the leadership and its work methods as well as for attempting to organize a conference where party activity would be discussed. The underlying motive for the purge was their criticism of the party's stifling atmosphere and of the personality cult surrounding Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristina Diac, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Ceausescu_a_dat_de_pamant_cu_ilegalistii_0_649735538.html "Ceaușescu a dat de pământ cu ilegaliștii"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221171224/http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Ceausescu_a_dat_de_pamant_cu_ilegalistii_0_649735538.html |date=2012-02-21 }}, ''[[Adevărul]]'', February 20, 2012; Pleșa, p.174-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The plenary session also criticized Roller, and afterwards, [[Paul Niculescu-Mizil]] presented the party leadership a report recommending that the entire leadership of the PMR Institute save the director be removed. At the same time as the plenary, a joint meeting of Romanian and Soviet historians took place at which Oțetea sharply criticized Roller for the unprofessionalism with which he published documents and announced they would be republished. The Soviets did not defend Roller, which the latter interpreted as a loss of support from his former allies.&lt;ref name="plesa175"&gt;Pleșa, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Roller died on June 21, 1958, and Pleșa believes he most likely committed suicide.&lt;ref name="plesa175"/&gt; Tismăneanu initially credited that rumor in his [[Radio Free Europe]] addresses,&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.17"/&gt; but later noted that the suicide story was "unconfirmed".&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.342&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that Roller had serious [[diabetes]], or a disease of the digestive tract.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plesa175"/&gt; According to at least two accounts, he had also suffered a [[stroke]] or a [[heart attack]] some time during the "unmasking" sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.342; Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Although sidelined by the time of his death, Roller received the usual PMR honor, an obituary piece in ''{{Lang|ro|Scînteia}}''.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; An urn containing his ashes is housed at the [[Cremation in Romania|Cenușa Crematorium]] in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;

After World War II, Roller had married Sara Zighelboim, whose brothers Avram and Ștrul were communist activists during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristina Diac, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Corul_cizmarilor_si_tabacarilor-dirijat_de_Ceausescu_0_532747153.html "Corul cizmarilor și tăbăcarilor, dirijat de Ceaușescu"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910121938/http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Corul_cizmarilor_si_tabacarilor-dirijat_de_Ceausescu_0_532747153.html |date=2011-09-10 }}, ''[[Adevărul]]'', August 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter Sonela died in 1956 while with her father at a health resort: after diving into a pool, she suffered a fatal head trauma.&lt;ref name="fantoma"/&gt;

Roller's death did not result in a thorough change to the historiographical ideas he had put forth. Class struggle and dialectical materialism continued to be taught in schools. While history writing did alter after 1960, with less emphasis placed on the "greatness" of the Soviet Union and on criticizing the West, and greater attention paid to previously neglected historical figures, this was due not so much to Roller's disappearance from the scene as to Romania's changed international position and gradual alienation from the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.319-25, 345-80; Pleșa, p.175-76. See also Drăgușanu, p.116-7&lt;/ref&gt; The role of guiding communist historiography fell on Marxists from the professional field, primarily Oțetea.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.114; Tismăneanu, p.198, 220, 335&lt;/ref&gt;

Tismăneanu and historian Cristian Vasile note that Roller's downfall was a sacrificial offering by Leonte Răutu, who survived the "unmasking" period and was still a culture boss under the [[national communism]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.31-2&lt;/ref&gt; Gheorghiu-Dej's successor Ceaușescu allowed young authors—[[Ileana Vrancea]], [[Ion Cristoiu]]—or senior figures—[[Iorgu Iordan]]—, to publish works critical of the Zhdanov Doctrine. Although these mentioned Roller by name, Răutu was entirely exempt.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.31-2, 45-6, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; Iordan calls Roller the "evil genie" of the Romanian Academy, and makes him responsible for the more "fanatical" decisions—such as granting posthumous Academy membership to the Marxist poet [[Dumitru Theodor Neculuță]].&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; A bizarre exception to this rule was an official reference work, the 1978 ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești'' ("The Encyclopedia of Romanian Historiography"). It has an entry on Roller, which does not feature any negative commentary, while Răutu is entirely absent.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu &amp; Vasile, p.53-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Roller's contribution was reevaluated again after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] toppled communism. Some of the first monographs dealing with Roller's career and its impact on Romania were published by [[Romulus Rusan]], the [[Civic Alliance Foundation]], and the [[Memorial of the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance|Sighet Memorial of the Victims of Communism]].&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

Writing in 1999, Mihai Stoian described it as anomalous that, in the process of restoring membership to those deposed by the regime, the Academy had not also posthumously stripped Roller of his title. He calls Roller "a red specter", haunting "the bookcases dusted by lies and servitude."&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt; Senior historian [[Florin Constantiniu]] reflected back on the communist period, coining the popular (but, according to Cristian Vasile, melodramatic) image of Roller as "the gravedigger of authentic Romanian culture".&lt;ref&gt;Vasile, p.303-4&lt;/ref&gt; At that stage, some authors described Roller's influence as criminal, and declared him an anti-Romanian by conviction. The books of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] conspiracy theorist [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]] cited Roller's case as evidence that [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish communism]] was working against the Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, ''Istorie și mit...'', p.258-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such widespread condemnation of his theories, Roller's terminology was not entirely expunged from later Romanian research works. As noted in 1998 by archaeologist Petre Diaconu, the "meaningless and pernicious" concept of "[[free Dacians]]" has been taken for granted by numerous scientists in the field.&lt;ref name="msnemuritorii"/&gt;

The Association was founded in 1869 by [[Michael Birkeland]] and [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]]. It works to promote historical research and to strengthen history  in higher education and in public. Its publishes the academic journal ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Norway)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'', which it commenced in 1871. The association also publishes the magazine ''Historikeren''. Additionally the association is co-owner of  ''[[Scandinavian Journal of History]]''.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Den norske historiske forening|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Den_norske_historiske_forening|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the association merged with the organizations ''Norsk historikerforening'' (founded 1982) and ''Norsk komité for historisk vitskap'' (founded 1927). It kept its old name, but adopted the new acronym HIFO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Historisk_tidsskrift|title=  Historisk tidsskrift|publisher= Store norske leksikon |author=  Åsmund Borgen Gjerde|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''one-name study''' is a project researching  a specific [[surname]], as opposed to a particular [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] ([[ancestor]]s of one person) or descendancy ([[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of one person or couple). Some people who research a specific surname may restrict their research geographically and chronologically, perhaps to one country and time period, while others may collect all occurrences world-wide for all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.one-name.org/onename.html Guild of One-Name Studies web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

A one-name study is not limited to persons who are related biologically. Studies may have a number of family trees which have no link with each other.

Findings from a one-name study are useful to [[genealogy|genealogists]]. [[onomastics|Onomasticians]], who study the [[etymology]], meaning and geographic origin of names, also draw on the macro perspective provided by a one-name study.

== Scope ==
Many people conducting family history, genealogical or onomastic research may conduct a one-name study of a surname in a given period or locality quite informally.

A full one-name study can be daunting, particularly if the surname is very common. Conversely, a rare surname can be difficult to trace.&lt;ref name="Tracking Down ONS"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Adler |first1=Harry |title = Tracking Down Your Ancestors |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4lUmXpuyBcoC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=one+name+study+%22Tracking+Down+Your+Ancestors%22#v=onepage&amp;q=one%20name%20study%20&amp;f=false |place = Oxford  |publisher=How To Books Ltd. |pages=20–22 |date= |year = 2002|isbn = 9781857038286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since such studies are usually conducted by individuals as a pastime, they are generally feasible only when a surname is not used by more than a couple of thousand contemporary people, so that the total historical data-set is numbered in the low tens of thousands. Where a surname is used by hundreds of thousands, or millions of people, it would be practically impossible to differentiate these persons using national-index data alone.

In some cultures, one-name studies are impossible, since hereditary surnames are not used at all or in the case of names such as [[Singh]] may represent religious practice rather than an ancestry. Since a majority of human societies use patronymic surnames, one-name studies generally focus on male succession and ignore family relationships through marriage.

Some researchers are satisfied to collect all information and group it geographically, approximately representing the different family groups. Others attempt to reconstruct lineages.

In most one-name studies, a united lineage will not be discovered, but broad perspectives can be achieved, giving clues to name origins and migrations. Many researchers are motivated to go beyond the one-name-study stage and to compile fully researched, single-family histories of some of the families they discover.

== Methods ==

Accessibility of the data required for a one-name study varies from country to country. Where civil registration indexes are open to public search, they may not be online or gathered in the national capital, but are scattered through the states, as in Australia, or towns, as in France and the United States. In many countries, such as Germany, civil registration and census data are regarded as a state prerogative: vital data are only available to the persons concerned and 19th-century census returns are not available at all.

One-name studies in the United States have become more feasible than they were, thanks to the increased availability of online indexes to 19th-century and early-20th-century censuses.

More limited one-name studies can be conducted using other national indexes including:
* [[Telephone directory|telephone]] and address directories
* registers of [[will (law)|wills]] or deceased estates
* electoral rolls
* land possession records
* military service indexes

One-name studies are generally rounded out with a miscellany of information drawn from national bibliographies, archival catalogues, patent databases, reports of law cases, tax lists, newspaper indexes and web searches. A one-name researcher is may also to report on the linguistic origins of the surname and its use in place names and corporate names.

===UK surnames===
[[Civil registry#United Kingdom|Civil registration]] indexes of births, marriages and deaths in [[England]] and [[Wales]] (for the period from 1837), [[Scotland]] (from 1855) and [[Northern Ireland]] (from 1865 and Protestant marriages from 1845) are in the public domain, and anyone may apply to see the details of any birth, marriage or death. For the period before civil registration, in principle back to 1538 in England and Wales and 1533 in Scotland, [[parish registers]] have recorded birth and/or baptisms, marriages and deaths and/or burials. These are also freely available, although the survival of such registers is less likely as we reach back to the earliest dates of this period.

The civil registration index books for [[England and Wales]] were scanned and made available online in 2004 by the subscription web site Findmypast (formerly ''1837online'') and an index has also been created by volunteers for the free web site FreeBMD. Records for [[Scotland]] can be searched at the pay-per-view web site ScotlandsPeople, and this means that a one-name study with a British focus can be conducted from anywhere in the world. Civil registration indexes for Northern Ireland can be viewed at the [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)]] (GRONI) on payment of an entrance fee.

[[Census in the United Kingdom|Censuses]] have taken place in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since the 1800s. The Irish Census returns for the years 1841 to 1891 are not available having been destroyed. Otherwise information from the 10-yearly censuses from 1841 until 1911 is available and facilitates the linking of surname data into family groups.

Since it is possible to extract a complete data-set of a given surname from these public records, ancestries of most 20th-century persons with a particular surname in England and Wales can be compiled without needing any contact to the persons concerned.

== Tools ==
While most one-name studies are conducted as a pastime, rather than as an economic activity, the sheer volume of information to be organised may require semi-professional data-processing and publishing skills. To avoid retyping large volumes of data by hand, one-name researchers are often skilled at data [[screen scraping|scraping]] and automated reformatting. The data must be carefully structured. An accurate copy of the original indexes must be drawn up, and updated when they are amended. Errors and conflicts in the indexes are noted. Links to those tables appear in the roll of individual persons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Many one-name researchers keep data tables in computer spreadsheets because it is possible to see hundreds of items on a single screen and use thinking power to detect patterns. Genealogy software is used by many researchers to collate and define family trees. Others employ [[relational database]] software.

Increasingly one-namers are becoming involved in [[Surname DNA project]]s, using [[Genealogical DNA test#Y chromosome (Y-DNA) testing|Y-DNA testing]] to analyse relationships among different lineages bearing the same surname (or suspected spelling variants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DNA project to link people who share the same Staffordshire surname |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/DNA-project-link-people-share-Staffordshire/story-24519279-detail/story.html |work=The Sentinel |place=[[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke]] |date=13 November 2014 |accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation and support ==
One-name researchers often begin a study in the hope that obtaining a massive [[data set]] will give them sufficient perspective to break through a barrier in their own family history research. Some are motivated by the belief, only rarely borne out, that kinship can be documented among all persons sharing a surname.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The [[Guild of One-Name Studies]] was established in the United Kingdom in September 1979, and maintains a register of surnames being researched by members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guild of One-name Studies: Register|url=http://www.one-name.org/register.html|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a channel for anyone wishing to contact the person researching a particular registered name. In 2014 the Guild had over 2,000 world-wide members conducting studies of individual surnames and their variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guild of One-name Studies|url=http://www.one-name.org|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
Traditionally, publication of definitive research is undertaken by printing a book or by publishing a one-name periodical.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Such publications are often sponsored by formally established one-name groups. The UK-based [[Federation of Family History Societies]] includes several One-Name Societies, whilst the [[Guild of One-Name Studies]] has many members who are associated with such organisations. Advice on setting up a one-name group appears in a short booklet, "One-Name Family History Groups" by Derek Palgrave published by the Halsted Trust in 2008.

Today many studies are presented online, since the data can be continually updated and made available worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A number of Guild of One-Name Studies members have taken advantage of the member benefit called the [http://one-name.org/the-members-websites-project-mwp/members-websites-full-list-and-search-page/ Members Website Project (MWP)] which enables a members to both share and publish their study as a website whilst continuing to work on their study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://one-name.org/the-members-websites-project-mwp/|title=The Members’ Websites Project (MWP) – Guild of One-Name Studies|website=one-name.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Portuguese discoveries''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Descobrimentos portugueses'') are the numerous territories and maritime routes discovered by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] as a result of their intensive maritime exploration during the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of Africa, Canada, Asia and Brazil, in what became known as the [[Age of Discovery]]. Methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of prince [[Henry the Navigator]], with [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reaching the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] led the first fleet around [[Africa]] to [[India]], arriving in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Portuguese explorations then proceeded to southeast Asia, where they reached [[Japan]] in 1542, forty-four years after their first arrival in India.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Karl O'Brien|title=Atlas of World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZy5tDjaUkC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-521921-0|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1500, the Portuguese nobleman [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] became the first European to discover [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="PageSonnenburg2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melvin Eugene Page|author2=Penny M.

==Origins==
[[Image:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Vasco da Gama]] lands in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on May 20th 1498.]]
In 1139 the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] achieved independence from [[Kingdom of León|León]], having doubled its area with the [[Reconquista]] under [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]].

In 1297 king [[Denis of Portugal]] took personal interest in the development of exports, having organized the export of surplus production to European countries. On May 10, 1293 he instituted a maritime insurance fund for Portuguese traders living in the [[County of Flanders]], which were to pay certain sums according to tonnage, accrued to them when necessary. Wine and dried fruits from [[Algarve]] were sold in Flanders and England, salt from [[Setúbal]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] was a profitable export to northern Europe, and leather and [[kermes (dye)|kermes]], a scarlet dye, were also exported. Portuguese imported armors and munitions, fine clothes and several manufactured products from Flanders and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;A. R. de Oliveira Marques, Vitor Andre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aq08DHChiGwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages"], p.9, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1971, {{ISBN|0-299-05584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1317 king Denis made an agreement with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[Admiral]] with trade privileges with his homeland in return for twenty war ships and crews, with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids, thus laying the basis for the [[Portuguese Navy]] and establishment of a Genoese merchant community in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey (1977), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580], p. 210, University of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|0-8166-0782-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, the [[Republic of Genoa]] had turned to north African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as energy source) and a search for gold – navigating also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England. Genoese and Florentine communities established since then in Portugal, who profited from the enterprise and financial experience of these rivals of the [[Republic of Venice]].

In the second half of the fourteenth century outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation: the economy was extremely localized in a few towns, and migration from the country led to agricultural land being abandoned and resulting in village unemployment rise. Only the sea offered alternatives, with most people settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. D. Newitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vpteLQcx6J4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400–1668"], p.9, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-23979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325–1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] granted public funding to raise a proper [[trade|commercial]] fleet and ordered the first maritime explorations, with the help of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], under command of admiral Manuel Pessanha. In 1341 the [[Canary Islands]], already known to Genoese, were officially discovered under the patronage of the Portuguese king, but in 1344 Castile disputed them, further propelling the Portuguese [[navy]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Butel, Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GL83BE8oVcwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The Atlantic"], p. 36, Seas in history, Routledge, 1999

==Atlantic exploration (1415–1488)==
[[File:Henry the Navigator1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], generally credited as the driving force behind Portuguese maritime exploration.]]

In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was occupied by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast, moved by expanding [[Christianity]] with the avail of the [[Pope]] and a desire of the unemployed [[nobility]] for epic acts of war after the reconquista. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the Saharan trade routes. Governor of the rich [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] since 1420 and holding valuable monopolies on resources in Algarve, he invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of Mauritania, gathering a group of merchants, shipowners, stakeholders and participants interested in the sea lanes. Later his brother Prince [[Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Pedro]], granted him a [[royal monopoly]] of all profits from trading within the areas discovered. Soon the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1420) and Azores (1427) were reached. There wheat and later [[sugarcane]] were cultivated, like in Algarve, by the Genoese, becoming profitable activities. This helped them become more wealthy.

[[Henry the Navigator]] took the lead role in encouraging Portuguese maritime exploration until his death in 1460.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Bojador]] on the African coast. Henry wished to know how far the Muslim territories in Africa extended, and whether it was possible to reach Asia by sea, both to reach the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]] and perhaps to join forces with the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]] that was rumoured to exist somewhere in the "Indies".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Rafiuddin Shirazi, Tazkiratul Mulk.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1419 two of Henry's captains, [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]] were driven by a storm to [[Madeira]], an uninhabited island off the coast of Africa which had probably been known to Europeans since the 14th century. In 1420 Zarco and Teixeira returned with [[Bartolomeu Perestrelo]] and began Portuguese settlement of the islands. A Portuguese attempt to capture [[Grand Canary]], one of the nearby [[Canary Islands]], which had been partially settled by Spaniards in 1402 was unsuccessful and met with protestations from Castile.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact details are uncertain, [[cartography|cartographic]] evidence suggests the [[Azores]] were probably discovered in 1427 by Portuguese ships sailing under Henry's direction, and settled in 1432, suggesting that the Portuguese were able to navigate at least {{convert|745|mi|km|-1}} from the Portuguese coast.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&amp;nbsp;60&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time as the unsuccessful attack on the Canary Islands, the Portuguese began to explore the North African coast. Sailors feared what lay beyond [[Cape Bojador]], and whether it was possible to return once it was passed. In 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], passed this obstacle. Once this psychological barrier had been crossed, it became easier to probe further along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; Westward exploration continued over the same period: Diogo Silves discovered the Azores island of Santa Maria in 1427 and in the following years Portuguese discovered and settled the rest of the Azores. Within two decades of exploration, Portuguese ships bypassed the Sahara.
[[File:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[caravel]] ship introduced in the mid-15th century which aided Portuguese exploration]]
Henry suffered a serious setback in 1437 after the failure of an [[Battle of Tangier (1437)|expedition]] to capture [[Tangier]], having encouraged his brother, King [[Edward of Portugal|Edward]], to mount an overland attack from Ceuta. The Portuguese army was defeated and only escaped destruction by surrendering Prince [[Ferdinand the Holy Prince|Ferdinand]], the king's youngest brother.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&amp;nbsp;44&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat at Tangier, Henry retired to [[Sagres (Vila do Bispo)|Sagres]] on the southern tip of Portugal where he continued to direct Portuguese exploration until his death in 1460.

In 1443 [[Prince Pedro, Duke of Coimbra|Prince Pedro]], Henry's brother, granted him the monopoly of navigation, war and trade in the lands south of [[Cape Bojador]]. Later this monopoly would be enforced by the [[Papal bull]]s [[Dum Diversas]] (1452) and [[Romanus Pontifex]] (1455), granting Portugal the trade monopoly for the newly discovered countries,&lt;ref name="Daus"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; laying the basis for the Portuguese empire.

A major advance which accelerated this project was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a ship that could be sailed closer to the wind than any other in operation in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoxer1969|Boxer]], p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; Using this new maritime technology, Portuguese navigators reached ever more southerly [[latitude]]s, advancing at an average rate of one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRussellWood|Russell-Wood]], p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445. The first [[feitoria]] trade post overseas was established then under Henry's directions, in 1445 on the island of [[Arguin]] off the coast of Mauritania, to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa, starting the chain of Portuguese feitorias along the coast. In 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] was reached in the 1460s.

===Exploration after Prince Henry===
[[File:Caopillar.JPG|thumb|left|80px|An illustration of the [[padrão]] [[Diogo Cão]] erected at Cape St. Mary, [[Angola]].]]
As a result of the first meager returns of the African explorations, in 1469 king [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] granted the monopoly of trade in part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to merchant [[Fernão Gomes]], for an annual payment of 200,000 [[Portuguese real|real]]s. Gomes was also required to explore {{convert|100|league|km}} of the coast each year for five years.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thornr.demon.co.uk/kchrist/discpde.html| title = Discoveries After Prince Henry| accessdate = 2006-12-24| last = Thorn| first = Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and [[Pedro de Sintra]], and exceeded the requirement. Under his sponsorship, Portuguese  explorers crossed the [[Equator]] into the Southern Hemisphere and found the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].&lt;ref name="marinha"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.marinha.pt/extra/revista/ra_fev1999/pag21.html| title = O Contrato de Fernão Gomes| accessdate = 2006-12-24| last = Semedo | first = J. de Matos| date = | publisher = |language =Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1471, Gomes' explorerers reached [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast (present day [[Ghana]]), and  discovered a thriving gold trade between the natives and visiting Arab and Berber traders. Gomes established his own trading post there, which became known as “A Mina” ("The Mine"). Trade between Elmina and Portugal grew in the next decade.&lt;ref name="ghana"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ghanatourism.gov.gh/regions/highlight_detail.asp?id=&amp;rdid=116#| title = Castelo de Elmina| accessdate = 2006-12-24| publisher = Governo de Gana| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070305003001/http://www.ghanatourism.gov.gh/regions/highlight_detail.asp?id=&amp;rdid=116| archivedate = 2007-03-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1481, the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[São Jorge da Mina]] fort (Elmina Castle) and factory to protect this trade, which was then held again as a royal monopoly.

In 1482, [[Diogo Cão]] discovered the [[Congo River]]. In 1486, Cão continued to [[Cape Cross]], in present-day [[Namibia]], near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]].

In 1488, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on the southern tip of Africa, disproving the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the [[Indian Ocean]] was separate from the Atlantic. Also at this time, [[Pêro da Covilhã]] reached [[India]] via [[Egypt]] and [[Yemen]], and visited [[Madagascar]]. He recommended further exploration of the southern route.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Portuguese explored the coastlines of Africa, they left behind a series of [[Padrão|padrões]], stone crosses inscribed with the Portuguese coat of arms marking their claims,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNewitt|Newitt]], p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/ref&gt; and built forts and trading posts. From these bases, the Portuguese engaged profitably in the slave and gold trades. Portugal enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] for over a century, exporting around 800 slaves annually. Most were brought to the Portuguese capital [[Lisbon]], where it is estimated black Africans came to constitute 10 per cent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAnderson|Anderson]], p.&amp;nbsp;55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tordesillas division of the world (1492)===
[[Image:Spain and Portugal.png|thumb|right|The 1494 [[Tordesilhas Treaty]] [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] dividing the world between  Portugal and Castille/Spain (purple) and the [[Moluccas]] [[antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], 1529]]
In 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery for [[Spain]] of the [[New World]], which he believed to be Asia, led to disputes between the Spanish and Portuguese. These were eventually settled by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494 which divided the world outside of Europe in an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the Portuguese and the Spanish, along a north-south meridian 370 [[League (unit)|leagues]], or {{convert|970|mi|km|-1}}, west of the Cape Verde islands. However, as it was not possible at the time to correctly measure [[longitude]], the exact boundary was disputed by the two countries until 1777.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&amp;nbsp;174&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of these negotiations with Spain is one of several reasons proposed by historians for why it took nine years for the Portuguese to follow up on Dias's voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, though it has also been speculated that other voyages were in fact taking place in secret during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiffie|Diffie]], p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoxer|Boxer]], p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this was the case, the long-standing Portuguese goal of finding a sea route to Asia was finally achieved in a ground-breaking voyage commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]].

===Reaching India and Brazil (1497–1500)===
[[Image:Gama route 1.svg|left|thumb|The route followed in Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497–1499)]]
The squadron of Vasco da Gama left Portugal in 1497, rounded the Cape and continued along the coast of East Africa, where a local pilot was brought on board who guided them across the [[Indian Ocean]], reaching [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in western [[India]] in May 1498.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refScammell|Scammell]], p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; The second voyage to India was dispatched in 1500 under [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]. While following the same south-westerly route as Gama across the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral made landfall on the Brazilian coast. This was probably an accidental discovery, but it has been speculated that the Portuguese secretly knew of Brazil's existence and that it lay on their side of the Tordesillas line.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcAlister|McAlister]], p.&amp;nbsp;75&lt;/ref&gt; Cabral recommended to the Portuguese King that the land be settled, and two follow up voyages were sent in 1501 and 1503. The land was found to be abundant in ''pau-brasil'', or [[brazilwood]], from which it later inherited its name, but the failure to find gold or silver meant that for the time being Portuguese efforts were concentrated on India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcAlister|McAlister]], p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 1497 the fleet, consisting of four ships and a crew of 170 men, left [[Lisbon]]
The travel led by Vasco da Gama to Calicut was the starting point for deployment of Portuguese in the African east coast and in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Scammell, G.V. (1997). The First Imperial Age, European Overseas Expansion c. 1400–1715. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-09085-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first contact occurred on 20 May 1498. After some conflict, he got an ambiguous letter for trade with the [[Zamorin]] of Calicut, leaving there some men to establish a trading post. Since then explorations lost the private nature, taking place under the exclusive of the Portuguese Crown. Shortly after, the [[Casa da Índia]] was established in Lisbon to administer the royal monopoly of navigation and trade.

==Indian Ocean explorations (1497–1542)==
[[Image:Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The carrack ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]'' and other Portuguese Navy' ships in the 16th century.]]
The aim of Portugal in the Indian Ocean was to ensure the monopoly of the [[spice trade]]. Taking advantage of the rivalries that pitted Hindus against Muslims, the Portuguese established several forts and trading posts between 1500 and 1510. In [[East Africa]], small [[Islamic]] states along the coast of [[Mozambique]], [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], [[Barawa|Brava]], [[Sofala]] and [[Mombasa]] were destroyed, or became either subjects or allies of Portugal. [[Pêro da Covilhã]] had reached [[Ethiopia]], traveling secretly overland, as early as 1490;&lt;ref&gt;Bethencourt, Francisco. Curto, Diogo Ramada. (2007). Portuguese Overseas Expansion, 1400-1800. Cambridge University Press. p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; a diplomatic mission reached the ruler of that nation on October 19, 1520.

In 1500 the second fleet to India who came to discover Brazil explored the East African coast, where [[Diogo Dias]] discovered the island that he named St. Lawrence, later known as [[Madagascar]]. This fleet, commanded by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in September, where the first trade agreement in India was signed. For a short time a Portuguese factory was installed there, but was attacked by Muslims on December 16 and several Portuguese, including the scribe [[Pêro Vaz de Caminha]], died. After bombarding Calicut as a retaliation, Cabral went to rival [[Kochi, India|Kochi]].

Profiting from the rivalry between the Maharaja of Kochi and the [[Zamorin]] of Calicut, the Portuguese were well received and seen as allies, getting a permit to build a [[Fort Kochi|fort (Fort Manuel)]] and a trading post that were the first European settlement in India. There in 1503 they built the [[St. Francis Church, Kochi|St. Francis Church]].&lt;ref name="Kochi1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.holidaysinkerala.org.uk/pilgrim-centers/st-francis-kochi.html  | title = St. Francis Church | accessdate = 2008-02-21 | last = | first =    | work = | publisher =  Wonderful Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayub"&gt;Ayub, Akber (ed), ''Kerala: Maps &amp; More'', ''Fort Kochi'',  2006 edition 2007 reprint, pp. 20–24, Stark World Publishing, Bangalore, {{ISBN|81-902505-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1502 Vasco da Gama took the island of Kilwa on the coast of Tanzania, where in 1505 the first fort of Portuguese East Africa was built to protect ships from the East Indian trade.

In 1505 king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] appointed [[Francisco de Almeida]] first [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India]] for a three-year period, starting the Portuguese government in the east, headquartered at Kochi. That year the Portuguese conquered [[Kannur]] where they founded [[St. Angelo Fort]]. [[Lourenço de Almeida]] arrived in [[Ceylon]] (modern Sri Lanka), where he discovered the source of [[cinnamon]]. Finding it divided into seven rival kingdoms, he established a defense pact with the [[kingdom of Kotte]] and extended the control in coastal areas, where in 1517 was founded the fortress of Colombo.&lt;ref name="cs1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/8.htm |title=European Encroachment and Dominance:The Portuguese |accessdate=2006-12-02 |work=Sri Lanka: A Country Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1506 a Portuguese fleet under the command of [[Tristão da Cunha]] and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], conquered [[Socotra]] at the entrance of the [[Red Sea]] and [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] in 1507, having failed to conquer [[Ormuz]], following a strategy intended to close the entrances to the Indian Ocean. That same year were built fortresses in the Island of Mozambique and Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. [[Madagascar]] was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] and in the same year [[Mauritius]] was discovered.

In 1509, the Portuguese won the sea [[Battle of Diu (1509)|Battle of Diu]] against the combined forces of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid II]], [[Gujarat Sultanate|Sultan of Gujarat]], [[Mamluk|Mamlûk Sultan of Cairo]], Samoothiri Raja of [[Kozhikode]], [[Venetian Republic]], and [[Ragusan Republic]] (Dubrovnik). The Portuguese victory was critical for its strategy of control of the Indian Sea: Turks and Egyptians withdraw their navies from India, leaving the seas to the Portuguese, setting its trade dominance for almost a century, and greatly assisting the growth of the Portuguese Empire. It marked also the beginning of the European colonial dominance in the Asia. A second [[Siege of Diu|Battle of Diu]] in 1538 finally ended Ottoman ambitions in India and confirmed Portuguese hegemony in the Indian Ocean.

Under the government of Albuquerque, [[Goa]] was taken from the [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur sultanate]] in 1510 with the help of Hindu [[privateer]] [[Timoji]]. Coveted for being the best port in the region, mainly for the commerce of Arabian horses for the [[Deccan sultanates]], it allowed to move on from the initial guest stay in Cochin. Despite constant attacks, Goa became the seat of the Portuguese government, under the name of [[Portuguese India|''Estado da India'' (State of India)]], with the conquest triggering compliance of neighbour kingdoms: [[Gujarat]] and Calicut sent embassies, offering alliances and grants to fortify. Albuquerque began that year in Goa the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in India, taking the opportunity to announce the achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Teotonio R. De Souza, "Goa Through the Ages: An economic history" p.220, Issue 6 of Goa University publication series, {{ISBN|81-7022-226-5}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indo-Portuguese Issues [http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/pm_indoportuguese.aspx Indo-Portuguese Issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia expeditions===
[[File:Asia oceania anonymous c1550.jpg|left|thumb|Anonymous map c.1550 of Eastern Africa, Asia and Western Oceania]]
In April 1511 Albuquerque sailed to [[Malacca]] in modern-day [[Malaysia]],&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, M.C. (1991). A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300, 2nd Edition. London: MacMillan, p.23. {{ISBN|0-333-57689-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important eastern point in the trade network, where Malay met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic traders, described by [[Tomé Pires]] as invaluable. The port of Malacca became then the strategic base for Portuguese trade expansion with China and Southeast Asia, under the Portuguese rule in India with its capital at [[Goa]]. To defend the city a strong fort was erected, called the "A Famosa", where one of its gate still remains today. Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malacca, Albuquerque sent immediately [[Duarte Fernandes]] on a diplomatic mission to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|kingdom of Siam]] (modern Thailand), where he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between both kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Donald Frederick Lach p.520"&gt;Donald Frederick Lach, Edwin J. Van Kley, "Asia in the making of Europe", p.520–521, University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-226-46731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November that year, getting to know the location of the so-called "[[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]" in the Moluccas, he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to find them, arriving in early 1512. Abreu went by Ambon while deputy commander [[Francisco Serrão]] came forward to [[Ternate]], were a Portuguese fort was allowed. That same year, in Indonesia, the Portuguese took [[Makassar]], reaching [[Timor]] in 1514. Departing from Malacca, [[Jorge Álvares]] came to southern [[China]] in 1513. This visit was followed the arrival in [[Guangzhou]], where trade was established. Later a trade post at [[Macau]] would be established.
[[File:Henry the Navigator.jpg|right|260px|thumb|[[Padrão dos Descobrimentos|Monument to the Portuguese Discoveries]] in [[Belém, Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].]]
The Portuguese empire expanded into the Persian Gulf as Portugal contested control of the spice trade with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1515, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered the [[Huwala]] state of [[Ormus|Hormuz]] at the head of the Persian Gulf, establishing it as a vassal state. [[Aden]], however, resisted Albuquerque's expedition in that same year, and another attempt by Albuquerque's successor [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]] in 1516, before capturing [[Bahrain]] in 1521, when a force led by [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] defeated the [[Jabrid]] King, [[Muqrin ibn Zamil]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 p37&lt;/ref&gt; In a shifting series of alliances, the Portuguese dominated much of the southern Persian Gulf for the next hundred years. With the regular maritime route linking Lisbon to Goa since 1497, the [[island of Mozambique]] become a strategic port, and there was built [[Fort São Sebastião]] and an hospital. In the Azores, the Islands Armada protected the ships en route to Lisbon.

In 1525, after [[Fernão de Magalhães]]'s expedition (1519–1522), Spain under Charles V sent an expedition to colonize the [[Moluccas islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], since there was not a set limit to the east. García Jofre de Loaísa expedition reached the Moluccas, docking at [[Tidore]]. The conflict with the Portuguese already established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes. An agreement was reached only with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]], attributing the Moluccas to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.

In 1530, [[John III of Portugal|John III]] organized the colonization of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] around 15 ''capitanias hereditárias'' ("hereditary captainships"), that were given to anyone who wanted to administer and explore them, to overcome the need to defend the territory, since an expedition under the command of [[Gonçalo Coelho]] in 1503, found the French making incursions on the land. That same year, there was a new expedition from [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]] with orders to patrol the whole Brazilian coast, banish the French, and create the first colonial towns: [[São Vicente, Brazil|São Vicente]] on the coast, and [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] on the border of the altiplane. From the 15 original captainships, only two, [[Pernambuco]] and São Vicente, prospered. With permanent settlement came the establishment of the [[sugar cane]] industry and its intensive labor demands which were met with [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and later African slaves.

In 1534 Gujarat was occupied by the [[Mughals]] and the Sultan [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bassein (1534)]] with the Portuguese, establishing an alliance to regain the country, giving in exchange [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], [[Diu, India|Diu]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Vasai|Bassein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqM-VSjw0gAC&amp;pg=PA726&amp;dq=%22Bahadur+Shah+of+Gujarat%22&amp;ei=EEbTRpq6JKLY7AL_n4By&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=Ne24xZxzNNcZo1FrMyX-z4-59AU|title=Sarina Singh, ''India'', Lonely Planet, 2003, 726 pp. ISBN 1-74059-421-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1538 the fortress of Diu is again surrounded by Ottoman ships. Another siege failed in 1547 putting an end to the Ottoman ambitions, confirming the Portuguese hegemony.

In 1542 Jesuit missionary [[Francis Xavier]] arrived in Goa at the service of king [[John III of Portugal]], in charge of an [[Apostolic Nunciature]]. At the same time Francisco Zeimoto, [[António Mota]], and other traders arrived in [[Japan]] for the first time. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]], which would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Pacey, "Technology in world civilization: a thousand-year history", {{ISBN|0-262-66072-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1557 the Chinese authorities allowed the Portuguese to settle in [[Macau]] through an annual payment, creating a warehouse in the triangular trade between China, Japan and Europe. In 1570 the Portuguese bought a Japanese port where they founded the city of [[Nagasaki]],&lt;ref&gt;Yosaburō Takekoshi, "The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan", {{ISBN|0-415-32379-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating a trading center for many years was the port from Japan to the world.

Portugal established trading ports at far-flung locations like [[Goa]], [[Ormuz]], [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Guarding its trade from both European and Asian competitors, Portugal dominated not only the trade between Asia and Europe, but also much of the trade between different regions of Asia, such as [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries, such as the Basque [[Francis Xavier]], followed the Portuguese to spread [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity]] to Asia with mixed success.

==Portuguese nautical science==
{{See also|Iberian ship development, 1400–1600|Iberian nautical sciences, 1400–1600|Iberian cartography, 1400–1600}}
The successive expeditions and experience of the pilots led to a fairly rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science, creating an elite of [[astronomers]], [[navigators]], [[mathematicians]] and [[cartographers]], among them stood [[Pedro Nunes]] with studies on how to determine the latitudes by the stars and [[João de Castro]].

=== Ships ===

[[File:Armada portugaise.jpg|thumb|150px|Portuguese "Armada" fleet in 1507, Lisuarte de Abreu]]
Until the 15th century, the Portuguese were limited to [[cabotage]] navigation using [[barque]]s and ''barinels'' (ancient cargo vessels used in the [[Mediterranean]]). These boats were small and fragile, with only one mast with a fixed quadrangular [[sails|sail]] and did not have the capabilities to overcome the navigational difficulties associated with Southward oceanic exploration, as the strong [[wind]]s, [[shoal]]s and strong [[ocean current]]s easily overwhelmed their abilities. They are associated with the earliest discoveries, such as the [[Madeira]] Islands, the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and to the early exploration of the north west African coast as far south as [[Arguim]] in the current [[Mauritania]].

The ship that truly launched the first phase of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the [[caravel]], a development based on existing fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing [[luffing]]. The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to [[tack (sailing)|tack]]. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Anunciação.

With the start of long oceanic [[sailing]] also large ships developed. "Nau" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily [[merchant ship]]s. Due to the [[piracy]] that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the [[Portuguese Navy|navy]] and were provided with canon windows, which led to the classification of "naus" according to the power of its artillery. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade: from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500, they become impressive in the 16th century, having usually two [[Deck (ship)|deck]]s, [[stern]] castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century there were also used [[carrack]]s, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2000 tons.

=== Celestial navigation ===

[[File:AlmanachPerpetuum.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Ephemeris]] by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496]]
In the thirteenth century [[celestial navigation]] was already known, guided by the sun position. For celestial navigation the Portuguese, like other Europeans, used [[Arab]] navigation tools, like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], which they made easier and simpler. They also created the [[cross-staff]], or ''cane of Jacob'', for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The [[Southern Cross]] become a reference upon arrival at the Southern hemisphere by [[João de Santarém]] and [[Pedro Escobar]] in 1471, starting the celestial navigation on this constellation. But the results varied throughout the year, which required corrections.

To this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables ([[Ephemeris]]), precious tools for oceanic navigation, which have experienced a remarkable diffusion in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing to calculate [[latitude]]. The tables of the Almanach Perpetuum, by astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]], published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].

===Sailing techniques===

[[Image:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|150px|Map of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s]]
Besides coastal exploration, Portuguese also made trips off in the ocean to gather [[meteorological]] and [[oceanographic]] information (in these were discovered the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, and [[Sargasso Sea]]). The knowledge of [[wind]] patterns and [[ocean current|currents]] – the [[trade winds]] and the [[oceanic gyre]]s in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the latitude of the Azores, using the permanent favorable winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of [[atmospheric circulation]] and the effect of [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]], facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese venturing increasingly farther from shore, the maneuver that became known as "[[Volta do mar]]". In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the [[Manila Galleon]] trade route.

===Cartography===
[[File:Fernão Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Pre-mercator navigation chart of the Coast of Africa (1571), by Fernão Vaz Dourado (Torre do Tombo, Lisbon)]]
It is thought that [[Jehuda Cresques]], son of the Catalan cartographer Abraham Cresques have been one of the notable [[cartographers]] at the service of Prince Henry. However the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a [[Portolan chart|Portolan]] made by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo Cão]]. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of [[latitude]]s in 1504 and the first representation of an [[Wind rose]].

With his son, cartographer [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], they participated in the making of the atlas known as "Lopo Homem-Reinés Atlas" or "[[Miller Atlas]]", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time, with Emperor Charles V wanting them to work for him. In 1517 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] handed Lopo Homem a charter gaving him the privilege to certify and amend all [[compass]] needles in vessels.

In the third phase of the former [[Iberian cartography from 1400-1600|Portuguese nautical cartography]], characterized by the abandonment of the influence of [[Ptolemy]]'s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents, stands out [[Fernão Vaz Dourado]] (Goa ~ 1520 – ~ 1580), giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time. Many of his charts are large scale.

*1512— [[António de Abreu]] discovered [[Timor]] island and reached [[Banda Islands]], [[Ambon Island]] and [[Seram]]. [[Francisco Serrão]] reached the [[Moluccas]].
*1512—[[Pedro Mascarenhas]] discover the island of [[Diego Garcia]], he also encountered the [[Mauritius]], although he may not have been the first to do so; expeditions by [[Diogo Dias]] and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 may have encountered the islands. In 1528 [[Diogo Rodrigues]] named the islands of Réunion, Mauritius, and Rodrigues the [[Mascarene Islands]], after Mascarenhas.
*1513—The first European trading ship to touch the coasts of China, under [[Jorge Álvares]] and  [[Rafael Perestrello]] later in the same year.
*1514-1531— António Fernandes`s voyage and discoveries in 1514-1515,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhodesia.nl/rhodesiana/volume19.pdf] Rhodesiana: ''The Pioneer Head''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sancho de Tovar]] from 1515 onwards, and Vicente Pegado (1531), among others, in several expeditions and contacts, are the first Europeans ever to contemplate and to describe the ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] and those regions (then referred to by the Portuguese as [[Monomotapa]]).
*1517—[[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] and [[Tomé Pires]] were chosen by [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to sail to China to formally open relations between the Portuguese Empire and the [[Ming Dynasty]] during the reign of the [[Zhengde Emperor]].
*1519-1521—[[Fernão de Magalhães]]'s expedition at the service of the King [[Charles I of Spain]] and German "Holy Roman" Emperor, in search of a westward route to the "Spice Islands" (Maluku Islands) became the first known expedition to sail from the Atlantic Ocean into the Pacific Ocean (then named "peaceful sea" by Magellan; the passage being made via the Strait of Magellan), and the first to cross the Pacific. Besides Magellan, also participated in the trip Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[João Serrão]], Álvaro de Mesquita (Magellan`s nephew), the pilots João Rodrigues de Carvalho and [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[Enrique of Malacca|Henrique of Malacca]], among others. Many of them cross almost all longitudes or all longitudes reaching the Philippines, Borneo and the Moluccas, because they had previously visited India, Mallacca, the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] or the Moluccas (1511-1512), like Ferdinand Magellan in the [[7th Portuguese India Armada (Almeida, 1505)|7th Portuguese India Armada]] under the command of [[Francisco de Almeida]] and on the expeditions of [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], Afonso de Albuquerque and his other voyages, sailing eastward from Lisbon (as Magellan in 1505), and then later, in 1521, sailing westward from Seville, reaching that longitude and region once again and then proceeding still further west.
*1525—[[Aleixo Garcia]] explored the Rio de la Plata in service to Spain as a member of the expedition of [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] in 1516. Solís had left Portugal towards Castile (Spain) in 1506 and would be financed by Christopher de Haro, who had served Manuel I of Portugal until 1516. Serving Charles I of Spain after 1516, Haro believed that Lisboa and Frois had discovered a major route in the Southern New World to west or a ''strait'' to Asia two years earlier. Later (when returning and after a shipwreck on the coast of Brazil), from Santa Catarina, [[Brazil]], and leading an expedition of some European and 2,000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]], Aleixo Garcia explored [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] using the trail network Peabiru. Aleixo Garcia was the first European to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and even managed to penetrate the outer defenses of the [[Inca Empire]] on the hills of the [[Andes]] (near [[Sucre]]), in present-day Bolivia. He was the first European to do so, accomplishing this eight years before [[Francisco Pizarro]].
*1525—[[Exploration of the Pacific|Diogo da Rocha]] and his pilot [[Gomes de Sequeira]] reached [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] and were blown off course and driven three hundred leagues in a direction constantly towards the east and to ''Ilhas de Gomes de Sequeira'' - most probably the [[Palau Island]] or [[Yap]], ([[Caroline Islands]]) according to the geographical notes, distance traveled and physical description of the natives in ''Décadas da Ásia'' of [[João de Barros]], or, according to the alleged existence of gold mentioned by the natives, other descriptions of the people and if they were to south and east in one or two voyages made by Gomes de Sequeira (According to the different interpretations of the Chronicles of Barros, Castanheda and Galvão), raises also the hypothesis of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in [[Australia]], maybe one of the [[Prince of Wales Islands]]. In Gastald`s map a group of islands named ''Insul de gomes des queria'' lie in about 8 degrees of south latitude and in the longitude of the Northern Territory of Australia. In the same map the ''Apem insul'' seems to correspond with either [[Adi Island]] or the [[Aru Islands]]. The ''Ins des hobres blancos'' (''Islands of the White Men'') correspond, as far as locality is concerned, to the Arru (Aru) Islands. It would appear then that Gomes de Sequeira's Islands, which are the south-easternmost of those represented, must correspond with the Timor Laut group. In the same year, according to the voyages to the ''Banda'' Islands mentioned on ''Decadas'' and according to contemporaneous cartographers, [[Martim Afonso de Melo]] (Jusarte) and Garcia Henriques explored the [[Tanimbar Islands]] (the archipelago labelled "''aqui invernou Martim Afonso de Melo''" and "''Aqui in bernon Martin Afonso de melo''" [Here wintered Martin Afonso de Melo]) and probably the Aru Islands (the two archipelagos and the navigator mentioned in the maps of Lázaro Luís, 1563, Bartolomeu Velho, c. 1560, Sebastião Lopes, c. 1565 and also in the 1594 map of the East Indies entitled ''Insulce Molucoe'' by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius and in the map of ''Nova Guinea'' of 1600).
*1526—Discovery of [[New Guinea]] by [[Jorge de Meneses]]
*1528—[[Diogo Rodrigues]] explores the [[Mascarene]] islands, that he names after his countryman [[Pedro Mascarenhas]], he explored and named the islands of [[Réunion]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]]&lt;ref&gt;José Nicolau da Fonseca, ''Historical and Archaeological Sketch of the City of Goa'', Bombay : Thacker, 1878, pp. 47–48.

*1559— The Nau ''São Paulo'' commanded by Rui Melo da Câmara (was part of the Portuguese India Armada commanded by Jorge de Sousa) discovered [[Île Saint-Paul]] in the South Indian Ocean. The island was mapped, described and painted by members of the crew, among them the Father Manuel Álvares and the chemist Henrique Dias (Álvares and Dias calculated the correct latitude 38° South at the time of discovery). The Nau São Paulo, who also carried women and had sailed from Europe and had scale in Brazil, would be the protagonist of a dramatic and moving story of survival after sinking south of Sumatra.
*1560—[[Gonçalo da Silveira]], Jesuit missionary, travalled up the [[Zambezi River]], on his expedition to the capital of the [[Monomotapa]] which appears to have been the [[N'Pande]] kraal, close by the [[M'Zingesi River]], a southern tributary of the Zambezi. He arrived there on 26 December 1560.
*1586—[[António da Madalena]], a [[Capuchin friar]], was one of the first [[Western world|Western]] visitors to [[Angkor]] (now Cambodja).

*1606—[[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] discovered [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]], the [[Ducie Island]] and the islands later called the [[New Hebrides]] and now the nation of [[Vanuatu]]. Queirós landed on a large island which he took to be part of the southern continent, and named it ''La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo'' (The Austrian Land of the Holy Spirit), for King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]](II), or Australia of the Holy Spirit (''Australia do Espírito Santo'') of the ''southern'' continent.

'''Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica''' are believed to have been extensive. There were various trade routes attested since prehistoric times. In this article, especially the routes starting in the [[Mexican Plateau|Mexico Central Plateau]], and going down to the Pacific coast will be considered. These contacts then went on as far as [[Central America]].

The time frame considered is from the earliest times and up to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classical Period]] (600–900 CE).

==Regional communication==
[[File:Early Mesoamerican Ballgame sites 1.svg|thumb|Early [[Mesoamerican Ballgame]] sites]]
Scholars have long identified a number of similarities between the ancient Guatemalan and Mexican art styles and cultures. These similarities start as far north as the Mexico Central Plateau and continue to the Pacific coast and as far as Central America. There are many common elements in iconography, stone sculptures and artefacts. All this led to the investigation of possible trade patterns and communication networks.

Based on archaeological and ethno historical study in eastern Guerrero since 1998, an important network of roads through the [[Sierra Madre del Sur|Sierra Madres of Guerrero]] has been identified. These roads connected the settlements in [[Morelos]] and [[Puebla]] to the longer Pacific Coast communication and trade route.&lt;ref name=Icon &gt;{{cite conference|last1=Gutiérrez |first1=Gerardo |last2=Pye |first2=Mary E. |title= Conexiones Iconográficas entre Guatemala y Guerrero: Entendiendo el funcionamiento de la ruta de comunicación a lo largo de la planicie costera del Océano Pacifico |conference=Simposio de Investigaciones Arqueológicas en Guatemala |conference-url=http://www.equiponaya.com.ar/eventos/20siag.htm |book-title=Memoria del Simposio de Investigaciones Arqueológicas en Guatemala |volume=2 |publisher=Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes. Instituto de Antropología e Historia |location=Guatemala, Guatemala |language=Spanish |trans-title=|year= 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is certain this route played a critical role in the political and economic development of southern Mesoamerica, although its importance varied over time.&lt;ref name=Icon /&gt;

There was material and information trade between the Mexico Central Plateau, the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, it is not certain whether it was made through direct contact (15 day or more trips and 15 days to return)&lt;ref name=Alva &gt;{{cite book |last1= Durán |first1=Rafael |last2=Alvarez |first2=Jose J. |year= 1856 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4VUUDoXXMEC&amp;dq |title= Itinerarios y derroteros de la República Mexicana |trans-title=Itineraries and Routes of the Republic of Mexico |publisher=J.

===Roads===

Routes from the Gulf of Mexico Mountains and the center of Oaxaca seem to have been constantly open to circulation, since at least the early preclassical period; the Pacific route was apparently blocked at different points, between Chiapas and Oaxaca, for example, during the postclassical period by the Mixtec kingdom of Tututepec on the eve of the Spanish Conquest. One group of epiclassical sculptures indicates iconographic relationships between Morelos and Guerrero, with examples also found in Pacific Coastal Chiapas and Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Icon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spores   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Spores |first= Ronald |year= 1993|title= Tutupec: A Postclassic-Period Mixtec Conquest State |trans-title=|journal= Ancient Mesoamerica |location= |url= |language= |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=167–174 |doi=10.1017/S0956536100000845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fray Bernardino de Sahagún (1989:267) Mesoamerica prehispanic roads were simple compacted dirt paths, full of stone and limited by surrounding vegetation. Today these roads have disappeared, whether by railway or asphalt roads and freeways or by abandonment at prehispanic times, in addition to normal erosion deterioration, sedimentation and invasion of adjacent vegetation.&lt;ref name=Icon /&gt;

Systematic archaeological and ethnic-historical studies in eastern Guerrero from 1998, have demonstrated the existence of an important road network through the mountain ranges of Guerrero, that connected archaeological sites of Morelos and the south of Puebla with a communication and commerce trade route throughout the Pacific Ocean coast.&lt;ref name=Guti &gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D. |last= Gutiérrez |first= Gerardo |year= 2002|title= The Expanding Polity: Patterns of the Territorial Expansion of the Post-Classic Señorío of Tlapa-Tlachinollan in the Mixteca-Nahua-Tlapaneca Region of Guerrero |trans-title=|institution=Department of anthropology, Pennsylvania State University |location= |url=https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/2111 |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Christine&gt;{{cite book |last= Niederberger |first= Christine |year= 2002 |editor1-last=Niederberger |editor1-first=Christine |editor2-last=Reyna-Robles |editor2-first=Rosa Maria |chapter= Nácar, "jade" y cinabrio: Guerrero y las redes de intercambio en la Mesoamérica antigua (1000–600 a.C.) |title= El Pasado Arqueológico de Guerrero |trans-chapter=Nacre, "jade" and cinnabar: Guerrero and trade networks in ancient Mesoamerica (1000–600 BCE) |trans-title= Guerrero's Archaeological Past |publisher=INAH/CEMCA/Gobierno del Estado de Guerrero |location=Chilpancingo, Guerrero|pages=175–223|url=|language=Spanish |format= |isbn=970-18-8483-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asociaciontikal.com/pdf/54_-_Mary_Pye.pdf Figures 1 and 2]&lt;/ref&gt; URL/title needs to be changed to match Gutiérrez, Gerardo; Pye, Mary E.

===Historical Routes===
Without taking into consideration branches and secondary deviations, there are several routes identified, that connected the center of Mexico with the Guatemala Pacific Coast, one through Puebla and the sierra, and the other through the Guerrero state and the Pacific Ocean coast. Both joined at [[Juchitán de Zaragoza|Juchitán]]. From Juchitán, again, there were two routes to Guatemala, one on the north that lead to MIxco-Kalimanjuyu and the other on the south that lead to Escuintla.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

===North Route Tenochtitlan – Juchitán===
This route left Tenochtitlan to Puebla, [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] (Tlaxcala Plateau), Orizaba and down to the "[[Sierra Madre Oriental|Eastern Sierra Madre]]" range to [[Tuxtepec]], Matias Romero and from there, towards the Isthmus.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

An alternate route from Cholula went southwards, towards Tehuacán, Oaxaca, Monte Albán and down to Juchitán.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

===Middle Route Tenochtitlan – Juchitán===
This route crosses through Oaxaca had two alternatives:

* Via de [[Tehuacán Valley]], through the [[Cañada, Oaxaca|Cuicatlán and Teotitlán]] Ravine&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;
* Through the [[Morelos Valley]] and then through the Lower Mixteca, [[Huajuapan de León]]; as well as [[La Mixteca|Mixteca Alta]], Yanhuitlán and Nochistlán.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

From the Oaxaca central valleys the route went towards Nejapa, Tequisistlán, and arrived at [[Tehuantepec]], then Juchitán. and.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

===South Route Tenochtitlan – Juchitán===
This route started at Tenochtitlan, south to Morelos, [[Chalcatzingo]] and headed east towards the state of Guerrero, passing through [[Chiautla de Tapia|Chiautla]], [[Huamuxtitlán]], [[Tlapa de Comonfort|Tlapa]] and [[Ometepec]], from there headed towards the "[[Sierra Madre del Sur]]" and the coast, via Tututepec and [[Huatulco]] all the way up to Tehuantepec.

===Route Juchitán to Guatemala===
From Juchitán to Guatemala there were two routes, north and south.

* The northern route, went from Juchitán to [[San Pedro Tapanatepec|Tapanatepec]] and then towards "Chiapa de los Indios" ([[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]]) and headed towards [[Comitan, Chiapas|Comitán]] and then, in Guatemalan territory, onto [[Huehuetenango]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Chimaltenango]] and [[Mixco Viejo]].&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;
* The southern Isthmus or Soconusco route continued from [[San Pedro Tapanatepec|Tapanatepec]] to [[Tonalá, Chiapas|Tonalá]], [[Pijijiapan]], Tuxtla Chico, and then in Guatemalan territory, onto [[Retalhuleu]] and down to [[Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa]], [[Escuintla]].&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

In spite of the importance of these routes, passage through these routes was blocked by the Mixtec Kingdom of Tututepec, that monopolized it for their own benefit&lt;ref name="Acuña"   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Acuña |first=   René |year=  1984|title= Relaciones geográficas del siglo XVI: Antequera, Tomos Segundo y Tercero. |trans-title=Geographical relationships of the 16th century: Antequera, volumes second and third  |journal=  Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México |location=  México |language=Spanish |format= Volume 2:187 – 189.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused tensions with the political groups of the Mexican Plateau, especially with the Triple Alliance.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

==Regional relations and commerce==
[[File:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|thumb|Formative Period in southern Mesoamerica]]
There are numerous evidences of regional trade from northwestern mesoamerican civilizations, the Mexican highlands and Centro America with southern lands as far down as Peru and Colombia, some of which are suspected but remain a strong possibility, based on evidences. Certainly, it is elemental understanding how people traveled and traded.

As early as 1881, [[Carl Bovallius]] Swedish archaeologist and investigator exploring Central America ([[Ometepe (archaeological site)|Ometepe]] and [[Zapatera (archaeological site)|Zapatera]]), noted: "Los Orotinas far separated from their relations, inhabiting the peninsula of Nicoya and the territory of Guanacaste, which comprises the north-eastern part of the republic of Costa Rica. Opinions vary, however, with regard to these groups, several authors being inclined to regard los Cholutecas as a detached branch of los Pipiles in El Salvador; they would then be of Toltecan origin. Certainly there are a number of local names within their district which seem to corroborate this opinion."&lt;ref name=Carl  &gt;{{cite journal |last=Bovallius |first=Carl   |year=  1886|title=Nicaraguan Antiquities |trans-title=|journal=Swedish Society of Anthropology and Geography  |location=Stockholm, Sweden  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Nicaraguan_Antiquities_(1886).djvu |language= |format= |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bovallius, other writers are disposed to ascribe a Mexican origin to the Orotinas and lastly Dr. Berendt&lt;ref name=Berendt   &gt;{{cite journal |last=Dr. Berendt |first=   |year=1870  |title= Geographical Distribution of the Ancient Central American Civilization |trans-title=|journal=  Journal of the American Geographical society of New York |location=  vol. 8, p. 142.|language= |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the whole Chorotegan stock may be considered as a Toltecan offspring, the name Choroteganos being only a corruption of Cholutecas. According to the concurrent testimonies of the old chroniclers the Niquirans were a Mexican people settled in the country at a comparatively late period. It is not clear whether they were Toltecs or Aztecs, and this question cannot probably be decided until the ancient remains, surely very numerous, that they have left behind them, shall have been accurately studied and compared with the better known Mexican antiquities. The intelligent and well-built Indians on the island of Ometepec are doubtless the descendants of the Niquirans; this is corroborated by their language, which the successful investigations of SQUIER have shown to be of Mexican origin and presenting a very close similarity to the pure Aztec tongue. (Written in 1886)&lt;ref name=Carl   /&gt;

An elemental piece of this discussion was provided by Bernal Diaz del Castillo,&lt;ref name=Diaz   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Diaz del Castillo |first=   Bernal |year=1976  |title= Historia de la conquista de Nueva España |trans-title=History of the conquest of new Spain |journal=  Editorial Porrúa, México |location= 11th Edition |language=Spanish |format=p. 396}}&lt;/ref&gt; who mentioned that once they took over Tenochtitlan (1521 CE), lords from Tehuantepec came before Cortes to ask for help in fighting one of their neighbors, Tututepec, whom were battling them constantly. Cortes sent Pedro de Alvarado who in time conquered Tututepec. It is interesting understanding the Tututepec political expansion and their western wars against the Mexicas, near Ometepec, Guerrero and to the east with Tehuantepec, they had blocked that route during the Mesoamerican postclassical period.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

There are many debates related to the definition of specific sculptures styles,&lt;ref name=Christa   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Schieber de Lavarreda |first=   Christa |year=  1999|title= Taller arqueología de la región de la Costa Sur de Guatemala |trans-title=Archaeological workshop of southern Guatemala region |journal=  Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes |location=  Guatemala |language=Spanish |format=pp. 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in general terms the Parsons proposal&lt;ref name=Parsons   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Parsons |first=   Lee A |date=  |title= Post-Olmec Stone Sculpture: The Olmec-Izapan Transition on the Southern Pacific Coast and Highlands, in The Olmec and Their Neighbors (edited by E. Benson),|trans-title=|journal=  Dumbarton Oaks |location=  Washington, D.C. |url=|language= |format= pp. 257–288|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is accepted, in the sense that there is a mesoamerican sculpture tradition from the preclassical to the postclassical periods, with divergent lines, some of which disappear and others with evolving styles from regional development, and that at the same time, with cross information from a region to another, that there are spectacular fashion styles that may vanish at a point in time, only to return adapted to new conditions.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

This process has an effect in the chronology, makes an exact dating of pieces troublesome, the problem is compounded because the majority of the pieces lost their original context, some from prehispanic times.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

===Early Preclassical Period (1200–900 BCE)===
Based on the presence of a ceramic style pottery shaped as pots (Tecomates), found in the Tlapa and Huamuxtitlán, it is known that the region had an early cultural development predating the Olmecs.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

A female ceramic figurine from the Huamuxtitlán valley indicates an archaeological occupation of eastern Guerrero State, contemporary to the Chiapas Ocós Phase (1500–1350 BCE);&lt;ref name=C&amp;M   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Mary E.

===Mid-Preclassical Period (900-500 BCE)===
Stratigraphic wells and radiocarbon dating at the Contlalco and Cerro Quemado-La Coquera sites in the Tlapa Valley, Guerrero, confirm massive platforms construction between 740 and 500 BCE.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Olmec-style murals in the [[Oxotitlán]], [[Juxtlahuaca]] and Cauadzidziqui caves and sculpture from the [[Teopantecuanitlan]] site, confirm a strong connection with [[Chalcatzingo]] in the Valley of Morelos. Iconographic representations similarities of these sites with the Pacific coast of Chiapas and Guatemala, depict closer relations than those suggested by the argument that they simply share a pan-mesoamerican tradition.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Thus, the style resemblance between [[Takalik Abaj|Tak´alik Ab´aj]], Guatemala monument 1 and individuals depicted on Chalcatzingo relief 1-B-2 have been repeatedly established.&lt;ref name=Cova   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Covarrubias |first=   Miguel |year= 1957 |title= Indian Art of Mexico and Central America. |trans-title=|journal=  Alfred A.

Should also note the similarity between the relief of [[Chalchuapa]] ([[El Salvador]]) with the main character of Cauadzidziqui, Guerrero. Other cases involving close similarities are noted in Xoc, Chiapas, and the San Miguel Amuco, Guerrero relief.&lt;ref name=Louis   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Louise Paradis |first=   Grove, David C. |year=  1971|title= An Olmec Stela from San Miguel Amuco, Guerrero |trans-title=|journal=  American Antiquity |location=  |url= |language= |format= 36 (1):95-102. |doi=10.2307/278026 |volume=36 |pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ekholm   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Ekholm-Miller |first=   Susana |year=  1973|title= The Olmec Rock Carving at Xoc, Chiapas, Mexico.

===Late Preclassical Period (500 BCE – 200 CE)===
According to Parsons, during this time an iconographical transition between the [[Olmec]] and [[Izapa]] communication codes takes place, as would be the cases of Monument 55 of [[Takalik Abaj]], Guatemala, and Monument 1 of [[Huamelulpan (archaeological site)|Huamelulpan]], Oaxaca.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

However, for the case of Guerrero and Morelos this phase lends itself to controversy, since chronologically speaking the mixture of time periods of Olmec symbols in sculptures and reliefs is not understood, as reported by the main archeological sites of the region. The symbols permanence from one period to another is the main factor that makes the task difficult of understanding the styles evolution and the connections between diverse regions.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Paddock) |trans-title=|journal= Stanford University Press |location= Stanford. |language=Spanish |format= pp. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The S-inverted glyph complex would be represented by [[Chalcatzingo]] petroglyph 1-A- : a seated individual inside a cavity, accompanied by two glyphs precisely resembling a horizontal letter S.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Parsons noticed that this S-inverted glyph&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Lee A. (1981:256)&lt;/ref&gt; appears also at the chest of the post-Olmec sculpture of Palo Gordo, Suchitepéquez, known as the "Piedra Santa" (holy stone) sculpture. This same glyph is repeated in Chalcatzingo's  monument 31&lt;ref name=GroveD   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Grove |first=   David C. |year=  1996|title= Archaeological Contexts of Olmec Art Outside of the Gulf Coast. In Olmec Art of Ancient Mexico (edited by E. Benson &amp; B. de la Fuente)|trans-title=|journal=  National Art Gallery |location=  Washington, D.C. |language=Spanish |format= pp. 113. (Fig. 8) }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the S-inverted is depicted in a scene in which a bird beaked jaguar attacks a human.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Another identifiable figure is the bird-man, characterized by men dressed as birds. This figure can be identified at the mid-preclassical Oxotitlan cave, as well as Estela 4 and altar 3 at [[Izapa]], during the late preclassical and continues to be used during the epiclassical sculpture at Villa Rotaria, in the Guerrero Costa Grande.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

The use of the Pacific Ocean communication route during the late preclassical, is also inferred from the Izapa estela-smooth altar and its similarity to the steles and smooth altars found at the sites of the Pelillo and Metates sites of the Costa Chica, Guerrero; as with the "barrigones" of Monte Alto, Guatemala and the full-bodied "barrigon" from Cola Palma, Pinotepa Nacional in the boundaries between Oaxaca and Guerrero.&lt;ref name=Gamio   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Gamio |first=   Lorenzo |year=  1967|title= Zona arqueológica Cola de Palma, Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca |trans-title=Archaeological site Cola de Palma, Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca  |journal=  Boletín de INAH 28:25–28|location=  México |language=Spanish |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Classical Period (600–900 CE)===
During the early classical and even up to 600 CE, the iconographic codes seem to be silenced. The Petén and Usumacinta Mayan style dominate in the Chiapas and Guatemala highlands. On the Oaxaca coast the codes become Zapote and Ñuiñe, while in Guerrero and the Guatemala Costa Teotihuacan predominates.&lt;ref name=Bove   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Bove, Frederick J.|first=   Sonia Medrano Busto |year=  2003|title= Teotihuacan, Militarism, and Pacific Guatemala.

The Cotzumalguapa style flourishes in the Guatemala coast, while Guerrero registers the same code shared is sites like [[Xochicalco]], [[Teotenango]] and [[Cacaxtla]]. Reminiscent of the late preclassical, the scenes can be quite elaborate and are accompanied by multiple glyphs and numerals which are used to represent calendar dates or names of the characters.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Again there are coincidences style and themes throughout the coast of the Pacific, there is a clear example in crossed arms sculptures, apparently representations of ancestors.&lt;ref name=Urcid  &gt;{{cite journal |last= Urcid |first=   Javier |year=  1993|title= The Pacific Coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero: The Westernmost Extent of Zapotec Script |trans-title=|journal=  Ancient Mesoamerica |location=  |url= |language= |format= 4 (1):153. |doi=10.1017/s0956536100000833 |volume=4 |pages=141–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex of men jaguar, present since the Tuxtla Chico mid-preclassical sculpture and observable even today with guerrerenses peoples fertility dances, reached a great splendor in the case of [[El Baúl]], Stela 27 and [[Piedra Labrada]], monument 3. Jaguars of these two sites, El Baúl and Piedra Labrada, exhibit also aesthetic similarities as noticed in the 1960s by Miles.&lt;ref name=Miles   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Miles |first=   Susana W. |year=  1965|title= Summary of Preconquest Ethnology of the Guatemala-Chiapas Highlands and Pacific Slopes. En Handbook of Middle American Indians, Vol.2 (editado por G. Willey), |trans-title=|journal=  University of Texas Press, Austin |location=Austin, Texas |language= |format= pp. 247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, as in [[Xochicalco]] stele 3; [[Horcones]] stele 4 (Chiapas), and a ceramic figurine from [[Azoyú]], Guerrero, Jaguars have bifid tongues, as if recalling a "heart devouring" ancient deity, depicted in the Teotihuacan murals of  Atetelco.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;&lt;ref name=Beatriz   &gt;{{cite journal |last= De la Fuente |first=   Beatriz |year=  1995|title= Tetitla.

In 1986, when Carlos Navarrete&lt;ref name=Navarrete   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Navarrete |first=   Carlos |year=  1978|title= The Prehispanic System of Communications Between Chiapas and Tabasco. En Mesoamerican Communication Routes and Cultural Contacts. Papers of the New World Archaeological Foundation, No. 40.|trans-title=|journal=  Brigham Young University |location=  Provo |language= |format= pp. 75–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; registered the sculptural body of [[Cerro Bernal]], was the first to propose the iconographic relationship between central Mexico and the Pacific coast, by associating the body glyph and iconography of the Horcones stele 3 with Xochicalco Stela 2. It is now known that this association followed the Guerrero and Costa Chica route, thanks to the two Tlaloc representations located in Chilpancingo. One of the Tlaloc figures has the "cuatro movimiento" (four movement) glyph in the chest, in the same style used in Xochicalco. Characters with goggles, possibly rain deities are present along the coast, as in the case of the so-called "Dios Cangrejo" (God Crab) from [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]]" and Monument 12 at Piedra Labrada.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

Another example present in both regions is the death deities that "crumble" hearts with skeletal hands, as the case of El Baúl, monument 4 and Terreno de Coimbra monument 1, near Marquelia, on the Guerrero Costa Chica. The Coimbra death deity is probably associated with the complex of death gods, such as those of Palo Gordo,&lt;ref name=Chin   &gt;{{cite journal |last= Chinchilla Mazariegos |first=   Oswaldo |year=  2002|title= Palo Gordo, Guatemala, y el estilo artístico Cotzumalguapa.

Just like during the early classical, is during the postclassical period when the iconographic connection is lost again, detected between the Valley of Morelos and Guerrero, and Guerrero eastern coast of Chiapas with Guatemala, is lost. But unlike the early classical, it is known that during the postclassical period, the Tututepec political expansion is responsible for having blocked the Pacific route and the route never again had important traffic. Ironically it is today, with migrants and narcotics trafficking, when the Pacific route, land and maritime, has strongly resurfaced reviving routes lost a thousand years ago.&lt;ref name=Icon   /&gt;

'''Rodney Cockburn''' (21 October 1877 – 28 September 1932) was a South Australian journalist, author of a popular reference book on South Australian place names.

== History ==
[[File:Rodney Cockburn 1904.jpg|thumb|Rodney Cockburn, c. 1904]]
Cockburn was born in [[Kent Town, South Australia]], a son of George (c. 1835 – 2 December 1909) and Mary Cockburn (née Stewart) (c. 1844 – 10 May 1880). 
:His father, born in [[Alloa]], Scotland had served in the [[Royal Navy]], then around 1860 emigrated to South Australia, where two half-brothers had already settled. He completed his apprenticeship as a printer at the ''[[South Australian Register|Register]]'', where he continued to work for over 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article203453613 |title=A Grand Old Sailor |newspaper=[[Evening Journal (Adelaide)|Evening Journal]] |volume=XLIII |issue=12068 |location=Adelaide |date=2 December 1909 |accessdate=20 April 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named his son Rodney, appropriately born on [[Trafalgar Day]], for one of his ships, the {{HMS|Rodney|1833|6}}, which was in turn named for [[Admiral Rodney]].
He was educated at Flinders Street State school, and joined the ''Register'' as a "library boy" around 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129853781 |title=What Was Your First Job? |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |volume=II |issue=143 |location=Adelaide |date=7 January 1924 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elevated to the literary staff, where he was rated "one of the best journalists in Australia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article211429456 |title=Personal. |newspaper=[[The Critic (Adelaide)|The Critic]] |volume= |location=Adelaide |date=15 December 1909 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the smartest journalist of his years, column-crowding the dailies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article167807339 |title=Personalities. |newspaper=[[Quiz (Adelaide newspaper)]] |volume=XII |issue=607 |location=South Australia |date=18 April 1901 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he was made an "excellent sub-editor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article212156308 |title=Personal Pips. |newspaper=[[The Critic (Adelaide)|The Critic]] |volume=XV |issue=856 |location=Adelaide |date=8 July 1914 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in July 1914 the [[Archibald Peake|Peake]] government decided to institute a South Australian [[Hansard]] office, a function which had previously been contracted to the local press, Cockburn was selected assistant to [[Fred Johns]]'s leader. He served in that position for eighteen years, until forced by ill-health to retire. Cockburn was admirably suited to the job, as he was noted for his speedy and accurate [[shorthand]]. Johns remembered his "bright and breezy nature, and sparkling wit and humor" somewhat offset by "temperamental faults — and who hasn't them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34704574 |title=Death of Mr. R. Cockburn |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=29 September 1932 |accessdate=20 April 2017 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The work entailed not only recording the proceedings of the two houses of Parliament, but also of the various committees, notably the Public Works committee. Nevertheless, the position clearly allowed of time and facilities to pursue private research, as Johns produced a huge number of concise biographies of notable Australians which became a series of reference books, and Cockburn the voluminous notes on the histories of South Australian towns and geographical features, and the ensuing work for which he is remembered today, the manuscript of which the [[Mitchell Library (Australia)|Mitchell Library]] acquired in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article142395409 |title=South Australian Nomenclature |newspaper=[[Newcastle Morning Herald And Miners' Advocate]] |issue=18,540 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 March 1936 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which was used by Stewart Cockburn for a new edition of his famous father's work entitled ''What's in a Name''.

In August 1916, at the height of World War I anti-German sentiment, Cockburn was appointed to the South Australian Nomenclature Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59824084 |title=German Names |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |volume=5 |issue=221 |location=Adelaide |date=12 August 1916 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was given the hugely popular task of expunging place names of Teutonic origin or association from the State's map. Their deliberations resulted in the [[Nomenclature Act of 1917]] and their consequent wholesale replacement (see [[List of Australian place names changed from German names#South Australia|List of changed names]]).

==Other interests==
In his younger days he was a member of the North Adelaide Cycling Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article161767897 |title=Cycling |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=LVIII |issue=3,138 |date=23 November 1901 |accessdate=20 April 2017 |page=20 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a lacrosse player and official, serving as secretary of the South Australian Lacrosse Association for several years. He was the organising chairman for a South Australian tour by the Canadian lacrosse team. 
He has been mentioned as reporting lacrosse activities for ''The Register'' under the pen-name "Canadia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25701924 |title=Lacrosse |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |volume=XXIII |issue=6,583 |location=Western Australia |date=27 April 1907 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Rodney Cockburn married Marguerite Elizabeth Stapleton "Reta" Guerin (1883 – 5 January 1918) on 15 October 1910. Reta was a daughter of well-known accountant Herbert Robin Guerin, an [[Adelaide Educational Institution|AEI alumnus]]. He married again, to Ruby Ethel Adams Farmer ( –1954) on 1920. They had one son:
*(Alexander) Stewart Cockburn (1920–2009)
Alexander "Fid" Cockburn (1866–1943), Isabella Cockburn (1867–1903), George Stewart Cockburn (1869–1905), James Ralph Cockburn (1871–1900), Mary Cockburn (1873–1909), Walter Cockburn (1875–1903), and Margaret "Maggie" Cockburn (1879–1912) were siblings.

==Criticism==
Cockburn's book ''Nomenclature of South Australia'' is not faultless, far from it. Geoff Manning, in the preface to ''Place Names of Our Land'', the latest edition of his ''Romance of Place Names of South Australia'', points out that apart from numerous omissions, something like one in ten entries contains errors of fact, some of them egregious. He is also critical of two pioneering toponymy historians, the surveyors C. H. Harris and H. C. Talbot who, when documented evidence was not available, published hearsay as fact. Information from these sources has been accepted uncritically by later historians, perpetuating many errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffmanning.net.au/html/place-names.html|title=Geoff Manning's Insight into South Australian History|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody''' ('''RCIADIC''') (1987–1991) was a [[Royal Commission]] appointed by the [[Australian Government]] in October 1987 to study and report upon the underlying social, cultural and legal issues behind the deaths in custody of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders]], in the light of the high level of such deaths. 

The Commission was conducted under the ''Commission of Inquiry (Deaths in Custody) Act'' 1987 as amended on 15 June 1988 and 15 June 1989. The inquiry into the deaths of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders after an arrest or conviction, whether by suicide, natural causes, medical conditions, or injuries caused by police. The terms of reference for the inquiry limited it to such deaths between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989.

The Commission comprised 5 Commissioners: [[Patrick Dodson]], D.J. O'Dea, [[Hal Wootten]], AC, QC, L.F. Wyvill, QC and [[Elliott Johnston]], QC. Hal Wootten was a former judge of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/wootten-warns-of-unrealistic-hopes-for-finding-closure-20121113-29aj2.html|title=Wootten warns of unrealistic hopes for finding closure|first=Jonathan|last=Swan|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elliott Johnston was a judge of the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]].

Aboriginal activist [[Rob Riley (Aboriginal activist)|Rob Riley]] was appointed Head of the Aboriginal Issues Unit of the Commission until [[Ruby Hammond]] was appointed to the position in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = International law obligations to provide reparations for human rights abuses|date = 1999|url = http://worldlii.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MurUEJL/1999/41.html|last = Buti|journal = Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law|volume = 6|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission investigated 99 cases of [[Aboriginal deaths in custody]] between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989, including the death of rugby player [[Eddie Murray (rugby league)|Eddie Murray]] in 1981 at the [[Wee Waa]] police station,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Indigenous Law Resources|first=Reconciliation and Social Justice Library|title=Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/rciadic/|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[death of John Pat]] at [[Roebourne, Western Australia]] in 1983, of which commissioner Elliott Johnston was critical of the lack of any disciplinary charges against five officers implicated in the violent death of the 16-year-old Aboriginal boy—calling this "a most unsatisfactory state of affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/rciadic/individual/brm_jpp/107.html John Peter Pat - 14.1.2 An Overview] Royal Commission report, at Indigenous Law Resources, austlii.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report of the Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/rciadic/ Reports of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in April 1991. The Commission concluded that the 99 deaths investigated&lt;ref name=abs&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Deaths%20in%20custody~73 ABS: Year Book Australia, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; were not due to police violence:&lt;ref name="rcdic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/rciadic/national/vol1/54.html |title=National Report Volume 1 - Chapter 3 The Findings of the Commissioners as to the Deaths |accessdate=2006-05-17 |publisher=AustLII Reconciliation and Social Justice Library |year=1998 |work=Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... the immediate causes of the deaths do not include foul play, in the sense of unlawful, deliberate killing of Aboriginal prisoners by police and prison officers. More than one-third of the deaths (37) were from disease; 30 were self-inflicted hangings; 23 were caused by other forms of external trauma, especially head injuries; and 9 were immediately associated with dangerous alcohol and other drug use. Indeed, heavy alcohol use was involved in some way in deaths in each of these categories. The chapter concludes that glaring deficiencies existed in the standard of care afforded to many of the deceased."

A related issue, not investigated by the Commission, is the disproportionately high number of Indigenous Australians who come under some form of custody or who are imprisoned under the law. One of the outcomes of the Commission was the establishment of a National Deaths in Custody Monitoring and Research Program at the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]].&lt;ref name=abs /&gt;

{{japanese name|Ōkawa}}

{{nihongo|'''Shūmei Ōkawa'''|大川 周明|Ōkawa Shūmei|extra= December 6, 1886 – December 24, 1957}} was a [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalist]], [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] writer, indicted [[war criminal]]. In the prewar period, he was known for his publications on [[Japanese history]], [[philosophy of religion]], [[Indian philosophy]], and [[colonialism]]. He is frequently called a "[[right-wing]]" writer, although he described himself as [[anti-capitalist]] and rejected the label "right-wing".

== Background ==
Ōkawa was born in [[Sakata, Yamagata]], Japan in 1886. He graduated from [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1911, where he had studied [[vedas|Vedic]] literature and classical Indian philosophy. After graduation, Ōkawa worked for the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] doing translation work. He had a sound knowledge of German, French, English, [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].&lt;ref&gt;Wakabayashi, Modern Japanese Thought, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

He briefly flirted with [[socialism]] in his college years, but in the summer of 1913 he read a copy of [[Sir]] [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Henry Cotton]]'s ''New India, or India in transition'' (1886, revised 1905) which dealt with the contemporary political situation. After reading this book, Ōkawa abandoned "complete cosmopolitanism" (''sekaijin'') for Pan-Asianism. Later that year articles by [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] and [[Maulavi Barkatullah]] appeared in the magazine ''Michi'', published by [[Dōkai]], a religious organization in which Ōkawa was later to play a prominent part. While he studied, he briefly housed the Indian independence leader [[Rash Behari Bose]].

After years of study of foreign philosophies, he became increasingly convinced that the solution to Japan's pressing social and political problems lay in an alliance with Asian independence movements, a revival of pre-modern [[Japanese philosophy]], and a renewed emphasis on the ''[[kokutai]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Securing Japan: Tokyo's Grand Strategy and the Future of East Asia, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Okawa_Shumei_c.jpg|thumb|left|Ōkawa as a youth]]

In 1918, Ōkawa went to work for the [[South Manchurian Railway]] Company, under its East Asian Research Bureau. Together with [[Ikki Kita]] he founded the nationalist discussion group and political club ''[[Yūzonsha]]''. In the 1920s, he became an instructor of history and colonial policy at [[Takushoku University]], where he was also active in the creation of [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and nationalist student groups.&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi, The Penguin History of the Second World War p. 657&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he introduced [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s theory of [[social threefolding]] to Japan.

In 1926, Ōkawa published his most influential work: {{nihongo|''Japan and the Way of the Japanese''||Nihon oyobi Nihonjin no michi}}, which was so popular that it was reprinted 46 times by the end of World War II. Ōkawa also became involved in a number of attempted [[coups d'état]] by the [[Japanese military]] in the early 1930s, including the [[March Incident]], for which he was sentenced to five years in prison in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, The Making of Modern Japan, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; Released after only two years, he briefly re-joined the South Manchurian Railway Company before accepting a post as a professor at [[Hosei University]] in 1939. He continued to publish numerous books and articles, helping popularize the idea that a "[[clash of civilizations]]" between the East and West was inevitable, and that Japan was destined to assume the mantle of liberator and protector of Asia against the United States and other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;Wakabayashi, Modern Japanese Thought, pp. 226-227&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal ==
[[File:Okawa Shumei in court.jpg|thumb|Ōkawa in court]]

After World War II, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prosecuted Ōkawa as a [[class-A war criminal]]. Of the twenty-eight people indicted with this charge, he was the only one who wasn't a military officer or government official. The Allies described him to the press as the "Japanese Goebbels" and claimed that he had long agitated for a war between Japan and the West. In pre-trial hearings, Okawa countered that he had merely translated and commented on [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]'s geopolitical philosophy in 1924, and that in fact Pan-Asianism did not advocate for war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanfocus.org/-Cemil-Aydin/2695 Japan’s Pan-Asianism and the Legitimacy of Imperial World Order, 1931–1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Ōkawa behaved erratically – dressing in pajamas, sitting barefoot, and hitting the bald head of the former prime minister [[Hideki Tōjō]] while shouting "Inder! Kommen Sie!" (Come, Indian!) in [[German language|German]], and so on. Some heard him shout "This is act one of the comedy!"  [[U.S. Army]] [[psychiatrist]] Daniel Jaffe examined him and reported he was unfit to stand trial. Therefore, the presiding judge Sir [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] (The President of the Tokyo Tribunal) concluded that he was [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and dropped the case against him. (Of the remaining defendants, seven were hanged and the rest imprisoned.)&lt;ref&gt;Maga, ''Judgment at Tokyo: The Japanese War Crimes Trials''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halzack&gt;{{cite news

== After the war ==

Ōkawa was transferred from the jail to a [[US Army]] hospital in Japan, which concluded that he had mental instability, caused by [[syphilis]]. Later, he was transferred to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Hospital]], a famous [[mental hospital]], where he completed the third Japanese translation of the entire [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;While Ōkawa made reference to the Arabic original, he made his translation from about ten language editions, including English, Chinese, German, and French, as his knowledge of Arabic was only basic. At least three more translations of the Quran into Japanese have been produced since then, including several from the Arabic original. Ōkawa's version is difficult to find nowadays. See Krämer, “Pan-Asianism’s Religious Undercurrents,” pp. 627–630.&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from hospital in 1948. He spent the final years of his life writing a memoir, ''Anraku no Mon'', reflecting on how he found peace in the mental hospital.

In October 1957, [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] requested an audience with him during a brief visit to Japan. The invitation was hand-delivered to Ōkawa's house by an Indian Embassy official, who found that Ōkawa was already on his deathbed and was unable to leave the house. He died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;Sekioka Hideyuki. ''Ōkawa  Shūmei no Dai-Ajia-Shugi''. Tokyo: [[Kodansha]], 2007. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Concert for New York City''' was a [[benefit concert]], featuring many famous musicians, that took place on October 20, 2001 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in response to the [[September 11 attacks]]. Aside from performing for charity, the concert was an attempt to honor the first responders from the [[New York City Fire Department]] and [[New York City Police Department]], their families, and those lost in the attacks and those who had worked in the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts in the weeks since that time.

The concert was organized by [[Paul McCartney]] and included many legendary [[United Kingdom|British]] contemporaries, including [[The Who]], Rolling Stones bandmates [[Jagger/Richards|Mick Jagger and Keith Richards]], [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], and [[Eric Clapton]].  [[United States|American]] artists included [[Bon Jovi]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Destiny's Child]], the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[James Taylor]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Five for Fighting]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[John Mellencamp]] with [[Kid Rock]], and a humorous performance by [[Adam Sandler]] as  "[[Operaman]]." [[Paul Shaffer]] acted as [[Musical Director]] for the show and various celebrities and political figures including [[Howard Stern]] and [[Rudy Giuliani]] appeared between the acts.

Many athletes also appeared between the acts including [[Joe Torre]], whose Yankees were on their way to competing in their fourth consecutive [[2001 World Series|World Series]]. The concert also included several short films made by New York City's most notable filmmakers such as [[Woody Allen]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Spike Lee]], and [[Kevin Smith]].

Over 60 stars that participated in the concert signed unique memorabilia backstage at [[Madison Square Garden]] that were later auctioned off to support the [[Robin Hood Foundation]]. The autographed items included three large posters of the concert and three customized 24" drumheads. Other items included a complete drumset and guitar.

==Audience reaction==
Much of the crowd itself was extremely emotional, with victims' family members and colleagues holding up portraits of the dead. Three speakers were booed: actress [[Susan Sarandon]] (for plugging New York mayoralty candidate [[Mark J. Green|Mark Green]]), actor [[Richard Gere]] (for speaking about non-violent tolerance), and New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] before saying anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xa6BZXnGOQ|title=Hillary Clinton Booed in N.Y.C|publisher=The Oreilly Factor|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton did not overtly acknowledge the reaction, and spoke over the noise of the crowd by raising her voice. In contrast, her husband former President [[Bill Clinton]] also appeared, but was very positively received by the crowd. Richard Gere did acknowledge the crowd's jeering at his pacifist stance, stating, "That's apparently unpopular right now, but that's all right." Repeat broadcasts and the DVD version of the concert were digitally edited to remove the booing and replace it with dubbed cheering for Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/2002/cyb20020830.asp Booing of Hillary Transformed into Applause] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713232000/http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/2002/cyb20020830.asp |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Sandler]]'s appearance as [[Operaman]] was a comic highlight of the evening. He sang a humorous song about the greatness of [[New York City]], the end of [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s term as mayor, the [[New York Yankees]] who were in the middle of playing in the [[2001 ALCS]], the musical acts that preceded him on stage (in which he mentioned that [[Destiny's Child]] gave him a "bone-ah"), and [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s cowardice, including the line "''Osama says he's tough, Osama says he's brave/Then tell me why Osama is shitting in a cave!''"

Musically, the audience responded most fervently to [[The Who]], roaring as they came on stage with a roiling "[[Who Are You (song)|Who Are You]]", drowning out the band on the famous "It's only teenage wasteland" refrain of "[[Baba O'Riley]]," and reaching a peak of excitement with "[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]." The backdrop for the band consisted of an American flag alongside a British flag, showing solidarity. Vocalist [[Roger Daltrey]]'s final words to the crowd of first responders and their families were: "We could never follow what you did." This performance would turn out to be bassist [[John Entwistle|John Entwistle's]] final performance in America with The Who; he died of a [[John Entwistle#Death|heart attack]] only eight months later. Multi-instrumentalist [[Jon Carin]], who had worked with the band during the group's [[The Who Tour 1996–1997|1996–1997 tours]], played keyboards in place of longtime keyboardist [[John Bundrick|John "Rabbit" Bundrick]].

Other highlights included [[David Bowie]]'s opening tandem of [[Paul Simon]]'s "[[America (Paul Simon song)|America]]" and his own "[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]", dedicated to his local ladder company, and New York's own [[Billy Joel]]'s "[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]" where Joel says after singing it, "I wrote that song 25 years ago, I thought it was gonna be a science fiction song. I never thought it would really happen. But unlike the end of that song...we ain't going anywhere!" [[Elton John]]'s sentimental "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" was also well received, among other performances. After The Who's performance, FDNY firefighter Mike Moran spoke to the audience, explaining that his brother was killed on 9/11, and that the victims would not be forgotten. He ended by saying "In the spirit of the [[Ireland|Irish]] people, [[Osama Bin Laden]], you can kiss my royal, Irish ass!" which was met with wild cheering and applause. Moran removed his cap and concluded with, "This is my face, bitch!" which was, again, met with cheers from the crowd.

When Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey, the two surviving members of The Who, were given the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in December 2008 for their contributions to American culture, a tribute performance of "Baba O'Riley" was delivered by [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]]. In the end refrain of "teenage wasteland", a full choir of FDNY firemen was revealed behind a curtain - bellowing the refrain - in gratitude for The Who's performance at The Concert for New York City, seven years prior.

The film ends with a message from Woody Allen: "I love this town."

[[John Cusack]] introduced the film with a message from Woody Allen: "I apologize in advance for my short movie. The cause was so worthwhile that I could not say no when approached to contribute something to this wonderful show. I did the best I could.

'''United Nations Security Council Resolution 502''' was a resolution adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 3 April 1982.  After expressing its concern at [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|the invasion of]] the [[Falkland Islands]] by the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic|armed forces]] of Argentina, the Council demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities between Argentina and the United Kingdom and a complete withdrawal by Argentine forces. The Council also called on the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to the situation and refrain from further military action.

The resolution, tabled by the British representative, Amb. [[Anthony Parsons|Sir Anthony Parsons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1899334.stm |title=Falklands War: The first day, 2 April 1982 |date=2 April 2002 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted by 10 votes to 1 against (Panama) with four [[abstention]]s (China, Poland, Spain and the Soviet Union).

Resolution 502, which was in the United Kingdom's favour, gave the UK the option to invoke [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter#Article 51|Article 51 of the United Nations Charter]] and claim the [[Self-defence_in_international_law|right of self-defence]]. It was supported by members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and by the [[European Economic Community]], which later imposed sanctions on Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibran |first=Daniel K. |title=The Falklands War: Britain Versus the Past in the South Atlantic |publisher=McFarland |date=2007 |pages=77 |isbn=978-0-7864-3736-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ChMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QXUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1755,5144126&amp;dq= |title=The legalities of the Falkland Islands crisis |last=Maechling Jr |first=Charles |date=27 April 1982 |work=The Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtue ethics''' (or '''aretaic ethics'''&lt;ref&gt;David Carr, Jan Steutel (eds.), ''Virtue Ethics and Moral Education'', Routledge, 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ɪ|k}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]] (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'')) are [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theories which emphasize [[virtues]] of mind and character. Virtue ethicists discuss the nature and definition of [[virtues]] and other related problems. These include how virtues are acquired, how they are applied in various real life contexts, and whether they are rooted in a universal human nature or in a plurality of cultures.

== Key concepts ==
The western tradition's key concepts derive from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. These theories include ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' (excellence or virtue), ''[[phronesis]]'' (practical or moral wisdom), and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' (flourishing).

A virtue is generally agreed to be a character trait, such as a habitual action or settled sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-virtue/|title=Virtue Ethics|last=Hursthouse|first=Rosalind|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a virtue is a positive trait that makes its possessor a good human being. A virtue is thus to be distinguished from single actions or feelings. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] says:  &lt;blockquote&gt;A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a “desirable” or “morally valuable” character trait. It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset. (Hence the extreme recklessness of attributing a virtue on the basis of a single action.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Practical wisdom is an acquired trait that enables its possessor to identify the thing to do in any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pincoffs, Edmund (1971). Quandary ethics. _Mind_ 80 (320):552-571.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike theoretical wisdom, practical reason results in action or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/aristotle-ethics/|title=Aristotle's Ethics|last=Kraut|first=Richard|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As John McDowell puts it, practical wisdom involves a "perceptual sensitivity" to what a situation requires.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and Reason". _The Monist_. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eudaimonia]]'' (εὐδαιμονία) is a state variously translated from Greek as 'well-being', 'happiness', 'blessedness', and in the context of virtue ethics, 'human flourishing'.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman, L.P. &amp; Fieser, J. (2009). Virtue Theory. In ''Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong'' (pp. 146-169). (6th ed.)  Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eudaimonia'' in this sense is not a subjective, but an objective, state. It characterizes the well-lived life. According to Aristotle, the most prominent exponent of ''eudaimonia'' in the Western philosophical tradition, "eudaimonia" is the proper goal of human life. It consists of exercising the characteristic human quality—[[reason]]—as the soul's most proper and nourishing activity. In his ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, like Plato before him, argued that the pursuit of ''eudaimonia'' is an "activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|pages=Book I}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further could only properly be exercised in the characteristic human community—the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].

Although ''eudaimonia'' was first popularized by Aristotle, it now belongs to the tradition of virtue theories generally. For the virtue theorist, ''eudaimonia'' describes that state achieved by the person who lives the proper human life, an outcome that can be reached by practicing the virtues.  A virtue is a habit or quality that allows the bearer to succeed at his, her, or its purpose. The virtue of a knife, for example, is sharpness; among the virtues of a racehorse is speed. Thus, to identify the virtues for human beings, one must have an account of what the human purpose is.

==History of virtue==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
Like much of the Western tradition, virtue theory seems to have originated in ancient [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]].

Virtue ethics began with [[Socrates]], and was subsequently developed further by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;P Gardiner - [http://jme.bmj.com/content/29/5/297 A virtue ethics approach to moral dilemmas in medicine] Journal of Medical Ethics / Volume 29, Issue 5 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.29.5.297 Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowin -  [https://people.ucsc.edu/~jbowin/virtue.pdf Aristotle's Virtue Ethics] [[University of California, Santa Cruz |University of Santa Cruz (California)]] Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Chappell (2010) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg Plato: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Virtue+ethics+began+with+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWwdOl6dfXAhVK1xoKHfxgBnYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Virtue%20ethics%20began%20with%20Socrates&amp;f=false p.10] {{ISBN|019980902X}}  Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue ethics refers to a collection of [[normative]] ethical philosophies that place an emphasis on being rather than doing.  Another way to say this is that in virtue ethics, morality stems from the identity or character of the individual, rather than being a reflection of the actions (or consequences thereof) of the individual.  Today, there is debate among various adherents of virtue ethics concerning what specific virtues are morally praiseworthy.  However, most theorists agree that morality comes as a result of intrinsic virtues. Intrinsic virtues are the common link that unites the disparate normative philosophies into the field known as virtue ethics. Plato and Aristotle's treatment of virtues are not the same. Plato believes virtue is effectively an end to be sought, for which a friend might be a useful means. Aristotle states that the virtues function more as means to safeguard human relations, particularly authentic friendship, without which one's quest for happiness is frustrated.

Discussion of what were known as the [[Four Cardinal Virtues]] – [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] – can be found in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. The virtues also figure prominently in Aristotle's moral theory (see below). Virtue theory was inserted into the study of [[history]] by moralistic historians such as [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Tacitus]].  The Greek idea of the virtues was passed on in Roman philosophy through [[Cicero]] and later incorporated into [[Christian]] moral theology by [[St. Ambrose]] of Milan. During the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] period, the most comprehensive consideration of the virtues from a theological perspective was provided by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' and his ''Commentaries on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Though the tradition receded into the background of European philosophical thought in these centuries, the term "virtue" remained current during this period, and in fact appears prominently in the tradition of [[classical republicanism]] or [[classical liberalism]]. This tradition was prominent in the intellectual life of 16th-century [[Italy]], as well as 17th- and 18th-century Britain and America; indeed the term "virtue" appears frequently in the work of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[David Hume]], the republicans of the [[English Civil War]] period, the 18th-century English [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], and the prominent figures among the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Founding Fathers|American Founding Fathers]].

===Contemporary "aretaic turn"&lt;!--"Aretaic turn" redirects here--&gt;===
Although some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers (e.g. [[David Hume|Hume]]) continued to emphasise the virtues, with the ascendancy of [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontology]], virtue theory moved to the margins of Western philosophy. The contemporary revival of virtue theory is frequently traced to the philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Following this:
* In the 1976 paper "[[The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories]]", Michael Stocker summarises the main aretaic criticisms of deontological and consequentialist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stocker | first1 = Michael | year = 1976 | title = The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophy | volume = 73 | issue = 14| pages = 453–466 | doi = 10.2307/2025782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippa Foot]], who published a collection of essays in 1978 entitled ''Virtues and Vices.''
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has made an effort to reconstruct a virtue-based theory in dialogue with the problems of modern and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] thought; his works include ''[[After Virtue]]'' and ''Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry''.
* [[Paul Ricoeur]] has accorded an important place to Aristotelian [[teleological ethics]] in his [[hermeneutical]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the subject, most notably in his book ''Oneself as Another''.
* Theologian [[Stanley Hauerwas]] has also found the language of virtue quite helpful in his own project.
* [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has published ''On Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Michael Slote]] have edited a collection of important essays titled ''Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]] have employed virtue theory in theorising the [[capability approach]] to [[international development]].
* [[Julia Annas]] wrote ''The Morality of Happiness'' (1993).
* [[Lawrence C. Becker]] identified current virtue theory with [[Stoicism]] (or [[Modern Stoicism]]) in ''A New Stoicism.'' (1998).

The '''aretaic turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in moral philosophy is paralleled by analogous developments in other philosophical disciplines. One of these is [[epistemology]], where a distinctive [[virtue epistemology]] has been developed by [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] and others. In political theory, there has been discussion of "virtue politics", and in legal theory, there is a small but growing body of literature on [[virtue jurisprudence]]. The aretaic turn also exists in [[United States of America|American]] [[constitutional theory]], where proponents argue for an emphasis on virtue and vice of constitutional [[adjudicator]]s.

Aretaic approaches to morality, epistemology, and jurisprudence have been the subject of intense debates. One criticism that is frequently made focuses on the problem of guidance; opponents, such as Robert Louden in his article "Some Vices of Virtue Ethics", question whether the idea of a virtuous moral actor, believer, or judge can provide the guidance necessary for action, belief formation, or the decision of legal disputes.

== Lists of virtues ==
There are several different lists of particular virtues. Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge, which suggests that there is really only one virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Meno.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics concurred, claiming the four cardinal virtues were only aspects of true virtue. John McDowell is a recent defender of this conception. He argues that virtue is a "perceptual capacity" to identify how one ought to act, and that all particular virtues are merely "specialized sensitivities" to a range of reasons for acting.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and reason." ''The monist'' 62.3 (1979): 331-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aristotle's list

Aristotle identifies approximately eighteen virtues that enable a person to perform their human function well.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He distinguished virtues pertaining to emotion and desire from those pertaining to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics, Book II.&lt;/ref&gt; The first he calls "moral" virtues, and the second intellectual virtues (though both are "moral" in the modern sense of the word).  Each moral virtue was a mean (see [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]) between two corresponding vices, one of excess and one of deficiency. Each intellectual virtue is a mental skill or habit by which the mind arrives at truth, affirming what is or denying what is not.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'' Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he discusses about 11 moral virtues:

;Moral Virtues

1. '''Courage''' in the face of fear

2. '''Temperance''' in the face of pleasure and pain

3. '''Liberality''' with wealth and possessions

4. '''Magnificence''' with great wealth and possessions

5. '''Magnanimity''' with great honors

6. '''Proper ambition''' with normal honors

7. '''Truthfulness''' with self-expression

8. '''Wittiness''' in conversation

9. '''Friendliness''' in social conduct

10. '''Modesty''' in the face of shame or shamelessness

11. '''Righteous indignation''' in the face of injury

;Intellectual virtues
# [[Nous]] (intelligence), which apprehends fundamental truths (such as definitions, self-evident principles)
# [[Episteme]] (science), which is skill with inferential reasoning (such as proofs, syllogisms, demonstrations)
# Sophia (theoretical wisdom), which combines fundamental truths with valid, necessary inferences to reason well about unchanging truths.
Aristotle also mentions several other traits: 
* Gnome (good sense) -- passing judgment, "sympathetic understanding" 
* Synesis (understanding) -- comprehending what others say, does not issue commands
* [[Phronesis]] (practical wisdom) -- knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands
* Techne (art, craftsmanship)
Aristotle's list is not the only list, however. As [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] observed in ''[[After Virtue]]'',  thinkers as diverse as: [[Homer]]; the authors of the [[New Testament]]; [[Thomas Aquinas]]; and [[Benjamin Franklin]]; have all proposed lists.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', chp 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some philosophers criticise virtue ethics as [[culturally relative]]. Since different people, cultures and societies often have different opinions on what constitutes a virtue, perhaps there is no one objectively right list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

For example, regarding what are the most important virtues, Aristotle proposed the following nine: wisdom; prudence; justice; fortitude; courage; liberality; magnificence; magnanimity; temperance.  In contrast, one modern-era philosopher proposed as the four cardinal virtues:  ambition/humility;  love;  courage;  and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, W.]], 1961. The Faith Of A Heretic. Doubleday &amp; Co., pages 317-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, regarding virtues once supposedly applicable to women, many would have once considered a virtuous woman to be quiet, servile, and industrious. This conception of female virtue no longer holds true in many modern societies. Proponents of virtue theory sometimes respond to this objection by arguing that a central feature of a virtue is its ''universal applicability''. In other words, any character trait defined as a virtue must reasonably be universally regarded as a virtue for all sentient beings. According to this view, it is inconsistent to claim for example servility as a female virtue, while at the same time not proposing it as a male one.

Other proponents of virtue theory, notably [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], respond to this objection by arguing that any account of the virtues must indeed be generated out of the community in which those virtues are to be practiced: the very word ''ethics'' implies "[[ethos]]". That is to say that the virtues are, and necessarily must be, grounded in a particular time and place. What counts as virtue in 4th-century Athens would be a ludicrous guide to proper behavior in 21st-century Toronto, and vice versa. To take this view does not necessarily commit one to the argument that accounts of the virtues must therefore be static: moral activity—that is, attempts to contemplate and practice the virtues—can provide the cultural resources that allow people to change, albeit slowly, the ethos of their own societies. [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] appears to take this position in his seminal work on virtue ethics, ''[[After Virtue]]''. One might cite (though [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] does not) the rapid emergence of [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] thought in the [[slave]]-holding societies of the 18th-century [[Atlantic world]] as an example of this sort of change: over a relatively short period of time, perhaps 1760 to 1800, in Britain, France, and British America, slave-holding, previously thought to be morally neutral or even virtuous, rapidly became seen as vicious among wide swathes of society. While the emergence of abolitionist thought derived from many sources, the work of [[David Brion Davis]], among others,{{who|date=January 2011}} has established that one source was the rapid, internal evolution of moral theory among certain sectors of these societies, notably the [[Quakers]].

Another objection to virtue theory is that the school does not focus on what ''sorts of actions'' are morally permitted and which ones are not, but rather on what sort of qualities someone ought to foster in order to become a good person. In other words, while some virtue theorists may not condemn, for example, murder as an inherently immoral or impermissible sort of action, they may argue that someone who commits a murder is severely lacking in several important virtues, such as [[compassion]] and [[wikt:fairness|fairness]]. Still, antagonists of the theory often object that this particular feature of the theory makes virtue ethics useless as a universal norm of acceptable conduct suitable as a base for [[legislation]]. Some virtue theorists concede this point, but respond by opposing the very notion of legitimate legislative [[authority]] instead, effectively advocating some form of [[anarchism]] as the political ideal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Others argue that laws should be made by virtuous legislators. Still others argue that it is possible to base a judicial system on the moral notion of virtues rather than rules.

Some virtue theorists might respond to this overall objection with the notion of a "bad act" also being an act characteristic of [[vice]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} That is to say that those acts that do not aim at virtue, or stray from virtue, would constitute our conception of "bad behavior". Although not all virtue ethicists agree to this notion, this is one way the virtue ethicist can re-introduce the concept of the "morally impermissible".  One could raise objection with Foot that she is committing an [[argument from ignorance]] by postulating that what is not virtuous is unvirtuous.  In other words, just because an action or person 'lacks of evidence' for virtue does not, [[ceteris paribus|all else constant]], imply that said action or person is unvirtuous.

=== Subsumed in deontology and utilitarianism ===

[[Martha Nussbaum]] has suggested that while virtue ethics is often considered to be anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], "suspicious of theory and respectful of the wisdom embodied in local practices",&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt; it is actually neither fundamentally distinct from, nor does it qualify as a rival approach to deontology and utilitarianism. She argues that philosophers from these two Enlightenment traditions often include theories of virtue. She pointed out that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] "Doctrine of Virtue" (in ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'') "covers most of the same topics as do classical Greek theories", "that he offers a general account of virtue, in terms of the strength of the will in overcoming wayward and selfish inclinations; that he offers detailed analyses of standard virtues such as courage and self-control, and of vices, such as avarice, mendacity, servility, and pride; that, although in general he portrays inclination as inimical to virtue, he also recognizes that sympathetic inclinations offer crucial support to virtue, and urges their deliberate cultivation."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|title=Virtue Ethics: A Misleading Category?|journal=The Journal of Ethics|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=163–201|jstor=25115613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points to considerations of virtue by utilitarians such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] (''[[The Methods of Ethics]]''), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]''), and [[John Stuart Mill]], who writes of moral development as part of an argument for the moral equality of women (''[[The Subjection of Women]]''). She argues that contemporary virtue ethicists such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Philippa Foot]], and [[John McDowell]] have few points of agreement, and that the common core of their work does not represent a break from Kant.

=== Utopianism and pluralism ===

[[Robert Louden]] criticises virtue ethics on the basis that it promotes a form of unsustainable [[utopianism]]. Trying to come to ''a'' single set of virtues is immensely difficult in contemporary societies as, according to Louden, they contain "more ethnic, religious, and class groups than did the moral community which Aristotle theorized about" with each of these groups having "not only its own interests but its own set of virtues as well". Louden notes in passing that MacIntyre, a supporter of virtue-based ethics, has grappled with this in ''[[After Virtue]]'' but that ethics cannot dispense with building rules around acts and rely only on discussing the moral character of persons.&lt;ref name="Louden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Louden|first=Robert B.|title=On Some Vices of Virtue Ethics|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=July 1984|volume=21|issue=3|pages=227–236|jstor=20014051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics in virtue ethics ==

=== Virtue ethics as a category ===
Virtue ethics can be contrasted to [[deontological]] ethics and [[consequentialist]] ethics by an examination of the other two (the three being together the most predominant contemporary normative ethical theories).

[[Deontological ethics]], sometimes referred to as duty ethics, places the emphasis on adhering to ethical principles or duties.  How these duties are defined, however, is often a point of contention and debate in deontological ethics.  One of the predominant rule schemes utilized by deontologists is the [[Divine Command Theory]]. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical [[Philosophical realism|realism]], in that it postulates the existence of [[moral absolute]]s that make an action moral, regardless of circumstances.  For more information on deontological ethics refer to the work of [[Immanuel Kant]].

The next predominant school of thought in normative ethics is [[consequentialism]].  While deontology places the emphasis on doing one's duty, which is established by some kind of moral imperative (in other words, the emphasis is on obedience to some higher moral absolute), consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome.  Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it causes undesirable effects.  The main contention here is what outcomes should/can be identified as objectively desirable.  The [[Greatest Happiness Principle]] of [[John Stuart Mill]] is one of the most commonly adopted criteria.  Mill asserts that our determinant of the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings it to, and the duration of the happiness.  He also tries to delineate classes of happiness, some being preferable to others, but there is a great deal of difficulty in classifying such concepts.  
{{see|Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism (book)|On Liberty}}
Virtue ethics differs from both deontology consequentialism as it focuses on being over doing. A virtue ethicist identifies [[virtues]], desirable characteristics, that the moral or virtuous person embodies.  Possessing these virtues is what makes one moral, and one's actions are a mere reflection of one's inner morality.  To the virtue philosopher, action cannot be used as a demarcation of morality, because a virtue encompasses more than just a simple selection of action.  Instead, it is about a way of being that would cause the person exhibiting the virtue to make a certain "virtuous" choice consistently in each situation.  There is a great deal of disagreement within virtue ethics over what are virtues and what are not.  There are also difficulties in identifying what is the "virtuous" action to take in all circumstances, and how to define a virtue.

Consequentialist and deontological theories often still employ the term 'virtue', but in a restricted sense, namely as a tendency or disposition to adhere to the system's principles or rules.  These very different senses of what constitutes virtue, hidden behind the same word, are a potential source of confusion.  This disagreement over the meaning of virtue points to a larger conflict between virtue theory and its philosophical rivals.  A system of virtue theory is only intelligible if it is [[teleological]]: that is, if it includes an account of the purpose (''telos'') of human life, or in popular language, the [[meaning of life]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Obviously, strong claims about the purpose of human life, or of what the good life for human beings is, will be highly controversial.  Virtue theory's necessary commitment to a teleological account of human life thus puts the tradition in sharp tension with other dominant approaches to normative ethics, which, because they focus on actions, do not bear this burden.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Virtue ethics mainly deals with the honesty and morality of a person. It states that practicing good habits such as honesty, generosity makes a moral and virtuous person. It guides a person without specific rules for resolving the ethical complexity.

=== Virtue and politics ===
Virtue theory emphasises [[Aristotle]]'s belief in the [[polis]] as the acme of political organisation, and the role of the virtues in enabling human beings to flourish in that environment. Classical republicanism in contrast emphasises [[Tacitus]]' concern that power and luxury can corrupt individuals and destroy liberty, as Tacitus perceived in the transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]]; virtue for classical republicans is a shield against this sort of corruption and a means to preserve the good life one has, rather than a means by which to achieve the good life one does not yet have. Another way to put the distinction between the two traditions is that virtue ethics relies on Aristotle's fundamental distinction between the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-should-be, while classical republicanism relies on the Tacitean distinction of the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-is-at-risk-of-becoming.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied virtue ethics ===
Virtue ethics has a number of contemporary applications.

;Social and political philosophy
Within the field of social ethics, [[Deirdre McCloskey]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a basis for a balanced approach to understanding capitalism and capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, D. ''The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce.'' (2007) Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-55664-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Education
Within the field of [[philosophy of education]], [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a rationale and foundation for [[peace education]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) '' Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations. '' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Health care and medical ethics

[[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued that whistleblowing in the healthcare setting would be more respected within clinical governance pathways if it had a firmer academic foundation in virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing Monash Bioethics Review 2004; 23(4): 41-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Jefferys S. Whistleblowing and Scientific Misconduct: Renewing Legal and Virtue Ethics Foundations Journal of Medicine and Law 2007, 26 (3): 567-84&lt;/ref&gt; He called for whistleblowing to be expressly supported in the [[UNESCO]] Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Nasu H. Normative Foundations of Technology Transfer and Transnational Benefit Principles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human RightsJournal of Medicine and Philosophy, 0 : 1 – 26, 2009 {{doi|10.1093/jmp/jhp021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Schwartz argues that "practical wisdom" is an antidote to much of the inefficient and inhumane bureaucracy of modern health care systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_our_loss_of_wisdom?language=en|title=Our loss of wisdom|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|website=www.ted.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Technology and the virtues

In her book ''Technology and the Virtues'',&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shannon Vallor]] proposed a series of 'technomoral' virtues that people need to cultivate in order to flourish in our socio-technological world: Honesty (Respecting Truth), Self-control (Becoming the Author of Our Desires), Humility (Knowing What We Do Not Know), Justice (Upholding Rightness), Courage (Intelligent Fear and Hope), Empathy (Compassionate Concern for Others), Care (Loving Service to Others), Civility (Making Common Cause), Flexibility (Skillful Adaptation to Change), Perspective (Holding on to the Moral Whole), and Magnanimity (Moral Leadership and Nobility of Spirit).
