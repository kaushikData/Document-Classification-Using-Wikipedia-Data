The '''21 grams experiment''' refers to a scientific study published in 1907 by Duncan MacDougall, a physician from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. MacDougall hypothesized that [[soul]]s have physical weight, and attempted to measure the mass lost by a human when the soul departed the body. MacDougall attempted to measure the mass change of six patients at the moment of death. One of the six subjects lost three-fourths of an ounce (21.3 grams).

MacDougall stated his experiment would have to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment is widely regarded as flawed and unscientific due to the small [[Sample size determination|sample size]], the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; The case has been cited as an example of [[Reporting bias|selective reporting]]. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.

==Experiment==
[[File:Duncan MacDougall physician.png|thumb|Duncan MacDougall, pictured in 1911]]

In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a physician from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]], who wished to scientifically determine if a [[soul]] had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients looked like they were close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams).&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book |last=Kruszelnicki |first=Karl |year=2006 |title=Great Mythconceptions: The Science Behind the Myths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIfEO4nvvLUC |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780740753640 |author-link=Karl Kruszelnicki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= wiseman/&gt;&lt;ref name=mary&gt;{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |author-link=Mary Roach |date=September 6, 2012 |title=[[Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers]] |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0241965016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

===Results===
One of the patients lost weight but then put the weight back on, and two of the other patients registered a loss of weight at death but a few minutes later lost even more weight. One of the patients lost "three-fourths of an ounce" (21.3 grams) in weight, coinciding with the time of death. MacDougall disregarded the results of another patient on the grounds the scales were "not finely adjusted", and discounted the results of another as the patient died while the equipment was still being calibrated. MacDougall reported that none of the dogs lost any weight after death.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

While MacDougall believed that the results from his experiment showed the human soul might have weight, his report, which was not published until 1907, stated the experiment would have to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Image:Nytimage001.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[The New York Times]]'' article from March 11, 1907]]
Before MacDougall was able to publish the results of his experiments, ''[[The New York Times]]'' broke the story in an article titled "Soul has Weight, Physician Thinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 11, 1907 |title=Soul has Weight, Physician Thinks |url=https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D07E5DC123EE033A25752C1A9659C946697D6CF |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacDougall's results were published in April of the same year in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDougall |first=Duncan |date=1907 |title=Hypothesis Concerning Soul Substance Together With Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Such a Substance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQAKAwAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=237|isbn=9785874496289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medical journal ''[[American Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDougall |first1=Duncan |date=April 1907 |title=The Soul: Hypothesis Concerning Soul Substance Together with Experimental Evidence of the Existence of Such Substance |url= |journal=American Medicine |volume=2 |pages=240–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Following the publication of the experiment in ''American Medicine'', physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted that at the time of death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death.&lt;ref name=wiseman&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiseman |first=Richard |date=1 April 2011 |title=Paranormality: Why We see What Isn't There |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO67ZcZ3wUUC |publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1743038383 |author-link=Richard Wiseman |pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mary/&gt; Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of ''American Medicine''. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;

MacDougall's experiment has been the subject of considerable skepticism, and he has been accused of both flawed methods and outright fraud in obtaining his results.&lt;ref name=hood/&gt; Noting that only one of the six patients measured supported the hypothesis, [[Karl Kruszelnicki]] has stated the experiment is a case of [[Reporting bias|selective reporting]], as MacDougall ignored the majority of the results. Kruszelnicki also criticized the small [[Sample size determination|sample size]], and questioned how MacDougall was able to determine the exact moment when a person had died considering the technology available at the time.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; Physicist [[Robert L. Park]] has written that MacDougall's experiments "are not regarded today as having any scientific merit",&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{cite book |last=Park |first=Rober L. |date=22 September 2008 |title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1XocNrUN_K4C |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1400828777 |author-link=Robert L. Park |pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologist [[Bruce Hood (psychologist)|Bruce Hood]] wrote that "because the weight loss was not reliable or replicable, his findings were unscientific".&lt;ref name=hood&gt;{{cite book |last=Hood |first=Bruce |date=1 June 2009 |title=Supersense: From Superstition to Religion – The Brain Science of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDafBAAAQBAJ |publisher=Hachette|isbn=978-1849012461 |author-link=Bruce Hood (psychologist) |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Richard Wiseman]] said that within the scientific community, the experiment is confined to a "large pile of scientific curiosities labelled 'almost certainly not true'".&lt;ref name=wiseman/&gt;

An article by [[Snopes]] in 2013 said the experiment was flawed because the methods used were suspect, the sample size was much too small, and the capability to measure weight changes too imprecise, concluding: "credence should not be given to the idea his experiments proved something, let alone that they measured the weight of the soul as 21 grams."&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; The fact that MacDougall likely poisoned and killed fifteen healthy dogs in an attempt to support his research has also been a source of criticism.&lt;ref name=mary/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1911 ''The New York Times'' reported that MacDougall was hoping to run experiments to take photos of souls, but he appears to not have continued any further research into the area and died in 1920.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; His experiment has not been repeated.&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the idea that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt; Most notably, '21 Grams' was taken as the title of a [[21 Grams|film in 2003]], which references the experiment.&lt;ref name=wiseman/&gt;&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=park/&gt;

The concept of a soul weighing 21 grams is mentioned in numerous media, including a 2013 issue of the manga ''[[Gantz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| cartoonist = [[Hiroya Oku]]| story = Gantz| title = Where the Missing Mass Goes| issue = 372| date = March 19, 2013| publisher = | location = | page = 12| panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2013 podcast of  ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://podbay.fm/show/536258179/e/1451624400?autostart=1 |title=Faceless Old Woman |series=[[Welcome to Night Vale]] |issue=26 |date=July 1, 2013 |quote=Proverb 1: The human soul weighs 21 grams, smells like grilled vegetables, looks like a wrinkled tartan quilt, and sounds like bridge traffic. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 film ''[[The Empire of Corpses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://otakunoculture.com/2016/02/16/a-historical-analysis-review-into-the-empire-of-corpses/ |title=A Historical Analysis &amp; Review into The Empire of Corpses |last=Sum |first=Ed |date=February 16, 2016 |work=Otaku no Culture |access-date=July 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170716081848/https://otakunoculture.com/2016/02/16/a-historical-analysis-review-into-the-empire-of-corpses/ |archivedate=July 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 song "21 Grams" by [[Niykee Heaton]] features the line "I just want your soul in my hands, feel your weight of 21 grams";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idolator.com/7603817/niykee-heaton-nude-indiana-jones-21-grams-full-song |title=Niykee Heaton Gets Serious With Dark, Sprawling "21 Grams": Listen |last=Wass |first=Mike |date=August 10, 2015 |work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] |access-date=July 16, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170716081250/http://www.idolator.com/7603817/niykee-heaton-nude-indiana-jones-21-grams-full-song |archivedate=July 16, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a song of the same name was released in 2017 by the [[Thundamentals]], and [[Travis Scott]] references the concept in the song "No Bystanders", released in 2018. MacDougall and his experiments are explicitly mentioned in the 1978 documentary film ''[[Beyond and Back]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=1978 |title=Beyond and Back |medium=Documentary film}}&lt;/ref&gt; and episode five of the first season of ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=September 28, 2011 |title=21 Grams, Missing Cosmonauts, Sound of Death  |medium=TV episode |series=Dark Matters: Twisted But True }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional American scientist named "Mr. MacDougall" appears in [[Gail Carriger]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Soulless (novel)|Soulless]]'', as an expert in the weight and measurement of souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carriger |first=Gail |date=September 2, 2010 |title=Soulless: Book 1 of The Parasol Protectorate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJrUf4KXArsC |publisher=Hachette |isbn=978-0748121489 |author-link=Gail Carriger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological network inference''' is the process of making [[inference]]s and predictions about [[biological network]]s.

==Biological networks==
A network is a set of nodes and a set of directed or undirected edges between the nodes. Many types of biological networks exist, including transcriptional, signalling and metabolic. Few such networks are known in anything approaching their complete structure, even in the simplest [[bacteria]]. Still less is known on the parameters governing the behavior of such networks over time, how the networks at different levels in a cell interact, and how to predict the complete state description of a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell or bacterial organism at a given point in the future. [[Systems biology]], in this sense, is still in its infancy.

There is great interest in [[network medicine]] for the [[modelling biological systems]]. This article focuses on a necessary prerequisite to dynamic modeling of a network: inference of the [[topology]], that is, prediction of the "wiring diagram" of the network. More specifically, we focus here on inference of biological network structure using the growing sets of high-throughput expression data for [[gene]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[metabolism|metabolites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tieri P, Farina L, Petti M, Astolfi L, Paci P, Castiglione F | title = Network Inference and Reconstruction in Bioinformatics | journal = Encyclopedia of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 805-813 | date = 2018 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-809633-8.20290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Briefly, methods using high-throughput data for inference of regulatory networks rely on searching for patterns of partial correlation or conditional probabilities that indicate causal influence.&lt;ref name="Marbach2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marbach D, Costello JC, Küffner R, Vega NM, Prill RJ, Camacho DM, Allison KR, Kellis M, Collins JJ, Stolovitzky G | title = Wisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 796–804 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22796662 | pmc = 3512113 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | vauthors = Sprites P, Glamour C, Scheines R | year = 2000 | title = Causation, Prediction, and Search: Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns of partial correlations found in the high-throughput data, possibly combined with other supplemental data on the genes or proteins in the proposed networks, or combined with other information on the organism, form the basis upon which such [[algorithm]]s work. Such algorithms can be of use in inferring the topology of any network where the change in state of one [[Node (networking)|node]] can affect the state of other nodes.

===Transcriptional regulatory networks===
Genes are the nodes and the edges are directed. A gene serves as the source of a direct regulatory edge to a target gene by producing an [[RNA]] or protein molecule that functions as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor of the target gene. If the gene is an activator, then it is the source of a positive regulatory connection; if an inhibitor, then it is the source of a negative regulatory connection. Computational algorithms take as primary input data measurements of [[mRNA]] expression levels of the genes under consideration for inclusion in the network, returning an estimate of the network [[topology]]. Such algorithms are typically based on linearity, independence or normality assumptions, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oates CJ, Mukherjee S | title = Network Inference and Biological Dynamics | journal = The Annals of Applied Statistics | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 1209–1235 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23284600 | doi = 10.1214/11-AOAS532 | last-author-amp = yes | arxiv = 1112.1047 | pmc=3533376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clustering or some form of statistical classification is typically employed to perform an initial organization of the high-throughput mRNA expression values derived from microarray experiments, in particular to select sets of genes as candidates for network nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guthke R, Möller U, Hoffmann M, Thies F, Töpfer S | title = Dynamic network reconstruction from gene expression data applied to immune response during bacterial infection | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 1626–34 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15613398 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question then arises: how can the clustering or classification results be connected to the underlying biology? Such results can be useful for pattern classification – for example, to classify subtypes of [[cancer]], or to predict differential responses to a [[drug]] (pharmacogenomics). But to understand the relationships between the genes, that is, to more precisely define the influence of each gene on the others, the scientist typically attempts to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network. This can be done by data integration in dynamic models supported by background literature, or information in public [[database]]s, combined with the clustering results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hecker M, Lambeck S, Toepfer S, van Someren E, Guthke R | title = Gene regulatory network inference: data integration in dynamic models-a review | journal = Bio Systems | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–103 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19150482 | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modelling can be done by a [[Boolean network]], by [[Ordinary differential equation]]s or [[Linear regression]] models, e.g. [[Least-angle regression]], by [[Bayesian network]] or based on [[Information theory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Someren EP, Wessels LF, Backer E, Reinders MJ | title = Genetic network modeling | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 507–25 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12164774 | doi = 10.1517/14622416.3.4.507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance it can be done by the application of a correlation-based inference algorithm, as will be discussed below, an approach which is having increased success as the size of the available microarray sets keeps increasing &lt;ref name="Marbach2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faith JJ, Hayete B, Thaden JT, Mogno I, Wierzbowski J, Cottarel G, Kasif S, Collins JJ, Gardner TS | title = Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e8 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17214507 | pmc = 1764438 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayete B, Gardner TS, Collins JJ | title = Size matters: network inference tackles the genome scale | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 77 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17299414 | pmc = 1828748 | doi = 10.1038/msb4100118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal transduction===
[[Signal transduction]] networks (very important in the biology of cancer). Proteins are the nodes and directed edges represent interaction in which the biochemical conformation of the child is modified by the action of the parent (e.g. mediated by [[phosphorylation]], ubiquitylation, methylation, etc.). Primary input into the inference algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring protein activation / inactivation (e.g., phosphorylation / dephosphorylation) across a set of proteins. Inference for such signalling networks is complicated by the fact that total concentrations of signalling proteins will fluctuate over time due to transcriptional and translational regulation. Such variation can lead to statistical [[confounding]]. Accordingly, more sophisticated statistical techniques must be applied to analyse such datasets.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Oates CJ, Mukherjee S | year = 2012 | title = Structural inference using nonlinear dynamics | journal = CRiSM Working Paper | volume = 12 | issue = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolic===
[[Metabolite]] networks. Metabolites are the nodes and the edges are directed. Primary input into an algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring metabolite levels.

===Protein-protein interaction===
Protein-protein interaction networks are also under very active study. However, reconstruction of these networks does not use correlation-based inference in the sense discussed for the networks already described (interaction does not necessarily imply a change in protein state), and a description of such interaction network reconstruction is left to other articles.

'''Classical test theory (CTT)''' is a body of related [[psychometric]] theory that predicts outcomes of psychological [[Test (assessment)|test]]ing such as the difficulty of items or the ability of test-takers. It is a theory of testing based on the idea that a person’s observed or obtained score on a test is the sum of a true score (error-free score) and an error score.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorC&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the aim of classical test theory is to understand and improve the [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] of psychological tests.

''Classical test theory'' may be regarded as roughly synonymous with ''true score theory''.  The term "classical" refers not only to the chronology of these models but also contrasts with the more recent psychometric theories, generally referred to collectively as [[item response theory]], which sometimes bear the appellation "modern" as in "modern latent trait theory".

Classical test theory as we know it today was codified by Novick (1966) and described in classic texts such as Lord &amp; Novick (1968) and Allen &amp; Yen (1979/2002).  The description of classical test theory below follows these seminal publications.

==History==
Classical test theory was born only after the following three achievements or ideas were conceptualized: one, a recognition of the presence of errors in measurements, two, a conception of that error as a random variable, and third, a conception of correlation and how to index it. In 1904, [[Charles Spearman]] was responsible for figuring out how to correct a correlation coefficient for attenuation due to measurement error and how to obtain the index of reliability needed in making the correction.&lt;ref&gt;Traub, R. (1997). Classical Test Theory in Historical Perspective. ''[[Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice]]'' 16 (4), 8–14. doi:doi:10.1111/j.1745-3992.1997.tb00603.x&lt;/ref&gt; Spearman's finding is thought to be the beginning of Classical Test Theory by some (Traub, 1997). Others who had an influence in the Classical Test Theory's framework include: [[George Udny Yule]], [[Truman Lee Kelley]], those involved in making the [[Kuder–Richardson Formula 20|Kuder–Richardson Formulas]], [[Louis Guttman]], and, most recently, [[Melvin Novick]], not to mention others over the next quarter century after Spearman's initial findings.

==Definitions==
Classical test theory assumes that each person has a ''true score'',''T'', that would be obtained if there were no errors in measurement. A person's true score is defined as the expected number-correct score over an infinite number of independent administrations of the test.  Unfortunately, test users never observe a person's true score, only an ''observed score'', ''X''.  It is assumed that ''observed score'' = ''true score'' plus some ''error'':
    
                 X         =       T      +    E
           observed score     true score     error

Classical test theory is concerned with the relations between the three variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; in the population. These relations are used to say something about the quality of test scores. In this regard, the most important concept is that of ''reliability''. The reliability of the observed test scores &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which is denoted as &lt;math&gt;{\rho^2_{XT}}&lt;/math&gt;,  is defined as the ratio of true score variance &lt;math&gt;{\sigma^2_T}&lt;/math&gt; to the observed score variance &lt;math&gt;{\sigma^2_X}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\rho^2_{XT} = \frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_X}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the variance of the observed scores can be shown to equal the sum of the variance of true scores and the variance of error scores, this is equivalent to

: &lt;math&gt;\rho^2_{XT} = \frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_X} = \frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_T+\sigma^2_E}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation, which formulates a signal-to-noise ratio, has intuitive appeal: The reliability of test scores becomes higher as the proportion of error variance in the test scores becomes lower and vice versa. The reliability is equal to the proportion of the variance in the test scores that we could explain if we knew the true scores. The square root of the reliability is the correlation between true and observed scores.

==Evaluating tests and scores: Reliability==
{{main article|Reliability (psychometrics)}}

Reliability cannot be estimated directly since that would require one to know the true scores, which according to classical test theory is impossible. However, estimates of reliability can be obtained by various means. One way of estimating reliability is by constructing a so-called ''[[parallel test]]''. The fundamental property of a parallel test is that it yields the same true score and the same observed score variance as the original test for every individual. If we have parallel tests x and x', then this means that

: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(X_i)=\varepsilon(X'_i)&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_{E_i} = \sigma^2_{E'_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Under these assumptions, it follows that the correlation between parallel test scores is equal to reliability (see Lord &amp; Novick, 1968, Ch. 2, for a proof).

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho_{XX'}= \frac{\sigma_{XX'}}{\sigma_X \sigma_{X'}}=
\frac{ \sigma_T^2 }{ \sigma_X^2 }= \rho_{XT}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Using parallel tests to estimate reliability is cumbersome because parallel tests are very hard to come by. In practice the method is rarely used. Instead, researchers use a measure of internal consistency known as [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;]]. Consider a test consisting of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; items &lt;math&gt;u_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,k&lt;/math&gt;. The total test score is defined as the sum of the individual item scores, so that for individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;X_i=\sum_{j=1}^k U_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

Then  [[Cronbach's alpha]] equals

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha =\frac k {k-1}\left(1-\frac{\sum_{j=1}^k \sigma^2_{U_j}}{\sigma^2_X}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Cronbach's &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to provide a lower bound for reliability under rather mild assumptions. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Thus, the reliability of test scores in a population is always higher than the value of Cronbach's &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; in that population. Thus, this method is empirically feasible and, as a result, it is very popular among researchers. Calculation of Cronbach's &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is included in many standard statistical packages such as [[SPSS]] and [[SAS System|SAS]].&lt;ref name="Lei2007"&gt;{{cite journal| title=CTTITEM: SAS macro and SPSS syntax for classical item analysis| author=Pui-Wa Lei and Qiong Wu| journal=Behavior Research Methods| volume=39| issue=3| year=2007| pages=527–530| url=http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/39/3/527.full.pdf| pmid=17958163| doi=10.3758/BF03193021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As has been noted above, the entire exercise of classical test theory is done to arrive at a suitable definition of reliability. Reliability is supposed to say something about the general quality of the test scores in question. The general idea is that, the higher reliability is, the better. Classical test theory does not say how high reliability is supposed to be. Too high a value for &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, say over .9, indicates redundancy of items. Around .8 is recommended for personality research, while .9+ is desirable for individual high-stakes testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1207/S15327752JPA8001_18 | last1 = Streiner | first1 = D. L. | year = 2003 | title = Starting at the Beginning: An      Introduction to Coefficient Alpha and Internal Consistency | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 99–103 | pmid = 12584072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These 'criteria' are not based on formal arguments, but rather are the result of convention and professional practice.  The extent to which they can be mapped to formal principles of statistical inference is unclear.

==Evaluating items: P and item-total correlations==
Reliability provides a convenient index of test quality in a single number, reliability.  However, it does not provide any information for evaluating single items.  [[Item analysis]] within the classical approach often relies on two statistics: the P-value (proportion) and the [[item-total correlation]] ([[point-biserial correlation coefficient]]).  The P-value represents the proportion of examinees responding in the keyed direction, and is typically referred to as ''item difficulty''.  The item-total correlation provides an index of the discrimination or differentiating power of the item, and is typically referred to as ''item discrimination''.  In addition, these statistics are calculated for each response of the oft-used [[multiple choice]] item, which are used to evaluate items and diagnose possible issues, such as a confusing distractor.  Such valuable analysis is provided by specially-designed [[psychometric software]].

==Alternatives==
Classical test theory is an influential theory of test scores in the social sciences. In [[psychometrics]], the theory has been superseded by the more sophisticated models in [[item response theory]] (IRT) and [[generalizability theory]] (G-theory). However, IRT is not included in standard statistical packages like [[SPSS]], but [[SAS System|SAS]] can estimate IRT models via PROC IRT and PROC MCMC and there are [https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Psychometrics.html IRT packages] for the open source statistical programming language [[R (programming language)|R]] (e.g., CTT). While commercial packages routinely provide estimates of Cronbach's &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, specialized [[psychometric software]] may be preferred for IRT or G-theory.  However, general statistical packages often do not provide a complete classical analysis (Cronbach's &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is only one of many important statistics), and in many cases, specialized software for classical analysis is also necessary.

==Shortcomings==
One of the most important or well-known shortcomings of classical test theory is that examinee characteristics and test characteristics cannot be separated: each can only be interpreted in the context of the other. Another shortcoming lies in the definition of reliability that exists in classical test theory, which states that reliability is "the correlation between test scores on parallel forms of a test".&lt;ref name="Hambleton, R. 1991"&gt;Hambleton, R., Swaminathan, H., Rogers, H. (1991). ''Fundamentals of Item Response Theory''. Newbury Park, California: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this is that there are differing opinions of what parallel tests are. Various reliability coefficients provide either lower bound estimates of reliability or reliability estimates with unknown biases. A third shortcoming involves the standard error of measurement. The problem here is that, according to classical test theory, the standard error of measurement is assumed to be the same for all examinees. However, as Hambleton explains in his book, scores on any test are unequally precise measures for examinees of different ability, thus making the assumption of equal errors of measurement for all examinees implausible (Hambleton, Swaminathan, Rogers, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;4). A fourth, and final shortcoming of the classical test theory is that it is test oriented, rather than item oriented. In other words, classical test theory cannot help us make predictions of how well an individual or even a group of examinees might do on a test item.&lt;ref name="Hambleton, R. 1991"/&gt;

A '''corrody''' was a lifetime allowance of food and clothing, and often shelter and care, granted by an [[abbey]], [[monastery]], or other religious house. While rarely granted in the modern era, corrodies were common in the [[Middle Ages]]. They were routinely awarded to the servants and staff of [[Royal family|royalty]], but could also be purchased with donations of money or land. The corrody is one of the earliest forms of [[insurance]], as it provided security in sustenance and lodging in a time when [[social welfare]] was scarce. 

The prices paid for corrodies are unknown. Academic estimates of the annual value of the food allowance (alone), are around £3 per year. This assumes an allowance of one loaf of bread and a gallon of ale, but excludes the cost of accommodation and living expenses. When multiplied by the [[life expectancy]] of the era (bearing in mind that corrodies would be granted to the old and infirm) it can be assumed that a lifelong corrody for an average person would cost approximately £100.{{fact|date=April 2014}}

A '''cortex''' is the outermost layer of a stem or root in a plant.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In [[botany]], the cortex is the outermost layer of the [[plant stem|stem]] or [[root]] of a plant, bounded on the outside by the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] and on the inside by the [[endodermis]]. In plants, it is composed mostly of [[differentiated cell]]s, usually large thin-walled [[parenchyma]] cells of the [[ground tissue]] system. The outer cortical cells often acquire irregularly thickened cell walls, and are called collenchyma cells. Some of the outer cortical cells may contain [[chloroplast]]s. It is responsible for the transportation of materials into the central cylinder of the root through diffusion and may also be used for food storage in the form of starch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Botany Illustrated: Introduction to Plants, Major Groups, Flowering Plant Families |authors= Janice Glimn-Lacy, Peter B.

[[File:Geoffroea_decorticans0.jpg|thumb|''[[Geoffroea decorticans]]'' is both cold and drought deciduous: it loses its leaves in winter as well as during particularly dry summers]]
'''Drought deciduous''' plants are those that [[Abscission|drop their leaves]] during the [[dry season]] or periods of [[drought]].  Examples include plants of the California [[coastal sage scrub]] community, and the leeward Hawaiian dry forest tree, the [[wiliwili]] (''Erythrina sandwicensis'').

'''FidoNet''' is a worldwide [[computer network]] that is used for communication between [[bulletin board system]]s (BBSes). It uses a [[store-and-forward]] system to exchange private (email) and public (forum) messages between the BBSes in the network, as well as other files and protocols in some cases.

The FidoNet system was based on a number of small interacting programs. Only one of these interacted with the BBS system directly and was the only portion that had to be [[Porting|ported]] to support other BBS software. This greatly eased porting, and FidoNet was one of the few networks that was widely supported by almost all BBS software, as well as a number of non-BBS [[online service]]s. This modular construction also allowed FidoNet to easily upgrade to new [[data compression]] systems, which was important in an era using [[modem]]-based communications over telephone links with high [[long-distance calling]] charges.

The rapid improvement in modem speeds during the early 1990s, combined with the rapid decrease in price of computer systems and storage, made BBSes increasingly popular. By the mid-1990s there were almost 40,000 FidoNet systems in operation, and it was possible to communicate with millions of users around the world. Only [[UUCP#UUCPNET|UUCPNET]] came close in terms of breadth or numbers; FidoNet's user base far surpassed other networks like [[BITNET]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The broad availability of low-cost [[Internet]] connections starting in the mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system in the world could be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined. Although FidoNet had shrunk considerably since the late 1990s, it has remained in use even today{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} despite internet connectivity becoming universally available.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Pre-nodelist "fido list" June 1984.jpg|thumb|Hand-compiled list of Fido BBS systems, June 1984. This document formed the basis of the first nodelists.]]
There are two major accounts of the development of the FidoNet, differing only in small details.

====Tom Jennings' account====
Around Christmas 1983, [[Tom Jennings]] started work on a new [[MS-DOS]]–hosted bulletin board system that would emerge as Fido BBS. Jennings set up the system in [[San Francisco]] some time in early 1984. Another early user was John Madil, who was trying to set up a similar system in [[Baltimore]] on his [[Rainbow 100]]. Fido started spreading to new systems, and Jennings eventually started keeping an informal list of their phone numbers, with Jennings becoming #1 and Madil #2.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;Ben Baker, [http://www.fidonet.ca/baker.htm "Fidonet History"], 2 May 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennings released the first version of the FidoNet software in June 1984. In early 1985 he wrote a document explaining the operations of the FidoNet, along with a short portion on the history of the system. In this version, FidoNet was developed as a way to exchange mail between the first two Fido BBS systems, Jennings' and Madil's, to "see if it could be done, merely for the fun of it". This was first supported in Fido V7, "sometime in June 84 or so".&lt;ref name=tom&gt;Tom Jennings, [http://www.worldpowersystems.com/FidoNet/fidohist1.txt "FidoNet History and Operation"], February 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbsdoc"&gt;Jason Scott Sadofsky, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402/ BBS: The Documentary]", FIDONET Episode, 21 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="byte198410"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-10/1984_10_BYTE_09-11_Databases#page/n353/mode/2up | title=FidoNet, Sidekick, Apple, Get Organized!, and Handle | work=BYTE | date=October 1984 | accessdate=23 October 2013 |author1=Markoff, John |author2=Shapiro, Ezra | page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ben Baker's account====
In early 1984, Ben Baker was planning on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the [[McDonnell Douglas]] automotive division in [[St. Louis]]. Baker was part of the [[CP/M]] [[special interest group]] within the club.&lt;ref&gt;Baker provides details of the club and the SIG at about the 8- to 10-minute mark during BBS interviews by Jason Scott Sadofsky, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 "BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)"]&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, [[CBBS]] system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] would be giving them a [[Rainbow 100]] computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two [[Central processing unit|processors]], an [[Intel 8088]] and a [[Zilog Z80]], allowing it to run both [[MS-DOS]] and [[CP/M]], with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the [[I/O port]]s, so CBBS could not communicate with a [[modem]]. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The Fido software required changes to the serial drivers to work properly on the Rainbow. A porting effort started, involving Jennings, Madil and Baker. This caused all involved to rack up considerable [[Long-distance calling#Categories and charges|long distance charges]] as they all called each other during development, or called into each other's BBSes to leave email. During one such call "in May or early June", Baker and Jennings discussed how great it would be if the BBS systems could call each other automatically, exchanging mail and files between them.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; This would allow them to compose mail on their local machines, and then deliver it quickly, as opposed to calling in and typing the message in while on a long-distance telephone connection. Jennings responded by calling into Baker's system that night and uploading a new version of the software consisting of three files: FIDO_DECV6 (the new version of the BBS program itself), FIDONET, and NODELIST.BBS. The new version of FIDO BBS had a timer that caused it to exit at a specified time, normally at night, and as it exited it would run the separate FIDONET program. NODELIST was the list of Fido BBS systems, which Jennings had already been compiling.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The FIDONET program was what later became known as a ''mailer''. FIDO was modified to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a ''node number'' for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a ''message packet''. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would [[Handshaking|handshake]] and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.&lt;ref&gt;Baker at the 35 minute mark, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 "BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to lower long distance charges, the mail exchanges were timed to run late at night, normally 4 AM.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; This would later be known as ''national mail hour'',&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; and, later still, as ''Zone Mail Hour''.

===Up and running===
By June 1984 Version 7 of the system was being run in production, and nodes were rapidly being added to the network. By August there were almost 30 systems in the nodelist, 50 by September, and over 160 by January 1985. As the network grew, the maintenance of the nodelist became prohibitive, and errors were common. In these cases people would start receiving phone calls at 4 AM, from a caller that would say nothing and then hang up. In other cases the system would be listed before it was up and running, resulting in long distance calls that accomplished nothing.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt;

In August 1984 Jennings handed off control of the nodelist to the group in St. Louis, mostly Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker. Kaplan had come across Fido as part of finding a BBS solution for his company, which worked with DEC computers and had been given a Rainbow computer and a [[USRobotics]] 1200bit/s [[modem]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan provides details 14 to 16 minute mark during this inverview, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 "BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)"]&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured that at least some of the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number. If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

===Nets and nodes===
Growth continued to accelerate, and by the spring of 1985 the system was already reaching its limit of 250 nodes. In addition to the limits on growth of what was clearly a popular system, nodelist maintenance continued to grow more and more time consuming.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

It was also realized that Fido systems were generally clustered – of the 15 systems running by the start of June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;  A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn.  Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate.  Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would make sense to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.

The team settled on the concept of adding a new ''network number'' patterned on the idea of [[area code]]s.&lt;ref group=N&gt;Details of the sequence of events leading to the new routing scheme differ slightly between accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; A complete [[network address]] would now consist of the network and node number pair, which would be written with a slash between them. All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local ''network host'', someone who volunteered to pay for any long distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. They would then call any required network admin sites and deliver the packet to them. That site would then process the mail as normal, although all of the messages in the packet would be guaranteed to be local calls.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The network address was placed in an unused field in the Fido message database, which formerly always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would look it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

A huge advantage of the new scheme was that node numbers were now unique only within their network, not globally. This meant the previous 250 node limit was gone, but for a variety of reasons this was initially limited to about 1,200. This change also devolved the maintenance of the nodelists down to the network hosts, who then sent updated lists back to Node 51 to be collected into the master list. The St. Louis group now had to only maintain their own local network, and do basic work to compile the global list.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

At a meeting held in Kaplan's living room in St. Louis on 11 April 1985&lt;ref group=N&gt;In the interviews, Baker says this took place in May.&lt;/ref&gt; the various parties hammered out all of the details of the new concept. As part of this meeting, they also added the concept of a ''region'', a purely administrative level that was not part of the addressing scheme. Regional hosts would handle any stragglers in the network maps, remote systems that had no local network hosts. They then divided up the US into ten regions that they felt would have roughly equal populations.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

By May, Jennings had early versions of the new software running. These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include a list of all the known systems in that area, with instructions to forward mail to each of those nodes through node 10. This process was later semi-automated by John Warren's NODELIST program.&lt;ref name=tom2&gt;Tom Jennings, [http://www.worldpowersystems.com/FidoNet/fidohist2.txt "FidoNet History #2"], 20 August 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this information was folded into updated versions of the nodelist format, and the ROUTES file is no longer used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbscorner.com/bbsnetworks/fidonet.htm |title=The Fidonet BBS Network |publisher=Bbscorner.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of FIDO and FIDONET, 10C, was released containing all of these features. On 12 June 1985 the core group brought up 10C, and most Fido systems had upgraded within a few months.&lt;ref name=tom2/&gt; The process went much smoother than anyone imagined, and very few nodes had any problems.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

===Echomail===
Some time during the evolution of Fido, [[email attachment|file attachments]] were added to the system, allowing a file to be referenced from an email message. During the normal exchange between two instances of FIDONET, any files attached to the messages in the packets were delivered after the packet itself had been up or downloaded. It is not clear when this was added, but it was already a feature of the basic system when the 8 February 1985 version of the FidoNet standards document was released, so this was added very early in Fido's history.

At a [[sysop]] meeting in Dallas, the idea was raised that it would be nice if there was some way for the sysops to post messages that would be shared among the systems.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;Wynn Wagner, [http://www.rxn.com/~net282/fidonet.wagner.echomail.txt "History of Echomail"], July 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a ''tosser/scanner''. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.&lt;ref name=randy&gt;Randy Bush, [http://www.fidonet.org/inet92_Randy_Bush.txt "FidoNet: Technology, Use, Tools, and History"], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In this fashion, Rush's system implemented a store and forward public message system similar to [[Usenet]], but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such ''echomail'' forum was one created by the Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public ''echos'' soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, and led to the creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987.&lt;ref name=robbins&gt;Frank Robbins, [http://elsmar.com/pdf_files/fidonet-info.txt "FidoNet History Timeline"]&lt;/ref&gt; Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt;

Echomail did not necessarily use the same distribution pathways as normal netmail, and the distribution routing was stored in a separate setup file not unlike the original ROUTES.BBS. At the originating site a header line was added to the message indicating the origin system's name and address. After that, each system that the message traveled through added itself to a growing PATH header, as well as a SEENBY header. SEENBY prevented the message from looping around the network in the case of mis-configured routing information.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt;

Echomail was not the only system to use the file attachment feature of netmail to implement store-and-forward capabilities. Similar concepts were used by online games and other systems as well.

===Zones and points===
The evolution towards the net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on either end of the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt;

At the same time, it was noted that some [[power user]]s were interested in using FidoNet protocols as a way of delivering the large quantities of echomail to their local machines where it could be read offline. These users did not want their systems to appear in the nodelist - they did not (necessarily) run a bulletin board system and were not publicly accessible.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; A mechanism allowing netmail delivery to these systems without the overhead of nodelist maintenance was desirable.

In October 1986 the last major change to the FidoNet network was released, adding ''zones'' and ''points''. Zones represented major geographical areas roughly corresponding to continents. There were six zones in total, North America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Points represented non-public nodes, which were created privately on a BBS system. Point mail was delivered to a selected host BBS as normal, but then re-packaged into a packet for the point to pick up on-demand. The complete addressing format was now &lt;code&gt;zone:net/node.point&lt;/code&gt;, so a real example might be &lt;code&gt;Bob Smith@1:250/250.10&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; Points were widely used only for a short time, the introduction of [[offline reader]] systems filled this role with systems that were much easier to use. Points remain in use to this day, but are less popular than when they were introduced.

===Other extensions===
Although FidoNet supported file attachments from even the earliest standards, this feature tended to be rarely used and was often turned off. File attachments followed the normal mail routing through multiple systems, and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered in the form of ''file requests'', which made file transfers driven by the ''calling'' system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing. Two such standards became common, "WaZOO" and "Bark", which saw varying support among different mailers. Both worked in a similar fashion, with the mailer calling the remote system and sending a new handshake packet to request the files.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Becker [http://www.rxn.com/services/fts/fts-0008.txt "An Enhanced FidoNet Technical Standard Extending FTS-0001 to include Bark requests"], 15 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vince Perriello, [http://ftsc.org/docs/fts-0006.002 "YOOHOO and YOOHOO/2U2"], 30 November 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Although FidoNet was, by far, the best known BBS-based network, it was by no means the only one. From 1988 on, [[PCBoard]] systems were able to host similar functionality known as [[RelayNet]], while other popular networks included [[RBBSNet]] from the [[Commodore 64]] world, and [[AlterNet]]. Late in the evolution of the FidoNet system, there was a proposal to allow mail (but not forum messages) from these systems to switch into the FidoNet structure.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Gove, [http://ftsc.org/docs/fsc-0076.001 "A Proposal for NetMail AreaTags"], 3 December 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This was not adopted, and the rapid rise of the internet made this superfluous as these networks rapidly added internet exchange, which acted as a [[lingua franca]].

[[File:Fidonodes.PNG|thumb|Rapid rise, 1996 peak, and slower decline in number of Fidonodes]]

===Peak===
FidoNet started in 1984 and listed 100 nodes by the end of that year. Steady growth continued through the 1980s, but a combination of factors led to rapid growth after 1988. These included faster and less expensive modems, and rapidly declining costs of hard drives and computer systems in general. By April 1993 the FidoNet nodelist contained over 20,000 systems. At that time it was estimated that each node had, on average, about 200 active users. Of these 4 million users in total, 2 million users commonly used echomail, the shared public forums, while about 200,000 used the private netmail system.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; At its peak, FidoNet listed approximately 39,000 systems.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;The Jargon File puts it at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/FidoNet 38,000] at its peak.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its lifetime, FidoNet was beset with management problems and infighting. Much of this can be traced to the fact that the inter-net delivery cost real money, and the traffic grew more rapidly than decreases caused by improving modem speeds and downward trending long distance rates. As they increased, various methods of recouping the costs were attempted, all of which caused friction in the groups. The problems were so bad that Jennings came to refer to the system as the "fight-o-net".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fight-o-net "fight-o-net"], Jargon File, 4 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}
As modems reached speeds of 28.8&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, the overhead of the [[TCP/IP]] protocols were no longer so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 the bulletin board market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the store-and-forward model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.

The FidoNet nodelist started shrinking, especially in areas with widespread availability of internet connections. This downward trend continues, but has levelled out at approximately 2,500 nodes.&lt;ref group=N&gt;The exact number can be determined by examining the official nodelist. However, the format is difficult to parse and many systems deliberately appear more than once, in different sections. The 2,500 node limit is an estimate made by the current maintainer as of 2013, Janis Kracht.&lt;/ref&gt; FidoNet remains popular in areas where Internet access is difficult to come by, or expensive.

===Resurgence===

There is now (~2014) a retro movement which is resulting in a slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than the internet as a whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with [[ASCII]] text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.

==FidoNet organizational structure==
FidoNet is governed in a hierarchical structure according to FidoNet policy, with designated coordinators at each level to manage the administration of FidoNet nodes and resolve disputes between members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fidonet.us/policy4.html | title = FidoNet Policy Document: Version 4.07 | date = June 9, 1989 | publisher = FidoNet | accessdate = 2010-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Network coordinators are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area, usually a city or similar sized area. Regional coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of the network coordinators within their region, typically the size of a state, or small country. Zone coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of all of the regions within their zone. The world is divided into six zones, the coordinators of which elect one of themselves to be the ''International Coordinator'' of FidoNet.

==Technical structure==
FidoNet was historically designed to use modem-based [[Dial-up internet access|dial-up]] ([[plain old telephone service|POTS]]) access between bulletin board systems, and much of its policy and structure reflected this.

The FidoNet system officially referred only to transfer of ''Netmail''&amp;mdash;the individual private messages between people using bulletin boards&amp;mdash;including the protocols and standards with which to support it. A netmail message would contain the name of the person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system.

Netmail allowed for the ''attachment'' of a single file to every message. This led to a series of ''piggyback'' protocols that built additional features onto FidoNet by passing information back and forth as file attachments. These included the automated distribution of files, and transmission of data for inter-BBS games.

By far the most commonly used of these piggyback protocols was ''Echomail'', public discussions similar to [[Usenet]] newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the ''scanner''), compressed it using [[.arc|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system. On receiving such a message, identified because it was addressed to a particular ''user'', the reverse process was used to extract the messages, and a ''tosser'' put them back into the new system's forums.

Echomail was so popular that for many users, Echomail ''was'' the FidoNet. Private person-to-person Netmail was relatively rare.

===Geographical structure===
FidoNet is politically organized into a tree structure, with different parts of the tree electing their respective coordinators. The FidoNet hierarchy consists of ''zones'', ''regions'', ''networks'', ''nodes'' and ''points'' broken down more-or-less geographically.

The highest level is the zone, which is largely continent-based:
* Zone 1 is [[North America]]
* Zone 2 is Europe, Former [[Soviet Union]] countries, and Israel
* Zone 3 is [[Australasia]]
* Zone 4 is [[Latin America]] (except [[Puerto Rico]])
* Zone 5 was Africa
* Zone 6 was Asia, Israel and the Asian parts of Russia, (which are listed in Zone 2). On 26 July 2007 zone 6 was removed, and all remaining nodes were moved to zone 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shenkenberger | first = Carol | editor-last = Felten  | editor-first = Björn | date =  26 July 2007 | publication-date = 30 July 2007 | title = Removal of Zone 6 | periodical = FidoNews | volume =24 | issue= 31 | page = 2 | url = http://www.fidotel.com/public/fidonews/archive/2007/FIDO2431.htm | accessdate = 2010-10-08 | quote =With sadness I have removed the last entry for Zone6 as of this writing.  All remaining members have been transitioned to Zone3 as previously determined by Z6 members at large.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each zone is broken down into regions, which are broken down into nets, which consist of individual nodes.  Zones 7-4095 are used for ''othernets''; groupings of nodes which use Fido-compatible software to carry their own independent message areas without being in any way controlled by FidoNet's political structure. Using un-used zone numbers would ensure that each network would have a unique set of addresses, avoiding potential routing conflicts and ambiguities for systems that belonged to more than one network.

===FidoNet addresses===
FidoNet addresses explicitly consist of a ''zone'' number, a ''network'' number (or region number), and a ''node'' number. They are written in the form &lt;tt&gt;Zone:Network/Node&lt;/tt&gt;.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 4.0}} The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address.

For example, consider a node located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[United States]] with an assigned node number is 918, located in Zone 1 (North America), Region 19, and Network 170. The full FidoNet address for this system would be &lt;tt&gt;1:170/918&lt;/tt&gt;.  The ''region'' was used for administrative purposes, and was only part of the address if the node was listed directly underneath the Regional Coordinator, rather than one of the networks that were used to divide the region further.

FidoNet policy requires that each FidoNet system maintain a ''nodelist'' of every other member system. Information on each node includes the name of the system or BBS, the name of the node operator, the geographic location, the telephone number, and software capabilities. The nodelist is updated weekly, to avoid unwanted calls to nodes that had shut down, with their phone numbers possibly having been reassigned for voice use by the respective telephone company.

To accomplish regular updates, coordinators of each network maintain the list of systems in their local areas. The lists are forwarded back to the International Coordinator via automated systems on a regular basis. The International Coordinator would then compile a new nodelist, and generate the [[diff|list of changes]] (nodediff) to be distributed for node operators to apply to their existing nodelist.

===Routing of FidoNet mail===
In a theoretical situation, a node would normally forward messages to a ''hub''. The hub, acting as a distribution point for mail, might then send the message to the Net Coordinator. From there it may be sent through a Regional Coordinator, or to some other system specifically set up for the function. Mail to other zones might be sent through a Zone Gate.

For example, a FidoNet message might follow the path:
*1:170/918 ''(node)'' to 1:170/900 ''(hub)'' to 1:170/0 ''(net coordinator)'' to 1:19/0 ''(region coordinator)'' to 1:1/0 ''(zone coordinator)''. From there, it was distributed 'down stream' to the destination node(s).

Originally there was no specific relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the node number to the hub number if the network is large enough to contain any hubs. This effect may be seen in the nodelist by looking at the structure of Net 2410 where node 2:2410/330 is listed under Hub 300. This is not the case in other zones.

In Zone 1, things are much different. Zone 1 was the starting point and when Zones and Regions were formed, the existing nets were divided up regionally with no set formula. The only consideration taken was where they were located geographically in respect to the region's mapped outline. As net numbers got added, the following formula was used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Region number × 20
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then when some regions started running out of network numbers, the following was also used.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Region number × 200
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Region 19, for instance, contains nets 380-399 and 3800-3999 in addition to those that were in Region 19 when it was formed.

Part of the objective behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages would be sent to one or more hubs or hosts in [[data compression|compressed form]] ([[.arc|ARC]] was nominally standard, but [[PKZIP]] is universally supported); one toll call could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution.

In practice, the FidoNet structure allows for any node to connect directly to any other, and node operators would sometimes form their own toll-calling arrangements on an ad-hoc basis, allowing for a balance between collective cost saving and timely delivery. For instance, if one node operator in a network offered to make regular toll calls to a particular system elsewhere, other operators might arrange to forward all of their mail destined for the remote system, and those near it, to the local volunteer.  Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, but it was also common for people to volunteer to pay for regular toll calls either out of generosity, or to build their status in the community.

This ad-hoc system was particularly popular with networks that were built on top of FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively large file transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead.

The FidoNet system was best adapted to an environment in which local [[telephone]] service was inexpensive and long-distance calls (or intercity data transfer via [[packet-switched]] [[computer network|networks]]) costly. Therefore, it fared somewhat poorly in [[Japan]], where even local lines are expensive, or in [[France]], where tolls on local calls and competition with [[Minitel]] or other data networks limited its growth.

===Points===
As the number of messages in Echomail grew over time, it became very difficult for users to keep up with the volume while logged into their local BBS. ''Points'' were introduced to address this, allowing technically savvy users to receive the already compressed and batched Echomail (and Netmail) and read it locally on their own machines. {{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 5}}

To do this, the FidoNet addressing scheme was extended with the addition of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address &lt;tt&gt;1:170/918.10&lt;/tt&gt;.

In real-world use, points are fairly difficult to set up. The FidoNet software typically consisted of a number of small utility programs run by manually edited scripts that required some level of technical ability. Reading and editing the mail required either a "sysop editor" program, or a BBS program to be run locally.

In North America (Zone 1), where local calls are generally free, the benefits of the system were offset by its complexity. Points were used only briefly, and even then only to a limited degree. Dedicated [[offline mail reader]] programs such as [[Blue Wave (mail reader)|Blue Wave]], Squiggy and Silver Xpress (OPX) were introduced in the mid-1990s, and quickly rendered the point system obsolete. Many of these packages supported the [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] offline mail standard.

In other parts of the world, especially Europe, this was different. In Europe, even local calls are generally metered, so there was a strong incentive to keep the duration of the calls as short as possible. Point software employs standard compression (ZIP, ARJ, etc.) and so keeps the calls down to a few minutes a day at most. In contrast to North America, pointing saw rapid and fairly widespread uptake in Europe.

Many regions distribute a pointlist in parallel with the nodelist. The pointlist segments are maintained by Net- and Region Pointlist Keepers and the Zone Point List Keeper assembles them into the Zone pointlist. At the peak of FidoNet there were over 120,000 points listed in the Zone 2 pointlist. Listing points is on a voluntary basis and not every point is listed, so how many points there really were is anybody's guess. As of June 2006, there are still some 50,000 listed points. Most of them are in Russia and Ukraine.

===Technical specifications===
FidoNet contained several technical specifications for compatibility between systems.  The most basic of all is [http://ftsc.org/docs/fts-0001.016 ''FTS-0001''], with which all FidoNet systems are required to comply as a minimal requirement.  FTS-0001 defined:
*Handshaking - the protocols used by mailer software to identify each other and exchange meta information about the session.
*Transfer protocol ''([[XMODEM]])'' - the protocols to be used for transferring files containing FidoNet mail between systems.
*Message format - the standard format for FidoNet messages during the time which they were exchanged between systems.

Other specifications that were commonly used provided for ''echomail'', different transfer protocols and handshake methods (''e.g.: Yoohoo/Yoohoo2u2, EMSI''), file compression, nodelist format, transfer over reliable connections such as the Internet ([[Binkp]]), and other aspects.

===Zone mail hour===
Since computer bulletin boards historically used the same [[telephone line]]s for transferring mail as were used for dial-in human users of the BBS, FidoNet policy dictates that at least one designated line of each FidoNet node must be available for accepting mail from other FidoNet nodes during a particular hour of each day.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 6.0}}

''Zone Mail Hour'', as it was named, varies depending on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning.  The exact hour varies depending on the time zone, and any node with only one telephone line is required to reject human callers. In practice, particularly in later times, most FidoNet systems tend to accept mail at any time of day when the phone line is not busy, usually during night.

==FidoNet deployments==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Most FidoNet deployments were designed in a modular fashion.  A typical deployment would involve several applications that would communicate through shared files and directories, and switch between each other through carefully designed [[shell script|scripts]] or [[batch file]]s.  However, [[wiktionary:monolith|monolithic]] software that encompassed all required functions in one package is available, such as D'Bridge.  Such software eliminated the need for custom batch files and is tightly integrated in operation.  The preference of deployment was that of the operator and there were both pros and cons of running in either fashion.

Arguably the most important piece of software on a DOS-based Fido system was the ''[[FOSSIL| FOSSIL driver]]'', which was a small device driver which provided a standard way for the Fido software to talk to the modem.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 10.0}}  This driver needed to be loaded before any Fido software would work.  An efficient FOSSIL driver meant faster, more reliable connections.

''Mailer software'' was responsible for transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times.  The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols.  If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user.  When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it from time to time by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further.  Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.

''BBS software'' was used to interact with human callers to the system.  BBS software would allow dial-in users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes.  Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system.  Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users in a variety of ways (i.e.: node to node chat).

A ''scanner/tosser'' application, such as [[FastEcho]], [[FMail]], [[TosScan]] and [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]], would normally be invoked when a BBS user had entered a new FidoNet message that needed to be sent, or when a mailer had received new mail to be imported into the local messages bases.  This application would be responsible for handling the packaging of incoming and outgoing mail, moving it between the local system's message bases and the mailer's inbound and outbound directories.  The scanner/tosser application would generally be responsible for basic routing information, determining which systems to forward mail to.

In later times, ''message readers'' or ''editors'' that were independent of BBS software were also developed.  Often the System Operator of a particular BBS would use a devoted message reader, rather than the BBS software itself, to read and write FidoNet and related messages. One of the most popular editors in 2008 was [[GoldED+]].  In some cases FidoNet nodes, or more often FidoNet points, had no public bulletin board attached, and existed only for the transfer of mail for the benefit of the node's operator. Most nodes in 2009 had no BBS access, but only points, if anything.

The original ''Fido BBS'' software, and some other FidoNet-supporting software from the 1980s, is no longer functional on modern systems.  This is for several reasons, including problems related to the [[Y2K bug]].  In some cases, the original authors have left the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] or [[shareware]] community, and the software, much of which was [[closed source]], has been rendered [[abandonware]].

Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as [[FrontDoor]], Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge from the early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the freeware [[NetFoss]] Telnet [[FOSSIL]] driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to ''dial'' an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with [[DOSEMU]] (DOS emulator).
Mail Tossers such as FastEcho and FMail are still used today under both Windows and Linux/DOSEMU.

[[File:Qcc-0.57.1xe master queue.png|thumb|File queue in qcc, the ncurses UI for qico. The addresses are made-up.]]
There are several modern Windows based FidoNet Mailers available today with source code, including Argus, Radius, and Taurus&lt;!-- (they seem to be neither [[free software]] nor [[open source software]], since, IIRC, commercial use is prohibited according to a license in the Argus source code at SF.net)--&gt;. MainDoor is another Windows based Fidonet mailer, which also can be run using either a modem or directly over TCP/IP. Two popular [[free and open source software]] FidoNet mailers for [[Unix-like]] systems are the [[binkd]] (cross-platform, IP-only, uses the [[binkp]] protocol) and qico (supports modem communication as well as the IP protocol of ifcico and binkp).

On the ''hardware'' side, Fido systems were usually well-equipped machines, for their day, with quick CPUs, high-speed modems and [[16550]] UARTs, which were at the time an upgrade.  As a Fidonet system was usually a BBS, it needed to quickly process any new mail events before returning to its 'waiting for call' state. In addition, the BBS itself usually necessitated lots of storage space.  Finally, a FidoNet system usually had at least one dedicated phoneline.  Consequently, operating a Fidonet system often required significant financial investment, a cost usually met by the owner of the system.

== FidoNet availability ==
While the use of FidoNet has dropped dramatically compared with its use up to the mid-1990s, it is still used in many countries and especially [[Russia]] and former republics of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Some BBSes, including those that are now available for users with [[Internet]] connections via [[telnet]], also retain their FidoNet netmail and echomail feeds.

Some of FidoNet's echomail conferences are available via gateways with the Usenet news hierarchy using software like UFGate.  There are also mail gates for exchanging messages between Internet and FidoNet.  Widespread net abuse and [[e-mail spam]] on the Internet side has caused some gateways (such as the former 1:1/31 [[IEEE]] fidonet.org gateway) to become unusable or cease operation entirely.

== FidoNews==
''FidoNews'' is the [[online journal|newsletter]] of the FidoNet community.  Affectionately nicknamed ''The Snooze'', it is published weekly.  It was first published in 1984.  Throughout its history, it has been published by various people and entities, including the short-lived International FidoNet Association.

'''Foodomics''' was defined in 2009 as "a discipline that studies the Food and Nutrition domains through the application and integration of advanced [[-omics]] technologies to improve consumer's well-being, health, and knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cifuentes A | year = 2009 | title =  Food analysis and Foodomics| url =  http://hdl.handle.net/10261/154212 | journal = J. Chromatogr. A | volume = 1216 | issue = 43| page = 7109 | doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2009.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foodomics requires the combination of food chemistry, biological sciences, and data analysis.

The study of foodomics became under the spotlight after it was introduced in the first international conference in 2009 at [[Cesena]], Italy. Many experts in the field of omics and nutrition were invited to this event in order to find the new approach and possibility in the area of food science and technology. However, research and development of foodomics today are still limited due to high throughput analysis required. The American Chemical Society journal called [[Analytical Chemistry]] dedicated its cover to foodomics in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;About the Cover December 4, 2012: Vol. 84, Iss. 23 http://pubs.acs.org/action/showLargeCover?jcode=ancham&amp;vol=84&amp;issue=23&lt;/ref&gt;

Foodomics involves four main areas of omics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Capozzi|first1=Francesco|title=Foodomics: a new comprehensive approach to food and nutrition|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12263-012-0310-x|website=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Genomics]], which involves investigation of genome and its pattern;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.journals.elsevier.com/genomics/|title=Genomics|last=Engel|first=Astrid|date=|website=Elsevier|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Transcriptomics]], which explores a set of gene and identifies the difference among various conditions, organisms, and circumstance, by using several techniques including [[microarray analysis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/transcriptome|title=Transcriptomics|last=Liang|first=Kung-Hao|date=2013|website=ScienceDirect|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Proteomics]], studies every kind of proteins that is a product of the genes. It covers how protein functions in a particular place, structures, interactions with other proteins, etc;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Paul|title=Molecular Biologist's Guide to Proteomics|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=66|issue=1|pages=39–63; table of contents|date=March 2002|doi=10.1128/MMBR.66.1.39-63.2002|pmid=11875127|pmc=120780|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC120780/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of foodomics ==
Foodomics greatly helps the scientists in an area of food science and nutrition to gain a better access to data, which is used to analyze the effects of food on human health, etc. It is believed to be another step towards better understanding of development and application of technology and food. Moreover, the study of foodomics leads to other omics sub-disciplines, including nutrigenomics which is the integration of the study of nutrition, gene and omics.

[[File:Rosmarinus officinalis133095382.jpg|thumb|Rosemary]]

=== Colon cancer===
Foodomics approach is used to analyze and establish the links between several substances presented in [[rosemary]] and the ability to cure colon cancer cells. There are thousands of chemical compounds in rosemary, but the ones that are able to help cure such disease are Carnosic acid (CA) and Carnosol (CS), which can be obtained by extracting rosemary via SFE. They have the potential to fight against and reduce the proliferation of human [[HT-29]] colon cancer cells.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cifuentes|first1=Alejandro|title=Foodomics: Food Science &amp; Omics Tools in the 21st Century|url=http://www.nmkl.org/dokumenter/Kurs/ACifuentes.pdf|website=NMKL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment done by inserting rosemary extracts to the mice and collecting RNA and metabolites from each controlled and treated individual indicated that there is a correlation between the compounds used and the percentage of recovery from the cancer. This information is however never achievable without the help of foodomics knowledge as it was used to process data, analyze statistic, and identify biomakers. Foodomics, coupled with transcriptomic data, shows that Carnosic acid leads to the accumulation of an antioxidant, [[Glutathione S-transferase|glutothione]] (GSH). The chemical can be broken down to Cysteinylglycine, a naturally occurring dipeptide and an intermediate in the gamma glutamyl cycle. Moreover, the result from an integration of foodomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics reveals that provoking colon cancer cell compounds, such as N‐acetylputrescine, N‐acetylcadaverine, 5’MTA and γ‐aminobutyric acid, can also be lowered by CA treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thus, foodomics plays an important role in explaining the relationship between deadly disease, like colon cancer, and natural compounds existing in rosemary. Data obtained is useful in reaching another approach for tackling proliferation against cancer cells.

=== Processed meat ===
Aside from measuring the concentration of protein in meat, calculating [[bioavailability]] is another way in determining the total amount of component and quality. The calculation is done when food molecules are digested in various steps. Since human digestion is very complicated, a wide range of analytical techniques are used to obtain the data, including foodomics protocol and an [[in vitro]] static simulation of digestion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bordoni |first1= Alessandra |last2= Laghi |first2=Luca |last3=Babini |first3= Elena |last4=Nunzio|first4=Mattia Di |last5=Picone |first5=Gianfranco |last6=Ciampa |first6=Alessandra |last7=Valli |first7= Veronica |last8=Danesi |first8=Francesca |last9=Capozzi1 |first9=Francesco |date= 5 March 2014 |title= The foodomics approach for the evaluation of protein bioaccessibility in processed meat upon in vitro digestion |url= |journal= Electrophoresis |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages= 1607–1614 |doi= 10.1002/elps.201300579 |pmid= 24436037 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bresaola &amp; Mozzarella (5824152348).jpg|thumb|Bresaola or the air-dried and salted beef. It is made from a single muscle of beef.]]
The procedure is divided into 3 stages as the samples are collected from oral, gastric and duodenal digestion in order to study protein digestibility closely and thoroughly. A meat based food, [[Bresaola]], is evaluated because beef muscles are still intact, which can be used to indicate nutritional value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The consequences of oral step can be observed at the beginning of the gastric digestion, the first stage. As there is no enzymatic proteolytic activity at this stage, the level of [[Proton nuclear magnetic resonance|H-NMR]], a spectrum used to determine the structure, is still constant because there is no change going on. However, when [[pepsin]] takes action, TD-NMR, a special technique used for measuring mobile water population with macromolecular solutes, reveals that progressive unbundling of meat fibers helps pepsin activity to digest. TD-NMR data proves that bolus structure changes considerably during the first part of digestion and water molecules, consequently, leave the spaces inside the [[myofibril]]s and fiber bundles. This results in a low level of water that can be detected in duodenal stage. Since digestion is in progress, protein molecules become smaller and molecular weight gets lower, in other words, there is an increase in the spectra total area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Identifiers.org URIs&lt;ref name="pmid22140103"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22140103 |year=2012 |last1=Juty |first1=N |last2=Le Novère |first2=N |last3=Laibe |first3=C |title=Identifiers.org and MIRIAM Registry: Community resources to provide persistent identification |volume=40 |issue=Database issue |pages=D580–6 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkr1097 |pmc=3245029 |journal=Nucleic Acids Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://identifiers.org/ Identifiers.org Website&lt;/ref&gt; are perennial identifiers, that specify at once the data collection, using the namespaces of the Registry, and the record identifier within the collection in the form of a unique resolvable [[URI]]. The Identifiers.org resolving system is built upon the information stored in the [[MIRIAM Registry]], which is a database that stores namespaces assigned to commonly used data collections (databases and [[ontologies]]) for the Life Sciences. It transforms an Identifiers.org URI into the various URLs leading to the various instances of the record identified by the URI. Identifiers.org is part of the [[ELIXIR]] [https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability Interoperability Platform].

=== Identifier structure ===

An Identifiers.org URI is formed of several parts:

* Protocol. Identifiers.org URIs are [[HTTP]] URIs and start with "http:/"
* Data collection. These are namespaces listed in the [[MIRIAM Registry]]. For instance "pubmed" for the publication resource [[pubmed]], "ec-code" for the [[enzyme nomenclature]] and "go" for [[gene ontology]]
* Record in the collection. For instance "9606" is "3-fluorotoluene" in the collection PubChem, it is "Homo sapiens" in the collection "taxonomy" and it is a social science publication in the collection "pubmed".
* Optional: Identifiers.org URIs can be suffixed with parameters, for instance imposing which resource to use for resolving, "profiles" that control the resolver's behaviour etc.

[[File:Identifiers.org-URIs.png|thumb|Structure and examples of Identifiers.org URIs.]]

=== Usage ===

The systems allows a consistent and uniform annotation of datasets. This is turn facilitates data alignment and integration. Identifiers.org URIs are used to encode the metadata in the standard formats of the COMBINE initiative,&lt;ref&gt;http://co.mbine.org/ COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork Web site&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[SBML]]. In particular, databases such as [[BioModels Database]] and [[Reactome]] export their data in SBML with cross-references encoded using Identifiers.org URIs. These URIs are also used in various semantic web projects such as [[Bio2RDF]], Open PHACTS and the EBI RDF platform&lt;ref&gt;S Jupp, J Malone, J Bolleman, M Brandizi, M Davies, L Garcia, A Gaulton, C Laibe, N Redaschi, S Wimalaratne, Helen P, Ewan B, AM Jenkinson (2014) The EBI RDF Platform: Linked Open Data for the Life Sciences. ''Bioinformatics'' {{DOI|10.1093/bioinformatics/btt765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with other URI systems ===

Identifiers.org URIs have been developed since 2011 as a resolvable version of the [[MIRIAM]] identifiers, developed since 2005, which were of a [[Uniform resource name|URN]] form, and not directly resolvable. Identifiers.org URIs are similar to [[PURL]]s, albeit providing alternative resolutions for collections with several instances. They are also similar to [[Digital object identifier|DOI]]s, but provide human readable collection names, and re-use the record identifier assigned by the data provider.

[[File:Wilcox.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] (1863–1935)]]

An '''illustration''' is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process,&lt;ref&gt;cf. the freely available international [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi Database of Scientific Illustrators 1450-1950] with 20 search fields and nearly 7000 entries of illustrators in science, medicine &amp; technology active prior to 1950&lt;/ref&gt; designed for integration in published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films.

The origin of the word “illustration” is late Middle English (in the sense ‘illumination; spiritual or intellectual enlightenment’): via Old French from Latin ''illustratio(n- )'', from the verb ''illustrate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/illustration|title=Oxford Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary illustration uses a wide range of styles and techniques, including [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[collage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[digital design]], [[multimedia]], [[3D modelling]]. Most illustrators work on a freelance basis. 

Depending on the purpose, illustration may be expressive, stylised, realistic or highly technical.

[[Technical illustration|Technical]] and [[scientific illustration]] communicates information of a technical or scientific nature. This may include [[Exploded-view drawing|exploded view]]s, [[Cutaway drawing|cutaways]], fly-throughs, reconstructions, instructional images, component designs, [[diagrams]]. The aim is "to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer"&lt;ref name="ViGr05"&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). "[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2005/Viola-05-Smart/Viola-05-Smart-Paper.pdf Smart Visibility in Visualization]". In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical and scientific illustration is generally designed to describe or explain subjects to a nontechnical audience, so must provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer's interest and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm Industriegrafik.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814125052/http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm |date=2009-08-14 }} website, Last modified: June 15, 2002. Accessed february 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary illustration practice, 2D and 3D software is often used to create accurate representations that can be updated easily, and reused in a variety of contexts.

== Illustration as fine art ==
[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' by [[William Blake]] (1786) ]]

In the art world, illustration has at times been considered of less importance than [[graphic design]] and fine art.

Today, however, due in part to the growth of [[graphic novel]] and [[video game]] industries, as well as increased use of illustration in magazines and other publications, illustration is now becoming a valued art form, capable of engaging a global market.

Original illustration art has been known to attract high prices at auction. The US artist [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting "Breaking Home Ties" sold in a 2006 [[Sotheby's]] auction for USD15.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/norman-rockwell-art-rises-in-value-and-his-museum-gets-priced-o/19366251/ Norman Rockwell's Rising Value Prices Out His Museum] Zac Bissonnette, AOL Daily Finance, 2-22-10&lt;/ref&gt; Many other illustration genres are equally valued, with pinup artists such as [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Alberto Vargas]], for example, also attracting high prices.

Historically, the art of illustration is closely linked to the industrial processes of [[printing]] and [[publishing]].

=== Early history ===

The illustrations of medieval [[codices]] were known as [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]], and were individually hand drawn and painted. With the invention of the [[printing press]] during the 15th century, [[books]] became more widely distributed, often illustrated with [[woodcuts]].

1600s Japan saw the origination of [[Ukiyo-e]], an influential illustration style characterised by expressive line, vivid colour and subtle tones, resulting from the ink-brushed [[woodblock printing in Japan|wood block printing]] technique. Subjects included traditional folk tales, popular figures and every day life. [[Hokusai]]’s ''The Great Wave of Kanazawa'' is a famous image of the time.

During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, the main reproduction processes for illustration were [[engraving]] and [[etching]]. In 18th Century England, a notable illustrator was [[William Blake]] (1757–827), who used [[relief etching]]. By the early 19th century, the introduction of [[lithography]] substantially improved reproduction quality.

=== 19th Century ===

In Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Dickens]] illustrator [[Hablot Knight Browne]], and, in France, [[Honoré Daumier]]. All contributed to both satirical and “serious” publications. At this time, there was a great demand for [[caricature]] drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes.

The British humorous magazine [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's [[Comic Almanac]] (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir [[John Tenniel]], the [[Dalziel Brothers]], and [[George du Maurier|Georges du Maurier]]. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators.

Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term "[[cartoon]]" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] being known as the world's first "[[cartoonist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Punch Magazine Changed Everything|url=http://illustrationchronicles.com/How-Punch-Magazine-Changed-Everything|website=Illustration Chronicles|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian [[Le Voleur]], Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.

=== The "Golden Age" ===

From the early 1800s [[newspaper]]s, mass market [[magazine]]s, and illustrated books had become the dominant consumer media in Europe and the New World. By the 19th century, improvements in printing technology freed illustrators to experiment with color and rendering techniques. These developments in printing effected all areas of literature from cookbooks, photography and traveling guides, as well as children's books. Also, due to advances in printing, it became more affordable to produce color photographs within books and other materials. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Books: A Living History|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2011|isbn=9780500291153|location=London|pages=193-196}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, almost 100 percent of paper was machine-made, and while a person working by hand could produce 60-100lbs of paper per day, mechanization yielded around 1,000lbs per day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Broadview Anthology of Victorian Prose: 1832- 1901|last=Leighton|first=Mary Elizabeth|last2=Surridge|first2=Lisa|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Peterborough, ON|pages=14|chapter=Victorian Print Media and the Reading Public}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the 50 year period between 1846 and 1916, book production increased 400% and the price of books was cut in half.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[America]], this led to a "golden age of illustration" from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafoxsociety.com/what-was-the-golden-age-of-illustration/ The R. Atkinson Fox Society: What Was the Golden Age of Illustration?]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best known illustrators of that period were [[N. C. Wyeth|N.C. Wyeth]] and [[Howard Pyle]] of the [[Brandywine School]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], and [[James Montgomery Flagg]].

In economic theory, the field of [[contract theory]] can be subdivided in the theory of [[complete contract]]s and the theory of '''incomplete contracts'''.

The incomplete contracting paradigm was pioneered by [[Sanford J. Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver D. Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John H. Moore]]. In their seminal contributions, Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990), and Hart (1995) argue that in practice, contracts cannot specify what is to be done in every possible contingency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The costs and benefits of ownership: A theory of vertical and lateral integration|last = Grossman|first = Sanford J.|date = 1986|journal = Journal of Political Economy|doi = 10.1086/261404|pmid = |last2 = Hart|first2 = Oliver D.|pages = 691–719|volume = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|last = Hart|first = Oliver D.|date = 1990|journal = Journal of Political Economy|doi = 10.1086/261729|pmid = |last2 = Moore|first2 = John|pages = 1119–58|volume = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Firms, Contracts, and Financial Structure|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of contracting, future contingencies may not even be describable. Moreover, parties cannot commit themselves never to engage in mutually beneficial renegotiation later on in their relationship. Thus, an immediate consequence of the incomplete contracting approach is the so-called [[hold-up problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Hold-Up Problem and Incomplete Contracts: A Survey of Recent Topics in Contract Theory|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8586.00114/abstract|journal = Bulletin of Economic Research|date = 2001|issn = 1467-8586|pages = 1–17|volume = 53|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-8586.00114|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least in some states of the world the parties will renegotiate their contractual arrangements later on, they have insufficient incentives to make relationship-specific investments (since a party's investment returns will partially go to the other party in the renegotiations). Oliver Hart and his co-authors argue that the hold-up problem may be mitigated by choosing a suitable ownership structure ex ante (according to the incomplete contracting paradigm, more complex contractual arrangements are ruled out). Hence, the property rights approach to the [[theory of the firm]] can explain the pros and cons of vertical integration, thus providing a formal answer to important questions regarding the boundaries of the firm that were first raised by [[Ronald Coase]] (1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Nature of the Firm|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x/abstract|journal = Economica|date = 1937|issn = 1468-0335|pages = 386–405|volume = 4|issue = 16|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x|first = R. H.|last = Coase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incomplete contracting approach has been subject of a still ongoing discussion in contract theory. In particular, some authors such as Maskin and Tirole (1999) argue that rational parties should be able to solve the [[hold-up problem]] with complex contracts, while Hart and Moore (1999) point out that these contractual solutions do not work if renegotiation cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unforeseen Contingencies and Incomplete Contracts|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/1/83|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1999|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 83–114|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-937X.00079|first = Eric|last = Maskin|first2 = Jean|last2 = Tirole}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Foundations of Incomplete Contracts|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/1/115|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1999|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 115–138|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-937X.00080|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Incomplete Contracts: Where do We Stand?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0262.00052/abstract|journal = Econometrica|date = 1999|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 741–781|volume = 67|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/1468-0262.00052|first = Jean|last = Tirole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that the pros and cons of vertical integration can sometimes also be explained in complete contracting models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4135244|title = Allocating Control in Agency Problems with Limited Liability and Sequential Hidden Actions|last = Schmitz|first = Patrick W.|date = 2005|journal = RAND Journal of Economics|doi = |pmid = |volume = 36|pages = 318–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach based on incomplete contracting has been criticized by Williamson (2000) because it is focused on ex ante investment incentives, while it neglects ex post inefficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The New Institutional Economics: Taking Stock, Looking Ahead|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jel.38.3.595|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|date = 2000|issn = 0022-0515|pages = 595–613|volume = 38|issue = 3|doi = 10.1257/jel.38.3.595|first = Oliver E|last = Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out by Schmitz (2006) that the property rights approach can be extended to the case of asymmetric information, which may explain ex post inefficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Information Gathering, Transaction Costs, and the Property Rights Approach|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/000282806776157722|journal = American Economic Review|date = 2006|issn = 0002-8282|pages = 422–434|volume = 96|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/000282806776157722|first = Patrick W|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach has also been extended by Chiu (1998) and DeMeza and Lockwood (1998), who allow for different ways to model the renegotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 117010|title = Noncooperative Bargaining, Hostages, and Optimal Asset Ownership|last = Chiu|first = Y.

'''John Roland Darsee''' (born {{circa|1948}} in [[Huntington, West Virginia]]) is an American [[physician]] and former [[medical research]]er. After compiling an impressive list of publications in reputable [[scientific journal]]s, he was found to have [[scientific misconduct|fabricated data]] for his publications.

==Education and research career==
John Darsee obtained his [[undergraduate education]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]], then went to medical school at [[Indiana University]], where he received a degree in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.h2mw.eu/redactionmedicale/2012/02/Darsee%20J%20Am%20Soc%20Information%20Science.pdf |title=The Persistence of fraud in the literature: The Darsee case |journal=[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]] |date=August 1992 |first1=Carol Ann |last1=Kochan| first2=John M. |last2=Budd |volume=43 |number=7 |pages=488–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darsee had an excellent reputation as a student and medical researcher. He worked at [[Emory University]] from 1974 to 1979, serving as [[resident (medicine)|chief medical resident]] at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; He then moved to [[Harvard University]], where he worked as [[research fellow]] at the Cardiac Research Laboratory. Darsee produced 5 [[Academic publishing|major papers]] in his first 15 months at Harvard.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,955142-1,00.html |title= Fraud in a Harvard lab |first= Claudia |last= Wallis |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= February 28, 1983 |accessdate= March 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of his lab, [[cardiologist]] [[Eugene Braunwald]], considered Darsee the most remarkable of the 130 fellows who had worked in his lab and offered Darsee a [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty position]] at Harvard in 1981. Some of Darsee's colleagues became concerned about the accuracy of Darsee's results. They went to the lab director, Robert Kroner, with their suspicions.  Kroner investigated and found that Darsee had been altering dates on his laboratory work to make a few hours' work appear to be several weeks of data.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; When informed, Braunwald terminated Darsee's fellowship but did not inform the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), which was funding the research, of Darsee's misconduct at the time.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

Braunwald and Kroner conducted their own investigation into Darsee's work and found no other evidence of fraud; nor did a committee of Harvard faculty appointed by the Dean of the medical school.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dingell |first=John D. |authorlink=John Dingell |title=Shattuck Lecture--Misconduct in medical research |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=328 |issue=22 |pages=1610–5 |year=1993 |pmid=8487803 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199306033282207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 1981 discrepancies between Darsee's data and those collected by other centers performing similar work triggered a formal investigation by the NIH.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The NIH review found that Darsee had committed wide-ranging [[scientific misconduct]], [[Fabrication (science)|fabricating]] large amounts of data from [[experiment]]s which he had never conducted. Harvard's investigation, as well as that of Braunwald and Kroner, were criticized for being inadequately rigorous and for reporting that they had "fully reviewed" data which later turned out to be non-existent.&lt;ref name="nejm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |first=Peter |last=Wilmshurst |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darsee was barred by the NIH from receiving federal [[Funding of science|research funding]] for 10 years.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E4DF153BF937A25755C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title= Notorious Darsee case shakes assumptions about science |first= William J. |last= Broad |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= June 14, 1983 |accessdate= March 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], affiliated with Harvard, had to return $122,371 in research funds to NIH. This was the first time an institution was required to return money to NIH because of research fraud.&lt;ref name="Harris2013"&gt;{{cite book |last= Harris |first= Charles E., Jr. |title= Engineering Ethics: Concepts and Cases |year= 2013 |publisher= Cengage Learning|isbn=1133934684 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3sqYcyV-DkC&amp;pg=PA223 223–4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider misconduct==
Over time, more research by Darsee came under fire. Investigations revealed that Darsee had previously used false data between 1966 and 1970, while an undergraduate at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Following the NIH investigation, Harvard [[Retraction|retracted]] 30 of Darsee's papers and [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] in February 1983. Review of Darsee's earlier work at Emory University led to the retraction of an additional 52 papers and abstracts published during his tenure there.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Braunwald drew criticism for lax supervision and for creating "a hurried pace and emphasis on productivity, coupled with limited interaction with senior scientists", which contributed to the ease with which Darsee was able to fabricate data.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; [[Arnold Relman]], editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', also criticized Darsee's coauthors for their unfamiliarity with his work and lack of awareness of the scientific misconduct.&lt;ref name="relman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Relman |first= AS |title=Lessons from the Darsee affair |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=308 |issue=23 |pages=1415–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6843634 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198306093082311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Darsee maintained that he had "no recollection" of committing research fraud.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; He issued an apology which was printed in ''The New England Journal of Medicine'', writing: "I am deeply sorry for allowing these inaccuracies and falsehoods to be published in the Journal and apologize to the editorial board and readers." Darsee asked "forgiveness for whatever I have done wrong."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darsee |first= JR |title=A retraction of two papers on cardiomyopathy |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=308 |issue=23 |page=1419 |year=1983 |pmid=6341850 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198306093082313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darsee subsequently entered a clinical fellowship in [[intensive-care medicine|critical care]] at Ellis Hospital in [[Schenectady, New York]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; He worked there until June 1983. In 1984 the [[New York State Board of Regents]] revoked his [[Medical license|license to practice medicine]] in the state of New York.&lt;ref name=CrimsonLicense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1984/9/28/fraudulent-harvard-researcher-loses-medical-practice/?print=1 |title=Fraudulent Harvard researcher loses medical practice license |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=September 28, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now working as a medical writer and blogger under the name of John Hughes-Darsee and living with his wife, Linda Hughes, a surgical nurse, and 2 children in West Nyack, NY. &lt;ref name=CrimsonLicense/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardstein.blogspot.com/2013_02_01_archive.html |title=Academic Fraud |work=No Cause for Shame |type=blog |date=February 6, 2013 |first=Richard |last=Stein }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doximity.com/pub/john-darsee-md |title=John Darsee, MD; Internal Medicine; Indianapolis, IN |publisher=Doximity.com |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Launch Complex 39 (LC-39)''' is a [[rocket launch site]] at the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida|Merritt Island]] in [[Florida]], United States. The site and its collection of facilities were originally built for the [[Apollo program]], and later modified for the [[Space Shuttle program]]. As of 2017, only Launch Complex 39A is active, launching [[SpaceX]]'s [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]]. Pad 39B is being modified to launch NASA's [[Space Launch System]]. A new, smaller pad, 39C was added in 2015 to support smaller launches but has not yet been used.

Launch Complex 39 is composed of three launch pads—[[#Launch Pad 39A|39A]], [[#Launch Pad 39B|39B]] and [[#Launch Pad 39C|39C]], a [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB), a [[Crawlerway]] used by [[crawler-transporter]]s to carry [[Mobile Launcher Platform]]s between the VAB and the pads, [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] buildings, a [[Launch Control Center]] which contains the firing rooms, a [[Launch Complex 39 Press Site|news facility]] famous for the iconic countdown clock seen in television coverage and photos, and various logistical and operational support buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/tour.html|title=KSC Facilities|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA launches from LC-39A and 39B have been supervised from the NASA [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC), located {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the launch pads. LC-39 is one of several launch sites that share radar and tracking services of the [[Eastern Test Range]].

==History==

===Early history===
Northern Merritt Island was first developed around 1890 when a few wealthy Harvard University graduates purchased {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} and constructed a three-story mahogany clubhouse, very nearly on the site of Pad 39A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=AK6126|title=NGS DATASHEET FOR CLUBHOUSE SOUTHWEST GABLE|publisher=National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, Peter E. Studebaker Jr., son of [[Studebaker|the automobile magnate]], built a small casino at De Soto Beach eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) north of the Canaveral lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, John M. [http://johneriksen.net/bc/bc_cb.htm ''Brevard County, Florida : A Short History to 1955'']. See Chapter Ten on De Soto Grove, De Soto Beach, and Playa Linda Beach.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the Navy transferred the former Banana River Naval Air Station located south of [[Cape Canaveral]], to the Air Force for use in testing captured German V-2 rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrick.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4514 |title=EVOLUTION OF THE 45TH SPACE WING |publisher=US Air Force |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613181155/http://www.patrick.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4514 |archivedate=June 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's location on the East Florida coast was ideal for this purpose in that launches would be over the ocean, away from populated areas. This site became the Joint Long Range Proving Ground in 1949, and was renamed [[Patrick Air Force Base]] in 1950. The Air Force annexed part of Cape Canaveral to the North in 1951, forming the Air Force Missile Test Center, the future [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS). Missile and rocketry testing and development would take place here through the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceline.org/capehistory/2a.html|title=THE HISTORY OF CAPE CANAVERAL CHAPTER 2: THE MISSILE RANGE TAKES SHAPE (1949–1958)|publisher=Spaceline.org|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[creation of NASA]] in 1958, the CCAFS launch pads were used for NASA's civilian unmanned and manned launches, including those of [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/sites/capallc5.htm|title=Cape Canaveral LC5|publisher=Astronautix.com|accessdate=2009-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414180519/http://www.astronautix.com/sites/capallc5.htm|archivedate=April 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apollo and Skylab ===
{{Main|Apollo program}}
In 1961, President Kennedy proposed to Congress the goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Congressional approval led to the launch of the [[Apollo program]], which required a massive expansion of NASA operations, including an expansion of launch operations from the Cape to adjacent Merritt Island to the north and west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceline.org/capehistory/3a.html|title=THE HISTORY OF CAPE CANAVERAL CHAPTER 3 NASA ARRIVES (1959–PRESENT)|publisher=Spaceline.org|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA began acquisition of land in 1962, taking title to {{convert|131|sqmi}} by outright purchase and negotiating with the state of Florida for an additional {{convert|87|sqmi}}. On July 1, 1962, the site was named the '''Launch Operations Center'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}

At the time, the highest numbered launch pad on CCAFS was Launch Complex 37; when the lunar launch complex was designed, it was designated as Launch Complex 39. It was designed to handle launches of the [[Saturn&amp;nbsp;V]] rocket, the largest, most powerful rocket then designed, which would propel Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. Initial plans included four pads (five were considered) evenly spaced {{convert|8700|ft|m}} apart to avoid damage in the event of an explosion on the pad. Three were scheduled for construction (A-C, to the southeast) and two (D and E, west and north) would have been built at a later date. The numbering of the pads at the time was from north to south, with the northernmost being 39A, and the southernmost being 39C. Pad 39A was never built, and 39C became 39A in 1963. With today's numbering, 39C would have been north of 39B, and 39D would have been due west of 39C. Pad 39E would have been due north of the mid-distance between 39C and 39D, with 39E forming the top of a triangle, and equidistant from 39C and 39D. The [[Crawlerway]] was built with the additional pads in mind. This is the reason the Crawlerway turns as it heads to Pad&amp;nbsp;B; continuing straight from that turn would have led to the additional pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Months before launch, the three stages of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle and the components of the [[Apollo spacecraft]] were brought inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and assembled in one of four high bays into a {{convert|363|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall space vehicle on one of three [[Mobile Launcher Platform|Mobile Launcher]]s. Each mobile launcher consisted of a two-story, {{convert|49|by|41|m|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} launch platform with four hold-down arms and a {{convert|136|m|ft|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) topped by a crane used to lift the spacecraft into position for assembly.

The Umbilical Tower contained two elevators and nine retractable swing arms which extended to the space vehicle, to provide access to each of the three rocket stages and the spacecraft for people, wiring and plumbing while the vehicle was on the launch pad, and swung away from the vehicle at launch.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swing Arm Engineer|url=http://enterfiringroom.ksc.nasa.gov/systemSwingArm.htm|publisher=NASA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107093952/http://enterfiringroom.ksc.nasa.gov/systemSwingArm.htm|archivedate=November 7, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technicians, engineers, and astronauts used the uppermost Spacecraft Access Arm to access the crew cabin.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transportation to the pad ====
When the stack integration was completed, it was moved the {{convert|3|–|4|mi|km}} to the pad at a speed of {{convert|1|mph|kph}} by one of two [[Crawler-Transporter]]s. Each crawler weighed {{convert|2720|MT|lb|order=flip}} and was capable of keeping the space vehicle on its Mobile Launcher level while negotiating a 5 percent grade to the pad. At the pad, the MLP was supported by six steel pedestals, plus four additional extensible columns.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"/&gt;

==== Mobile Service Structure ====
[[File:Saturn V and service structures.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Saturn V]] with fixed (left) and mobile (right) service structures]]
[[File:LC-39A walkway.jpg|thumb|200px|Apollo-era walkway and [[White room (spaceflight)|white room]], on display at [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]]]]
After the MLP was set in place, the Crawler-Transporter rolled a {{convert|125|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on|sp=us}}, {{convert|4760|MT|lb|order=flip|adj=on}} Mobile [[service structure|Service Structure]] (MSS) into place to provide further access for technicians to perform detailed checkout of the vehicle, and necessary umbillical connections to the pad. The MSS contained three elevators, two self-propelled platforms and three fixed platforms, and was rolled back {{convert|2100|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} to its parking position shortly before launch.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"/&gt;

==== Flame deflector ====
A flame deflector was slid on rails into place under the launch pedestal. This system allowed for rotation with a second flame deflector, after the first was refurbished after each launch. Each deflector measured {{convert|12|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} high by {{convert|15|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|23|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} long and weighed {{convert|635|MT|lb|order=flip|sp=us}}. It deflected the exhaust flame into a trench measuring {{convert|13|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} deep by {{convert|18|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|137|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} long.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"/&gt;

==== Launch control and fueling ====
The four-story [[Launch Control Center]] was located {{convert|5.6|km|mi|order=flip|sp=us}} away from Pad A, adjacent to the Vehicle Assembly Building for safety. The third floor had four firing rooms (corresponding to the four high bays in the VAB), each with 470 sets of control and monitoring equipment.{{when|date=April 2014}}&lt;!-- at what time in its long history did this apply? --&gt; The second floor contained telemetry, tracking, instrumentation, and data reduction computing equipment. The LCC was connected to the Mobile Launchers by a high speed data link, and during launch a system of 62 closed-circuit television cameras transmitted to 100 monitor screens in the LCC.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"/&gt;

Large cryogenic tanks located near the pads stored the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOX) for the second and third stages of the Saturn V. The highly explosive nature of these chemicals required numerous safety measures at the Launch Complex. The pads were located {{convert|2660|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} away from each other.&lt;ref name="Moonport_appendixb"/&gt; Before tanking operations began and during launch, non-essential personnel were excluded from the danger area.

==== Emergency evacuation system ====
Each pad had a {{convert|61|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on|sp=us}} evacuation tube running from the Mobile Launcher platform to a [[Rubber room (bunker)|blast-resistant bunker]] {{convert|12|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} underground, equipped with survival supplies for 20 persons for 24 hours. There was also a cab/slidewire system running from the {{convert|98|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on|sp=us}} tower level to evacuate astronauts and technicians {{convert|763|m|ft|order=flip|sp=us}} away from the pad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pad Terminal Connection Room ====
Connections between the [[Launch Control Center]], [[mobile launcher platform]] and space vehicle are made in the Pad Terminal Connection Room (PTCR). The facility was a two-story series of rooms beneath the launch pad, constructed of reinforced concrete located on the west side of the flame trench and was protected by up to {{convert| 20|ft}} of fill dirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/pad-term-connect-room.html|title=NASA – Pad Terminal Connection Room|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=John|title=Wings in Orbit: Scientific and Engineering Legacies of the Space Shuttle 1971–2010|isbn=978-0-16-086847-4|pages=82|authorlink=John Young (astronaut)|author2=Robert Crippen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The first use of LC-39 came in 1967 with the first Saturn&amp;nbsp;V launch, carrying the unmanned [[Apollo&amp;nbsp;4]] spacecraft. The second unmanned launch, [[Apollo&amp;nbsp;6]], also used Pad 39A. With the exception of [[Apollo&amp;nbsp;10]], which used Pad 39B (due to the "all-up" testing resulting in a 2-month turnaround period), all manned Apollo-Saturn&amp;nbsp;V launches, commencing with [[Apollo&amp;nbsp;8]], used Pad 39A.

A total of thirteen Saturn Vs were launched for Apollo, and the unmanned launch of the [[Skylab]] space station in 1973. The mobile launchers were then modified for the shorter [[Saturn IB]] rockets, by adding a "milk-stool" extension platform to the launch pedestal, so that the [[S-IVB]] upper stage and Apollo spacecraft swing arms would reach. These were used for three manned Skylab flights and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], since the Saturn IB pads 34 and 37 at Cape Canaveral AFB had been decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Space Shuttle===
{{Main|Space Shuttle program}}
The thrust to allow the Space Shuttle to achieve orbit was provided by a combination of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid Rocket Booster]]s (SRBs) and the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs). The SRBs used solid propellant, hence their name. The SSMEs used a combination of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) from the [[External Tank]]&amp;nbsp;(ET), as the orbiter did not have internal fuel tanks for the SSMEs (they would have had to be as large as the External Tank). The SRBs arrived in segments via rail car from their manufacturing facility in [[Utah]], the External Tank arrived from its manufacturing facility in [[Louisiana]] by barge, and the orbiter waited in the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] (OPF). The SRBs were first stacked in the VAB, and then the External Tank was mounted between them. Then, using a massive crane, the orbiter was lowered and connected to the External Tank.

Payload to be installed at the launch pad was independently transported in a payload transportation canister then installed vertically at the Payload Changeout Room. Otherwise, payloads would have already been pre-installed at the Orbiter Processing Facility and transported within the orbiter's cargo bay.

The original structure of the pads was remodeled for the needs of the Space Shuttle, starting with Pad 39A after the last Saturn&amp;nbsp;V launch, and in 1977 for Pad 39B after the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975.

&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="300px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Launch towers ====
Each pad contained a two-piece access tower system, the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) and the Rotating Service Structure (RSS). The FSS permitted access to the Shuttle via a retractable arm and a "beanie cap" to capture vented LOX from the External Tank. The RSS contained the Payload Changeout Room, which offered "clean" access to the orbiter's payload bay, protection from the elements, and protection in winds up to {{convert|60|kn|km/h}}.

The FSS on Pad 39A was constructed from most of the umbilical tower of Mobile Launcher 2, while the FSS that was on 39B was constructed from most of the umbilical tower of Mobile Launcher 3.

==== Sound suppression water system ====
A Sound Suppression Water System (SSWS) was added to protect the Space Shuttle and its payload from effects of the intense sound wave pressure generated by its engines. An elevated water tank on a {{convert|290|ft|m|adj=on}} tower near each pad stored 300,000 gallons (1.1&amp;nbsp;Megalitres) of water, which was released onto the Mobile Launcher Platform just before engine ignition.&lt;ref name="nasa_suppression_system"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/f_watertest.html|title=Sound Suppression System|accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water muffled the intense sound waves produced by the engines. Due to heating of the water, a large quantity of steam and water vapor was produced during launch.

====Swing arm modifications====
[[File:Launch Pad 39A KSC White Room Access Arm Walkway.jpg|thumb|200px|The doors to the White Room, which provided entry to the Shuttle crew compartment, are seen here at the end of the access arm walkway]]
The Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm positioned a hood, often called the "Beanie Cap," over the top of the External Tank (ET) nose cone during fueling.{{when|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- when was this modification made to the pad? --&gt; Heated gaseous nitrogen was used there to remove the extremely cold gaseous oxygen that normally vented out of the External Tank. This prevented the formation of ice that could fall and damage the shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA – External Tank (ET) Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/et-gaseous-O2-vent-arm.html |publisher=nasa.gov |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hydrogen Vent Line Access Arm mated the External Tank (ET) [[Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate]] (GUCP) to the launch pad hydrogen vent line. The GUCP provided support for plumbing and cables, called umbilicals, that transferred fluids, gases, and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment. While the ET was being fueled, hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank through the GUCP, out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance. Sensors at the GUCP measured gas level. The GUCP was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of [[STS-127]] and were also detected during attempts to launch [[STS-119]] and [[STS-133]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GUCP troubleshooting continues as MMT push for launch on June 17|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/06/sts-127-scrubbed-due-to-gucp-leak-launch-moves-to-net-june-17/|publisher=NASA Spaceflight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GUCP released from the ET at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames.

==== Emergency pad evacuation ====
[[File:Astroescape.jpg|thumb|200px|M113 armored personnel carriers parked near LC-39]]
In an emergency, the launch complex used a slidewire escape basket system for quick evacuation. Assisted by members of the closeout team, the crew would leave the orbiter and ride an emergency basket to the ground at speeds reaching up to {{convert|55|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="astronaut_rescue_drill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/ft_shuttle_training_041203.html|title=SPACE.com – NASA Conducts Shuttle Astronaut Rescue Drill|accessdate=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, the crew took shelter in a bunker. A modified [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier]] could carry injured astronauts away from the complex to safety.&lt;ref name="astronaut_evacuation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/journals/space/lohning/|title=NASA Field Journal by Greg Lohning|accessdate=2008-11-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204045450/http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/journals/space/lohning/|archivedate=February 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the launch of Discovery on [[STS-124]] on May&amp;nbsp;31, 2008, the pad at LC-39A suffered extensive damage, in particular to the concrete trench used to deflect the SRB's flames.&lt;ref name="damage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/080602-sts124-pad39a-damage.html#comments|title=NASA Eyes Launch Pad Damage for Next Shuttle Flight|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent mishap investigation found that the damage was the result of carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors which held the [[refractory brick]]s in the trench in place. These had been exacerbated by the fact that [[hydrochloric acid]] is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pbma.nasa.gov/docs/public/pbma/images/msm/STS-124FlameTrench_SFCS.pdf | title=Hit the Bricks | journal=System Failure Case Studies | publisher=NASA | date=August 2010 | volume=4 | issue=8 | pages=1–4 | author=Lilley, Steve K. | accessdate=July 20, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928091534/http://pbma.nasa.gov/docs/public/pbma/images/msm/STS-124FlameTrench_SFCS.pdf | archivedate=September 28, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space Shuttle launches====
After the launch of [[Skylab]] in 1973, Pad 39A was reconfigured for the Space Shuttle, with shuttle launches beginning in 1981 with [[STS-1]], flown by the {{OV|102}}.&lt;ref

After the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, 39B was reconfigured similarly to 39A, but due to additional modifications (mainly to allow the facility to service a modified [[Centaur (rocket)|Centaur-G]] upper stage), along with budgetary restraints, it was not ready until 1986, and the first shuttle flight to use it was [[STS-51-L]], which ended with the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]. The first return to flight mission [[STS-26]] launched from 39B.

=== Constellation Program and Pad 39B ===

[[File:Ares I-X launch 08.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ares I-X launches from LC-39B, 15:30 UTC, October&amp;nbsp;28, 2009]]
The last Shuttle launch from Pad 39B was the nighttime launch of [[STS-116]] on December 9, 2006. To support the final Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope [[STS-125]] launched from Pad 39A in May 2009, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' was placed on 39B if needed to launch the [[STS-400]] rescue mission.

After the completion of [[STS-125]], 39B was converted for the single test flight of the ''Constellation Program'' [[Ares&amp;nbsp;I-X]] from Pad 39B on October&amp;nbsp;28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/10/pad-39b-suffers-substantial-damage-ares-i-x-parachute-update/|title=Pad 39B suffers substantial damage from Ares I-X launch – Parachute update {{!}} NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program was later cancelled.

===2011–2013===
With the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011,&lt;ref name=bw20101028&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_45/b4202066178314.htm?campaign_id=mag_Oct28&amp;link_position=link23 NASA: Lost in Space], ''[[Business Week]]'', 2010-10-28, accessed 2010-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the cancellation of [[Constellation Program]] in 2010, the future of the LC-39 pads was uncertain.
By early 2011, NASA began informal discussions on use of the pads and facilities by [[private spaceflight|private companies]] to fly missions for the commercial space market,&lt;ref name=ft20110206&gt;
{{cite news |last=Dean|first=James |title=Up for grabs?

====Pad 39A====
Just like the first 24 shuttle flights, Pad 39A supported the final manifested shuttle flights, starting with [[STS-117]] in June 2007 until the retirement of the shuttle fleet in July 2011. Prior to the SpaceX lease agreement, the pad remained as it was when Atlantis launched on the final shuttle mission on July 8, 2011, complete with a [[mobile launcher platform]].
[[File:PAD 39A lease announcement.jpg|thumb|right|KSC Director [[Robert D. Cabana|Bob Cabana]] announces the signing of the pad 39A lease agreement on April 14, 2014. [[SpaceX]] COO [[Gwynne Shotwell]] stands nearby.]]

In 1997 the pad was the proposed as the site of the first machine for the film [[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Talks for use of the pad were underway between NASA and [[Space Florida]]—the [[State of Florida]]'s [[economic development agency]]—as early as 2011, but no deal materialized by 2012 and NASA then pursued other options for removing the pad from the Federal government inventory.&lt;ref name=nsf20141117/&gt;

By early 2013, NASA publicly announced that it would allow commercial launch providers to lease Pad 39A,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaspace.com/?p=30313 "NASA not abandoning LC-39A" January 17, 2013], accessed February 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
and followed that, in May 2013, with a formal solicitation for proposals for [[private spaceflight|commercial use]] of Launch Pad 39A.&lt;ref name=nsw20130520&gt;[http://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/nasa-requests-proposals-for-commercial-use-of-pad-39a.html NASA requests proposals for commercial use of Pad 39A], ''NewSpace Watch'', May 20, 2013, accessed May 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
There were two competing bids for the commercial use of the launch complex.&lt;ref name=leasedoc/&gt; [[SpaceX]] submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex, while [[Jeff Bezos]]' [[Blue Origin]] submitted a bid for shared non-exclusive use of the complex such that the launchpad would interface with multiple vehicles, and costs could be shared over the long term. One potential shared user in the Blue Origin plan was [[United Launch Alliance]].&lt;ref name=os20130818&gt;

"The [solicitation] document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility."&lt;ref name=pa20131212&gt;

[[Elon Musk]], CEO of SpaceX, has stated that he wants to shift most of their NASA launches to Pad 39A, including [[Commercial Resupply Services|Commercial Cargo]] and [[Commercial Crew Development|Crew]] missions to the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=padnego/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1312/12gao/#.UrhmtbSTJe4|title=GAO decision opens door for commercial lease of pad 39A|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=December 12, 2013|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=December 23, 2013|quote=Musk said he wants to launch SpaceX's commercial cargo and crew missions to the International Space Station from launch pad 39A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SpaceX launch history ====
While [[SLC-40]] was undergoing reconstruction after the loss of the [[AMOS-6]] satellite, all SpaceX's east coast launches were launched from LC-39A until SLC-40 became operational again in December 2017. On May 1, 2017, [[NROL]]-76 was the first SpaceX mission for the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] with a classified payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/03/spacex-falcon-9-echostar-23-slc-40-return/ |title=SpaceX Static Fires Falcon 9 for EchoStar 23 launch as SLC-40 targets return |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=March 9, 2017 |access-date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  February 6, 2018, LC-39A hosted the successful liftoff of the Falcon Heavy on its [[Falcon Heavy Test Flight|maiden launch]], carrying [[Elon Musk]]'s [[Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster|Tesla Roadster]] car to space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/06/technology/future/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-mainbar/index.html|title=SpaceX launches Falcon Heavy, the world's most powerful rocket|last=Wattles|first=Jackie|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Future flights ====
Future notable missions include:

* [[SpX-DM1|Demonstration Mission 1 (DM-1)]] with the [[Dragon 2]] spacecraft. Currently planned for launch in January 2019.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/|title=Schedule- Spaceflight Now – Spaceflight Now|website=spaceflightnow.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the first launch of this vehicle, and will be unmanned.
* A second Dragon 2 mission, [[SpX-DM2|Demonstration Mission 2 (DM-2)]] scheduled for June 2019 will launch the first crewed mission from LC-39A and the United States since [[STS-135]].
* The second Falcon Heavy flight is set to launch from this pad carrying the Arabsat 6A communications satellite for Arabsat of Saudi Arabia. The satellite is to provide Ku-band and Ka-band communication services over the Middle East and Northern Africa regions, as well as a small bit for South Africa. The launch is set to be in the first half of 2019.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
* The third flight of the Falcon Heavy is set to launch from this pad carrying the U.S. Air Force's [[Space Test Program]]-2 (STP-2) with a cluster of military and scientific research satellites. The launch is set to happen in the first half of 2019.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

SpaceX intends to utilize the [[Fixed Service Structure]] (FSS) of the Pad 39A [[#Launch towers|launch towers]], and will extend it above its existing {{convert|350|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} height, but will not need the [[Rotating Service Structure]] (RSS) and thus will remove it. Initial plans in 2014 called for leaving the RSS in place until after the first [[Falcon Heavy]] launch.&lt;ref name=nsf20141117/&gt; However, plans were changed since then, and work on RSS takedown began in February 2016.&lt;ref name=ses20141021&gt;{{cite web |title=SES-9 |work=SES |url=http://www.ses.com/ses-9 |publisher=SES |date=October 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021043414/http://www.ses.com/ses-9 |archive-date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch Pad 39B===
[[File:KSC SLC-39B September 2017.jpg|thumb|Launch Complex 39B as seen from aerial survey in September 2017|325px]]
Since the Ares I-X flight, NASA proceeded with plans to strip Pad 39B of its Flight Service Structure (FSS), returning the location to an Apollo-like "clean pad" design for the first time since 1977. This approach will make the pad available to multiple types of vehicles which arrive at the pad with service structures on the mobile launcher platform as opposed to custom structures on the pad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic space shuttle pad soon to be scrap|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2011-03-23-shuttle-launch-pad_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, LOX, and water tanks (used for the sound suppression system) are the only structures left from the Space Shuttle era.&lt;ref name=nsf20150322&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bergin|first1=Chris |title=KSC Pads continue preparations for future vehicles |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/03/ksc-pads-preparations-future-vehicles/ |accessdate=24 March 2015 |work=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=2015-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sound"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html|title=Sound Suppression System|accessdate=September 30, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2006|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts127/status.html |title=STS-127 Rollaround starts |accessdate=2009-05-31 |publisher=Space Flight Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2012|6}}, repairs and modifications to selected facility systems at Launch Complex (LC) 39B for [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) processing and launch operations are finishing the first phase of a five-phase project. The second phase of this project is currently budgeted at $89.2 million ($6.1 million in FY 2012, $28.5 million in FY 2013, $9.4 million in FY 2014 and $45.2 million in the outyears).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/632670main_NASA_FY13_Budget_CECR-508.pdf |title=NASA FY13 Budget |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|4|16}}&lt;!-- so what actually happened in late-2012 thru mid-2014? --&gt;
In March 2015, Pad 39B was undergoing modifications to the Catacomb Roof structure so that it can handle the loads from the SLS Block 1B rocket, increasing the load capacity to support the crawler-transporter and vertical rocket from {{convert|21000000| to |25500000|lb}}.&lt;ref name=nsf20150322/&gt;

In 2014, NASA announced that it would make Pad 39B available to commercial users during times when it is not needed by the Space Launch System.&lt;ref name=sfn20140415/&gt; {{asof|2017|05}}, NASA has one SLS mission scheduled in 2019, and a second one in 2021.&lt;ref name=sfn20140415/&gt;

===Launch Pad 39C===
Launch Pad 39C is a new facility for [[Small-lift launch vehicle|smaller launch vehicles]] built in 2015 within the Launch Complex 39B perimeter.

====Construction====

Construction of the pad began in January 2015 and was completed in June 2015. [[Kennedy Space Center]] Director [[Robert D. Cabana]] and representatives from the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program and the Center Planning and Development (CPD) and Engineering Directorates marked the completion of the new pad during a ribbon-cutting ceremony July 17, 2015.

"As America's premier spaceport, we're always looking for new and innovative ways to meet America's launch needs, and one area that was missing was small class [[payloads]]," [[Robert D. Cabana]] said. "Using 21st Century funds, we built Pad 39C."&lt;ref name="lc39C"/&gt;

GSDO oversaw the project and is working with CPD to grow commercial space efforts at Kennedy.&lt;ref name="lc39C"/&gt;

"Pad 39C is the latest addition to our portfolio of launch pads," said Scott Colloredo, CPD director. "The small class market is here. The demand for that kind of launcher is increasing. The key here is this is really what a launch site for a small class launcher needs to look like."&lt;ref name="lc39C"/&gt;

The concrete pad measures about {{convert|50|feet|m}} wide by about {{convert|100|feet|m}} long and could support the combined weight of a fueled [[launch vehicle]], [[payload]] and customer-provided launch mount up to about {{convert|132,000|lbs|kg}}, and an umbilical tower structure, fluid lines, cables and umbilical arms weighing up to about {{convert|47,000|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref name="lc39C"/&gt;

GSDO also developed a universal propellant servicing system to provide liquid oxygen and [[liquid methane]] fueling capabilities for a variety of small class rockets.&lt;ref name="lc39C"/&gt;

"This is absolutely great to designate a new pad within the confines of Pad 39B. I'm looking forward to having customers here in the not too distant future, making use of this outstanding facility," [[Robert D. Cabana]] said&lt;ref name="lc39C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-launch-pad-will-enable-smaller-companies-to-develop-and-launch-rockets-from-kennedy|title= New Launch Pad will Enable Smaller Companies to Develop and Launch Rockets from Kennedy|accessdate=July 18, 2015|publisher=[[NASA]]|year=2015|author=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capabilities====

KSC's newest Launch Pad, designated 39C, is designed to accommodate Small Class Vehicles. Located in the southeast area of the Launch Complex 39B perimeter, this new concrete pad measures about {{convert|50|feet|m}} wide by about {{convert|100|feet|m}} long. Launch Complex 39C will serve as a multi-purpose site allowing companies to test vehicles and capabilities in the smaller class of rockets, making it more affordable for smaller companies to break into the commercial spaceflight market.

As part of this capability,  NASA's Ground Systems Development and Operations Program developed a universal propellant servicing system, which can provide liquid oxygen and liquid methane fueling capabilities for a variety of small class rockets. This system is slated for operational readiness in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref name="lc39C" /&gt;

With the addition of Launch Complex 39C, KSC can offer the following processing and launching features for companies working with small class vehicles (maximum thrust up to {{convert|200,000|lbf|kN}}):&lt;ref name="lc39C-2" /&gt;
*Processing facilities – i.e. [[Vehicle Assembly Building]]
*Vehicle/payload transportation ([[KAMAG]], [[flatbed trucks]], tugs, etc.) from integration facility to pad
*Launch site
*Universal propellant servicing system (LOX, LCH4)
*[[Launch control center]]/mobile command center options.&lt;ref name="lc39C-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kscpartnerships.ksc.nasa.gov/Partnering-Opportunities/Capabilities-and-Testing/Physical-Assets/Launch-Complex-39C|title= Launch Complex 39C|accessdate=July 18, 2015|publisher=[[NASA]]|year=2015|author=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future development===
Kennedy Space Center (KSC) previous Master Plan recommendations in 1966, 1972, and 1977, noted that an expansion of KSC's vertical launch capacity could occur when the market demand existed.  The 2007 Site Evaluation Study recommended an additional vertical launch pad, Launch Complex 49 (LC-49), to be sited to the north of existing LC-39B.  
As part of the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) process, this area was consolidated from two pads (formerly designated in 1963 plans as 39-C and 39-D) to one that provides greater separation from LC-39B.  The area was expanded to accommodate a wider variety of launch azimuths, helping protect against potential overflight concerns of LC-39B.  
This LC-49 launch facility could accommodate medium to large class launch vehicles.&lt;ref name=2007_KSCPlan&gt;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://masterplan.ksc.nasa.gov/Future-State/Future-Land-Use/Vertical-Launch |title=Vertical Launch |publisher=NASA |access-date=4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 Vertical Launch Site Evaluation Study concluded that a vertical launch pad could also be sited to the south of 39A and to the north of pad 41 to accommodate small/medium launch vehicles.  Designated as Launch Complex 48 (LC-48), this area is best suited to accommodate small to medium class launch vehicles due to its closer proximity to LC-39A and LC-41.  Due to the nature of these activities, QD arcs, launch hazard impact limit lines, other safety setback, and exposure limits requirements will be imposed for safe operations.&lt;ref name=2007_KSCPlan/&gt; The Proposed Launchpads where published in the Kennedy Space Center Master Plan in 2012.

The Master Plan also notes a New Vertical Launchpad northwest of LC-39B and a Horizontal Launch Area north of the LC-49 and converting the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and it apron areas into a (2nd) Horizontal Launch Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://masterplan.ksc.nasa.gov/-/media/Master%20Plan/Future%20Land%20Use%20Map%20Stretched_Final.ashx|title=Kennedy Space Center Master Plan Map by Nasa|last=|first=|date=August 1, 2017|website=masterplan.ksc.nasa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2007_KSCPlan" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6782">'''Konstantinos Tsioulkas''' (1845 - 1915) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] educator and writer from [[West Macedonia|Western Macedonia]].

== Biography ==
Tsioulkas was born in 1845 in Gorenchi (now Koresos), [[Kastoria]]. Most of the inhabitants of the village had a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] first language, but Tsioulkas spoke Greek as his first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation from the main school of his village he continued his studies with a scholarship in the Educational Association of Kastoria in the Gymnasium of Kasoria and then he taught in the "Greek school" of his birthplace. He opposed the attempts of the [[Exarchists]] to hold the [[Divine Liturgy]] in Bulgarian&lt;ref name="Dragati"&gt;{{harvnb|Δραγάτη|2010|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1871 he succeeded together with others to drive Konstantinos Darzilovites, who, according to Tsioulkas, was the first to teach the Slavic speakers that they were [[Bulgarians]], off Gorenchi, just before a Bulgarian school was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875 he was sent with a scholarship from [[Konstantinos Bellios|Bellios]] a bequest in [[Athens]], where he studied in the Philosophic School of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|National University]]. In 1879 he went to [[Bitola|Monastiri (Bitola)]], where he became the first [[gymnasiarch]] of the Greek gymnasium for a decade, until 1889, when he was fired because of the events relating to [[Anastasios Pichion|Pichion]].&lt;ref name="Dragati"/&gt;

==''Contributions to the bilingualism of the Macedonians''==
[[File:Simvolai_Eis_Tin_Siglossan_Ton_Makedonon_1.png|thumb|317x317px|The first edition of the ''Contributions'' of Tsioulkas (Athens: Petrakos, 1907).]]
In 1907 he published in Athens a 350-page work of his ''Contributions to the bilingualism of the Macedonians by comparing the Slavic-seeming Macedonian language with the Greek one'' ("Συμβολαί εις την διγλωσσίαν των Μακεδόνων εκ συγκρίσεως της σλαυοφανούς μακεδονικής γλώσσης προς την ελληνικήν"),&lt;ref name="Tsioulkas"&gt;{{harvnb|Τσιούλκας|1907|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to fight against the [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavist]] propaganda in the [[region of Macedonia]]. Tsioulkas, who claimed not to speak any Slavic language, tried by distorting [[historical linguistics]] to prove that the language of the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia]] wasn't Bulgarian, but an [[Ancient Greek dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=4}}, {{harvnb|Ioannidou|1999|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsioulkas didn't focus on [[phonology]], [[syntax]], or [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for which he only devoted 11 pages in total,&lt;ref name="Mackridge 2011 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mainly on the [[vocabulary]], where it is easy to find words with common, [[Indoeuropean|Indo-European]], etymology with Greek, in order to show that the basic elements of the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] vocabulary weren't Slavic, but originated from Greek.&lt;ref name="Mac2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2009|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove that the language of the Slavophones was closer to Ancient Greek than Modern Greek, he composed a list of homeric words and compared how many of them survive in the "people's" language, meaning demotic, (650) and how many in the "Slavic-seeming Macedonian" (1260).&lt;ref name="Mackridge 2011 5"/&gt; The conclusion, for Tsioulkas, was that the "Slavic-seeming Macedonian [language] was a sister of the Greek [language]" and the "Macedonian people" was native and descended from the Ancient Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Antiscience|anti-scientific]] book was the most important in a series of pseudo-linguistic publications that appeared in Greece from the beginning to the middle of the 20th century, whose writers without knowing the dialects they were writing about maintained that the "mixed" or "Slavic-seeming" dialects of the Slavophones weren't Slavic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ioannidou|1999|pp=56–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Greek linguist supported Tsioulkas' theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the book was republished in 1991, during the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], without negative commentary, but with a commendatory exordium of the former minister [[Nikolaos Martis]].&lt;ref name="Mac2009"/&gt; The book is still in circulation today{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and references to it continue to appear online, resulting in Tsioulkas having unwittingly contributed to the idea that modern [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] are descended from [[Ancient Macedonians]] and are their true inheritors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2011|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lab(s) website''' is a specific type of [[website]] most commonly dedicated to research and development programs.

Relating to the classic scientific research environment - the [[laboratory]] - existing lab websites predominantly fall into two categories, the real-world and the virtual.

==Real-world laboratory websites==
Real-world lab sites relate to the activities and research conducted by laboratories existing outside the Internet. In general, these sites tend to offer users a chance to see results of past research, rather than detailed views of contemporary research.

Examples of these types of labs from the aviation world include [[Boeing Phantom Works|Boeing’s Phantom Works]], which covers the research arm of the Boeing Corporation, and Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Program, aka [[Skunk Works]].

==Virtual laboratory websites==
A number of companies and institutions have created virtual lab websites specifically for research into Internet-based products. 

This type of research environment is seen as both podium and playpen for Internet-borne companies. In many cases, the labs offer visitors a chance to learn more about the company's products currently in development, and increasingly, to actually trial the work in progress. 

One of the best-known examples is [[Google Labs]]. Since its inception, Google Labs has resulted in the trial and launch of live products such as [[Gmail]], [[Google Calendar]] and [[Google Videos]].

Similar examples from large web-based companies include [[Yahoo! Next]] and [[Microsoft Live Labs]].

One recent notable addition is Digg Labs, illustrating the [[Digg]] [[social bookmarking]] community's activities in near real-time. The labs are composed of the swarm and the stack activity displays.

[[Mozilla]] has added a lab area to its product offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | url = https://mozillalabs.com/
  | title = Mozilla Labs
  | accessdate = 2010-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual laboratories are not the sole domain of companies and institutions.  Some are created by individuals and exist solely as [[websites]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Media labs==

Traditional print and broadcast media companies have also begun to experiment with dedicating specific areas on their websites to advanced projects. One of the first companies credited with creating its own lab area was [[Reuters]]. When founded, the Reuters lab offered a limited number of products for visitors to experiment with, including the news and quotes widget and their mobile service.

The [[BBC]] has created a derivation on the lab idea with their [[BBC Backstage]] site. Backstage's slogan "Use our stuff to build your stuff" openly invites developers to use the BBC's various feeds and API's to power a new range of non-commercial products and services. The backstage site has allowed the BBC to create a developer network, a location for all those working with the BBC's content to come together and share their  ideas and prototypes amongst their peers. The site also contains a blog. 

''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in the UK has taken the idea of a lab to the next level with its [[Comment is free]] product. Created by [[Ben Hammersley]], Comment is Free was made as a fully interactive extension to the [[Guardian Unlimited]]’s blogging system.  

The site contains the political and opinion material from both ''The Guardian'' and its sister paper ''[[The Observer]]'', as well as work from over 600 separate subject-based experts, selected to write on their topics of knowledge. Users are encouraged to read and comment, and all posts are automatically linked to [[Technorati]] to return contextual blogosphere results.

In November 2006, NEWS.com.au, the breaking news section of News Digital Media launched News Lab, the first media-driven R&amp;D website within News Corporation (N.B. News Corp also operates [[Fox Interactive Media|FIM Lab]] but this is currently without a website). The site aims to collect users' feedback on new products and amend them accordingly.

==Monitoring experimentation==

While some media companies choose to create their own experimental areas, others create dedicated areas to document the efforts of others. ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s blog section, referred to as the Mashington Post records the efforts of Internet users' experimentation with combinations of pre-existing data, referred to as [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3201">Computer [[software]] for '''computer-assisted organic synthesis''' ('''CAOS''') is used in [[organic chemistry]] and [[computational chemistry]] to facilitate the tasks of designing and predicting [[chemical reaction]]s. The CAOS problem reduces to identifying a series of chemical reactions which can, from starting materials, produce a desired target [[molecule]]. CAOS algorithms typically use two [[database]]s: a first one of known chemical reactions and a second one of known starting materials (i.e., typically molecules available commercially). Desirable synthetic plans cost less, have high yield, and avoid using hazardous reactions and intermediates. Typically cast as a planning problem, significant progress has been made in CAOS.

The following table lists the abilities of the most versatile software packages that show an entry in two or more columns of the table.&lt;!-- This sounds as if someone is about to make this linear list into some sort of table, so the phrasing is left intact. --&gt;

[[Food additive]]s are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste, appearance, or other qualities.

==Purposes==

Additives are used for many purposes but the main uses are:

;Acids : [[Food acid]]s are added to make flavors "sharper", and also act as preservatives and antioxidants. Common food acids include [[vinegar]], [[citric acid]], [[tartaric acid]], [[malic acid]], [[folic acid]], [[fumaric acid]], and [[lactic acid]].
;Acidity regulators : [[Acidity regulator]]s are used to change or otherwise control the acidity and [[alkaline|alkalinity]] of foods.
;Anticaking agents : [[Anticaking agent]]s keep powders such as milk powder from caking or sticking.
;Antifoaming agents : [[Antifoaming agent]]s reduce or prevent foaming in foods.
;Antioxidants : [[Antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin C]] act as preservatives by inhibiting the effects of [[oxygen]] on food, and can be beneficial to health.
;Bulking agents : [[Bulking agent]]s such as [[starch]] are additives that increase the bulk of a food without affecting its nutritional value.
;Food coloring : [[Food coloring|Colorings]] are added to food to replace colors lost during preparation, or to make food look more attractive.
;Color retention agents : In contrast to colorings, [[color retention agent]]s are used to preserve a food's existing color.
;Emulsifiers : [[Emulsifier]]s allow water and oils to remain mixed together in an [[emulsion]], as in [[mayonnaise]], [[ice cream]], and homogenized [[milk]].
;Flavors : [[Flavor]]s are additives that give food a particular taste or smell, and may be derived from natural ingredients or created artificially.
;Flavor enhancers : [[Flavor enhancer]]s enhance a food's existing flavors. They may be extracted from natural sources (through [[distillation]], [[solvent extraction]], [[maceration (food)|maceration]], among other methods) or created artificially.
;Flour treatment agents : [[Flour treatment agent]]s are added to [[flour]] to improve its color or its use in [[baking]].
;Glazing agents: [[Glazing agent]]s provide a shiny appearance or protective coating to foods.
;Humectants : [[Humectant]]s prevent foods from drying out.
;Tracer gas: [[Tracer-gas leak testing method|Tracer gas]] allow for package integrity testing to prevent foods from being exposed to atmosphere, thus guaranteeing shelf life.
;Preservatives : [[Preservative]]s prevent or inhibit spoilage of food due to [[fungi]], [[bacterium|bacteria]] and other [[microorganism]]s.
;Stabilizers : [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|Stabilizer]]s, thickeners and gelling agents, like [[agar]] or [[pectin]] (used in [[jam]] for example) give foods a firmer texture. While they are not true [[emulsifier]]s, they help to stabilize [[emulsion]]s.
;Sweeteners : [[Sweeteners]] are added to foods for flavoring. Sweeteners other than [[sugar]] are added to keep the [[food energy]] ([[calorie]]s) low, or because they have beneficial effects for [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[tooth decay]] and [[diarrhea]].
;Thickeners : [[Thickener]]s are substances which, when added to the mixture, increase its [[viscosity]] without substantially modifying its other properties.

[[Caffeine]] and other [[Generally recognized as safe|GRAS]] (generally recognized as safe) additives such as [[sugar]] and
[[salt]] are not required to go through the regulation process.

{{War}}
'''Military engineering''' is loosely defined as the art, science, and practice of designing and building military works and maintaining lines of [[military transport]] and [[military communications]]. Military engineers are also responsible for [[logistics]] behind military tactics. Modern military engineering differs from [[civil engineering]]. In the 20th and 21st centuries, military engineering also includes other engineering disciplines such as mechanical and electrical engineering techniques.&lt;ref name="military engineering"&gt;{{cite web|title=military engineering|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/382334/military-engineering|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|accessdate=13 February 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[NATO]], "military engineering is that engineer activity undertaken, regardless of component or service, to shape the physical operating environment. Military engineering incorporates support to maneuver and to the force as a whole, including military engineering functions such as engineer support to force protection, counter-improvised explosive devices, environmental protection, engineer intelligence and military search. Military engineering does not encompass the activities undertaken by those 'engineers' who maintain, repair and operate vehicles, vessels, aircraft, weapon systems and equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MC 0560 "MILITARY COMMITTEE POLICY FOR MILITARY ENGINEERING"|author=NATO publication|date=1 April 2008|publisher=NATO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military engineering is an academic subject taught in [[military academies]] or [[School of Military Engineering (disambiguation)|schools of military engineering]]. The construction and demolition tasks related to military engineering are usually performed by military engineers including [[soldier]]s trained as [[sapper]]s or [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Crossbow to H-bomb|author=Bernard Brodie, Fawn McKay Brodie|year=1973 |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-20161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern armies, soldiers trained to perform such tasks while well forward in battle and under fire are often called [[combat engineer]]s.

In some countries, military engineers may also perform non-military construction tasks in peacetime such as [[flood control]] and river navigation works, but such activities do not fall within the scope of military engineering.

==Etymology==
The word ''engineer'' was initially used in the context of warfare, dating back to 1325 when ''engine’er'' (literally, one who operates an engine) referred to "a constructor of military engines".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, "engine" referred to a military machine, i. e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]).

As the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings developed as a technical discipline, the term ''[[civil engineering]]''&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineers' Council for Professional Development definition on Encyclopædia Britannica] (Includes Britannica article on Engineering)&lt;/ref&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline. As the prevalence of civil engineering outstripped engineering in a military context and the number of disciplines expanded, the original military meaning of the word "engineering" is now largely obsolete. In its place, the term "military engineering" has come to be used.

==History==
[[File:MulberryB - Piers.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of [[Mulberry harbour]] "B" (27 October 1944)]]

The first civilization to have a dedicated force of military engineering specialists were the Romans, whose army contained a dedicated corps of military engineers known as [[Roman military engineering|''architecti'']]. This group was pre-eminent among its contemporaries. The scale of certain military engineering feats, such as the construction of a double-wall of fortifications {{convert|30|mi|km}} long, in just 6 weeks to completely encircle the besieged city of Alesia in 52 B.C.E., is an example. Such military engineering feats would have been completely new, and probably bewildering and demoralizing, to the Gallic defenders. The best known of these Roman army engineers due to his writings surviving is [[Vitruvius]].

In ancient times, military engineers were responsible for [[siege warfare]] and building field [[fortifications]], temporary camps and roads. The most notable engineers of ancient times were the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[China|Chinese]], who constructed huge siege-machines (catapults, [[battering rams]] and [[siege tower]]s). The Romans were responsible for constructing [[Castra|fortified wooden camps]] and paved roads for their [[Roman legion|legions]]. Many of these [[Roman road]]s are still in use today.

For 500 years after the [[fall of the Roman empire]], the practice of military engineering barely evolved in the west. In fact, much of the classic techniques and practices of Roman military engineering were lost. Through this period, the foot soldier (who was pivotal to much of the Roman military engineering capability) was largely replaced by mounted soldiers. It was not until later in the [[Middle Ages]], that military engineering saw a revival focused on siege warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Forces Publication, A-JS-007-003/JD-001 Customs and Traditions of the Canadian Military Engineers. 30 June 2003 [http://www.cmea-agmc.ca/redbook/CME_Customs_e.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military engineers planned castles and fortresses. When laying siege, they planned and oversaw efforts to penetrate castle defenses. When [[castle]]s served a military purpose, one of the tasks of the [[sapper]]s was to weaken the bases of walls to enable them to be breached before means of thwarting these activities were devised. Broadly speaking, sappers were experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems.

[[File:Royal Military Artificers working dress 1795.jpg|left|thumb|Working dress of the [[Soldier Artificer Company|Royal Military Artificers]] in Gibraltar, 1795]]
With the 14th-century development of [[gunpowder]], new [[siege engine]]s in the form of [[cannon]]s appeared. Initially military engineers were responsible for maintaining and operating these new weapons just as had been the case with previous siege engines. In England, the challenge of managing the new technology resulted in the creation of the [[Board of Ordnance|Office of Ordnance]] around 1370 in order to administer the cannons, armaments and castles of the kingdom. Both military engineers and [[artillery]] formed the body of this organization and served together until the office's predecessor, the Board of Ordnance was disbanded in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Museum |first=Royal Engineers |title=Corps History – Part 2 |url=http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part2.htm |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204084632/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part2.htm |archivedate=4 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to older weapons, the cannon was significantly more effective against traditional [[medieval fortification]]s. Military engineering significantly revised the way fortifications were built in order to be better protected from enemy direct and plunging shot. The new fortifications were also intended to increase the ability of defenders to bring fire onto attacking enemies. Fort construction proliferated in 16th-century Europe based on the ''[[trace italienne]]'' design.&lt;ref&gt;Langins, Janis.

[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema 12.jpeg|thumb|French sappers during the [[Battle of Berezina]] in 1812]]
By the 18th century, regiments of foot (infantry) in the British, French, Prussian and other armies included pioneer detachments. In peacetime these specialists constituted the regimental tradesmen, constructing and repairing buildings, transport wagons, etc. On active service they moved at the head of marching columns with axes, shovels, and pickaxes, clearing obstacles or building bridges to enable the main body of the regiment to move through difficult terrain. The modern [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] and [[French Foreign Legion]] still maintain pioneer sections who march at the front of ceremonial parades, carrying chromium-plated tools intended for show only. Other historic distinctions include long work aprons and the right to wear beards.

The [[Peninsular War]] (1808–14) revealed deficiencies in the training and knowledge of officers and men of the [[British Army]] in the conduct of siege operations and bridging. During this war low-ranking [[Royal Engineers]] officers carried out large-scale operations. They had under their command working parties of two or three battalions of infantry, two or three thousand men, who knew nothing in the art of siegeworks. [[Royal Engineers]] officers had to demonstrate the simplest tasks to the soldiers, often while under enemy fire. Several officers were lost and could not be replaced, and a better system of training for siege operations was required. On 23 April 1812 an establishment was authorised, by Royal Warrant, to teach "Sapping, Mining, and other Military Fieldworks" to the junior officers of the Corps of [[Royal Engineers]] and the Corps of Royal Military Artificers, Sappers and Miners.

The first courses at the [[Royal Engineers]] Establishment were done on an all ranks basis with the greatest regard to economy. To reduce staff the NCOs and officers were responsible for instructing and examining the soldiers. If the men could not read or write they were taught to do so, and those who could read and write were taught to draw and interpret simple plans. The Royal Engineers Establishment quickly became the centre of excellence for all fieldworks and bridging. Captain [[Charles Pasley]], the director of the Establishment, was keen to confirm his teaching, and regular exercises were held as demonstrations or as experiments to improve the techniques and teaching of the Establishment. From 1833 bridging skills were demonstrated annually by the building of a pontoon bridge across the [[Medway]] which was tested by the infantry of the garrison and the cavalry from [[Maidstone]]. These demonstrations had become a popular spectacle for the local people by 1843, when 43,000 came to watch a field day laid on to test a method of assaulting earthworks for a report to the Inspector General of Fortifications. In 1869 the title of the Royal Engineers Establishment was changed to "The School of Military Engineering" (SME) as evidence of its status, not only as the font of engineer doctrine and training for the [[British Army]], but also as the leading scientific military school in Europe.
[[File:Baileys Bridge in Korea.jpg| thumb| A [[Bailey bridge]] being deployed in the [[Korean War]] to replace a bridge destroyed in combat.]]

The dawn of the [[internal combustion engine]] marked the beginning of a significant change in military engineering. With the arrival of the [[History of the automobile|automobile]] at the end of the 19th century and [[Aviation history#Heavier than air|heavier than air flight]] at the start of the 20th century, military engineers assumed a major new role in supporting the movement and deployment of these systems in war. Military engineers gained vast knowledge and experience in [[explosive]]s. They were tasked with planting bombs, [[land mine|landmines]] and [[dynamite]].

At the end of [[World War I]], the standoff on the Western Front caused the [[Imperial German Army]] to gather experienced and particularly skilled soldiers to form "Assault Teams" which would break through the Allied trenches. With enhanced training and special weapons (such as [[flamethrower]]s), these squads achieved some success, but too late to change the outcome of the war. In early WWII, however, the [[Wehrmacht]] "Pioniere" battalions proved their efficiency in both attack and defense, somewhat inspiring other armies to develop their own combat engineers battalions. Notably, the attack on Fort [[Eben-Emael]] in Belgium was conducted by Luftwaffe [[military glider|glider]]-deployed combat engineers.

The need to defeat the German defensive positions of the "[[Atlantic wall]]" as part of the amphibious landings in Normandy in 1944 led to the development of specialist combat engineer vehicles. These, collectively known as [[Hobart's Funnies]], included a specific vehicle to carry combat engineers, the [[Churchill tank|Churchill AVRE]]. These and other dedicated assault vehicles were organised into the specialised [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]] and deployed during [[Operation Overlord]] – 'D-Day'.

Other significant military engineering projects of [[World War II]] include [[Mulberry harbour]] and [[Operation Pluto]].

Modern military engineering still retains the Roman role of building field [[fortification]]s, road paving and breaching terrain obstacles. A notable military engineering task was, for example, breaching the [[Suez Canal]] during the [[Yom Kippur War]].

== Education ==
Military engineers can come from a variety of engineering programs.  They may be graduates of [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], or [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Become_a_Military_Engineer_Step-by-Step_Career_Guide.html|title=Become a Military Engineer: Step-by-Step Career Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-discipline==
Modern military engineering can be divided into three main tasks or fields: combat engineering, strategic support, and ancillary support. Combat engineering is associated with engineering on the battlefield. Combat engineers are responsible for increasing mobility on the front lines of war such as digging trenches and building temporary facilities in war zones. Strategic support is associated with providing service in communication zones such as the construction of airfields and the improvement and upgrade of ports, roads and railways communication. Ancillary support includes provision and distribution of maps as well as the disposal of unexploded warheads. Military engineers construct bases, airfields, roads, bridges, ports, and hospitals. During peacetime before modern warfare, military engineers took the role of civil engineers by participating in the construction of civil-works projects. Nowadays, military engineers are almost entirely engaged in war logistics and preparedness.&lt;ref name="military engineering" /&gt;

==Institutions &amp; Professional Associations==
[[File:341st company building ribbon bridge.jpg|thumb|The American 341st Engineer Company building a ribbon bridge|alt=A group of soldiers in green fatigues assembling a bridge]]
The [[NATO]] Military Engineering Center of Excellence (MilEng CoE) is co-located with the [[German Army]] Military Engineer School in [[Ingolstadt]]. Prior to becoming a NATO CoE, the institute was known as the Euro NATO Training Engineer Centre (ENTEC) and it was located in [[Munich]]. As ENTEC, the institute was mandated to conduct military engineer interoperability training for participating nations. As the MilEng CoE, the institute's mandate has expanded to include doctrine and NATO standardization agreements ([[STANAG]]s) related to military engineering.

==Military engineering by country==
Military engineers are key in all armed forces of the world, and invariably found either closely integrated into the force structure, or even into the combat units of the national troops.

;United States:
{{main|Military engineering of the United States}}
The prevalence of military engineering in the United States dates back to the American Revolutionary War when engineers would carry out tasks in the U.S. Army. During the war, they would map terrain to and build fortifications to protect troops from opposing forces. The first military engineering organization in the United States was the Army Corps of Engineers. Engineers were responsible for protecting military troops whether using fortifications or designing new technology and weaponry throughout the United States’ history of warfare. The Army originally claimed engineers exclusively, but as the U.S. military branches expanded to the sea and sky, the need for military engineering sects in all branches increased. As each branch of the United States military expanded, technology adapted to fit their respective needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chambers|first=John|title=Engineering, Military|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/military_engineering.aspx#1|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=14 February 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6218">'''Open peer review''' is a process in which names of [[peer review]]ers of papers submitted to [[academic journal]]s are disclosed to the authors of the papers in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh E, Rooney M, Appleby L, Wilkinson G | title = Open peer review: a randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 176 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–51 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10789326 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.176.1.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanrooyen&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Rooyen S, Godlee F, Evans S, Black N, Smith R | title = Effect of open peer review on quality of reviews and on reviewers' recommendations: a randomised trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 318 | issue = 7175 | pages = 23–7 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9872878 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.318.7175.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, as with the ''[[BMJ]]'' and [[BioMed Central]], the process also involves posting the entire pre-publication history of the article online, including not only signed reviews of the article, but also its previous versions and author responses to the reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/authors/authorfaq/medical | title=What is 'open peer review', as operated by the medical journals in the BMC series? | publisher=BioMed Central | accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groves T, Loder E | title = Prepublication histories and open peer review at the BMJ | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | issue = sep03 13 | pages = g5394 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25186622 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g5394 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There is no single definition of open peer review, as it is implemented differently by different academic journals, but it has been broadly defined as "any scholarly review mechanism providing disclosure of author and referee identities to one another at any point during the peer review or publication process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford E | title = Open peer review at four STEM journals: an observational overview | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages = 6 | date = 2015-07-20 | pmid = 25767695 | pmc = 4350441 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.6005.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Possible advantages to an open peer-review system include reviewers being "more tactful and constructive" than they would be if they could remain anonymous.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Pros and cons of open peer review | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–8 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10195206 | doi = 10.1038/nature04991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that open review leads to more honest reviewing and prevents reviewers from following their individual agendas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review | title=What is peer review? | publisher=Elsevier | accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as leading to the detection of reviewers' conflicts of interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benos DJ, Bashari E, Chaves JM, Gaggar A, Kapoor N, LaFrance M, Mans R, Mayhew D, McGowan S, Polter A, Qadri Y, Sarfare S, Schultz K, Splittgerber R, Stephenson J, Tower C, Walton RG, Zotov A | title = The ups and downs of peer review | journal = Advances in Physiology Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–52 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17562902 | doi = 10.1152/advan.00104.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have also found that open peer review is associated with an increase in quality of reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Carole J. | last2 = Sugimoto | first2 = Cassidy R. | last3 =Zhang | first3 = Guo | last4 = Cronin | first4 = Blaise | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bias in peer review | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | date = January 2013 | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–17 | doi = 10.1002/asi.22784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other studies have not found such an association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Rooyen S, Delamothe T, Evans SJ | title = Effect on peer review of telling reviewers that their signed reviews might be posted on the web: randomised controlled trial | language = en | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | pages = c5729 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21081600 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c5729 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[BioMed Central]] [[medical journal]]s, all of which use open peer review, found that reviewers usually did not notice problems or request changes in reporting of the results of [[randomized trial]]s. The same study found most, but not all, of the requested changes had a positive effect on reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopewell S, Collins GS, Boutron I, Yu LM, Cook J, Shanyinde M, Wharton R, Shamseer L, Altman DG | title = Impact of peer review on reports of randomised trials published in open peer review journals: retrospective before and after study | language = en | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | pages = g4145 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24986891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g4145 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

A 1999 study found that open peer review did not affect the quality of reviews or the recommendation regarding whether the paper being reviewed should be published, but that it "significantly increased the likelihood of reviewers declining to review".&lt;ref name=vanrooyen/&gt; Open review of abstracts tended to lead to bias favoring authors from English-speaking countries and prestigious academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross JS, Gross CP, Desai MM, Hong Y, Grant AO, Daniels SR, Hachinski VC, Gibbons RJ, Gardner TJ, Krumholz HM | title = Effect of blinded peer review on abstract acceptance | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 14 | pages = 1675–80 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16609089 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.14.1675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that open peer review could lead to authors accumulating enemies who try to keep their papers from being published or their grant applications from being successful.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4357">The '''Penny Black Project''' is a [[Microsoft Research]] project that tries to find effective and practical ways of fighting [[Spam (e-mail)|spam]]. Because identifying spams consumes a recipient's time, the idea is to make the sender of emails "pay" a certain amount for sending them. The currency or the mode of payment could be [[CPU cycle]]s, [[Turing test]]s or [[memory cycle]]s. Such a payment would limit spammers' ability to send out large quantities of emails quickly.

The project's name is derived from the [[Penny Black]], the world's first adhesive stamp used for paid postage.

==Objective==
The goal of the project is move the e-mail costs from the receiver to the sender. The general idea is that if the sender must prove that they have expended a certain amount of effort specifically for the receiver and the message alone.

The project aims to devise a method to do this without introducing additional challenge-response mechanisms and third parties, and without requiring extra maintenance and updates, while retaining the current architecture of the e-mail system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ticket server==
One of the project's ideas was the "ticket server", a credit-based method for validating emails. Tickets would be required to perform actions, such as sending emails. There are three operations the ticket server provides: "request ticket", "cancel ticket", and "refund ticket".

The server would allow the user to request a ticket in exchange for a [[proof of work]]: expending [[CPU cycle]]s solving hard algorithms with processing power, [[Turing test]]s, or even just by paying money. The server could also cancel a ticket. For example, after receiving an email with a ticket, the receiver could request the ticket to be cancelled so it cannot be reused. The person who cancels a ticket also has the option to refund the ticket to the sender. This causes the original sender to regain a new ticket. For example, a user might refund a ticket that came with an email if it was not spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Using this, friendly and trusted emails would have little to no cost as tickets would be frequently refunded. However, spammers would be required to invest either a lot of computing time or money in order to create enough tickets to send large numbers of e-mails.

==Downfalls==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
One of the more obvious flaws is that this project can not entirely stop spam. It only hopes to slow spam down enough such that it is no longer cost effective for spammers. Using these methods to reduce spam will also require these policies to be universal amongst mail clients.

Intended mass email may also not work as intended. For example, subscribers to a particular email service may end up getting their emails with a significant delay while the email service will also become an increased expenses to the provider.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14407">'''Polywater''' was a hypothesized [[polymer]]ized form of [[water]] that was the subject of much [[scientific controversy]] during the late 1960s. By 1969 the [[popular press]] had taken notice and sparked fears of a "polywater gap" in the US.

Increased press attention also brought with it increased scientific attention, and as early as 1970 doubts about its authenticity were being circulated.&lt;ref name=unnatural/&gt;&lt;ref name=poly&gt;{{cite news |author= |title= Polywater |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E10FA345E1B7493C0AB1782D85F4D8685F9 |quote= Water is so essential, so abundant, so simple in composition and so intensively studied over the centuries that it seems a most unlikely substance to provide a major scientific surprise.

==Background==
In 1961, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] physicist Nikolai Fedyakin, working at the Technological Institute of [[Kostroma]], [[Russia]], performed measurements on the properties of water which had been [[condensation|condensed]] in, or repeatedly forced through, narrow [[quartz]] [[capillary action|capillary]] [[glass tube|tubes]]. Some of these experiments resulted in what was seemingly a new form of water with a [[boiling-point elevation|higher boiling point]], [[freezing-point depression|lower freezing point]], and much higher [[viscosity]] than ordinary water – about that of a syrup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/polywater-the-soviet-scientific-secret-that-made-the-world-gulp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boris Derjaguin]], director of the laboratory for surface physics at the Institute for Physical Chemistry in [[Moscow]], heard about Fedyakin's experiments. He improved on the method to produce the new water, and though he still produced very small quantities of this mysterious material, he did so substantially faster than Fedyakin did. Investigations of the material properties showed a substantially lower freezing point of −40&amp;nbsp;°C or less, a boiling point of 150&amp;nbsp;°C or greater, a density of approx. 1.1 to 1.2&amp;nbsp;g/cm³, and increased expansion with increasing temperature. The results were published in Soviet science journals, and short summaries were published in ''Chemical Abstracts'' in English, but Western scientists took no notice of the work.

In 1966, Derjaguin travelled to England for the "Discussions of the [[Faraday Society]]" in [[Nottingham]]. There, he presented the work again, and this time English scientists took note of what he referred to as ''anomalous water''. English scientists then started researching the effect as well, and by 1968 it was also under study in the United States.

By 1969, the concept had spread to [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]].&lt;ref name=unnatural&gt;{{cite news |author= |title= Unnatural Water |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941747,00.html#ixzz193cs9DeB |quote= Western scientists were frankly skeptical. Russian Chemists N. Fedyakin and Boris Deryagin claimed to have produced a mysterious new substance, a form of water so stable, it boiled only at about 1,000°F., or five times the boiling temperature of natural water. It did not evaporate. It did not freeze – though at  −40°F., with little or no expansion, it hardened into a glassy substance, quite unlike ice. |work= [[Time magazine]] |date= December 19, 1969 |accessdate= 2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=poly/&gt; There was fear {{Failed verification |date= April 2013}} by the [[United States military]] that there was a so-called "polywater gap" with the [[Soviet Union]], a popular media term indicating a possible capability "gap", or discrepancy, between the US and the USSR, popularized by media hype of the "[[bomber gap]]", the "[[missile gap]]", and the "[[cruiser gap]]", during periods when the USSR appeared to be outstripping the US in numbers of these respective weapons. Likely entered the US vernacular after Watergate, the use of "gap" also became widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title= U.S. Begins Efforts To Exceed the USSR In Polywater Science.

A scientific furor followed. Some experiments carried
out were able to reproduce Derjaguin's findings, while others failed. Several theories were advanced to explain the phenomenon. Some proposed it was the cause for increasing resistance on [[Transatlantic communications cable|trans-Atlantic phone cables]], while others predicted that if polywater were to contact ordinary water, it would convert that water into polywater, echoing the doomsday scenario in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''. By the 1970s, polywater was well known in the general population.&lt;ref name="PopSci"&gt;{{cite news |last= Christian |first= P. A. |author2= Berka, L. H. |title= How You Can Grow Your Own Polywater |work= Popular Science |date= June 1973 |pages= 105–107 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsYZa8MYtTsC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;ots=P5NwDr8pyM&amp;dq=How%20You%20Can%20Grow%20Your%20Own%20Polywater&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20You%20Can%20Grow%20Your%20Own%20Polywater&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, several people questioned the authenticity of what had come to be known in the West as polywater. The main concern being contamination of the water, but the papers went to great lengths to note the care taken to avoid this. [[Denis Rousseau]] and [[Sergio Porto]] of [[Bell Labs]] carried out infrared spectrum analysis, which showed polywater to be mostly chlorine and sodium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rousseau |first1= Denis L. |last2= Porto |first2= Sergio P. S. |date= March 27, 1970 |title= Polywater: Polymer or Artifact? |journal= Science |volume= 167 |issue= 3926 |pages= 1715–1719 |doi= 10.1126/science.167.3926.1715 |accessdate= August 13, 2011 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/167/3926/1715.abstract?sid=8b4eadf1-7198-4b31-b0fe-e0b27d28b8cf |bibcode= 1970Sci...167.1715R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Rousseau]] undertook an experiment with his own [[perspiration|sweat]] after playing a [[American handball|handball]] game at the lab and found it had identical properties. He then published a paper suggesting polywater was nothing more than water with small amounts of biological impurities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rousseau |first1= Denis L. |date= January 15, 1971 |title= "Polywater" and Sweat: Similarities between the Infrared Spectra |journal= Science |volume= 171 |issue= 3967 |pages= 170–172 |doi= 10.1126/science.171.3967.170 |accessdate= August 13, 2011 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/171/3967/170.abstract?sid=68de19c4-686a-45e9-84bd-ed9cd65f9196 |bibcode= 1971Sci...171..170R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another wave of research followed, this time more tightly controlled. Invariably, polywater could no longer be made. Chemical analysis found the samples of polywater to be contaminated with other substances (explaining the changes in melting and boiling points due to [[colligative properties]]), and examination of polywater by [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] showed it also contained small particles of various solids – from silica to [[phospholipid]]s, explaining its greater viscosity.

When the experiments which had initially produced polywater were repeated with thoroughly cleaned [[laboratory glassware|glassware]], the anomalous properties of the resulting water vanished, and even the scientists who had originally advanced the case for polywater agreed it did not exist. This took a few years longer in the Soviet Union, where scientists still clung to the idea.

In August 1973, Derjaguin and N. V. Churaev published a letter in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which they wrote; "these [anomalous] properties should be attributed to impurities rather than to the existence of polymeric water molecules".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Franks |first= Felix |title= Polywater |date= 1981 |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= 0-262-06073-6 |page= 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Rousseau]] used polywater as a classic example of [[pathological science]] and has since written on other examples as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Denis Rousseau|Rousseau, Denis L.]] |title= Case Studies in Pathological Science |journal= [[American Scientist]] |date= January–February 1992 |volume= 80 |issue= 1 |pages= 54–63 |bibcode= 1992AmSci..80...54R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that polywater should have been dismissed on theoretical grounds. The laws of thermodynamics predicted that, since polywater had a higher boiling point than ordinary water, it meant it was more stable, and thus all of Earth's water should have turned spontaneously into polywater, instead of just part of it.&lt;ref name="bauer" /&gt; [[Richard Feynman]] remarked that if such a material existed, then an animal would exist that would ingest water and excrete polywater, using the energy released on the process to survive.&lt;ref name="bauer"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[HYLE - International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry International]] |title= 'Pathological Science' is not Scientific Misconduct (nor is it pathological) |author= [[Henry H. Bauer]] |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |pages= 5–20 |url= http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/8-1/bauer.htm}} The above paper cites this review from Eisenberg: {{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.213.4512.1104 |title= A Scientific Gold Rush.

==In fiction==
The story "Polywater Doodle" by [[Howard L. Myers]] (writing under the pseudonym "[[Dr. Dolittle]]") appeared in the February 1971 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]''. It features an animal composed entirely of polywater, with the metabolism described by Richard Feynman. (The title of the story is a pun on "[[Polly Wolly Doodle]]".)

Polywater is the central idea of the 1972 espionage/thriller novel ''[[A Report from Group 17]]'' by [[Robert C. O'Brien (author)|Robert C. O'Brien]]. The story revolves around the use of a type of polywater to make people controllable and incapable of independent thought or action.

The episodes "[[The Naked Time]]" (''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'') and its sequel, "[[The Naked Now]]" (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'') involve forms of polywater [[substance intoxication|intoxication]]. In the original episode, a scientific research outpost falls victim to polywater, which causes the crew to become so incapacitated that they all died after shutting off environmental controls in the compound. In the sequel, a [[Starfleet]] vessel is discovered adrift, its crew frozen in various states due to polywater intoxication.

In [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', [[ice-nine]] was a form of water that was solid at room temperature, and solidified any water that it contacted, giving it the capability to destroy all life on Earth.

'''Principles of intelligent urbanism''' ('''PIU''') is a theory of [[urban planning]] composed of a set of ten axioms intended to guide the formulation of city plans and urban designs. They are intended to reconcile and integrate diverse urban planning and management concerns. These axioms include [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[sustainability]], [[heritage conservation]], [[appropriate technology]], infrastructure-efficiency, [[placemaking]], [[social access]], [[transit-oriented development]],  [[regional integration]], [[human scale]], and institutional integrity. The term was coined by Prof. [[Christopher Charles Benninger]].

The '''PIU''' evolved from the city planning guidelines formulated by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|''International Congress of Modern Architecture'' (CIAM)]], the urban design approaches developed at Harvard's pioneering Urban Design Department under the leadership of [[Josep Lluis Sert]], and the concerns enunciated by [[Team Ten]].  It is most prominently seen in plans prepared by [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] and his numerous colleagues in the Asian context (Benninger 2001). They form the elements of the planning curriculum at the School of Planning, [[Ahmedabad]], which Benninger founded in 1971.  They were the basis for the new capital plan for [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name=Thimphu&gt;[http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html Thimphu Structural Plan 2002-2027] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623013525/http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html |date=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
===Principle one: a balance with nature===
According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, balance with nature emphasizes the distinction between utilizing resources and exploiting them.  It focuses on the thresholds beyond which [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]], [[aquifer]] depletion, [[silting|siltation]] and flooding reinforce one another in urban development, saving or destroying life support systems.  The principle promotes environmental assessments to identify fragile zones, threatened [[ecosystems]] and habitats that can be enhanced through conservation, density control, [[land use planning]] and [[Urban open space|open space]] design (McCarg: 1975). This principle promotes life cycle building energy consumption and pollutant emission analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg I. (1975): Design with Nature, Wiley, John and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle states there is a level of human habitation intensity wherein the resources that are consumed will be replaced through the replenishing natural cycles of the seasons, creating environmental equilibrium.  Embedded in the principle is  contention that so long as nature can resurge each year; so long as the biomass can survive within its own [[eco-system]]; so long as the breeding grounds of fauna and avifauna are safe; so long as there is no erosion and the biomass is maintained, nature is only being utilized.

Underlying this principle is the supposition that there is a fragile line that is crossed when the [[fauna]], which cross-fertilizes the [[flora]], which sustains the soil, which supports the hillsides, is no longer there. Erosion, siltation of drainage networks and flooding result. After a point of no return, utilization of [[natural resources]] will outpace the natural ability of the [[Ecosystem|eco-system]] to replenish itself.  From there on degradation accelerates and amplifies.  [[Deforestation]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]], floods, fires and landslides all increase.

The principle states that blatant "acts against nature" include cutting of hillside trees, [[quarry]]ing on slopes, dumping [[sewage]] and [[industrial waste]] into the natural [[drainage basin|drainage system]], paving and plinthing excessively, and construction on steep slopes.   This [[urban theory]] proposes that the urban ecological balance can be maintained when fragile areas are reserved, conservation of eco-systems is pursued, and low intensity habitation precincts are thoughtfully identified.  Thus, the principles operate within the balance of nature, with a goal of protecting and conserving those elements of the ecology that nurture the environment.  Therefore, the first principle of intelligent urbanism is that urbanization be in balance with nature.

===Principle two: a balance with tradition===
Balance with tradition is intended to integrate plan interventions with existing cultural assets, respecting traditional practices and precedents of style (Spreiregen: 1965). This urban planning principle demands respect for the [[cultural heritage]] of a place.  It seeks out traditional wisdom in the layout of human settlements, in the order of building plans, in the precedents of style, in the symbols and signs that transfer meanings through decoration and motifs.  This principle respects the order engendered into building systems through years of adaptation to climate, to social circumstances, to available materials and to technology.  It promotes [[architectural styles]] and motifs designed to communicate cultural values.

This principle calls for orienting attention toward historic monuments and heritage structures, leaving space at the ends of visual axis to “frame" existing views and vistas. Natural views and vistas demand respect, assuring that buildings do not block major sight lines toward visual assets.

Embedded in the principle is the concern for unique cultural and societal iconography of regions, their signs and symbols. Their incorporation into the spatial order of urban settings is promoted.  Adherents promote the orientation and structuring of urban plans using local knowledge and meaning systems, expressed through art, urban space and architecture.

Planning decisions must operate within the balance of tradition, aggressively protecting, promoting and conserving generic components and elements of the urban pattern.

===Principle three: appropriate technology===
[[Appropriate technology]] emphasizes the employment of [[building materials]], construction techniques, infrastructural systems and [[project management]] which are consistent with local contexts (situation, setting or circumstances)[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/contexts]. People's capacities, geo-climatic conditions, locally available resources, and suitable [[investment|capital investments]] all temper technology. Where there are abundant craftspeople, labour-intensive methods are appropriate. Where there is surplus savings, capital intensive methods are appropriate. For every problem there is a range of potential technologies, which can be applied, and an appropriate fit between technology and other resources must be established. Proponents argue that accountability and transparency are enhanced by overlaying the physical spread of urban utilities and services upon electoral constituencies, such that people’s representatives are interlinked with the urban technical systems needed for a [[civil society]]. This principle is in sync with "small is beautiful" concepts and with the use of local resources.

===Principle four: conviviality===
The fourth principle  sponsors [[social interaction]] through public domains, in a hierarchy of places, devised for personal solace, companionship, romance, domesticity, "neighborliness," community and civic life (Jacobs:1993). According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, vibrant societies are interactive, socially engaging and offer their members numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs Jane (1993): [[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]], [[Random House]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIU maintain that this can be achieved through design and that society operates within hierarchies of [[social relation]]s which are space specific.  The hierarchies can be conceptualized as a system of social tiers, with each tier having a corresponding physical place in the settlement structure.

====A place for the individual====
A goal of intelligent urbanism is to create places of solitude. These may be in urban forests, along urban hills, beside quiet streams, in public gardens and in parks where one can escape to meditate and contemplate.  According to proponents, these are the quiet places wherein the individual consciousness dialogues with the rational mind.  Idle and random thought sorts out complexities of modern life and allows the obvious to emerge.  It is in these natural settings that the wandering mind finds its measure and its balance. Using ceremonial gates, directional walls and other “silent devices" these spaces are denoted and divined.  Places of the individual cultivate introspection.  These spaces may also be the forecourts and interior courtyards of public buildings, or even the thoughtful reading rooms of libraries. Meditation focuses one's thought.  Intelligent urbanism creates a domain for the individual to mature through self-analysis and [[self-realization]].

====A place for friendship====
The axiom insists that in city plans there must be spaces for “beautiful, intimate [[friendship]]" where unfettered dialogue can happen.  This principle insists that such places will not exist naturally in a modern urban fabric.  They must be a part of the conscientious design of the urban core, of the urban hubs, of urban villages and of neighborhoods, where people can meet with friends and talk out life’s issues, sorrows, joys and dilemmas.  This second tier is important for the emotional life of the populace.  It sponsors strong [[mental health]] within the people, creating places where friendship can unfold and grow.

====A place for householders====
There must be spaces for householders, which may be in the form of dwellings for families, or homes for intimate companions, and where young workmates can form a common kitchen.  Whatever their compositions, there must be a unique domain for [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], familiar or biological, which have organized themselves into households.  These domestic precincts are where families live and carry out their day-to-day functions of life.  This third tier of conviviality is where the individual socializes into a personality.

Housing clusters planned according to this axiom create a variety of household possibilities, which respond to a range of household structures and situations.  It recognizes that households transform through the years, requiring a variety of dwellings types that respond to a complex matrix of needs and abilities, which are provided for in city plans.

====A place for the neighborhood====
Smaller household domains must cluster into a higher social domain, the neighborhood social group.
Good city planning practice sponsors, through design, such units of social space.  It is in this fourth tier of social life that public conduct takes on new dimensions and groups learn to live peacefully among one another.  It is through neighborhoods that the “social contract" amongst diverse households and individuals is sponsored.  This [[social contract]] is the rational basis for social relations and negotiations within larger social groups. Within neighborhoods basic amenities like creches, early learning centers, preventive health care and rudimentary infrastructure are maintained by the community.

====A place for communities====
The next social tier, or hierarchy, is the community.  Historically, communities were tribes who shared [[Mores|social mores]] and cultural behavioral patterns.  In contemporary urban settings communities are formed of diverse people.  But these are people who share the common need to negotiate and manage their spatial settings. In plans created through the principles of intelligent urbanism these are called urban villages.  Like a rural village, social bonds are found in the [[community management]] of security, common resources and social space. Urban villages will have defined social spaces, services and amenities that need to be managed by the community.  According to proponents of intelligent urbanism these urban villages optimally become the administrative wards, and therefore the constituencies, of the elected members of municipal bodies.  Though there are no physical barriers to these communities, they have their unique spatial social domain.  Intelligent urbanism calls for the creation of dense, walkable zones in which the inhabitants recognize each other’s faces, share common facilities and resources, and often see each other at the village centre. This fifth tier of social space is where one needs initiative to join into various activities.  It is intended to promote initiative and constructive community participation.  There are opportunities for one to be involved in the management of services, and amenities and to meet new people. They accommodate primary education and recreation areas. Good planning practice promotes the creation of community places, where community-based organizations can manage common resources and resolve common problems.

====A place for the city domain====
The principles of intelligent urbanism call for city level domains.  These can be plazas, parks, stadia, transport hubs, promenades, "passages" or gallerias.  These are social spaces where everyone can go.  In many cities one has to pay an entrance fee to access “public spaces" like malls and museums.  Unlike the lower tiers of the [[social hierarchy]], this tier is not defined by any biological, familiar, [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or exclusive characteristic.  One may find people from all continents, from nearby districts and provinces and from all parts of the city in such places. By nature these are accessible and open spaces, with no physical, social or economic barriers. According to this principle it is the rules of human conduct that order this domain’s behavior.  It is civility, or civilization, which protects and energizes such spaces.  At the lower tiers, one meets people through introductions, through family ties, and through neighborhood circumstances.

These domains would include all freely accessible large spaces. These are places where outdoor exhibits are held, sports matches take place, vegetables are sold and goods are on display. These are places where visitors to the city meander amongst the locals. Such places may stay the same, but the people are always changing.  Most significant, these city scale public domains foster public interaction; they sponsor unspoken ground rules for unknown people to meet and to interact.  They nurture civic understanding of the strength of diversity, variety, a range of cultural groups and ethnic mixes. It is this higher tier of social space which defines truly urbane environments.

Every [[Social structure|social system]] has its own hierarchy of social relations and interactions. Intelligent urbanism sees cyberspace as a macro tier of conviviality, but does not discount physical places in forging relationships due to the Internet. These are reflected through a system of ‘places’ that respond to them.  Good urban planning practice promotes the planning and design of such ‘places’ as elemental components of the [[urban structure]].

===Principle five: efficiency===
The principle of efficiency promotes a balance between the consumption of resources such as energy, time and fiscal resources, with planned achievements in comfort, safety, security, access, tenure, productivity and hygiene.  It encourages optimum sharing of public land, roads, facilities, services and infrastructural networks, reducing per household costs, while increasing affordability, productivity, access and civic viability.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a balance between performance and consumption.  Intelligent urbanism promotes efficiency in carrying out functions in a [[Cost-effectiveness|cost effective]] manner. It assesses the performance of various systems required by the public and the consumption of energy, funds, administrative time and the maintenance efforts required to perform these functions.

A major concern of this principle is transport.  While recognizing the convenience of personal vehicles, it attempts to place costs (such as [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|energy consumption]], large paved areas, parking, accidents, negative [[balance of trade]], pollution and related morbidity) on the users of private vehicles.

Good city planning practice promotes alternative modes of transport, as opposed to a dependence on personal vehicles.  It promotes affordable [[public transport]].  It promotes medium to high-density [[residential development]] along with complementary social amenities, convenience shopping, recreation and [[public services]] in compact, walkable mixed-use settlements.  These compact communities have shorter pipe lengths, wire lengths, cable lengths and road lengths per capita.  More people share gardens, shops and transit stops.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute (1998): Smart Growth, [[Urban Land Institute]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These compact urban nodes are spaced along regional urban transport corridors that integrate the region’s urban nodes, through public transport, into a rational system of growth.  Good planning practice promotes clean, comfortable, safe and speedy, public transport, which operates at dependable intervals along major origin and destination paths.  Such a system is cheaper, safer, less polluting and consumes less energy.

The same principle applies to [[public infrastructure]], social facilities and public services.  Compact, high-density communities result in more efficient urban systems, delivering services at less cost per unit to each citizen.

There is an appropriate balance to be found somewhere on the line between wasteful low-density individual systems and over-capitalized mega systems.  Individual [[septic tank]]s and water bores servicing individual households in low-density fragmented layouts, allow the use of filtered [[greywater]] for free [[irrigation]] of gardens, but, if not maintained, can cause a local pollution of subterranean [[aquifer]] systems. The bores can dramatically lower [[Groundwater|ground water]] levels especially during droughts. The vantage of septic tanks an bores is to be managed by the very users, at no cost for the community.
Alternatively, large-scale, citywide sewerage systems and regional [[water supply]] systems are capital intensive and prone to management and maintenance dysfunction, if not corruption or extortion by private companies.  Operating costs, [[user fees]] and cost recovery expenses are high.   There is a balance wherein medium-scale systems, covering compact communities, utilize modern technology, without the pitfalls of large-scale infrastructure systems.  This principle of urbanism promotes the middle path with regard to public infrastructure, facilities, services and amenities.

When these appropriate facilities and service systems overlap electoral constituencies, the “imagery" between user performance in the form of payments for services, systems dependability through managed delivery, and official response through effective representation, should all become obvious and transparent.

Good city planning practices promote compact settlements along dense urban corridors, and within populated networks, such that the numbers of users who share costs are adequate to support effective and efficient infrastructure systems. Intelligent urbanism is intended to foster movement on foot, linking pedestrian movement with public transport systems at strategic nodes and hubs.  Medium-scale infrastructural systems, whose catchment areas overlap political constituencies and administrative jurisdictions, result in transparent governance and accountable urban management.

===Principle six: human scale===
Intelligent urbanism encourages ground level, pedestrian oriented urban patterns, based on anthropometric dimensions.  Walkable, mixed use urban villages are encouraged over single-function blocks, linked by motor ways, and surrounded by [[parking lot]]s.

An abiding axiom of urban planning, [[urban design]] and city planning has been the promotion of people friendly places, pedestrian walkways and public domains where people can meet freely.  These can be parks, gardens, glass-covered gallerias, arcades, courtyards, street side cafes, river- and hill-side stroll ways, and a variety of semi-covered spaces.

Intelligent urbanism promotes the scale of the pedestrian moving on the pathway, as opposed to the scale of the automobile on the expressway.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the ground plan of imaginable precincts, as opposed to the imagery of façades and the monumentality of the section.  It promotes the personal visibility of places moving on foot at eye level.

Intelligent urbanism advocates removing artificial barrier and promotes face-to-face contact.  Proponents argue that the automobile, [[Single-use zoning|single use zoning]] and the construction of public structures in isolated compounds, all deteriorate [[Human condition|the human condition]] and the human scale of the city.

According to PIU proponents, the trend towards [[urban sprawl]] can be overcome by developing pedestrian circulation networks along streets and open spaces that link local destinations.  Shops, amenities, [[day care]], vegetable markets and basic social services should be clustered around public transport stops, and at a walkable distance from work places, public institutions, high and medium density residential areas.  Public spaces should be integrated into residential, work, entertainment and commercial areas.  Social activities and public buildings should orient onto public open spaces.  These should be the interchange sites for people on the move, where they can also revert into the realm of “slowness," of community life and of human interaction.

Human scale can be achieved through building masses that “step down" to human scale open spaces; by using arcades and pavilions as buffers to large masses; by intermixing open spaces and built masses sensitively; by using [[anthropometric]] proportions and [[natural material]]s.  Traditional building precedents often carry within them a human scale language, from which a contemporary fabric of build may evolve.

The focus of intelligent urbanism is the ground plane, pedestrian movement and interaction along movement channels, stems, at crossing nodes, at interactive hubs and within vibrant urban cores.  The PIU holds many values in common with [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]], but the PIU goal is not merely to replace the automobile, nor to balance it.  These are mundane requirements of planning, which the PIU assumes are found in every design and urban configuration. The PIU goal is to enrich the human condition and to enhance the realm of human possibilities.

Intelligent urbanism conceives of urbanity as a process of facilitating [[human behavior]] toward more tolerant, more peaceful, more accommodating and more sensitive modalities of interaction and [[conflict resolution]].  Intelligent urbanism recognizes that ‘urbanity’ emerges where people mix and interact on a face-to-face basis, on the ground, at high densities and amongst diverse social and economic groups. Intelligent urbanism nurtures ‘urbanity’ through designs and plans that foster human scale interaction.

===Principle seven: opportunity matrix===
The PIU envisions the city as a vehicle for personal, social, and [economic development], through access to a range of organizations, services, facilities and information providing a variety of opportunities for enhanced employment, economic engagement, education, and recreation. This principle aims to increase access to shelter, health care and human resources development. It aims to increase safety and hygienic conditions. The city is a place of economic opportunity. This is generally said with regard to urban annual net product, enriched urban economic base, sustained employment generation and urban balance of trade.  More significantly this is true for the individuals who settle in cities.  Moreover, cities are places where individuals can increase their knowledge, skills and sensitivities.  Cities provide access to [[health care]] and [[preventive medicine]].  They provide a great umbrella of services under which the individual can leave aside the struggle for survival, and get on with the finer things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Sen A. (2000): Development as Freedom: Knopf, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIU sees cities as catalysts for personal definition and self-discovery. In cities people get inspired, build a drive to achieve, discover aspects of their personalities, skills and intellectual curiosity which they use to craft their identity.

The city provides a range of services and facilities, whose realization in villages are the all-consuming struggle of rural inhabitants.  Potable water; sewerage management; energy for cooking, heat and lighting are all piped and wired in; [[Waste management|solid waste disposal]] and [[Stormwater|storm water]] drainage are taken for granted.  The city offers access through roads, public transit, telephones and the Internet.  The peace and security provided by effective policing systems, and the courts of law, are just assumed to be there in the city.  Then there are the schools, the recreation facilities, the health services and a myriad of professional services offered in the city market place.

Intelligent urbanism views the city as an opportunity system.  Yet these opportunities are not equally distributed.  Security, health care, education, shelter, hygiene, and most of all employment, are not equally accessible.  Proponents of intelligent urbanism see the city as playing an equalizing role allowing citizens to grow according to their own essential capabilities and efforts.  If the city is an institution, which generates opportunities, intelligent urbanism promotes the concept of equal access to opportunities within the urban system.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a guaranteed access to education, health care, police protection, and justice before the law, potable water, and a range of basic services.  Perhaps this principle, more than any other, distinguishes intelligent urbanism from other elitist, efficiency oriented urban charters and regimes.

Intelligent urbanism does not say every household will stay in an equivalent house, or travel in the same vehicle, or consume the same amount of electricity.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes the existence of poverty, of ignorance, of ill health, of malnutrition, of low skills, of gender bias and ignorance of the urban system itself.  Intelligent urbanism is courageous in confronting these forms of inequality, and backlogs in social and economic development.  Intelligent urbanism sees an urban plan, not only as a physical plan, but also as a social plan and as an economic plan.

The ramifications of this understanding are that the people living in [[smart city|intelligent cities]] should not experience urban development in “standard doses".   In short, people may be born equal or unequal, but they grow inequitably.  An important role of the city is to provide a variety of paths and channels for each individual to set right their own future, against the inequity of their past, or the special challenges they face.  According to proponents of this principle this is the most salient aspect of a [[free society]]; than even [[Suffrage|voting rights]] access to opportunity is the essence of self-liberation and human development (Sen:2000).

According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, there will be a variety of problems faced by urbanites and they need a variety of opportunity channels for resolution.  If there are ten problem areas where people are facing stresses, like economic engagement, health, shelter, food, education, recreation, transport, etc., there must be a variety of opportunities through which individuals and households can resolve each of these stresses.  There must be ten channels to resolve each of ten stresses! If this opportunity matrix is understood and responded to, the city is truly functioning as an opportunity matrix. For example, opportunities for shelter could be through the channels of lodges, rented rooms, studio apartments, bedroom apartments and houses.  It could be through the channels of ownership, through a variety of tendencies.  It could be through opportunities for [[self-help]], or incremental housing.  It could be through the up-gradation of slums.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a wide range of solutions, where any stress is felt.  It therefore promotes a range of problem statements, options, and variable solutions to urban stresses.

Intelligent urbanism sees cities as processes.  Proponents argue that good urban plans facilitate those processes and do not place barriers before them.  For example, it does not judge a “slum" as a blight on society; it sees the possibility that such a settlement may be an opportunity channel for entry into the city.  Such a settlement may be the only affordable shelter, within easy access to employment and education, for a new immigrant household in the city.  According to intelligent urbanism, if the plan ignores, or destroys such settlements, it is creating a city of barriers and despair wherein a poor family, offering a good service to the city, is denied a modicum of basic needs for survival.  Alternatively, if the urban plan recognizes that the “slum" is a mechanism for [[Personal development|self development]], a spring-board from which children have access to education, a place which can be up-graded with potable water, basic sanitary facilities, [[street light]]s and paving…then it is a plan for opportunity.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there are slums of hope and slums of despair.  It promotes slums of hope, which contribute, not only to individual opportunities, but also to [[Nation-building|nation building]].

The opportunity matrix must also respond to young professionals, to skilled, well-paid [[day labor]]ers, to the [[upper middle class]] and to affluent entrepreneurs.   If a range of needs, of abilities to pay, of locational requirements, and of levels of development of shelter, is addressed, then opportunities are being created.

Intelligent urbanism believes that [[Capitalism|private enterprise]] is the logical provider of opportunities, but that alone it will not be just or effective.  The regime of land, left to [[Market Forces|market forces]] alone, will create an exclusive, dysfunctional society.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there is an essential role for the [[civil society]] to intervene in the opportunity matrix of the city.

Intelligent urbanism promotes opportunities through access to:

* Basic and primary education, skill development and knowledge about the  urban world;
* Basic health care, potable water, solid waste disposal and hygiene;
* Urban facilities like storm drainage, street lights, roads and footpaths;
* Recreation and entertainment;
* Transport, energy, communications;
* [[Public participation]] and debate;
* Finance and investment mechanisms;
* Land and/or built-up space where [[goods and services]] can be produced;
* Rudimentary economic infrastructure;
* Intelligent urbanism provides a wide range of zones, districts and precincts where activities and functions can occur without detracting from one another.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that enterprise can only flourish where a public framework provides opportunities for enterprise.  This system of opportunities operates through public investments in economic and social infrastructure; through incentives in the form of appropriate finance, tax inducements, subsidized skill development for workers, and: regulations which protect the environment, safety, hygiene and health. To ensure a stable playing field where one can make an investment with predictable returns, a modicum of regulation is necessary. Proponents argue that it is through government regulations that private investment can be protected from fraud. It is through government regulation that the under-pinning conditions for [[free enterprise]] can be protected.

===Principle eight: regional integration===
Intelligent urbanism envisions the city as an organic part of a larger environmental, [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] and cultural-geographic system, essential for its sustainability. This zone of influence is the region.  Likewise, it sees the region as integrally connected to the city.  Intelligent urbanism sees the planning of the city and its hinterland as a single holistic process.  Proponents argue if one does not recognize growth as a regional phenomenon, then development will play a [[hopscotch]] game of moving just a bit further along an arterial roads, further up valleys above the municipal jurisdiction,  staying beyond the path of the city boundary, development regulations and of the urban tax regime.

The region may be defined as the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] from which employees and students commute into the city on a daily basis. It is the catchment area from which people choose to visit one city, as opposed to another, for retail shopping and entertainment. Economically the city region may include the hinterland that depends on its wholesale markets, banking facilities, transport hubs and information exchanges. The region needing integration may be seen as the zone from which perishable foods, firewood and building materials supply the city.  The economic region can also be defined as the area managed by exchanges in the city.  Telephone calls to the region go through the city's telecom exchange; post goes through the city's general [[post office]]; money transfers go through the city’s [[financial institution]]s and internet data passes electronically through the city’s servers.  The area over which “city exchanges" disperse matter can well be called the city’s economic hinterland or region.  Usually the region includes dormitory communities, airports, water reservoirs, perishable food farms, hydro facilities, out-of-doors recreation and other infrastructure that serves the city.   Intelligent urbanism sees the integrated planning of these services and facilities as part of the city planning process.

Intelligent urbanism understands that the social and economic region linked to a city also has a physical form, or a geographic character.   A hierarchy of watersheds, creating valleys and defining edges of neighborhoods, may define the geographic character.  Forest ranges, fauna and avifauna habitats are set within such regions and are connected by natural corridors for movement and cross-fertilization.  Within this larger, environmental scenario, one must conceptualize urbanism in terms of watersheds, subterranean aquifer systems, and other natural systems that operate across the entire region.  Economic infrastructure, such as roads, hydro basins, irrigation channels, water reservoirs and related distribution networks usually follow the terrain of the [[regional geography]].  The region’s geographic portals, and lines of control, may also define defense and security systems deployment.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes that there is always a spillover of population from the city into the region, and that population in the region moves into the city for work, shopping, entertainment, health care and education.  With thoughtful planning the region can take pressure off of the city.  Traditional and new settlements within the urban region can be enhanced and densified to accommodate additional urban households.  There are many activities within the city, which are growing and are incompatible with urban habitat.  Large, noisy and polluting workshops and manufacturing units are amongst these.  Large wholesale markets, storage sheds, vehicular maintenance garages, and waste management facilities need to be housed outside of the city’s limits in their own satellite enclaves. In larger urban agglomerations a number of towns and cities are clustered around a major  urban center forming a metropolitan region.

Intelligent urbanism is not just planning for the present; it is also planning for the distant future.  Intelligent urbanism is not Utopian, but futuristic in its need to forecast the scenarios to come, within its own boundaries, and within the boundaries of the distant future.

===Principle nine: balanced movement===
Intelligent urbanism advocates integrated transport systems comprising walkways, cycle paths, bus lanes, light rail corridors, under-ground metros and automobile channels. A balance between appropriate modes of movement  is proposed. More capital intensive transport systems should move between high density nodes and hubs, which interchange with lower technology movement options. These modal split nodes become the public domains around which cluster high density, pedestrian, mixed-use urban villages (Taniguchi:2001).

The PIU accepts that the automobile is  here to stay, but that it should not be made essential by design. A well planned metropolis would densify along mass transit corridors and around major urban hubs. Smaller, yet dense, urban nodes are seen as micro-zones of medium level density, public amenities and pedestrian access. At these points lower level nodal split will occur, such as between bus loops and cycle tracts. The PIU views nodal split points as places of urban conviviality and access to services and facilities. Modal split can be between walking, cycling, driving, and mass transit. Bus loops may feed larger rail-based rapid-movement corridors. Social and economic infrastructure becomes more intensive as movement corridors become more intense.

===Principle ten: institutional integrity===
Intelligent urbanism holds that good practices inherent in considered principles can only be realized through accountable, transparent, competent and participatory local governance, founded on appropriate data bases, due entitlements, civic responsibilities and duties. The PIU promotes a range of facilitative and promotive urban development management tools to achieve appropriate urban practices, systems and forms(Islam:2000). None of the principles or practices the PIU promotes can be implemented unless there is a strong and rational institutional framework to define, channel and legalize urban development, in all of its aspects. Intelligent urbanism envisions the institutional framework as being very clear about the rules and regulations it sponsors and that those using discretion in implementing these measures must do so in a totally open, recorded and transparent manner.

Intelligent urbanism facilitates the public in carrying out their honest objectives.  It does not regulate and control the public.  It attempts to reduce the requirements, steps and documentation required for citizens to process their proposals.

Intelligent urbanism is also promotive in furthering the interests of the public in their genuine utilization of opportunities.  It promotes site and services schemes for households who can construct their own houses.  It promotes up-gradation of settlements with inadequate basic services.  It promotes innovative financing to a range of actors who can contribute to the city’s development.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a limited role for government, for example in “packaging" large-scale urban development schemes, so that the private sector is promoted to actually build and market urban projects, which were previously built by the government.

Intelligent urbanism does not consider itself naïve.  It recognizes that there are developers and promoters who have no long term commitment to their own constructions, and their only concern is to hand over a dwelling, gain their profit and move on.  For these players it is essential to have [[Development Control]] Regulations, which assure the public that the products they invest in are safe, hygienic, orderly, durable and efficient.  For the discerning citizen, such rules also lay out the civil understanding by which a [[complex society]] agrees to live together.

The PIU contends that there must be a cadastral System wherein all of the land in the jurisdiction of cities is demarcated, surveyed, characterized and archived, registering its legal owner, its legal uses, and the tax defaults against it.

The institutional framework can only operate where there is a Structure Plan, or other document that defines how the land will be used, serviced, and accessed.  The Structure Plan tells landowners and promoters what the parameters of development are, which assures that their immediate investments are secure, and that the returns and use of such efforts are predictable.   A Structure Plan is intended to provide owners and investors with predictable future scenarios.  Cities require efficient patterns for their main infrastructure systems and utilities.  According to PIU proponents, land needs to be used in a judicious manner, organizing complementary functions and activities into compact, mixed use precincts and separating out non-compatible uses into their own precincts.   In a similar manner, proponents argue it is only through a plan that heritage sites and the environment can be legally protected.  Public assets in the form of nature, religious places, heritage sites and open space systems must be designated in a legal plan.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that the city and its surrounding region be regulated by a Structure Plan, or equivalent mechanism, which acts as a [[legal instrument]] to guide the growth, development and enhancement of the city.

According to proponents, there must be a system of participation by the “Stake Holders" in the preparation of plans.  Public meetings, hearings of objections and transparent processes of addressing objections, must be institutionalized.  Intelligent urbanism promotes Public Participation.  Local Area Plans must be prepared which address local issues and take into account local views and sentiments regarding plan objectives, configurations, standards and patterns.  Such plans lay out the sites of plots showing the roads, public open spaces, amenities areas and conservation sites.  Land Pooling assures the beneficiaries from provision of public infrastructure and amenities proportionally contribute and that a few individuals do not suffer from reservations in the plan.

According to proponents, there must be a system of Floor Area Ratios to assure that the land and the services are not over pressured.  No single plot owner should have more than the determined "fair share" of utilization of the access roads, amenities and utilities that service all of the sites.  Floor Area Ratios temper this relationship as regulated the manner in which public services are consumed.  According to PIU proponents, [[Air rights|Transfer of Development Rights]] benefits land owners whose properties have been reserved under the plan.  It also benefits the local authorities that lack the financial resources to purchase lands to implement the [[Structure Plans]].  It benefits concentrated, [[Central business district|city center]] project promoters who have to amortize expensive land purchases, by allowing them to purchase the development rights from the owners of reserved lands and to hand over those properties to the plan implementing authority.  This allows the local authority to widen roads and to implement the Structure Plan.  The local authority then transfers the needed development right to city center promoters.

Intelligent urbanism supports the use of Architectural Guidelines where there is a tradition to preserve and where precedents can be used to specify architectural elements, motifs and language in a manner, which intended to reinforce a cultural tradition.  Building designs must respect traditional elements, even though the components may vary greatly to integrate contemporary functions. Even in a greenfield setting Architectural Guidelines are required to assure harmony and continuity of building proportions, scale, color, patterns, motifs, materials and facades.

Intelligent urbanism insists on safety, hygiene, durability and utility in the design and construction of buildings.  Where large numbers of people gather in schools, hospitals, and other  public facilities that may become [[emergency shelter]]s in disasters, special care must be exercised.  A suitable [[Building code|Building Code]] is the proposed instrument to achieve these aims.

PIU proponents state that those who design buildings must be professionally qualified architects; those who design the structures (especially of more than ground plus two levels) must be professionally qualified structural engineers; those who build buildings must be qualified civil engineers; and, those who supervise and control construction must be qualified construction managers.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the professionalisation of the city making process.  While promoting professionalism, intelligent urbanism proposes that this not become a barrier in the development process.  Small structures, low-rise structures, and humble structures that do not house many people can be self designed and constructed by the inhabitants themselves.  Proponents maintain that there must be recognized Professional Accrediting Boards, or Professional Bodies, to see that urban development employs adequate technical competence.

Finally, there must be legislation creating statutory [[Local government|local authorities]], and empowering them to act, manage, invest, service, protect, promote and facilitate urban development and all of the opportunities that a modern city must sponsor.

Intelligent urbanism insists that cities, local authorities, regional development commissions and planning agencies be professionally managed.  City Managers can be hired to manage the delivery of services, the planning and management of planned development, the maintenance of utilities and the creation of amenities.

Intelligent urbanism views plans and urban designs and housing configurations as expressions of the people for whom they are planned.  The processes of planning must therefore be a participatory involving a range of stakeholders.  The process must be a transparent one, which makes those privileged to act as guardians of the people’s will accountable for their decisions and choices.  Intelligent urbanism sees urban planning and city governance as the most salient expressions of civility.  Intelligent urbanism fosters the evolution of institutional systems that enhance transparency, accountability and rational public decision making.

==Movements implementing the ten principles==
Though not necessarily related to the principles of intelligent urbanism, there are examples representing all or some of them in urban design theory and practice.
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pigment Colours - Classification.jpg|thumb|Classification of pigment colors]]

'''RYB''' (an abbreviation of [[red]]–[[yellow]]–[[blue]]) is a historical set of [[Color|colors]] used in [[subtractive color]] mixing and is one commonly used set of [[primary color]]s. It is primarily used in art and design education, particularly [[painting]].

RYB predates modern scientific [[color theory]], which has determined that [[CMYK color model|cyan, magenta, and yellow]] are the best set of three colorants to combine, for the widest range of high-chroma colors.&lt;ref&gt;

==Color wheel==
{{double image|right|BYR color wheel.svg|150|Color_star-en (tertiary names).svg|150|RYB [[color wheel]]|RYB color star}}

RYB (red–yellow–blue) make up the primary color triad in a standard artist's [[color wheel]]. The [[secondary colors]] [[purple]]–[[orange (colour)|orange]]–[[green]] (sometimes called [[violet (color)|violet]]–orange–green) make up another triad. Triads are formed by three equidistant colors on a particular color wheel. Other common color wheels represent the [[RGB color model|light model (RGB)]] and the [[CMYK color model|print model (CMYK)]].

==History==
[[File:Franciscus Aguilonius color scheme.png|thumb|The 1613 RYB color scheme of Franciscus Aguilonius (Francisci Agvilonii), with primaries yellow (flavus), red (rubeus), and blue (caeruleus) arranged between white (albus) and black (niger), with orange (aureus), green (viridis), and purple (purpureus) as combinations of two primaries.]]
[[File:Traité_de_la_peinture,_1708.png|thumb|Claude Boutet's 1708 color circle uses the same arrangement of primary and secondary color names as modern RYB color circles.]]
[[File:Le Blon three-color printing.png|thumb|Le Blon's 1725 description of mixing red, yellow, and blue paints or printing inks]]

The first known instance of the RYB triad can be found in the work of [[Franciscus Aguilonius]] (1567–1617), although he did not arrange the colors in a wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Franciscus Aguilonius |work=Colorsystem: &lt;!--different spellings in original--&gt;Colour order systems in art and science |url=http://www.colorsystem.com/?page_id=629&amp;lang=en |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213041900/http://www.colorsystem.com/?page_id=629&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his experiments with light, [[Isaac Newton]] recognized that colors could be created by mixing color primaries. In his ''[[Opticks]]'', Newton published a color wheel to show the geometric relationship between these primaries. This chart was later confused and understood to apply to pigments as well,&lt;ref name=hprint1&gt;{{cite web |last=MacEvoy |first=Bruce |date=April 19, 2009 |title=handprint : color wheels |url=http://handprint.com/HP/WCL/color13.html |accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Newton was also unaware of the differences between additive and subtractive color mixing.&lt;ref name=hprint2&gt;{{cite web |last=MacEvoy |first=Bruce |date=April 19, 2009 |title=handprint : do "primary" colors exist? |url=http://handprint.com/HP/WCL/color6.html#confusions |accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RYB model was used for printing, by [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]], as early as 1725.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

In the 18th century, the RYB primary colors became the foundation of theories of color vision, as the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between [[complementary colors|"complementary"]] or opposing hues that are produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the ''[[Theory of Colors]]'' (1810) by the German poet and government minister [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and ''The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast'' (1839) by the French industrial chemist [[Michel-Eugène Chevreul]].{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Painters have long used more than three RYB primary colors in their palettes, and at one point considered red, yellow, blue and [[green]] to be the ''four'' primaries.&lt;ref&gt;For instance Leonardo da Vinci wrote of these four simple colors in his notebook circa 1500.  See Rolf Kuenhi.  “Development of the Idea of Simple Colors in the 16th and Early 17th Centuries”. ''Color Research and Application''.  Volume 32, Number 2, April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Red, yellow, blue and green are still widely considered the four [[psychological primary color]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stroebel |first1=Leslie D. |last2=Current |first2=Ira B. |year=2000 |title=Basic Photographic Materials and Processes |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=0-240-80345-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRYa6Qpsw48C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Basic+Photographic+Materials+and+Processes}}&lt;/ref&gt; though red, yellow and blue are sometimes listed as the ''three'' psychological primaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ross |first1=MS Sharon |last2=Kinkead |first2=Elise |year=2004 |title=Decorative Painting &amp; Faux Finishes |publisher=Creative Homeowner |isbn=1-58011-179-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPJUWRydR9kC&amp;dq=red+yellow+blue+paint-mixing++subtractive}}&lt;/ref&gt; with black and white occasionally added as a fourth and fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swirnoff |first1=Lois |year=2003 |title=Dimensional Color |publisher=W.

The cyan, magenta, and yellow primary colors associated with [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] printing are sometimes known as "process blue", "process red"{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and "process yellow".{{fact|date=May 2017}}

[[Image:Norman Robert dip circle.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Illustration of magnetic dip from Norman's book, ''The Newe Attractive'']]

'''Robert Norman''' was a 16th-century-[[England|English]] [[sailor|mariner]], [[compass]] builder, and [[hydrographer]] who discovered [[magnetic dip|magnetic inclination]], the deviation of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] from the vertical.

== Work ==

Robert Norman is noted for ''The Newe Attractive'', a pamphlet published in 1581&lt;ref&gt;Published in London by Ballard.  See {{cite book | last = [[Rom Harré|Harré]] | first = [[Rom Harré|R.]] | title = Great Scientific Experiments | publisher = Phaidon (Oxford) | year = 1981 | pages = 49 &amp;ndash; 56 | isbn = 0-7148-2096-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the [[lodestone]] ([[magnet]]) and practical aspects of navigation. More importantly, it included Norman's discovery of [[magnetic dip]], the incline at an angle from the horizon by a compass needle. This effect is caused by the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[magnetic field]] not running parallel to the planet's surface.  Norman demonstrated magnetic dip by creating a compass needle that pivoted on a horizontal axis. The needle tilted at a steep angle relative to the [[horizon]] line. 

Magnetic inclination and local variations were known before Robert Norman, but his pamphlet had a greater influence than the earlier work.

The crater [[Norman (crater)|Norman]] on the [[Moon]] is named in his honour.

Like other X-FELs, SACLA uses [[self-amplified spontaneous emission]] to achieve extremely high intensities of X-rays. SACLA uses in-vacuum, short-period [[undulator]]s, which is one of the unique factors in its design that allows it to achieve sub-Ångstrom wavelengths of 0.6 Å at a relatively much shorter distance of 0.7&amp;nbsp;km, compared to other similar X-FELs like [[LCLS]] (2&amp;nbsp;km) or the [[European x-ray free electron laser|European X-FEL]] (3.4&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=NP /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLAC_ST&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts, Jr.|first1=Glenn|title=A Growth Spurt for X-ray Lasers|url=https://news.slac.stanford.edu/features/growth-spurt-x-ray-lasers|accessdate=1 May 2015|work=SLAC Today|agency=Stanford Linear Accelerator Center|date=17 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022074035/https://news.slac.stanford.edu/features/growth-spurt-x-ray-lasers|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 8.5 GeV electron beam is used as the source.

== Animated Short Films ==
SACLA has released a number of [[anime|animated]] [[short film]]s to promote its research capabilities to the public.

'''Saturn-Apollo 3''' ('''SA-3''') was the third flight of the [[Saturn I]] launch vehicle, the second flight of [[Project Highwater]], and part of the American [[Apollo program]]. The rocket was launched on November 16, 1962, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida.

== History ==

The Saturn I launch vehicle components were delivered to Cape Canaveral by the barge ''Promise'' on September 19, 1962,&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|6}} but erection of the first-stage booster onto its launch pedestal was delayed until September 21 due to a [[1962 Atlantic hurricane season|tropical depression]] that moved over the Florida peninsula.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt; The dummy second and third stages (S-IV and S-V) and payload were assembled on the booster on September 24.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|6}} [[:wikt:ballast|Ballast]] water was loaded into the dummy stages on October 31, and the [[RP-1]] fuel was loaded on November 14.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

For this launch, Cape Canaveral director [[Kurt Debus]] asked Marshall Space Flight Center director [[Wernher von Braun]], who was overseeing the Saturn project, that no outside visitors be allowed on NASA grounds due to the ongoing tensions of the [[Cuban missile crisis]].&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;

== Flight ==

Saturn-Apollo 3 was launched at 17:45:02 on November 16, 1962, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]].&lt;ref name="Ryba2009" /&gt; The only hold in the countdown sequence was for 45 minutes due to a power failure in ground support equipment.&lt;ref name="Brooks1979" /&gt; This mission was the first time the Saturn I rocket was launched with a full load of propellant, carrying approximately {{convert|750000|lb|kg}} of fuel.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight19621122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="montreal19621117" /&gt;

The vehicle's four inner H-1 engines shut down at 2 minutes 21.66 seconds after launch and an altitude of {{convert|61.46|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}}, and its four outer engines shut down at 2 minutes 29.09 seconds and {{convert|71.11|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}}; both sets burned slightly longer than was initially estimated, reaching a maximum velocity of {{convert|4046|mph}}.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The vehicle continued to coast to an altitude of {{convert|167.22|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}} and range of {{convert|211.41|km|mi|disp=flip|sp=us}}, at which point, 4 minutes 52 seconds after launch,&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|10}} officials sent a terminate command to the rocket, setting off several charges which caused the dummy stages of the vehicle to destruct.&lt;ref name="Ryba2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miami19621117" /&gt; The first stage remained intact,&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|66}} though uncontrolled, until it impacted the Atlantic Ocean around {{convert|270|mi}} from its launch site.&lt;ref name="montreal19621117" /&gt;

== Objectives ==

=== Primary ===

The main objectives of SA-3 were much the same as the previous two Saturn I flights in that it was primarily a test of the first-stage booster (S-I) and its H-1 engines. According to the NASA report ''Results of the Third Saturn 1 Launch Vehicle Test Flight'', SA-3 aimed to test four areas: the booster, the ground support equipment, the vehicle in flight, and Project Highwater.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The test of the booster involved the propulsion system, structural design, and control systems. The ground support test involved the facilities and equipment used in the launch, including propellant systems, automatic checkout equipment, launch platform, and support towers. The vehicle in flight test measured aeroballistics, which confirmed values of aerodynamic characteristics such as stability and performance; propulsion, which ensured the engines could provide enough thrust to propel the vehicle at the correct velocity and trajectory, as well as provide data on the performance of all eight engines during flight; structural and mechanical, which provided measurements of the vehicle's stress and vibration levels through all phases of flight; and guidance and control, which demonstrated that spacecraft systems could accurately provide orientation and velocity information.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The fourth objective, Project Highwater, was an experiment previously flown on [[Saturn I SA-2|SA-2]]. This involved the intentional release of ballast water from the second and third stages which allowed scientists to investigate the nature of Earth's [[ionosphere]], as well as [[noctilucent cloud]]s and the behavior of ice in space.&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt;

For Project Highwater, tanks in SA-3's dummy upper stages were filled with {{convert|192528|lb}} of water, approximately {{convert|22900|USgal}}, which was used to simulate the mass of future Saturn payloads.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|3, 66}} The water was divided roughly in half between the two dummy stages. When the terminate command was sent to the rocket, [[primacord]] charges split both stages longitudinally, instantly releasing its load of water.&lt;ref name="Woodbridge1965" /&gt; The experiment was tracked by cameras and other equipment on the ground and in aircraft.&lt;ref name="miami19621117" /&gt; Observers at Cape Canaveral reported that the ice cloud was visible for about three seconds and was "several miles across".&lt;ref name="montreal19621117" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miami19621117" /&gt;

NASA declared all engineering goals of the flight as achieved,&lt;ref name="nssdc-sa3" /&gt; despite occasional issues with telemetry during flight and some measurement data being unusable or only partially usable.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Project Highwater on SA-3 was also declared successful,&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|3}} though again, telemetry issues produced questionable results.&lt;ref name="nssdc-sa3" /&gt;

=== Special ===

The NASA ''Results'' report states that ten special tests were included in the SA-3 flight, all focused on technologies and procedures intended for use on future Apollo missions.

;Propulsion
As mentioned earlier, SA-3 was the first Apollo flight to carry a full load of propellant, compared to earlier flights that carried approximately 83% of maximum capacity. This had the effect of testing the rocket's reaction to slower acceleration and extended first stage flight time.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt; Also on this mission, the outboard engines were allowed to fire until depletion of the rocket's [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX), rather than the timed cut-offs of previous flights.&lt;ref name="Flight19621122" /&gt;

SA-3 also featured the first use of [[retrorocket]]s on Apollo hardware. These were the only functional part on SA-3 of what would become the S-I/S-IV stage separation system, which would separate the two stages in later missions. These four small solid rockets were located 90 degrees apart around the top of the S-I stage, with their nozzles aimed up. At 2 minutes 33.66 seconds after launch, the rockets fired for about 2.1 seconds. A minor misalignment of the rockets caused a 4.3 degree per second roll of the vehicle, which caused the spacecraft's ST-90 and ST-124P inertial platforms to fail after 15 degrees of rotation. This was considered incidental to the flight and did not impact mission success.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

;Instrumentation
The [[ST-124-M3 inertial platform|ST-124P inertial platform]] ('P' for prototype) was a component of the guidance and control system, and contained [[gyroscope]]s and [[accelerometer]]s that fed information to control computers.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Once out of the atmosphere, this information provided steering signals to the gimbaled engines.&lt;ref name="Bilstein1996" /&gt; During SA-3, this platform was an inactive component; while functioning and monitored during the flight, it had no control over the vehicle, and was used only to compare performance with the then-standard ST-90 platform, which was also an inactive component for the flight.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|1, 29}} For this mission, both platforms were located on the interstage between S-I and S-IV;&lt;ref name="Flight19621122" /&gt; [[Saturn IB]] and [[Saturn V]] vehicles would have one on the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] atop the S-IVB stage.&lt;ref name="Seltzer1963" /&gt;

Two new transmitters were included on SA-3. The pulse code modulated (PCM) data link transmitted digital data, which would be vital to providing automated spacecraft checkout and launch procedures on future flights.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt; The unit operated with high signal strength, indicating that it would provide very accurate data.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|60}} An [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) radio link was also tested on SA-3. It would be used to transmit sensor measurements which could not be effectively transmitted at lower frequencies.&lt;ref name="Benson1978" /&gt; The system performed satisfactorily, and post-flight documentation indicated engineers may expand its role for future telemetry transmission.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

A Block II antenna panel was tested during flight. Located between propellant tanks, it provided stronger and more consistent signal strength than the Block I panel.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

Temperature measurements of the S-IV dummy stage and interstage fairing were carried out with eighteen temperature probes, called [[thermocouple]]s. These were used to detect temperature changes around protuberances on the stage's skin and in the area of the retrorockets during operation. For the S-IV stage, temperatures were within expected levels, though a [[heat transfer|heating rate]] around twice that predicted was encountered. On the interstage, during retrorocket firing, a maximum temperature of {{convert|315|C|F|abbr=on}} was seen, indicating something unknown may have caused an abnormally high reading.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

;Engineering and ground equipment
A single panel of Block II M-31 heat shield insulation, along with one of the spacecraft's [[calorimeter]]s, was mounted on the base of the first stage by the engines. This test measured [[heat flux]] through the new insulation compared to the material normally used on Saturn I Block I flights.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|49–51}}

A dynamic pressure study was conducted for the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] program, in which two aluminum panels were mounted to the payload adapter atop the S-V stage and equipped with 11 pressure sensors. This study was performed due to the failure of the first Centaur vehicle flown, suspected to result from an adverse pressure environment around the shoulder of the vehicle. The test found that a very low pressure region formed just behind the shoulder while the vehicle was at Mach 0.7.&lt;ref name="Garcia1964" /&gt;

Finally, a new {{convert|240|ft|0|adj=on}} umbilical tower and Block II swing arm were used for the first time in preparation for future Block II Saturn I flights.&lt;ref name="thirdsaturn1964" /&gt;{{rp|66}}&lt;ref name="Flight19621122" /&gt;

The first launch was on November 19, 1999 and the first manned launch was on October 15, 2003. In March 2005, an asteroid was named [[8256 Shenzhou]] in honour of the spacecraft.

== History ==
{{Main|Shenzhou program}}

China's first efforts at [[human spaceflight]] started in 1968 with a projected launch date of 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/shuuang1.htm|title=Shuguang 1|accessdate=March 4, 2009|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|year=2009|author=Mark Wade|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714161906/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/shuuang1.htm|archivedate=July 14, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China successfully launched an unmanned satellite in 1970, its manned spacecraft program was cancelled in 1980 due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="futron"/&gt;

The Chinese manned spacecraft program was relaunched in 1992 with Project 921. The Phase One spacecraft followed the general layout of the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]], with three modules that could separate for reentry. China signed a deal with Russia in 1995 for the transfer of Soyuz technology, including life support and docking systems. The Phase One spacecraft was then modified with the new Russian technology.&lt;ref name="futron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futron.com/upload/wysiwyg/Resources/Whitepapers/China_n_%20Second_Space_Age_1003.pdf|title=China and the Second Space Age|accessdate=October 6, 2011|publisher=Futron Corporation|year=2003|author=Futron Corp.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419165427/http://www.futron.com/upload/wysiwyg/Resources/Whitepapers/China_n_%20Second_Space_Age_1003.pdf|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general designer of Shenzhou-1 through Shenzhou-5 was Qi Faren (戚发轫, Apr 26, 1933 -), and from Shenzhou-6 on, the general design was turned over to Zhang Bainan (张柏楠, Jun 23, 1962 -).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The first unmanned flight of the spacecraft was launched on November 19, 1999, after which '''Project 921/1''' was renamed '''Shenzhou''', a name reportedly{{by whom|date=July 2012}} chosen by [[Jiang Zemin]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A series of three additional unmanned flights ensued. The first manned launch took place on 15 October 2003 with the [[Shenzhou 5]] mission. The spacecraft has since become the mainstay o the Chinese manned space program, being used for [[Shenzhou program#Missions launched|both manned and unmanned missions]].

== Design ==

Shenzhou consists of three modules: a forward [[orbital module]] (轨道舱), a [[reentry module]] (返回舱) in the middle, and an aft [[service module]] (推进舱). This division is based on the principle of minimizing the amount of material to be returned to Earth. Anything placed in the orbital or service modules does not require [[heat shield]]ing, and this increases the space available in the spacecraft without increasing weight as much as it would if those modules were also able to withstand [[Atmospheric reentry|reentry]]. Thus both Soyuz and Shenzhou have more living area with less weight than the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo CSM]].

=== Orbital module ===
[[File:Shenzhou spacecraft - old OM.png|Shenzhou's Orbital Module prior to S8|thumb|right]]
The [[orbital module]] (轨道舱) contains space for experiments, crew-serviced or operated equipment, and in-orbit habitation. Without [[Space rendezvous|docking]] systems, Shenzhou 1–6 carried different kinds of payload on the top of their orbital modules for scientific experiments.

Up until Shenzhou 8, the orbital module of the Shenzhou was equipped with its own [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]], [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar power]], and [[attitude control (spacecraft)|control]] [[Robotic spacecraft|systems]], allowing autonomous{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} flight. It was possible for Shenzhou to leave an orbital module in orbit for redocking with a later spacecraft, something which the Soyuz cannot do since the only hatch between orbital and reentry modules is a part of reentry module, and orbital module is depressurized after separation. In the future it is possible that the orbital module(s) could also be left behind on the planned Chinese [[project 921/2]] [[space station]] as additional station modules.

In the unmanned test flights launched to date, the orbital module of each Shenzhou was left functioning on orbit for several days after the reentry modules return, and the [[Shenzhou 5]] orbital module continued to operate for six months after launch.

=== Reentry module ===

The [[reentry capsule|reentry module]] (返回舱) is located in the middle section of the spacecraft and contains seating for the crew. It is the only portion of Shenzhou which returns to Earth's surface. Its shape is a compromise between maximizing living space while allowing for some aerodynamic control upon reentry.

=== Service module ===

The aft [[service module]] (推进舱) contains life support and other equipment required for the functioning of Shenzhou. Two pairs of [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]], one pair on the service module, the other pair on the orbital module, have a total area of over 40 m² (430&amp;nbsp;ft²), indicating average electrical power over 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW (''Soyuz'' have 1.0&amp;nbsp;kW).

=== Comparison with Soyuz ===

Although the Shenzhou spacecraft follows the same layout as the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]], it is substantially larger than Soyuz. There is enough room to carry an inflatable boat in case of a water landing, whereas Soyuz astronauts must jump into the water and swim. The commander sits in the center seat on both spacecraft. However, the copilot sits in the left seat on Shenzhou and the right seat on Soyuz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hollingham |first1=Richard |title=Why Europe’s astronauts are learning Chinese |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180626-why-europes-astronauts-are-learning-chinese |work=BBC Future |date=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The theory of symbolic self-completion''' is a [[psychological theory]] which holds that individuals seek to acquire and display [[symbols]] that are strongly related to what they perceive as the ideal self.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wicklund|first1=Robert A.|last2=Gollwitzer|first2=Peter M.|title=Symbolic self-completion.|date=1982|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates|isbn=0898592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, relatively effeminate boys who want to appear macho may use products associated with manliness—such as a strong cologne or a silver watch—in hopes of symbolically fulfilling their self-definitions, i.e. becoming manly. Such cases of symbolic self-completion are seen in internet communication, marketing and advertising, and consumer behavior.

== Origins ==

The theory of symbolic self-completion has its origins in the [[symbolic interactionist]] school of thought. As expressed by [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]] in ''Mind, Self and Society'', symbolic interactionism suggests that the self is defined by the way that society responds to the individual.&lt;ref name="Mind, Self and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=George|title=Mind, Self and Society|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226516684|url=http://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/bu000001.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2014|ref=Mind, Self and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea helped shape the central ideas put forth in the book ''Symbolic Self-Completion'', which states that individuals tend to define themselves using symbols of accomplishment and that they use symbols to communicate their self-definitions to society.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; Depending on the area of self-definition to which these symbols pertain, a different self-definition is thus exhibited.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt;

==Key concepts==

===Self-definitional symbols===

''Self-definitional symbols'' are the objects that individuals use to communicate their self-definitions to society. Symbols can be both material and non-material, including anything ranging from utterances, behaviors, and socially recognized markers such as material possessions and social status.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun|first1=Ottmar L.|last2=Wicklund|first2=Robert A.|title=Psychological Antecedents of Conspicuous Consumption|journal=Journal of Economic Psychology|date=1989|volume=10|pages=161–187|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0167487089900184/1-s2.0-0167487089900184-main.pdf?_tid=9e3083e6-6693-11e4-9494-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1415374672_671bec4cc3ce98724c19e02e8233bd89|accessdate=7 November 2014|doi=10.1016/0167-4870(89)90018-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are defined as "any facet of the person that has the potential to signal to others (who understand the symbol as related to the identity) that one possesses the identity in question."&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt; Because it is through these symbols that individuals build their self-definitions around and communicate them to society, symbols are “the building blocks of self-definition.”&lt;ref name="Gollwitzer"/&gt; Thus, symbols are meaningful to individuals only insofar as they adequately represent individuals’ self-definitions, regarding the status of accomplishment in the areas individuals believe are important to their self-definitions. When individuals lack symbols to express their self-definitions, they seek to “display alternative symbols of attainment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmon-Jones|first1=Cindy|last2=Schmeichel|first2=Brandon J.|last3=Harmon-Jones|first3=Eddie|title=Symbolic self-completion in academia: Evidence from department web pages and email signature files|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=2009|volume=39|pages=311–316|url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_schmeichel_hj_EJSP_symbolic_self_completion.pdf|doi=10.1002/ejsp.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that when individuals are deficient in any self-definitional area, this deficiency produces a state of tension and a sense of incompleteness in their self-definitions.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; Individuals are motivated to reduce this tension by using alternate symbols of accomplishment in the relevant self-definitional area.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; In the study “Symbolic Self-completion, Attempted Influence, and Self-Deprecation,” Robert Wicklund, [[Peter Gollwitzer]] and [[James Hilton (academic administrator)|James Hilton]] asked participants to 1) write an essay teaching people how to perform an activity important to them and then 2) indicate how many people should be required to revise their essays. Results of this study showed that the fewer the years of education or experience participants seemed to have in their respective activities, the higher the number of people participants thought should be required to revise their essays.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gollwitzer|first1=Peter|last2=Wicklund|first2=Robert|title=Symbolic Self-Completion, Attempted Influence, and Self-Depreciation|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=2|issue=2|pages=89–114|url=http://www.interruptions.net/literature/Wicklund-BASP81.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2014|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp0202_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher this number was, the more participants put themselves in a position to influence others; researchers interpreted this relationship as a means of symbolic compensation for lacking the relevant self-definitional area.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt;

An additional part of this study asked a group of men to make a statement about their ability in the self-definitional area. Results of this part of the study showed that the less education and experience the men had, the less willing they were to provide a negative evaluation of themselves.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; This behavior remained consistent, even when the men were told that the attractive female confederate preferred men who were critical of themselves.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; This finding shows people are willing to self-symbolize even when they know the self-symbolizing behavior will be negatively received by society.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; Such findings indicate that individuals are more concerned with whether their behaviors will be reflective of their self-definitions than with whether the behaviors induce positive or negative judgments from others. Altogether, these findings indicate that “influencing others, as well as positive self-descriptions, can further the individual’s sense of having a complete self-definition.”&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt;

===Self-definitional threats===
Individuals' self-definitions can change for purposes of self-esteem protection and maintenance. These changes are likely to occur in consideration of the "relative performance and the psychological
similarity (closeness) and dissimilarity (distance) of others."&lt;ref name=Tesser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tesser|first1=Abraham|last2=Campbell|first2=Jennifer|title=Self-Definition: The Impact of the Relative Performance and Similarity of Others|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=Sep 1980|volume=43|issue=3|pages=341–347|jstor=3033737|doi=10.2307/3033737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain dimensions of individuals' self-definitions can become "less self-definitional" when others who are psychologically similar to them outperforms them in those areas.&lt;ref name="Tesser"/&gt; As such, self-definitions lend themselves to change—however, individuals may opt to strengthen their self-definitions in the face of self-definitional threats. ''Self-definitional threat'' refers to a situation in which individuals feel their identities are uncertain or threatened or they feel insecure in an identity they are committed to.&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Dr. Simon|title=Symbolic Self Completion Theory|url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=292|website=Psychlopedia|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, individuals are more likely to value symbols that reinforce those identities.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The study “Reactions to self-discrepant feedback: Feminist attitude and symbolic self-completion” shows how a threat to one’s identity also motivates individuals to engage in symbolic self-completion as a means of reducing the tension it causes.&lt;ref name="feminist study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiffmann|first1=Rudolf|last2=Nelkenbrecher|first2=Doris|title=Reactions to self-discrepant feedback: Feminist attitude and symbolic self-completion|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=317–327|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420240209/abstract|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420240209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers Rudolf Schiffmann and Doris Nelkenbrecher asked a group of feminist participants to subscribe to a feminist journal after being given feedback on their feminist attitudes.&lt;ref name="feminist study" /&gt; The women who were described as less feminist were more likely to subscribe to the feminist journal as a means of symbolically “completing” their self-definition.&lt;ref name="feminist study" /&gt;

Related to this study is "Psychological Antecedents of Conspicuous Consumption" by Ottmar L. Braun and Wicklund. This study was conducted in six separate studies, the first of which involved interviews of law students and attorneys. This first part of the study found that law students were more likely than practicing attorneys to think that it is important to have the "outward manifestations of an attorney," supporting the idea that individuals "striving toward a particular identity" and are "more inexperienced in that identity realm" are more prone to claim that they "can be recognized as belonging to that identity."&lt;ref name=Braun /&gt;

==Applications==

===Symbolic self-completion in Internet communication===
More recent studies have shown how symbolic self-completion influences individuals' communication in online media platforms. For example, Cindy and Eddie Harmon-Jones and Brandon Schmeichel have shown how individuals’ need for self-definition affects whether they share symbols of self-definitional attainment online.&lt;ref name="internet study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmon-Jones|first1=Cindy|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=Eddie|last3=Brandon|first3=Schmeichel|title=Symbolic self-completion in academia: Evidence from department web pages and email signature files|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2008|volume=39|pages=311–316|url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_schmeichel_hj_EJSP_symbolic_self_completion.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.1002/ejsp.541}}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers examined academic web pages and email signature files to see what types of academic departments and professors were more likely to enlist professional titles.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt; The researchers found that the lower an academic department was ranked within National Research Council Rankings, the higher the number of professional titles the professors in that department displayed in their websites.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt; Similarly, the lower the annual rate of publications and citations professors seemed to have, the higher the number of professional titles they enlisted in their email signatures. These correlations suggest that the enlistment of professional titles online serve as alternate symbols of accomplishment in their self-definitional areas; the more they felt they were lacking in a certain area, the more likely they were to engage in symbolic self-completion online regarding that particular area.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt;

=== Symbolic self-completion in advertising ===
[[File:Old spice deodorant body spray.jpg|thumb|Old spice deodorant body spray]]
The theory of symbolic self-completion has direct application in the [[advertisement]] industry. The [[mass media|media]] leads consumers to equate advertised products targeting their feelings of “incompleteness” with self-definitional symbols to make up for that incompleteness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliott|first1=Richard|last2=Wattanasuwan|first2=Kritsadarat|title=Consumption and the Symbolic Project of the Self|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=11147|website=acrwebsite.org|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|accessdate=31 October 2014|ref=(10)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symbols that each consumer ascribes to may be different in every case, these symbols as a whole can nonetheless be used to improve the individual consumers' perception of themselves. The product-symbols give some consumers a sense of completeness, since “self-perceptions are influenced by product use/ownership when the product has a strong user image and the consumer does not have a well formed self-image.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Newell|last2=Claiborne|first2=C.|last3=Sirgy|first3=M.|title=The Effects of Product Symbolism on Consumer Self Concept|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=7315|website=acrwebsite.org|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|accessdate=31 October 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a deodorant advertisement may appeal to a male consumer's self-definitional need for masculinity, by suggesting that he will become more masculine if he uses the deodorant advertised.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; The Old Spice brand famously uses phrases such as "smell like a man, man" when advertising their products. The "Smell Like A Man, Man" campaign led to Old Spice becoming the number one brand of deodorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smell Like A Man, Man Campaign|url=https://www.pg.com/en_US/downloads/innovation/factsheet_OldSpice.pdf|website=P&amp;G|publisher=Procter and Gamble|accessdate=21 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By displaying these product-symbols, consumers improve their sense of self and feel more confident about how others might perceive them.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

=== Symbolic self-completion and materialism ===
Braun and Wicklund suggest that there is a "compensatory relation between person's security" and certain kinds of conspicuous consumption, but that these relations cannot exist without individuals' perceived "incompleteness [of]" and "commitment to the identity in question."&lt;ref name=Braun /&gt; Thus, much of what is colloquially referred to as the “mid-life crisis” can be explained by the theory of symbolic self-completion. A classic example of the mid-life crisis is a 40-year-old man buying a red sports car. The man is unsure as to whether he has made the right choices in his life and if he has been leading a successful career. The man then counters his insecurity by purchasing a material object that functions as a status symbol, something that both he and others will recognize as a mark of success.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The relationship between self-completion theory and materialism is further shown through individuals' tendency to externalize their concerns about their lives by acquiring symbol-objects that reinforce and improve their self-definitions.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; In terms of goods/objects as individuals' status symbols, greater emphasis is placed on tangible, material objects, as they can be recognized and understood as status symbols by a wider audience than are intangible and abstract ideas. In the same vein, materialism reinforces symbolic self-completion particularly in a societies that are structure in such a way that the consumption of prestigious objects is seen as the best remedy for insecurity. This reinforcement is due to the fact that in such societies, individuals see material wealth as the best source of comforting reassurance to counter insecurity&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

'''The Plant List''' is a list of [[botanical name]]s of species of plants created by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] and launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="discovery news"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/plant-database-library-101229.html | title=World's Largest Plants Database Assembled | publisher=[[Discovery News|discovery.com]] | date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to be a comprehensive record of all known names of plant species over time.

There is a complementary project called the [[International Plant Names Index]], in which Kew is also involved.  The IPNI aims to provide details of publication and does not aim to determine which are accepted species names. Newly published names are automatically added from IPNI to the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]], a database which underlies the Plant List.

==Findings==
The Plant List has 1,064,035 scientific [[plant]] names of [[species]] rank.&lt;ref name="The Plant List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theplantlist.org/ | title=Summary Statistics | work=The Plant List | accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 350,699 are accepted species names, belonging to 642 plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and 17,020 plant [[genus|genera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/science/i81521.html|title=US, British scientists drew up the comprehensive list of world's known land plants|publisher=CBC }} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Plant List accepts approximately 350,699 unique species, with 470,624 [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s for those species, which suggests that many species have been referred to under more than one name.  {{As of|2014}}, The Plant List has determined that another 243,000 names are 'unresolved', meaning that botanists have so far been unable to determine whether they are a separate species or a duplication of the 350,699 unique species.

==Public attention==
When The Plant List was launched in 2010 (the [[International Year of Biodiversity]]), it attracted media attention for its comprehensive approach. [[Fox News]] highlighted the number of synonyms encountered, suggesting that this reflected a "surprising lack" of biodiversity on earth."&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/12/30/worlds-plant-life-far-diverse-previously-thought/#ixzz19t9BPqzQ|title=World's Plant Life Far Less Diverse Than Previously Thought|publisher=Fox News | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Plant List also attracted attention for building on the work of [[English people|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]], who in the 1880s started a plant list called the [[Index Kewensis]] (IK).
Kew has added an average of 6,000 species every year since the IK was first published with 400,000 names of species.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;  However, the IK (which by 1913 avoided making taxonomic judgement in its citations) is currently run as part of the IPNI rather than the Plant List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.ipni.org/ik_blurb.html  | title = About the Index Kewensis  | accessdate =  | author =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | date =   | year = 2004  | month =   | work =   | publisher = [[International Plant Names Index]]  | quote =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe''''' is a weekly, 80-minute [[podcast]] hosted by [[Steven Novella]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], and a panel of "[[Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] rogues". It is the official podcast of the [[New England Skeptical Society]]. The show features discussions of recent scientific developments [[Wiktionary:in layman's terms|in layman's terms]], and interviews authors, people in the area of science and other famous skeptics. The show also includes discussions of [[Urban myth|myths]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[pseudoscience]], the [[paranormal]], and many general forms of superstition, from the point of view of [[scientific skepticism]]. [[Steven Novella]], the host of the show, has been particularly active in debunking pseudoscience in medicine. His activities include opposing the claims of [[Vaccine controversy|anti-vaccine activists]], [[homeopathy]] practitioners and individuals [[HIV/AIDS denialism|denying the link between HIV and AIDS]].&lt;ref name="pmid18199017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Novella S, Roy R, Marcus D, Bell IR, Davidovitch N, Saine A |title=A debate: homeopathy—quackery or a key to the future of medicine? |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=9–15 |year= 2008|pmid=18199017 |doi=10.1089/acm.2007.0770}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18194763"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gold PW, Novella S, Roy R, Marcus D, Bell I, Davidovitch N, Saine A |title=Homeopathy—quackery or a key to the future of medicine? |journal=Homeopathy |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |year=2008 |pmid=18194763 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17713982"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith TC, Novella SP |title=HIV Denial in the Internet Era |journal=PLoS Med |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e256 |year=2007 |pmid=17713982 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256 |pmc=1949841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The show is prerecorded via a [[Skype]] conference call. Each caller records their own audio and then the locally recorded tracks are mixed together. Steven Novella does the editing and post-production of the show himself. British comedian and skeptic [[Iszi Lawrence]] provides voice-over introductions for the show and certain segments.

=== Segments ===
; Opening:  The Skeptics' Guide opens with Steven Novella introducing each panelist in attendance, typically leading to the retrospective segment "This Day in Skepticism". The panelists then discuss that week's top news stories of concern to skeptics. This is generally followed with answering of listener email.

; "What's the Word": Cara Santa Maria presents a technical word, discussing the history and etymology of the word and how it currently applies to various scientific disciplines.

;[[File:Live at the Australian Skeptics National Convention 2014.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The SGU at 2014 Australian Skeptics National Convention. From left to right: George Hrab, Evan Bernstein, Rebecca Watson, Steven Novella, Jay Novella, Bob Novella, and Richard Saunders.]]

;"Forgotten Superheroes of Science": Bob Novella describes a notable scientific figure from the past who is not well-known, ending with an encouragement to mention the figure to your friends when discussing their obscure area of expertise.

; "Who's That Noisy?": A [[Media clip|sound clip]] is played for listeners to guess what, or who it is.  This segment was originally hosted by Bernstein, but is currently hosted by Jay Novella.

; "A Quickie with Bob": Any of the rogues (apart from Bob) can ask for 'a quickie with Bob' who will then address an issue of current scientific news. Tends to happen before the interview section in around one minute, to a set length piece of background music.

; Interview: Most weeks the panel interview a guest skeptic or scientist.

; "Science or Fiction":  Steven Novella presents the panelists with three recent stories of a scientific nature, one of which is fiction. The co-hosts then have to use their knowledge of science and skeptical senses to figure out which story is fiction. The fake story may either be a complete fabrication or based on a factual story with a critical detail changed to make it fictitious. "Science or Fiction" is occasionally themed, such that all stories discuss similar topics.

; "Skeptical Quote": The show closes with Jay Novella reading a quote from a famous person that is relevant to skepticism or science. Bob did the first skeptical quote although it wasn't really specific to any one of the rogues. ("Isaac Asimov. A scientist fiction writer of some note.") Jay announces the source in an exaggerated radio announcer voice. On May 10, 2008 host Steven Novella  posted a survey on the SGU message board asking listeners if they preferred Jay read the source of the quote before or after the reading of the quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Novella, Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Topic: Skeptical Quote Survey|publisher=The Skeptics Guide to the Universe Forum|url=http://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,10521.msg236235.html#msg236235|date=May 10, 2008|accessdate=April 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting is open ended.

Only since 2010, has the "Who's That Noisy?" segment been before the interview; pre-2010, it was just before the "Skeptical Quote".

Most podcasts last around 80 minutes but on September 23, 2011 SGU produced a 24-hour-long podcast with contributions by skeptics from around the world. It was referred to as SGU-24.

==== Occasional and defunct segments ====
; "Guest Rogue": Since the start of 2010, sometimes, instead of having an interview, the Skeptic's Guide will invite a "guest rogue" to be present throughout the show including the news and "Science or Fiction" segments, as if they were one of the cast.

; "Skeptical Puzzle": At the end of the show, Evan Bernstein used to present the listeners with a skeptical puzzle, usually about some person or topic within the field of [[pseudoscience]]. Occasionally the puzzle was presented in verse, and on Episode 96 it was presented as if by a fictional skeptical rapper Kom’n Cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=96|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204827/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=96|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-27|work=Official Skeptics' Guide Site|title=Episode 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listeners would answer the puzzle via email or on the message board. Recognition (albeit no actual cash prize or gift) was given the following week to the first person to correctly answer the puzzle. The Skeptical puzzle has been discontinued since episode #130 to allow Evan to concentrate on other areas including SGU 5x5, though he has since occasionally offered a logic puzzle in lieu of "Who's That Noisy?".

; This Day in History: Until 2015, the first segment after introductions was a description of a historical event of scientific or skeptical importance whose anniversary falls on the date of recording or the date the podcast is released.

; "Randi Speaks": As of September 20, 2006, [[James Randi]] joined the podcast providing a pre-recorded commentary segment called "Randi Speaks". Randi, a professional magician and skeptic, expounds upon a topic on his mind for that week which may or may not have to do with skeptical matters. The segment disappeared for a period but returned for the August 8, 2007 episode with a different format. Instead of Randi delivering a prepared essay, an SGU host asks Randi a question which Randi then answers and expands upon.

; "Name That Logical Fallacy": Steven Novella regularly presents the panelists with a recent argument, usually of a pseudoscientific nature, that has either appeared in recent news or has been submitted by listeners for consideration. The panelists are challenged to point out the flaws in the presented argument, with specific references to any [[informal fallacy|logical fallacies]] employed. The segment debuted during Episode 40 but it is not featured in every show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcast-042606.html |title=Episode 40| work=Official Skeptics' Guide web site]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the fallacies named are taken from the show's "Top 20 Logical Fallacies" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theskepticsguide.org/logicalfallacies.asp | work =Official Skeptics' Guide web site]| title = Top 20 Logical Fallacies | last = Novella | first = Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Swindlers List": Starting on May 21, 2011, Jay Novella talks about a particular scam he has discovered or been told about. The first scam featured in this section was Bidsell.com.&lt;ref&gt;The Skeptics' Guide To The Universe - Podcast 305 - 5/18/2011 [http://theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;pid=305 Episode Show Notes]&lt;/ref&gt;

; "The Dumbest Thing I Heard All Week": Steve Novella occasionally recounts a subpar article he read during the past week and explains what is wrong with it.

=== Theme music ===
The show's theme music is "Theorem" by the San Francisco rock band, Kineto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/kineto Kineto's Myspace page]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was acquired from the [[Podsafe Music Network]]. Prior to the November 2, 2005 show, [[Thomas Dolby]]'s "[[She Blinded Me with Science]]" was the show's theme.

== Guests ==
&lt;!-- In case it's not obvious the list is chronological --&gt;
Many Skeptics' Guide episodes contain [[interview]]s. Often the interviews feature well-known scientists or skeptics, for instance [[Massimo Pigliucci]] or [[Joe Nickell]]. Rarely the guests are proponents of [[fringe science|fringe]] or [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] views. Notable guests include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu | title = Episode list | website=theskepticsguide.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsors and membership ==
On July 30, 2013, Dr. Steven Novella announced that the SGU would begin offering membership and airing sponsors. Dr. Novella went on to say that the money raised would go into funding skeptical activities, including but not limited to, development of skeptical educational content and web-series such as "Occ The Skeptical Caveman." The addition of sponsors is not permanent, according to Dr. Novella, they shall be removed "if 4% of listeners support the SGU through membership at an average of the $8 per month level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-sgu-and-skeptical-activism/ |title= The SGU and Skeptical Activism |publisher= Neurologica Blog |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Though membership has begun, the SGU continues to publish a free weekly sponsored podcast. Membership entitles one to an ad-free version of The SGU, extra content, and discounts to NECSS (The Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism). Membership range from $4/month to $200/month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theskepticsguide.org/member-subscription |title= Member Subscription |publisher= The Skeptics Guide To The Universe |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe'' book ==
In a 2017 interview, SGU team member Evan Bernstein announced in an interview for [[Skeptical Inquirer]] with [[Susan Gerbic]] that the team had collaborated on a book, and it was expected to be available in the fall of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|title=An Interview with CSICon Speaker Evan Bernstein|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_csicon_speaker_evan_bernstein|website=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=CSI|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, titled ''The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake'', became available for [[pre-order]] in early 2018, and is due to be released by [[Grand Central Publishing]] on October 2.&lt;ref name=Amazon&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake|url=https://www.amazon.com/Skeptics-Guide-Universe-Really-Increasingly/dp/1538760533|website=Amazon.com|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180430230139/https://www.amazon.com/Skeptics-Guide-Universe-Really-Increasingly/dp/1538760533|archivedate=30 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazon.com pre-order advertisement included the following information:
{{Quote|text=In this tie-in to their incredibly popular "The Skeptics Guide to the Universe" podcast, Steven Novella, MD, along with "Skeptical Rogues" Bob Novella, Cara Santa Maria, Jay Novella, and Evan Bernstein will explain the tenets of skeptical thinking and debunk some of the biggest scientific myths, fallacies and conspiracy theories (Anti-vaccines, homeopathy, UFO sightings, etc.) [...] It covers essential critical thinking skills, as well as giving insight into how your brain works and how to avoid common pitfalls in thinking...&lt;ref name = Amazon/&gt;}}

The book was released in October, 2018. [[Publishers Weekly]] reviewed the book, stating: "In plain English and cogent prose, Novella makes skepticism seem mighty, necessary, and accessible all at once... Empowering and illuminating, this thinker’s paradise is an antidote to spreading anti-scientific sentiments. Readers will return to its ideas again and again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review: The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe: How to Know What’s Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-5387-6051-2 |website=Publishersweekly.com |publisher=Publishers Weekly |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil deGrasse Tyson|Neil deGrasse Tyson's]] review says: "Thorough, informative, and enlightening, ''The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe'' inoculates you against the frailties and shortcomings of human cognition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1272">The '''triose phosphate translocator''' is an integral membrane protein found in the inner membrane of [[chloroplasts]]. It exports triose phosphate ([[Dihydroxyacetone phosphate]]) in exchange for inorganic phosphate and is therefore classified as an [[antiporter]]. The imported phosphate is then used for ATP regeneration via the light-dependent-reaction; the ATP may then for example be used for further reactions in the Calvin-cycle.The Translocator protein is responsible for exporting all the [[carbohydrate]] produced in [[photosynthesis]] by plants and therefore most of the carbon in food that one eats has been transported by the triose phosphate translocator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Walters | first1 = R.| last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = D.| last3 = Horton | first3 = P.| last4 = Kruger | first4 = N.| title = A mutant of Arabidopsis lacking the triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator reveals metabolic regulation of starch breakdown in the light| journal = Plant Physiology| volume = 135| issue = 2| pages = 891–906| year = 2004| pmid = 15173568| pmc = 514124| doi = 10.1104/pp.104.040469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upham worked as a geologist in [[New Hampshire]] before moving in 1879 to [[Minnesota]] to study the resources and glacial geology of that state.  Upham's first major report on Lake Agassiz was published in 1890 by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], but the main product of his many years of study ("The Glacial Lake Agassiz") was published in 1895 as ''Monograph 25'' of the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey's]] monograph series.

Upham graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1871 and worked under Minnesota state geologist [[Newton Horace Winchell|Newton H. Winchell]]. The Minnesota Historical Society published his landmark 735-page volume on place name origins, [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100561023 ''Minnesota Geographic Names: Their Origin and Historic Significance''] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;  A revised and enlarged third edition of this monumental work was published by the Minnesota Historical Society in 2001.

==Biography==

===Early years and academic education===
Sarig was born in [[Tel-Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agri.gov.il/he/pages/655.aspx Yoav Sarig - Volcani Center]&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the [[Technion]] in 1962 and his Master's degree from the Technion in 1972. Sarig was awarded his doctorate from [[Michigan State University]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartanhistory.kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/1/4/1-4-13DC-54-S201_1976W.pdf COMMENCEMENT 1976 MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biosystems Engineering |url=http://www.egr.msu.edu/age/documents/news_archives/alumni/alumniNewsletter2004.pdf |issue=Fall 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328061546/http://www.egr.msu.edu/age/documents/news_archives/alumni/alumniNewsletter2004.pdf |archivedate=March 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his doctoral thesis was ''Deformation analysis of foam-encapsulated apples under impact loading''.

===Research interests===
Working for Israel's [[Agricultural Research In Israel#The Agricultural Research Organization .28ARO.29|Volcani Centre]], where he headed the Institute for Agricultural Engineering from 1985 to 1988, Sarig developed apparatus including a mechanical pollinator for [[Date Palm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=8557430 Development of a ground-operated mechanical pollinator for date palms]&lt;/ref&gt; an apparatus for separating pomegranate seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mail.google.com/_/scs/mail-static/_/js/k=gmail.main.en.8uTzk32xSXg.O/m=m_i,t,it/am=PiP-WsD83_uDuM4QgHbpIxX23n9-95FiZw-P_9-bACLrCuD_Zv8P4P_gvWgLBQ/rt=h/d=1/t=zcms/rs=AHGWq9A1lOeR1nQ5Gr6OXiIi5rrTTVLvvw|title=Pomegranate "sheller" made in Israel|newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=December 21, 2011|first=Zac|last=Sarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4530278&amp;id=bBs9AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=y+sarig+y-sarig Apparatus for separating pomegranate seeds]&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical cracker for [[Macadamia]] nuts and a machine for harvesting agricultural produce from the ground suitable for Pecan nuts and similar produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4211062&amp;id=Q4I3AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=y+sarig+y-sarig Machine for harvesting agricultural produce]&lt;/ref&gt;
In later years, his interest turned to non-invasive methods for evaluation of agricultural produce - to assess a product's readiness for harvest or its ripeness without harming the fruit. He pioneered the use of  [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]] (NMR) to evaluate the maturity of [[Avocado]] fruits, and the use of an "artificial nose" utilizing the [[olfactory]] response of fresh produce as a consumer-oriented and non-destructive quality evaluation method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/ag/2000/00000077/00000003/art00566 Artificial Olfactory Sensing for Quality Evaluation of Fresh Produce]&lt;/ref&gt; He also researched the use of mechanization and automation as an alternative to [[Manual labour|manual labor]] in agriculture, and published several articles on the topic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alternatives to Immigrant Labor?|url = http://cis.org/FarmMechanization-ImmigrationAlternative|website = Center for Immigration Studies|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded that as long as cheap [[Migrant worker|immigrant labor]] (some of it illegal)  was available , there is little incentive for farmers to invest in labor-saving agricultural automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Productivity and immigration|url = http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/sep/30/20060930-095009-6408r/|website = The Washingtion Times|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
When [[China]] in 1992 formally established [[Foreign relations of Israel#China|diplomatic relations]] with Israel and an Israeli embassy was opened in [[Beijing]], Sarig was appointed Science and Agriculture [[Consul (representative)|Counsellor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health Care in Rural China: Lessons from HeBei Province|page=xi|first=Ofra|last=Anson|publisher=[[Ashgate]]|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1996/rt9611/961117/11200007.htm|title = COMING CRISIS - DECLINING GRAIN SUPPLIES AND A RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION THREATEN TO CREATE A HUNGRY WORLD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY|last = |first = |date = November 17, 1996|work = Roanoke Times|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a role he held for 4 years, from 1993 to 1997. There, Sarig proposed and oversaw the establishment of three major demonstration farms in China, which showcase Israeli agricultural technology, and several training centers which are supported by both the Chinese and Israeli ministries of agriculture. Sarig also realized the significance of conducting a variety of management courses in China, and instituted a program to deliver courses in business, marketing and business management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Mashav%20%E2%80%93%20International%20Development/Publications/1999/How%20Do%20You%20Say%20Business%20in%20Mandarin How Do You Say Business in Mandarin]&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the title "Honorary Professor"  by [[China Agricultural University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Noticias de MASHAV |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFAES/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/1/Noticias%2520de%2520MASHAV |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2015-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018063005/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFAES/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/1/Noticias%2520de%2520MASHAV |archivedate=October 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
