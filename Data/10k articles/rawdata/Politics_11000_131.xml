      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6151">The '''100 years of women in transport''' campaign (YOWIT) is a celebration of the significant role that women have played in the transport industry over the past 100 years in the [[United Kingdom]], following the centennial anniversary of the [[First World War]], when 100,000 women entered the [[transport]] industry to take on the responsibilities held by men who enlisted for military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/nov/08/world-war-women-workplace-public-services|title=Women in wartime: the rise of the female public servant|author =Sarah Dawood|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/assets/downloads/pdfs/Yearbook_2014-15_optimised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infrastructure-intelligence.com/article/jun-2014/first-100-years-women-transport|title=The first 100 years of women in transport|website=Infrastructure Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Board of Audit'''|会計検査院|Kaikeikensain}} reviews government expenditures and submits an annual report to the [[National Diet|Diet]]. Article 90 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] and the Board of Audit Act of 1947 give this body substantial independence from both [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] control. 

In 1968, it hosted the [[International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions|INCOSAI]] VI, the sixth triennial convention of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The headquarters is located at 3-2-2 Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8941, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Audit website|url=http://www.jbaudit.go.jp/english/index.html|publisher=Board of Audit|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origins of the Board of Audit can be traced back to a division established in 1869 under the [[Daijō-kan]]. It was reorganized as an auditing organ under the Daijō-kan in 1880.&lt;ref name="Board of Audit | History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Board|url=http://www.jbaudit.go.jp/english/jbaudit/history.html|website=Board of Audit of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 90 of the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution of 1947]] states: "Final accounts of the expenditures and revenues of the State shall be audited annually by a Board of Audit and submitted by the Cabinet to the Diet, together with the statement of audit, during the fiscal year immediately following the period covered." The original Japanese uses the word ''subete'' to indicate that all state expenditures and revenues are subject to audit.  In 2013, the [[Abe Shinzō|Abe government]] tried to circumvent this under the [[State Secrecy Law]], but relented in 2015.{{sfn|Jones|2016}}

'''Clearview''', also known as '''Clearview Hwy''', is the name of a [[Vox-ATypI classification#Humanist 2|humanist]] [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] family for [[Traffic sign|guide sign]]s on [[road]]s in the [[United States]]. It has also been used in Canada, Indonesia, the Philippines, Israel, and Sri Lanka. It was developed by independent researchers with the help of the [[Texas Transportation Institute]] and the [[Pennsylvania Transportation Institute]], under the supervision of the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA). It was once expected to replace the [[Highway Gothic|FHWA typefaces]] in many applications, although newer studies of its effectiveness have called its benefits into question.&lt;ref name=yaffa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grays Harbor Denial" /&gt;

Initial testing indicated that Clearview was 2 to 8 percent more legible in both day- and night-time viewing than the then-dominant Series E (Modified) on overhead signs, particularly benefiting older drivers, with a 6 percent increase in legibility distance.&lt;ref name="CastroHorberry2004"/&gt; A design goal of Clearview was the reduction of irradiation effects of retroreflective sign materials.&lt;ref name="CastroHorberry2004"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Castro| first1=Candida| last2=Horberry|first2=Tim | title=The Human Factors of Transport Signs| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFCZ53i5XXgC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=18 December 2013 |date=14 April 2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-45741-2|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced nighttime overglow or haloing was expected also to improve recognition rates for computer road sign detection.&lt;ref name="LiWang2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Li|first1=Li|last2=Wang| first2=Fei-Yue | author2-link= Fei-Yue Wang | title=Advanced Motion Control and Sensing for Intelligent Vehicles | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84qWTL_usD4C&amp;pg=PA375 | accessdate=18 December 2013|date=24 November 2007 | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-387-44409-3 | page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these tests also compared new signs in Clearview to existing, weathered signs in the existing [[Highway Gothic]] font.&lt;ref name="Verge2016"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The feds are killing off Clearview, the new highway sign font|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10919686/clearview-highway-font-fhwa-highway-gothic|website = The Verge|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new font's apparent legibility "was more due to the fact that older, worn signs were being replaced with nice, fresh, clean signs which were, naturally, more legible." Better testing also revealed that legibility was worse for negative contrast signs (dark lettering on light backgrounds) such as on speed limit and yellow warning signs.&lt;ref name="Verge2016" /&gt;

==History==
[[Image:ClearviewBGS-I696W-I275-I96.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A Clearview highway sign in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]], installed in 2005 near the terminus of westbound [[Interstate 696|I-696]]. Note that numerals within the shields use the traditional FHWA typeface [[Highway Gothic]].]]
The standard FHWA typefaces, developed in the 1940s, were designed to work with a system of highway signs in which almost all words are capitalized; its standard mixed-case form (Series E Modified) was designed to be most visible under the now-obsolete reflector system of [[button copy]], which has since been superseded by [[retroreflective sheeting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Forbes |first1= Theodore W. |last2= Moskowitz |first2= Karl |last3= Morgan |first3= Glen |lastauthoramp= yes |chapter= A Comparison of Lower Case and Capital Letters for Highway Signs |title= Proceedings of the Highway Research Board |year= 1950 |pages= 355–373}}{{Full citation needed|date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;The designers of Clearview sought to create a typeface adapted for mixed-case signage, initially expecting it would be based on an existing European sans-serif typeface.&lt;ref&gt;Meeker and Associates / Terminal Design, Inc. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041206184721/http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/index.php ClearviewHWY Research &amp; Design Development]. Retrieved on 15 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, using a similar weight to the FHWA fonts, a new font was created from scratch. Two key differences are much larger [[Counter (typography)|counter]] spaces, the enclosed spaces in letters like the lower case "e" or "a", and a higher [[x-height]], the relative height of the lower case "x" to the upper case "X". Smaller counter spaces in the FHWA fonts reduced legibility, particularly when the letters glowed from headlight illumination at night.  The typeface's general appearance resembles the design of the [[Transport typeface]] family, designed by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]] in 1957&amp;ndash;63 for the British highway sign system.

Clearview was granted interim approval by the FHWA for use on positive-contrast road signs (light legend on dark background, such as white on black, green, blue, brown, purple or red) on September 2, 2004,&lt;ref name=fha2004&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Federal Highway Administration | url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/res-ia_clearview_font.htm | title=Interim Approval for Use of Clearview Font for Positive Contrast Legends on Guide Signs | date=2 September 2004 | accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though not on negative-contrast road signs (dark legend on light background, such as black on white, yellow or orange), given its inferior legibility to the existing FHWA typefaces in these applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-4984-1.pdf | title = Evaluation of the Clearview Font for Negative Contrast Traffic Signs | date = January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FHWA also refused to add Clearview to the 2009 [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]], citing lack of testing on Clearview's numerals, symbols, and narrower typefaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Federal Register|74|66740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, FHWA indicated it expected to rescind Interim Approval to use Clearview in the future,&lt;ref name="Grays Harbor Denial"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kehrli|first=Mark R.|title=IA-5.31 - Clearview - Grays Harbor County, WA (DENIED)|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.atssa.com/Resources/Interpretation+Letters/IA-5.31+%28DENIED%29+Clearview-Grays+Harbor+Co+WA-REPLY.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually doing so in January 2016.&lt;ref name="Nadeau"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadeau|first1=Gregory G.|title=Notice of Termination of Interim Approval IA-5|journal=Federal Register|date=25 January 2016|volume=81|issue=15|pages=4083–4084|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/01/25/2016-01383/national-standards-for-traffic-control-devices-the-manual-on-uniform-traffic-control-devices-for|accessdate=31 January 2016|publisher=Office of the Federal Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress ordered the FHWA to reinstate the interim approval on March 28, 2018.&lt;ref name=knopp2018&gt;{{cite web|last=Knopp|first=Martin C.|date=March 28, 2018|title=Information: MUTCD – Interim Approval for Use of Clearview Font for Positive Contrast Legends on Guide Signs (IA-5)—Reinstatement [HOTO-1]|url=https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia5/ia5_reinstatement.pdf|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|access-date=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the US, Clearview has been adopted in Canada where it has been the standard typeface for signs in [[British Columbia]] since 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/Circulars/All/T_Circ/2006/t15-06_v3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205191659/http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/Circulars/All/T_Circ/2006/t15-06_v3.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used for street signs in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2013/05/torontos-gorgeous-old-street-signs-might-soon-be-sale/5545/|title=Toronto's Gorgeous Old Street Signs Might Soon Be for Sale|work=CityLab|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearview has been adopted as the standard typeface for road signs in Indonesia since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://kemhubri.dephub.go.id/perundangan/images/stories/doc/permen/2014/pm_13_tahun_2014.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, Ontario's MTO has started using Clearview on some signs on the QEW.

==Variants==
In addition to its appearance on road signage, a customized version of the ClearviewText typeface was adopted by [[AT&amp;T]] for corporate use, including advertising, used from 2006 to 2016.&lt;ref name="yaffa"/&gt; ClearviewText and ClearviewADA are versions of the typeface intended for use in general graphic design and [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-compliant]] signage.  An example of ClearviewADA in use is signage at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]].&lt;ref name="dfwairport"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://fontsinuse.com/uses/11519/dallas-fort-worth-international-airport-wayfi | title=Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport wayfinding | work=Fonts In Use | date=January 7, 2016 | accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==

===United States===
Between 20 and 30 states have adopted the use of the typeface as of 2013.&lt;ref name=murphy2013&gt;{{cite news | title=New font making signs more visible | last=Murphy | first=Matt | work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] | date=26 December 2013 | url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/News/201312250043 | accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strizver2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strizver|first=Ilene|title=Type Rules: The Designer's Guide to Professional Typography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sY5HAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=18 December 2013|date=7 October 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74869-5|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mutcd&gt;{{ cite web | title=List of approved requests for interim approval – FHWA MUTCD | work=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) | publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]], U.S. Department of Transportation | url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ialistreq.htm#ia5 | accessdate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the official font recommended for use by the FHWA and states were required to request interim approval from the Federal Highway Administration to use the font.&lt;ref name=murphy2013/&gt;

On January 25, 2016, the Federal Highway Administration issued a notice in the [[Federal Register]] of the agency's intent to rescind interim approval for use of the Clearview font in 30 days.&lt;ref name="Nadeau" /&gt; FHWA discussed the current state of road signage research and concluded that "the consistent finding
among all the research evaluations is that the brightness of the retroreflective sheeting is the primary factor in nighttime legibility."&lt;ref name="Nadeau" /&gt;  Even worse, significant misunderstandings and misapplications of the interim approval for Clearview were resulting in badly designed non-uniform signs that violated the uniformity central to the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]].&lt;ref name="Nadeau" /&gt; Accordingly, the notice concluded, "FHWA does not intend to pursue further consideration, development, or support of an alternative letter style."&lt;ref name="Nadeau" /&gt; This rescindment drew negative response from government officials as well as one of the typeface's designers.&lt;ref name="114-606"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.congress.gov/114/crpt/hrpt606/CRPT-114hrpt606.pdf | title=House Report 114-606| work=[[United States House of Representatives]] | date=7 June 2016 | accessdate=26 September 2016 |quote=FHWA is directed to suspend enforcement of actions terminating the interim approval of this alternate font for highway guide signs until the agency provides an opportunity for public comment on this matter, and documents the safety and cost implications of this decision for affected states.

The FHWA reinstated the interim approval on March 28, 2018,&lt;ref name=knopp2018/&gt; per Section 125 of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018]].

===Canada===
The Transportation Association of Canada's [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices#Other jurisdictions|MUTCD for Canada]] allows the use of Clearview, and the [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] uses it for positive contrast guide signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Now you see it!

===Indonesia===
The Ministry of Transportation promulgated a regulation in 2014 to introduce new [[Road signs in Indonesia|road signs]] that would use the Clearview typeface.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141343/http://kemhubri.dephub.go.id/perundangan/images/stories/doc/permen/2014/pm_13_tahun_2014.pdf Ministerial Regulation No. 13/2014 about Traffic Signs].

'''Coalició Compromís''' ({{IPA-ca|koalisiˈo kompɾoˈmis|va}}; {{lang-en|Commitment Coalition or Compromise Coalition}})&lt;ref&gt;Landsford, T. (2014) ''Political Handbook of the World 2014'', p. 1343 {{ISBN|978-1-4833-3328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ávila López, E. (2016) ''Modern Spain'', p. 85 {{ISBN|978-1-61069-600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Valencianism|Valencianist]] [[list of political parties in Spain|political party]], originally an [[electoral coalition]], in the [[Valencian Community]], [[Spain]]. The parties involved include the [[Valencian Nationalist Bloc]], the left-wing [[Valencian People's Initiative]], and a group of [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] ([[Greens Equo of the Valencian Country]]) and independent parties. Together they defend [[Valencian nationalism|Valencianist]], [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[ecological]] politics.

Compromís was founded in January 2010 to participate in the 2011 elections to the Valencian parliament, and the 2011 local elections.

Since the 2015 election year, Compromís has significantly increased its representation in many institutions. At present it has 722 councillors all over the Valencian Autonomous Community , 19 parliamentary representatives in the [[Valencian parliament]] (''Corts Valencianes''), 4 representatives in the [[Congress of Deputies]] of Spain (within 9 representatives of [[A la valenciana]] coalition), 2 in the [[Spanish Senate]] and 1 in the [[European parliament]]. It also has 6 representatives in the Deputation of Valencia (''València''), 2 in Castellón (''Castelló''), 3 in Alicante (''Alacant'') and 84 mayor's offices, among them, the city of [[Valencia]].

== History ==
In the [[Valencian regional election, 2011|2011 Valencian election]], Compromís received 176.213 votes (7% of the votes) and 6 of the 99 seats.

In the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 Spanish general election]], running in coalition with [[Equo]] in the three Valencian provinces, it won 0.5% of the national vote and 1 MP in Congress ([[Joan Baldoví]]), nearing 5% of the total vote in the [[Valencian Country]].

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Spain)|2014 European Parliament election]] it won 1 seat within the [[European Spring (Spanish party alliance)|European Spring]] ({{lang-es|Primavera Europea}}) coalition with other parties (such as [[Chunta Aragonesista]] or [[Equo]]).

In the [[Valencian regional election, 2015|2015 Valencian election]], Compromís polled third overall after the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and the [[Socialist Party of the Valencian Country|Valencian Socialists]] (PSPV). Compromís got 456.823 votes (18.5% of the votes) and 19 of the 99 seats. The election results allowed a new government to be formed by Compromís and PSPV, with the parliamentary support of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]]. After negotiations, [[Mònica Oltra]] from Compromís was elected as Vice president of [[Generalitat Valenciana]] and [[Ximo Puig]] from PSPV as President.

For the [[Spanish general election, 2015|2015 Spanish general election]], Compromís formed a coalition with Podemos, called ''[[És el moment|Compromís-Podem-És el moment]]''. This new coalition was the second most popular political force in the Valencian Country, surpassing the PSPV. They received 671.071 votes, 25,09% of the total vote in the Valencian Country. During the process of creating parliamentary groups, Podemos deputies joined the group within other Podemos deputies from all around Spain, while Compromís joined the Mixed Group.

In the [[Spanish general election, 2016|2016 general elections in Spain]] Compromís ran again in a coalition with Podemos, but this time the coalition included as well [[United Left of the Valencian Country]], the Valencian branch of [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]].

'''Context-based access control''' ('''CBAC''') is a feature of [[firewall (computing)|firewall software]], which intelligently [[packet filter|filters]] [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[Network_packet|packets]] based on [[layer 7|application layer]] protocol session information.  It can be used for [[Intranet|intranets]], [[Extranet|extranets]] and [[Internet|internets]].

CBAC can be configured to permit specified TCP and UDP traffic through a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] only when the connection is initiated from within the network needing protection. (In other words, CBAC can inspect traffic for sessions that originate from the external network.) However, while this example discusses inspecting traffic for sessions that originate from the external network, CBAC can inspect traffic for sessions that originate from either side of the firewall. This is the basic function of a [[stateful firewall|stateful inspection firewall]].

Without CBAC, traffic filtering is limited to [[Access control list|access list]] implementations that examine packets at the [[network layer]], or at most, the [[transport layer]]. However, CBAC examines not only network layer and [[transport layer]] information but also examines the application-layer protocol information (such as [[FTP]] connection information) to learn about the state of the TCP or UDP session. This allows support of protocols that involve multiple channels created as a result of negotiations in the FTP control channel. Most of the multimedia protocols as well as some other protocols (such as FTP, RPC, and SQL*Net) involve multiple control channels.

CBAC inspects traffic that travels through the firewall to discover and manage state information for TCP and UDP sessions. This state information is used to create temporary openings in the firewall's access lists to allow return traffic and additional data connections for permissible sessions (sessions that originated from within the protected internal network).

CBAC does the [[deep packet inspection]] and hence it is termed to be an IOS Firewall.

CBAC also provides the following benefits:

* [[DoS|Denial-of-service]] prevention and detection
* Real-time alerts and audit trails

==Background==
As a technique, the deprogramming that has been practiced over the last half century has been typically commissioned by relatives, often parents of adult offspring, who objected to the subject's membership in an organization or group. It has been compared to exorcisms in both methodology and manifestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shupe | first1 = Anson D. | last2 = JR | first2 =  | last3 = Spielmann | first3 = Roger | last4 = Stigall | first4 = Sam | year = 1977 | title = Deprogramming: The New Exorcism | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 941–956 | doi = 10.1177/000276427702000609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process sometimes has been performed with tacit support of law enforcement and judicial officials.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David Melton, J. Gordon 2002. Cults, Religion, and Violence. West Nyack, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflex"/&gt;  In response to a burgeoning number of [[new religious movement]]s in the 1970s in the United States, the "father of deprogramming", [[Ted Patrick]], introduced many of these techniques to a wider audience as a means to combat cults.&lt;ref name="Chryssides"&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring New Religions|last=Chryssides|first=George|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1999|isbn=0-8264-5959-5|pages=346–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, G.D. and B.E. Zeller. 2014. The Bloomsbury Companion to New Religious Movements: BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, deprogrammings have been carried out "by the thousands".&lt;ref name="reflex"&gt;James T Richardson "Reflexivity and objectivity in the study of controversial new religions  Religion Vol. 21, Iss. 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various [[atrocity stories]] served as justification for deprogramming of [[Unification Church]] members in the USA.&lt;ref name="Kurtz2007"&gt;[[Lester R. Kurtz|Kurtz, Lester R.]] ''Gods in the Global Village: The World's Religions in Sociological Perspective'' 2007, Pine Forge Press, {{ISBN|1-4129-2715-3}}, page 228&lt;/ref&gt;

As a technique for encouraging people to disassociate with groups with whom they have as consenting adults chosen to associate, deprogramming is a controversial practice. Even some cult critics have denounced it on legal and ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Langone, Michael D., and Paul R. Martin. "Viewpoint: Deprogramming, Exit Counseling, and Ethics: Clarifying the Confusion." Christian Research Institute Journal (30 June 1994) [Winter 1993]: page 46 (Retrieved 26 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions, when done without force, have been referred to as "[[exit counseling]]". 
Sometimes the word ''deprogramming'' is used in a wider (and/or ironic or humorous sense), to mean the freeing of someone (often oneself) from any previously uncritically assimilated [[idea]]. According to [[Carol Giambalvo]], "exit cousellors are usually former cult members themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giambalvo |first=Carol |year= 1992 |title= Exit Counseling: A Family Intervention |url= |location= |publisher= [[American Family Foundation]] |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academics have commented on the practice. For example, as defined by James T. Richardson, [[UNLV]] Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies and Director of the Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies, deprogramming is a "private, self-help process whereby participants in unpopular new religious movements (NRMs) were forcibly removed from the group, incarcerated, and put through radical resocialization processes that were supposed to result in their agreeing to leave the group."&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = James T | year = 2011 | title = Deprogramming: from private self-help to governmental organized repression | url = | journal = Crime, Law and Social Change | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 321–336 | doi=10.1007/s10611-011-9286-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor [[Douglas Laycock]], author of ''Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beginning in the 1970s, many parents responded to the initial conversion with "deprogramming." The essence of deprogramming was to physically abduct the convert, isolate him and physically restrain him, and barrage him with continuous arguments and attacks against his new religion, threatening to hold him forever until he agreed to leave it.&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, D. 2011. ''Religious Liberty: The free exercise clause''. W.B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiwxUad97IC.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lawyer John LeMoult, writing in a law review journal, described such practices as the person subject to deprogramming being "seized, held against his will, subjected to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his beliefs", and compared this power to that of Nazis over their prisoners.&lt;ref name="holywars"/&gt; Legal scholar [[Dean M. Kelley]] called deprogramming "protracted spiritual gang-rape".&lt;ref&gt;Dean Kelley, "Deprogramming and Religious Liberty", ''Civil Liberties Review'' 23 (July/August 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedures ==
There has never been a standard procedure among deprogrammers; descriptions in anecdotal reports, studies, and interviews with former deprogrammers vary greatly. Deprogrammers generally operate on the presumption that the people they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of [[mind control]] (or [[brainwashing]]). Books written by deprogrammers and [[exit counseling|exit counselor]]s say that the most essential part of freeing the mind of a person is to convince the subject that he or she had been under the mental control of others.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Ted Patrick]], one of the pioneers of deprogramming, used a confrontational method, enlisting psychiatrists and psychologists to assist him in the deprogramming process.&lt;ref name="holywars"&gt;24 T. Marshall L. Rev. 359 (1998-1999) Holy Wars: Involuntary Deprogramming as a Weapon against Cults; McAllister, Shawn&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick was tried and convicted of multiple felonies related to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of deprogramming subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Polly J. Regulation of religious proselytism in the United States. ''Brigham Young University Law Review''. 2001 537-574.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylvia Buford, an associate of Ted Patrick who has assisted him on many deprogrammings, described five stages of deprogramming:&lt;ref name="All Gods Children"&gt;(Stoner, C., &amp; Parke, J. (1977). [[All Gods Children (book)|All God's children: The cult experience - salvation or slavery?]] Radrior, PA: Chilton )&lt;/ref&gt;
#Discredit the figure of authority: the cult leader
#Present contradictions (ideology versus reality): "How can he preach love when he exploits people?" is an example.
#The breaking point: When a subject begins to listen to the deprogrammer; when reality begins to take precedence over ideology.
#Self-expression: When the subject begins to open up and voice gripes against the cult.
#Identification and transference: when the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers, starts to think as an opponent of the cult rather than as a member.

=== Violence ===
The deprogramming accounts vary widely regarding the use of force, with the most dramatic accounts coming from deprogrammed people who returned to the group.

[[Steven Hassan]] in his book ''Releasing the Bonds'' spoke against coercive deprogramming methods using force or threats.

The deprogramming case observed by Dubrow-Eichel did not include any violence.

Sociologist [[Eileen Barker]] wrote in Watching for Violence:

{{quote|Although deprogramming has become less violent in the course of time ... Numerous testimonies by those who were subjected to a deprogramming describe how they were threatened with a gun, beaten, denied sleep and food and/or sexually assaulted. But one does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence: [[Ted Patrick]], one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs (who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits) openly boasts about some of the violence he employed; in November 1987, [[Cyril Vosper]], a Committee member of the British cult-awareness group, [[Family Action Information Resource|FAIR]], was convicted in Munich of "causing bodily harm" in the course of one of his many deprogramming attempts; and a number of similar convictions are on record for prominent members of CAGs elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/barker.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Colombrito vs. Kelly'', the Court accepted the definition of deprogramming by J. Le Moult published in 1978 in the Fordham Law Review:

{{quote|Deprogrammers are people who, at the request of a parent or other close relative, will have a member of a religious sect seized, then hold him against his will and subject him to mental, emotional, and even physical pressures until he renounces his religious beliefs. Deprogrammers usually work for a fee, which may easily run as high as $25,000.

The deprogramming process begins with abduction. Often strong men muscle the subject into a car and take him to a place where he is cut off from everyone but his captors. He may be held against his will for upward of three weeks. Frequently, however, the initial deprogramming only last a few days. The subject's sleep is limited and he is told that he will not be released until his beliefs meet his captors' approval. Members of the deprogramming group, as well as members of the family, come into the room where the victim is held and barrage him with questions and denunciations until he recants his newly found religious beliefs.}}

Deprogrammer [[Carol Giambalvo]] writes in the 1998 text "Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation":

{{quote|It was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken – or "snapped" as some termed it – by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again. For that reason in some cases cult leader's pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist. What was often sought was an emotional response to the information, the shock, the fear, and the confrontation. There are horror stories – promoted most vehemently by the cults themselves – about restraint, beatings, and even rape. And we have to admit that we have met former members who have related to us their deprogramming experience – several of handcuffs, weapons wielded and sexual abuse. But thankfully, these are in the minority – and in our minds, never justified. Nevertheless, deprogramming helped to free many individuals held captive to destructive cults at a time when other alternatives did not seem viable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giambalvo, Carol]] (November 1998). [http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studyintervention/study_deprog_threfrmconsult.htm Deprogramming to Thought Reform Consultation"]. [[International Cultic Studies Association]]. Retrieved January 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Effectiveness and harm==
Alan W. Gomes (chairman of the department of theology at Talbot School of Theology, [[Biola University]]) in his 2009 book ''Unmasking the Cults'' reports:
  
{{quote|While advocates of the deprogramming position have claimed high rates of success, studies show that natural attrition rates actually are higher than the success rate achieved through deprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Alan W., ''Unmasking the Cults'',
Zondervan Guide to Cults and Religious Movements, [[Zondervan]], 2009
{{ISBN|0-310-86455-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-310-86455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Dialog Center International]] (DCI) a major [[Christian countercult movement|Christian counter-cult]] organization founded in 1973 by a [[Denmark|Danish]] professor of [[missiology]] and [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] [[theology]], Dr. [[Johannes Aagaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2007/aagaard.htm Obituary, 23 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; rejects deprogramming, believing that it is counterproductive, ineffective, and can harm the relationship between a cult member and concerned family members.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions'', [[George D. Chryssides]], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8264-5959-5}},  {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5959-6}}, pages 353-254&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychiatry Saul Levine suggests that it is doubtful that deprogramming helps many people and goes on to say that it actually causes harm to the victim by very nature of the deprogramming. For deprogramming to work, the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will. They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled.&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 =  | year = 1979 | title = The Role of Psychiatry in the Phenomenon of Cults | url = | journal = Canada Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 24 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Levine's professional opinion that once deprogrammed, a person would never be certain that they were really doing what they want. He states that deprogramming destroys a person's identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others. "Fundamentally deprogramming denies choice and creates dependency.  It robs people of their sense of responsibility.  Instead of encouraging people to accept that they made a mistake, it encourages people to deny their actions and blame others."&lt;ref name="levine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Cults and New Age Religions, by Irving Hexham, Karla Poewe, and J. I. Packer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

Deprogramming activities often fall outside of the law. Government agencies have at times been aware and have taken part in deprogramming to enforce official views of "correct" beliefs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;  This can involve "vigorous, even violent, efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government" and have been "given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefs
of the unpopular movement or group being targeted".&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;

==Controversy and related issues==
{{See also|Mind control#Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement|l1=Mind control: Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement}}

In the United States, from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s [[mind control]] was a widely accepted theory in public opinion, and the vast majority of [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits' relatives were well justified to seek [[conservatorship]]s and to hire deprogrammers. It took nearly 20 years for public opinion to shift.&lt;ref name=Rusher/&gt;

One aspect that gradually became disturbing from a civil rights point of view, was that relatives would use deception or other ethically questionable methods—even kidnapping—to get the recruit into deprogrammers' hands, without allowing the person any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. Previously, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.

One of main objections raised to deprogramming (as well as to [[exit counseling]]) is the contention that they begin with a [[false premise]]. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some [[civil libertarian]]s, [[sociologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.

[[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]] and [[Anson Shupe]] wrote:
{{Quote|Deprogrammers are like [[Witchcraft#Colonial_North_America|the American colonials who persecuted "witches"]]: a confession, drawn up before the suspect was brought in for torturing and based on the judges' fantasies about witchcraft, was signed under duress and then treated as justification for the torture.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David G., and Shupe, Anson D., Jr. (1981) Strange Gods, The Great American Cult Scare. Boston: Beacon (pp. 198-204)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of factors contributed to the cessation of deprogramming:

Some of the deprogrammed adults sued the deprogrammers or the relatives who had hired them.  Also in 1987, psychologist [[Margaret Singer]] became unusable as an [[expert witness]] after the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) rejected her [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control|''Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control'']] (DIMPAC) report.&lt;ref name=APA_memo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmcjPkrGTQ8C&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;ots=335cDzpa_5&amp;dq=%22May%2011%2C%201987%22%20dimpac&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q=%22May%2011,%201987%22%20dimpac&amp;f=false May 11, 1987, APA MEMORANDUM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] published a statement in 1977 which said:
{{quote|ACLU opposes the use of mental incompetency proceedings, temporary conservatorship, or denial of government protection as a method of depriving people of the free exercise of religion, at least with respect to people who have reached the age of majority. Mode of religious proselytizing or persuasion for a continued adherence that do not employ physical coercion or threat of same are protected by the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment against action of state laws or by state officials. The claim of free exercise may not be overcome by the contention that 'brainwashing' or 'mind control' has been used, in the absence of evidence that the above standards have been violated.}}

In the 1980s in the United States, namely in [[New York (state)|New York]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1981), [[Kansas]] (Deprogramming Bill, 1982), and [[Nebraska]] (conservatorship legislation for 1985), lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogramming.

Rev. [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church]] (many of whose members were targets of deprogramming) issued this statement in 1983:

{{quote|The methods involved in "deprogramming" are like those used in Communist concentration camps. Using parents and relatives to entrap members, "deprogrammers" commit grown adults to mental hospitals with the supposed "illness" of holding of a minority religious belief. Other typical deprogramming techniques include kidnapping, illegal detention, violence, psychological harassment, [[sleep deprivation]], inducement to use alcohol and drugs, sexual seduction and rape. By such threats, harassment and manipulation, professional "deprogrammers" force members to renounce their faith. Many people are injured physically and psychologically because of this criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unification.net/1983/831125.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1990s, deprogrammer [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]] was sued by [[Jason Scott case|Jason Scott]], a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church, after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt. In 1995, the jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $2,500,000 in punitive damages against Ross, which were later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services. More significantly, the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN $1,000,000 in punitive damages, forcing the group into [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2001/CAN/02/01.htm Scott vs. Ross, Workman, Simpson.] Retrieved May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States.&lt;ref name="holywars"/&gt;

==Referral and kickback system==
Anti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications, referrals, transportation, and housing necessary for continued deprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, D. and B. Hankins. 2003. New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America: Baylor University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the [[Cult Awareness Network]] operated a referral scheme ([[Cult Awareness Network#NARDEC|NARDEC]]) in which they would refer people to deprogrammers in return for a 'kickback' in the form of a donation or as a commission.&lt;ref name="shupe2011"&gt;Shupe, A. and S.E.

==Victims==
In 1974, Kathy Crampton, whose abduction and deprogramming were televised across the US, went back to the [[Love Family]] group several days after her apparently successful deprogramming. Patrick was charged with kidnapping, but acquitted with the reasoning: "[w]here parents are, as here, of the reasonable and intelligent belief that they were not physically capable of recapturing their daughter from existing, imminent danger, then the defense of necessity transfers or transposes to the constituted agent, the person who acts upon their belief under such conditions. Here that agent is the Defendant [[Ted Patrick]]." ''(District Court of the United States 1974: 79; New York Times 1974).''

In 1980, Susan Wirth, a 35-year-old teacher living in San Francisco, was abducted by her parents to be deprogrammed in reaction to her leftist political views and activities.&lt;ref name=Rusher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Daughter kidnapped over politics|date = July 2, 1980|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19800702&amp;id=Q6wiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GLIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1677,212672|newspaper = [[Beaver County Times]]|accessdate = November 14, 2013|agency = [[Associated Press]]|page = A-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patrick was paid $27,000 to carry out the deprogramming, which involved handcuffing her to a bed for two weeks and denying her food.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Garrard Postpage, ''Inquiries in bioethics'', 1993, Georgetwon University Press, {{ISBN|0-87840-538-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87840-538-1}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She was later released and after returning to San Francisco spoke out against deprogramming but declined to press legal charges against her parents.&lt;ref&gt;"Feared kidnapped, she reconciles with mother", ''[[Merced Sun-Star]]'', July 29, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Patrick was convicted of conspiracy, kidnapping, and [[false imprisonment]] for abducting and attempting to deprogram Roberta McElfish, a 26-year-old Tucson waitress.&lt;ref name="nyt-08301980" /&gt; Patrick was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000.&lt;ref name="nyt-09271980"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Patrick is sentenced in seizure of cult member|date=1980-09-27|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Stephanie Riethmiller, who lived in Ohio, was kidnapped by deprogrammers hired by her parents to end her lesbian relationship. She was held against her will and repeatedly raped. After her release she filed civil charges against her parents and the deprogrammers, which were dismissed in a trial that generated some controversy in the media.&lt;ref name=Rusher&gt;{{cite news|last=Rusher|first=William A.|title=Deprogramming A Disgrace To Free Society|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19830528&amp;id=0KQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LNYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4176,5893764|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=Gadsden Times|date=28 May 1983|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Violence Against Lesbians and Gay Men'',

In 1990, Patrick attempted to deprogram Elma Miller, an [[Amish]] woman who had joined a liberal sect. He was hired by her husband to return her to him and the Amish church. Criminal charges of conspiracy were filed against Miller's husband, brother, and two others but were later dropped on her request to the prosecuting attorney.&lt;ref&gt;''Amish Woman Charges Deprogramming'', ''[[Pittsburg Press]]'', November 30, 1990, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Amish Woman Asks Prosecutor to Drop Charges on Kidnapping'', [[Madison Courier]]'', December 8, 1990, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]], a noted cult intervention advocate who took part in a number of deprogramming sessions, was sued by [[Jason Scott case|Jason Scott]], a former member of a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalist]] group called the Life Tabernacle Church (part of [[United Pentecostal Church International]]), after an unsuccessful coercive deprogramming.&lt;ref name=Shupe180-184 /&gt; The jury awarded Scott $875,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN), and $2,500,000 against Ross (later settled for $5,000 and 200 hours of services "as an expert consultant and intervention specialist").&lt;ref name=Shupe180-184&gt;{{cite book

==Exit counseling==
Deprogramming and exit counseling, sometimes seen as one and the same, are distinct approaches to convincing a person to leave a cult.{{explain|date=September 2018}}

Proponents of the distinction, however, state that deprogramming entails coercion and confinement, while exit counseling assures the subject of the freedom to leave at any time. Deprogramming typically costs $10,000 or more, mainly because of the expense of a security team. Exit counseling typically costs $2,000 to $4,000, including expenses, for a three- to five-day intervention, although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more (estimated in 1993). Deprogramming, especially when it fails, entails considerable legal and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the subject from his or her family). The psychological and legal risks in exit counseling are significantly reduced. Although deprogrammers do prepare families for the process, exit counselors tend to work with them directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute more to the process; that is, exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because deprogramming relies on coercion, which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical, deprogrammers' critiques of the unethical practices of cults tend to be less credibility to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0121a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Hassan]], author of the book ''[[Combatting Cult Mind Control]]'', states that he took part in a number of deprogrammings in the late 1970s, and has spoken out against them since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomofmind.com/stevehassan/refuting/ Refuting the Disinformation Attacks Put Forth by Destructive Cults and their Agents], by Steven Hassan&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan states that he has not participated in any deprogrammings since then, although on page 114 of ''Combatting'', Hassan states that deprogrammings should be kept as a last resort if all other attempts fail to transform the individual. Hassan is one of the major proponents of exit counseling as a form of intercession, and he refers to his method as "strategic intervention therapy".

{{Forms of government}}
{{Politics}}
'''E-government''' (short for [[electronics|electronic]] [[government]]) is the use of electronic communications devices, [[computer]]s and the [[Internet]] to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. According to Jeong, 2007 the term consists of the digital interactions between a citizen and their government (C2G), between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories:&lt;ref name="JeongChunHai"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government (city, state/province, national, and international), facilitating citizen involvement in [[governance]] using [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) (such as computers and [[website]]s) and [[business process re-engineering]] (BPR). Brabham and Guth (2017) interviewed the third party designers of e-government tools in North America about the ideals of user interaction that they build into their technologies, which include progressive values, ubiquitous participation, geolocation, and education of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions are more away from technology as an object, to see them simply as facilitators or instruments and focus on specific changes in Public Administration issues, and in the internal transformation of a Government, is the case of the definition that established the specialist technologist Mauro D. Ríos in the paper "In search of a definition of Electronic Government", he says: "Digital Government is a new way of organization and management of public affairs, introducing positive transformational processes in management and the structure itself of the organization chart, adding value to the procedures and services provided, all through the introduction and continued appropriation of information and communication technologies as a facilitator of these transformations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novagob.org/en-busca-de-una-definicia3n-de-gobierno-electra3nico/|title=En busca de una definición de Gobierno Electrónico – NovaGob|website=novagob.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
E-government is also known as e-gov, electronic government, Internet governance, digital government, online government, connected government. As of 2014 the [[OECD]] still uses the term digital government, and distinguishes it from e-government in the recommendation produced there for the Network on E-Government of the Public Governance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |author1=Public Governance |author2=Territorial Development Directorate | publisher=OECD
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments have started to use the term digital government to a wide range of services involving contemporary technology, such as big data, automation or predictive analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apolitical.co/flagship/big-data-and-digital-government/|title=Tech and data: can 'digital government' be radically smarter?|website=Apolitical|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''E-gov strategies'' (or ''digital government'') is defined as "The employment of the Internet and the world-wide-web for delivering government information and services to the citizens." (United Nations, 2006; AOEMA, 2005).&lt;ref name="UNEGovSurvey2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic government'' (or ''e-government'') essentially refers to "utilization of [[Information Technology]] (IT), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT s), and other web-based telecommunication technologies to improve and/or enhance on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector.".&lt;ref name="JeongChunHai" /&gt; E-government promotes and improves broad stakeholders contribution to national and community development, as well as deepen the governance process.&lt;ref name="Egov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alenezi |first1=Hussain |last2=Tarhini |first2=Ali |last3=Sharma |first3=Sujeet Kumar |title=Development of quantitative model to investigate the strategic relationship between information quality and e-government benefits |journal=Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=324–351 |doi=10.1108/TG-01-2015-0004 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/TG-01-2015-0004 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |ref=(Alenzi et al., 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electronic government systems, government operations are supported by web-based services. It involves the use of information technology, specifically the Internet, to facilitate the communication between the government and its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi-sigegov.orgwww.csi-sigegov.org/1/1_369.pdf|title=E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain|last=Jain Palvia|first=Shailendra|date=|website=csi-sigegov.org|publisher=Computer Society of India|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN e-Government Development Index==

The Division of a Public Administration and Development Management (DPAPM) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) conducts a bi-annual e-government survey which includes a section titled ''e-Government Development Index (EGDI)''. It is a comparative ranking of 193 countries of the world according to three primary indicators: i) the OSI - Online Service Index that measures the online presence of the government in terms of service delivery; ii) the TII - Telecommunication Infrastructure Index iii) HCI -Human Capital Index . Constructing a model for the measurement of digitized services, the Survey assesses the 193 member states of the UN according to a quantitative composite index of e-government readiness based on website assessment; telecommunication infrastructure and human resource endowment.&lt;ref name="UNEGovSurvey2016" /&gt;

A diverse group of 100 researchers [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged with the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 [[UN Member States]] for the 2016 UN E-Government Survey.&lt;ref name="egovsurvey16"&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 UN E-Government Survey|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html Online Volunteering service, Experiences]&lt;/ref&gt;—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.

==Comparison with e-governance==
{{main|e-governance}}
E-government should enable anyone visiting a city website to communicate and interact with city employees via the Internet with graphical user interfaces (GUI), instant-messaging (IM), learn about government issues through audio/video presentations, and in any way more sophisticated than a simple email letter to the address provided at the site”&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C., Deshazo, R. and Van Eck, D.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of [[e-governance]] is "The enhanced value for stakeholders through transformation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0740-624X(01)00089-2 | volume=18 | title=Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities | year=2001 | journal=Government Information Quarterly | pages=293–307 | last1 = Kaylor | first1 = Charles | last2 = Deshazo | first2 = Randy | last3 = Van Eck | first3 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “the use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees”.&lt;ref&gt;Deloitte Research – Public Sector Institute [http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/pdfs/e-government.pdf At the Dawn of e-Government: The Citizen as Customer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122814/http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/pdfs/e-government.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The focus should be on:
* The use of [[information and communication technologies]], and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve better government.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/60/60/2502539.pdf The e-government imperative: main findings], Policy Brief, Public Affairs Division, Public Affairs and Communications Directorate, OECD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of information and communication technologies in all facets of the operations of a government organization.&lt;ref&gt;Grima-Izquierdo, C. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/A-generic-architecture-eGovernment-eDemocracy/dp/3848437627 A generic architecture for e-Government and e-Democracy: requirements, design and security risk analysis]. Ed. LAP Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Koh, C.E. |author2=Prybutok, V.R. |title=The three-ring model and development of an instrument for measuring dimensions of e-government functions|journal= Journal of Computer Information Systems|volume= 33|issue=3|pages=34–9|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The continuous optimization of service delivery, constituency participation, and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, the Internet and new media.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Group, “Key Issues in E-Government Strategy and Management,” Research Notes, Key Issues, 23 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Whilst e-government has traditionally been understood as being centered around the operations of government, e-governance is understood to extend the scope by including citizen engagement and participation in governance. As such, following in line with the OECD definition of e-government, e-governance can be defined as the use of ICTs as a tool to achieve better governance.

==Delivery models and activities of e-government==
The primary delivery models of e-government can be divided into:
* [[G2C|Government-to-citizen]] or government-to-consumer (G2C) approaches such as setting up [[website]]s where citizens can download forms, government information, etc.
** In this model, the G2C model applies the strategy of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) with business concept.
** By managing their "customer" (citizen) relationship, the business (government) can provide the needed products and services fulfill the needs of the customer (citizen).
** In United States, the NPR ([[National Partnership for Reinventing Government]]) has been implemented from 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, B., &amp; Milakovich, M. (January 1, 2005). Citizen Relationship Management and E-Government. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3591, 57–68&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government-to-business]] (G2B)
* [[Government-to-government]] (G2G)
* [[Government-to-employees]] (G2E)

Within each of these interaction domains, four kinds of activities take place:&lt;ref&gt;Mary Maureen Brown. "Electronic Government" Jack Rabin (ed.). ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy'', Marcel Dekker, 2003, pp. 427–432 {{ISBN|0824742400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-10|url=http://www.iceg.net/2007/books/1/1_369.pdf|publisher=ICEG|title=E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain Framework and Status around the World|format=PDF|author1=Shailendra C. Jain Palvia |author2=Sushil S. Sharma |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* pushing information over the Internet, e.g.: regulatory services, general holidays, public hearing schedules, issue briefs, notifications, etc.
* two-way communications between the agency and the citizen, a business, or another government agency. In this model, users can engage in dialogue with agencies and post problems, comments, or requests to the agency.
* conducting transactions, e.g.: lodging tax returns, applying for services and grants.
* governance, e.g.: To enable the citizen transition from passive information access to active citizen participation by:
# Informing the citizen
# Representing the citizen
# Encouraging the citizen to vote
# Consulting the citizen
# Involving the citizen

==Non-internet e-government==
While e-government is often thought of as "online government" or "Internet-based government," many non-Internet "electronic government" technologies can be used in this context. Some non-Internet forms include [[telephone]], [[fax]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]], [[Short message service|SMS]] text messaging, [[Multimedia Messaging System|MMS]], wireless networks and services, [[Bluetooth]], [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], tracking systems, [[RFID]], [[biometric]] identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, [[identity cards]], [[smart cards]] and other [[near field communication]] applications; polling station technology (where non-online [[e-voting]] is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., [[Control System Middleware for operator functioning (CSMW)|CSMW]]), email, [[online community]] facilities, [[newsgroup]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[online chat]], and [[instant messenger|instant messaging]] technologies.

== Controversies ==

===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantages concerning e-government is the lack of equality in public access to computers and the internet (the "[[digital divide]]", a reference to the fact that people who have low incomes, who are [[homeless]] and/or who live in remote regions may have little or no access to the Internet), reliability of information on the web, and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including [[disintermediation]] of the government and its citizens, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to [[cyber attack]]s, and disturbances to the ''status quo'' in these areas.&lt;ref name="information137"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Electronic leviathan]].

The political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/governance/key-issues/e-government/challenges-for-e-government#.WE-RiJMrJAY|title=Challenges for e-government|last=Collodi|first=Jason|date=|website=eldis.org/|publisher=Institute of Development Studies|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trust ===
Trust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions. This is much riskier and prone to fluctuation than a system of trust that is based on reputation because performance does not consider past actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Governance and Civic Engagement: Factors and Determinants of E-Democracy|last=Manoharan|first=Aroon|publisher=IGI Global|year=2011|isbn=161350084X|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Because E-government is in the early stages of development in many countries and jurisdictions, it is hard to be applied to forms of government that have been institutionalized. Age-old bureaucratic practices being delivered in new mediums or using new technologies can lead to problems of miscommunication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi-sigegov.orgwww.csi-sigegov.org/1/1_369.pdf |title =E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain Framework and Status around the World | author= Palvia, Shailendra and Sharma, Sushil|accessdate=2017-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyper-surveillance====
Increased electronic contact and data exchange between government and its citizens goes both ways. Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than [[bricks and mortar]] service offices (physical buildings) staffed by [[civil servant]]s. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]-like system could develop. When the government has easy access to countless information on its citizens, personal [[privacy]] is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/48629.html?wlc=1235202183 |title=AT&amp;T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance |publisher=TechNewsWorld |author=Lyman, Jay |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/analysis-new-la.html |title=Analysis: New Law Gives Government Six Months to Turn Internet and Phone Systems into Permanent Spying Architecture |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=Singel, Ryan |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost====
Although "a prodigious amount of money has been spent"&lt;ref&gt;The good, the bad and the inevitable | The Economist http://www.economist.com/node/10638105&lt;/ref&gt; on the development and implementation of e-government, some say{{Who|date=February 2014}} it has yielded only a mediocre result. The outcomes and effects of trial Internet-based government services are often difficult to gauge or users seem them unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?STORY_ID=10638105 |title=The pros and cons of e-government |publisher=Economist |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gartner, Worldwide IT spending is estimated to total $3.6 trillion in 2011 which is 5.1% increase from the year 2010 ($3.4 trillion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1513614 |title=Global IT Spending |publisher= Gartner |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inaccessibility====
{{Main|Digital divide}}
An e-government website that provides government services often does not offer the "potential to reach many users including those who live in remote areas [without Internet access], are homebound, have low literacy levels, exist on poverty line incomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-pub.com/files/prefaces/jeco%20preface%201(3).pdf |title=Bridging Literacy, Language, and Cultural Divides to Promote Universal Usability of E-Government Websites |publisher=[[Northern Arizona University]] |author=Becker, Shirley A. |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[homelessness|Homeless]] people, people in poverty and elderly people may not have access.

====False sense of transparency and accountability====
Opponents of e-government argue that online governmental transparency is dubious because it is maintained by the governments themselves. Information can be added or removed from the public eye. To this day, very few organizations monitor and provide accountability for these modifications. Those that do so, like the United States’ OMBWatch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombwatch.org/ |title=ombwatch.org |publisher=ombwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104170904/http://www.ombwatch.org/ |archivedate=2013-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Government Accountability Project]], are often nonprofit volunteers. Even the governments themselves do not always keep track of the information they insert and delete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |title=Has Terrorism Curtailed E-Government? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Chiger, Stephen |date=2002-09-11 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904235925/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |archivedate=2008-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

The ultimate goal of the e-government is to be able to offer an increased portfolio of public services to citizens in an efficient and cost effective manner. E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.
Simple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paper work for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.
E-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.
It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to get it.

E-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/bmv/ Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles]. In.gov (2009-06-16). Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. In addition to its simplicity, [[e-democracy]] services can reduce costs. [[Alabama]] Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources, [[Wal-Mart]] and NIC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com |title=nicusa.com |publisher=nicusa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an online hunting and fishing license service utilizing an existing computer to automate the licensing process. More than 140,000 licenses were purchased at [[Wal-Mart]] stores during the first hunting season and the agency estimates it will save $200,000 annually from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |title=Picking Up the Tab |publisher=Government Technology |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821131811/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anticipated benefits of e-government include efficiency, improved services, better accessibility of public services, sustainable community development and more transparency and accountability.&lt;ref name="information137"/&gt;

====Democratization====
{{Main|E-democracy}}
One goal of some e-government initiatives is greater citizen participation. Through the Internet's [[Web 2.0]] interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. [[Blog]]ging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. [[Chat room]]s can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.

A government could theoretically move more towards a true [[democracy]] with the proper application of e-government. [[Open government|Government transparency]] will give insight to the public on how decisions are made and hold elected officials or public servants accountable for their actions. The public could become a direct and prominent influence in government legislature to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/ericjsinrod/2004-06-30-sinrod_x.htm |title=A look at the pros and cons of e-government |publisher=[[USA Today]] |author=Sinrod, Eric J. |date=2004-06-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |title=How Web 2.0 Will Transform Local Government |publisher=Digital Communities |author=Schrier, Bill |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023020229/http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |title=Transparency |publisher=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315105326/http://cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |title=Facilitating effective online participation in e-government |publisher=E-government in [[New Zealand]] |author=Thorpe, Stephen J. |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520221620/http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental bonuses====
{{Main|Paperless office}}
Proponents of e-government argue that online government services would lessen the need for hard copy paper forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/so-how-much-paper-does-our-local-government-use |title=So, how much paper does our local government use? |publisher=Penn-Trafford Star |author=Dezayas, Heidi |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to recent pressures from [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] groups, the media, and the public, some governments and organizations have turned to the Internet to reduce paper use. The United States government utilizes the website http://www.forms.gov to provide “internal government forms for federal employees” and thus “produce significant savings in paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/egov_docs/FY09_Benefits_Report.pdf |title=Report to Congress on the Benefits of the President's E-Government Initiatives ("Business Gateway," p. 50) |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226145709/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/egov_docs/FY09_Benefits_Report.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, if citizens can apply for government services or permits online, they may not need to drive into a government office, which could lead to less [[air pollution]] from gas and diesel-fuelled vehicles.

====Speed, efficiency, and convenience====
E-government allows citizens to interact with computers to achieve objectives at any time and any location and eliminates the necessity for physical travel to government agents sitting behind desks and windows. Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to [[bricks and mortar]] government offices, which tend to be only open during [[business hour]]s (notable exceptions are [[police station]]s and [[hospital]]s, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).

Improved accounting and record keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations. Individuals with disabilities or conditions that affect their mobility no longer have to be mobile to be active in government and can access public services in the comfort of their own homes&lt;ref&gt;Satyanarayana, J. ''E-Government: The Science of the Possible.'' India: Prentice Hall, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Nixon | first1 = Paul G. | last2 = Rawal | first2 = Rajash | title = Enabling Democracy? e-Government, Inclusion and Citizenship | publisher = The Hague University | pages = 281–290 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=eC60D0q7m0AC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=cons+of+e-government | isbn = 978-1-905305-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as long as they have a computer and Internet and any accessibility equipment they may need).

====Public approval====
{{Main|e-participation}}
Recent trials of e-government have been met with acceptance and eagerness from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070426005159/en/Study-Finds-Federal-Gains-Electronic-Government-Citizen |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180613111852/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070426005159/en/Study-Finds-Federal-Gains-Electronic-Government-Citizen |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2018-06-13 |title= Study Finds Federal Gains in Electronic Government and Citizen Services; Challenges Remain |publisher= Bearing Point |date= 2007-04-26 |accessdate= 2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Urdiales | first1 = C. | last2 = de Trazegnies | first2 = C. | last3 = Salceda | first3 = J.

Although Internet-based governmental programs have been criticized for lack of reliable privacy policies, studies have shown that people value prosecution of offenders over personal confidentiality. Ninety percent of United States adults approve of Internet tracking systems of criminals, and 57% are willing to forgo some of their personal [[internet privacy]] if it leads to the prosecution of criminals or terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Mar122002id88684.htm |title=How Much Government Snooping Is Okay? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Roy, Saumya |date=2002-03-12 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023161650/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Mar122002id88684.htm |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology-specific e-government==
There are also some technology-specific sub-categories of e-government, such as [[m-government]] (mobile government), ubiquitous government), and g-government ([[GIS]]/[[GPS]] applications for e-government).

The previous concern about developments in E-government concerning technology are due to the limited use of online platforms for political reasons by citizens in local political participations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossberger|first=Karen|year=2009|title=CAN E-GOVERNMENT PROMOTE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT?|url=https://ipce.uic.edu/interior/egovtfinalreport2009.pdf|journal=Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary delivery models of e-government are classified depending on who benefits. In the development of public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Government Technology’s Public CIO Thought Leadership Profile [http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf "Expanding eGovernment, Every Day"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326054720/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf |date=2010-03-26 }} open-access online paper 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.

[[Social networking service]]s and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens’ environment and the engagement is on the citizens’ terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networking as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] widgets.

Government and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Government is also beginning to [[Twitter]]. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], Treasurer [[Frank T. Caprio]] is offering daily tweets of the state’s cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/RITreasury/ RI Treasury (@RITreasury) op Twitter]. Twitter.com.

==Government 2.0==

Government 2.0 or Gov 2.0 refers to government policies that aim to harness collaborative technologies and interactive [[Internet]] tools to create an [[open-source model|open-source]] [[computing platform]] in which government, citizens, and innovative companies can improve transparency and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=Gov 2.0: It's All About The Platform|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/04/gov-20-its-all-about-the-platform/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, Gov 2.0 is about "putting government in the hands of citizens".&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Logan|title=Gov 2.0 Rises to the Next Level: Open Data in Action|url=http://opensource.com/government/13/3/future-gov-20|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Open Source|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gov 2.0 combines interactive [[Web 2.0]] fundamentals with e-government and increases citizen participation by using open-source platforms, which allow development of innovative [[Application software|apps]], websites, and [[Software widget|widgets]].

===Africa===

====Kenya====
Following the transition from the longstanding [[Kenya African National Union]] government to the [[National Rainbow Coalition – Kenya|National Rainbow Coalition]] government in December 2002, in January 2004 a Directorate of e-government was established after an executive (cabinet) session. The newly created department had the duty to draw the plan of action for future ICT implementations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-government.go.ke "Welcome to e-government"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606020549/http://www.e-government.go.ke/ |date=2013-06-06 }}, Kenya e-Government website, Directorate of e-Government Kenya, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other African nations, Kenya has embraced the high mobile penetration rate within its population. Even people living in remote areas that did not have access to traditional telecommunications' networks can now communicate with ease. The fact of the same has, and continues to have, a great impact on the governments' strategies in reaching out to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgovservice.ru/upload/uploadfiles/From%20eGov%20to%20mGov.pdf "From E-government to M-government: Facing the Inevitable"], Ibrahim Kushchu and M. Halid Kuscu, Mobile Government Lab (mGovLab), May 2004, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Given that about 70% of the population owns mobile phones, leading mobile network operators like Safaricom have taken a great step in offering services that meet citizens' demands. Such services include Kipokezi (which allows subscribers to do online chatting and also exchange electronic mails via standard mobile phones), and [[M-Pesa]] (which allows the subscribers to send and receive electronic cash). Such services have even appealed to the majority of Kenyans, as they support the branchless members of the society too, in undertaking normal and secure businesses via M-Pesa.  The recent [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] report reveals that MPESA transactions in Kenya exceeded those carried out by the Western Union worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2011/afr/eng/sreo1011.pdf "Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa, Sustaining the Expansion"], World Economic and Financial Surveys, International Monetary Fund,  October 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-61635-125-0}}, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
E-government in Indonesia is developing, especially in central and regional/local government offices. E-government was officially introduced to public administration by Presidential Directive No 6/2001 on Telematics, which states that the government of Indonesia has to use telematics technology to support good governance. Furthermore, e-government should have been introduced for different purposes in government offices. As one of ISO member countries, Indonesia gives more attention to facilitate the activities of standardization. Among of the facilities provided are building the National information system of standardization (SISTANAS) and Indonesia Standardization Information Network (INSTANET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/27/challenges-e-government-implementation.html|title=Challenges in e-government implementation|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, ministries, institutions and local governments of Indonesia used to run separate e-government systems, which is now integrated into a central based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://govinsider.asia/innovation/indonesia-integrated-e-government-system/|title=Indonesia to launch integrated e-government system|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the government has also undertaken programs for digitization of SMEs and the informal sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/asean-business/can-indonesia-be-a-powerhouse-in-the-digital-economy|title=Can Indonesia be a powerhouse in the digital economy?|newspaper=The Business Times|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the cities across Indonesia including [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]],and [[Makassar]] are implementing the concept of [[Smart City]], consisting of e-government, e-health, e-education, e-logistics and e-procurement as priority areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/07/13/smart-cities-digital-savviness-to-resilient-living.html|title=Smart cities: Digital savviness to resilient living|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In 2002, Iran published a detailed report named TAKFA (Barnameye Tose-e va Karborde Fanavaie Etela’at) in which it was predicted that most of the government bodies would try to virtualize their services as soon as possible. However, based on the reports by UN bodies, Iran has failed in the recent years to meet the average standards of e-government.

====Pakistan====
{{Main|E-Government in Pakistan}}

In 2014, the [[Government of Pakistan]] created the National Information Technology Board (NITB) under the Ministry of Information Technology &amp; Telecom to enable a digital eco-system for Government services to the citizens of [[Pakistan]]. NITB was formed as a result of a merger between Pakistan Computer Bureau (PCB) and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD). 
&lt;br /&gt;
The key functions identified by the NITB are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040331032631/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/ e-Government Pakistan]. E-government.gov.pk. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provide technical guidance for the introduction of e-Governance in the Federal Govt. 
* Suggest efficient and cost-effective implementation of e-government programs in the Federal Ministries/Divisions. 
* To carry out training need assessment and design and implement the identified IT capacity building programs for the employees of Federal Ministries/Divisions.
* Review the status of e-government readiness on a regular basis to ensure sustainable, accelerated digitization and relevant human resource development.
* Identify the areas where IT interventions can be helpful and to suggest measures for the automation of these areas through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR).
NITB rolled out an e-Office Suite across various ministries in the [[Government of Pakistan]]. While it clearly pursued efficiency gains and improved transparency, it also hoped to deliver "efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan." The suite primarily included five modules or applications across all the ministries. Description of each module listed are: 
* Internal Communication Module
* HR Management Module
* Inventory &amp; Procurement Management Module
* Project Management Module
* Finance Budget Module
NITB released a high-level diagram that describes the process of transforming Federal Government agencies and ministries to e-Office environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003173827/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism: NITB's roll out of the e-Office suite across almost all federal agencies is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems to put together a lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlines in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.

====Sri Lanka====
Sri Lanka have taken some initiative actions to provide the benefits of e-government to the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.lk |title=Government of Sri Lanka Official Web Portal |publisher=Gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gic.gov.lk/ |title=Government Information Center |publisher=Gic.gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Law of Ukraine “On the Basic Principles of the Information Society in Ukraine for 2007-2015”, “On Information Protection in Information and Telecommunication Systems” and a number of other legislative acts aimed at concretization and specification of these laws were adopted. This law emphasized the use of information and telecommunication technologies to improve public administration, relations between the state and citizens. The next stage of e-government development began in 2015 after the adoption of the Agreement of parliamentary factions of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] (in 2014) and the adoption of the Development Strategy "Ukraine - 2020", which was approved by Decree of the President of Ukraine dated January 12, 2015 (No. 5/2015).

In 2018, Ukraine ranks 82nd in the UN e-government ranking. &lt;ref&gt;https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/Portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2018-Survey/E-Government%20Survey%202018_FINAL%20for%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[Clerk of the Privy Council (Canada)|Clerk of the Privy Council]] – the head of the federal public service has made workplace renewal a pillar of overall public service renewal. The key to workplace renewal is the adoption of collaborative networked tools. An example of such a tool is [[GCPEDIA]] – a wiki platform for federal public servants. Other tools include GCconnex, a social networking tool, and GCforums, a discussion board system.

The election of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States]] became associated with the effective use of Internet technologies during his campaign and in the implementation of his new administration in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On January 21, 2009, the President signed one of his first memorandums – the Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Transparency and Open Government.&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/ Transparency and Open Government]. Whitehouse.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The memo called for an unprecedented level of openness in Government, asking agencies to "ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration."&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/&gt; The memo further "directs the [[Chief Technology Officer]], in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies [and] to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in the memorandum."&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/&gt;

President Obama’s memorandum centered around the idea of increasing [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] throughout various different federal departments and agencies. By enabling public websites like recovery.gov and data.gov to distribute more information to the American population, the administration believes that it will gain greater citizen participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-04-27/news/27644253_1_online-town-hall-barack-obama-obama-administration | title = Obama's e-government off to good start | accessdate = 2010-05-07 | date = 2009-04-27 | work = Economictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. federal government launched [[Data.gov]] in order to make more government data available to the public. With data from Data.Gov, the public can build [[Applications software|apps]], websites, and [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]]. Although "Gov 2.0", as a concept and as a term, had been in existence since the mid-2000s, it was the launch of Data.gov that made it "go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]".&lt;ref name=harper /&gt;

In August 2009 the [[City of San Francisco]] launched [https://data.sfgov.org DataSF.org] with more than a hundred datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=Gavin|title=San Francisco Opens The City’s Data|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/san-francisco-opens-the-city’s-data/|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=19 August 2009|authorlink=Gavin Newsom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks after the DataSF.org launch, new apps and websites were developed. Using data feeds available on DataSF.org, civic-minded developers built programs to display public transportation arrival and departure times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Routesy Bay Area|url=http://www.routesy.com/|publisher=Routesy|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where to recycle hazardous materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=Gavin|title=Recycling in San Francisco Made Easy with the iPhone |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2009/06/15/recycling-in-san-francisco-made-easy-with-the-iphone/|newspaper=Clean Technica|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crime patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Crimespotting|url=http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the launch of DataSF.org there have been more than seventy apps created with San Francisco's data.

In March 2009, former [[San Francisco Mayor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] was at [[Twitter]] headquarters for a conversation about technology in government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSE20sVyyeo "A Conversation with Twitter about the Future of Technology in Government"] (video), Gavin Newsom and Evan Williams, Mayor's Press Conference (YouTube), 10 March 2009, 47 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; During the town hall, Newsom received a tweet about a [[pothole]].&lt;ref name=mitch&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Mitch|title=San Francisco Twitters With Citizens To Fix City|url=http://www.informationweek.com/internet/social-network/san-francisco-twitters-with-citizens-to/217702151|newspaper=InformationWeek|date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to Twitter co-founders [[Biz Stone]] and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and said let's find a way for people to tweet their service requests directly to San Francisco's 311 customer service center. Three months later, San Francisco launched the first Twitter 311 service, called @SF311, allowing residents to tweet, text, and send photos of potholes and other requests directly to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=San Francisco First City to Instate City-Wide 311 Twitter Program|url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/02/san-francisco-311-twitter/|newspaper=Mashable|date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Twitter and using the open-source platform, CoTweet turned @SF311 into reality. The software procurement process for something like this would normally have taken months, but in this case, it took less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fretwell|first=Luke|title=SF Mayor Newsom: Open Source More Reliable|url=http://govfresh.com/2010/07/2010/01/sf-mayor-newsom-open-source-more-reliable/|newspaper=GovFresh|date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The @SF311 is saving the city money in [[call center]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maeder|first=Kate|title=#OpenData and Real-Time Information Saves San Francisco Over $1 Million|url=http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/news/jun-25-12/open-data-real-time-information-saves-gov-money|newspaper=Reset San Francisco|date=25 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809201145/http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/news/jun-25-12/open-data-real-time-information-saves-gov-money|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dorothea Friderika Aemilia von Berlepsch''' (née '''von Oppel'''; 26 November 1755 – 27 July 1830), known as '''Emilie von Berlepsch''', was a German traveller and author. She is regarded as an early writer about women's rights in Germany.

==Life==
She was born in [[Gotha]] in 1755. Her parents were {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Georg August von Oppel|de}} and his wife Amalie. When her father died, her mother remarried, and she was looked after by an uncle and given a good private education. She published some poetry and then a book of protest because Switzerland was invaded in 1798 by the French.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

She married {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Ludwig von Berlepsch|de}} when she was sixteen and had three children with him. The marriage ended in divorce in 1787.&lt;ref name="Dawson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth P. Dawson|title=The Contested Quill: Literature by Women in Germany, 1770–1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avvD_na7DUEC&amp;pg=PA259|year=2002|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-762-0|pages=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ex-husband married Anna Dorothea Helene Siever, who had been her maid, after the divorce. By this time Berlepsch's writing was being regarded as more than amateur and aspiring to art. She is said to have "set her cap", unsuccessfully, at [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref name="Boyle2003"/&gt;

She left Switzerland in protest at the French invasion of the country and swore never to set foot in it again while it was occupied. She went to visit Scotland in 1799 and 1800. She had already met the polyglot Reverend James Macdonald in Germany who was acquainted with C. M. Wieland and J. G. Herder. Macdonald was an enthusiast for improving relations between Scotland and Germany. The vicar in [[Fife]] became Berlepsch's chosen host. He looked after her and took her on tours of Scotland; some of her time was spent in Edinburgh and some in the Highlands. Berlepsch wrote a four volume account titled ''Caledonia'', in German, which described Scotland, including the remote highlands,&lt;ref&gt;Ruth P. Dawson: “Navigating Gender: Georg Forster in the Pacific and Emilie von Berlepsch in Scotland.“ In: ''Weimar Classicism'', ed. David Gallagher. Lampeter, Wales: Edwin Mellen Press, 2011. 39-64.&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed women writers publishing in English.&lt;ref name="Boyle2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Boyle|title=Goethe: Revolution and renunciation, 1790-1803|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kgo0k_jtsxYC&amp;pg=PA451|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925751-5|pages=451–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within her own conventional restrictions, Berlepsch especially championed [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth P. Dawson: “Navigating Gender: Georg Forster in the Pacific and Emilie von Berlepsch in Scotland.“ In: ''Weimar Classicism'', ed. David Gallagher. Lampeter, Wales: Edwin Mellen Press, 2011. 39-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macdonald's affection for Berlepsch did not extend to marriage, and Berlepsch was disappointed.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Hans Utz, 'Berlepsch, Emilie von (bap. 1755, d. 1830)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54056, accessed 9 Sept 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Germany and married again. Her second marriage was to August Heinrich Harmes who was not of noble birth. They lived at Lake Zurich until 1817.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Writing==
[[File:Caledonia.jpg|thumb|upright|The title-page of ''Caledonia'', Hamburg, 1802]] 
Berlepsch's book ''Caledonia'' included early translations and reviews of [[Robert Burns]]. Her translations are credited with encouraging an acceptance and appreciation of Burns's work. There were numerous reviews in German newspapers and journals after Berlepsch's translations were published.&lt;ref name="Pittock2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray Pittock|title=The Reception of Robert Burns in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MymhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=19 June 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-567-17012-5|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her writing Berlepsch deals particularly with the subject of [[women's rights]]. She described herself as "fighting against the prejudice that wants to grant women neither a will of their own nor the courage to express it".&lt;ref name="Dawson2002"/&gt; She talks about routine misogyny that cannot be handled by submissiveness.&lt;ref name="Dawson2002"/&gt; She argues that women are given neither rights nor the opportunity to complain; women are not, by their nature, prisoners of their emotions and men are not natural tyrants. She wanted an end to misogyny but she believed that men retained supremacy.&lt;ref name="Dawson2002"/&gt; She discussed various writers for German readers including particularly [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. She notes her similar role in raising these subjects for the first time in German.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Berlepsch died in [[Lauenburg]] in 1830.&lt;ref name="Dawson2002"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6684">The '''Helvetische Gesellschaft''' / '''Société Helvétique''', or '''Helvetic Society''' as it is known in English, was a patriotic society and the first [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[reform]] society. It was founded by Swiss philosopher [[Isaak Iselin]], poet [[Solomon Gessner]] and some 20 others on 15 May 1762, and was dissolved with the formation of the [[Helvetic Republic]] in 1798. It was revived again from 1819 on until 1849. The latter should not be confused with the contemporary [[Helvetic Society for the Natural Sciences]], established in 1815.

==History==
The Helvetic Society was the first patriotic society in Switzerland aimed at all Swiss people. It was inspired by [[Franz Urs Balthasar]]'s ''Patriotische Träume eines Eidgenossen von einem Mittel, die veraltete Eidgenosenschaft wieder zu verjüngen'', an essay from 1758 which was distributed in manuscript form and was discussed by [[Joseph Anton Felix von Balthasar]] (son of the author), Iselin, Gessner and [[Hans Caspar Hirzel]].&lt;ref name=Zimmer&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimmer|first=Oliver|title=A contested nation: history, memory and nationalism in Switzerland, 1761-1891|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5guRLMVcYGoC&amp;pg=PA47 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81919-0|pages=269|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of discussion, and a change of scope from an historical society to a more socially directed one, the Society first met with 9 members in 1761, and was eventually formed on 15 May 1762 in [[Schinznach-Dorf]], with statutes by Hirzel, with 25 initial members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=History of Switzerland|year=1832|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown &amp; Green|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RagWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 |page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it had an open membership structure and advocated religious harmony, very few Catholics joined, and the members were predominantly German-speaking. The society tried to be more than just a philosophical debate club like most other similar European societies, and also organised social activities, and a yearly autumn meeting from 1763 on, first in Schitznach, and from 1780 on in [[Olten]],&lt;ref name=Melanges&gt;{{cite book|title=Mélanges Helvétiques des années 1787, 1788, 1789, 1790|year=1791|publisher=Charles Auguste Serini|location=Basel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wq4PAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA410 |accessdate=9 June 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally in [[Aarau]].  New statutes were approved in 1766, focusing on the inclusiveness of the society towards all Swiss from all cantons.&lt;ref name=Zimmer/&gt; The aims of the Society included a democratic reform of the Swiss constitution, and education for all, influenced by the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as expressed in ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]''. The pedagogic reformer [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] was an early member of the Society. He was one of the contributors for the Society's magazine ''Der Erinnerer'', established in 1765, but it was soon suppressed for being too radical and critical of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=P.|title=Education Administration|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-898-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNuK88RgTc8C&amp;pg=PA165 |accessdate=9 June 2011|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1766 statutes listed as the aim of the Society "The only goal and unique object of our Society must be to establish and conserve between the Swiss love and friendship, unity and concord; to maintain among them the taste for beautiful, noble and great acts; and to transmit for posterity liberty, peace and virtue through the care of good citizens".&lt;ref name=Melanges/&gt;

After a halting start, with a membership that stayed at around 80 until 1770, the society flourished, with 159 members by 1780 and 283 by 1797, with a steady rise in visitors as well, like some members of the [[Bernoulli family]] in 1763.&lt;ref name=Melanges/&gt; Among the new members were a lot of cantonal magistrates and other members of the Swiss elite. Of the 386 members the society had between 1762 and 1798, some 90 percent held a political office at some time.&lt;ref name=Zimmer/&gt;

In 1798, instead of an annual meeting, the members of the Helvetic Society started with the creation of the legislative assembly for the new [[Helvetic Republic]], providing many members. The Society was abandoned, and was revived in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Roy|title=Romanticism in national context|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33913-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhZjIO2aajAC&amp;pg=PA156 |accessdate=9 June 2011|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second version of the Society existed until 1849, when the society had become superfluous when most of its ideas were included in the new [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=Hans|title=Nationalism and Liberty|year=1956|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|pages=142|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalismandli006169mbp|authorlink=Hans Kohn|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have traditionally been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] constituency, in the main.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/americas/2000/us_elections/hispanic_vote/1003642.stm |title=The Latino challenge |accessdate=2008-05-16 |last=Munoz Jr |first=Carlos |date=2 November 2000 |publisher=[[BBC]] Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hispanic/Latino Participation and Key Issues==
Most [[Cuban-American]]s and [[Venezuelan-American]]s tend to support the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], while [[Mexican-Americans]], [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]], [[Salvadoran American|Salvadoran-American]]s, [[Guatemalan American|Guateman-American]]s, and [[Dominican Americans|Dominican-Americans]] tend to support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} As the latter groups are far more numerous (Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/factsheets/hispanics2006/Table-5.pdf |title=Detailed Hispanic Origin: 2006 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position among Hispanics overall. The U.S. Census indicates that the Hispanic population of the United States is the fastest growing minority group in the country.&lt;ref name=CBPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/011910.html |title=US Census Press Releases |accessdate=2008-05-16 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506111621/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/011910.html |archivedate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 9% of eligible voters nationwide are Latino. The majority support for Democratic candidates continues a pattern among Hispanic voters. In a December 2011, 67% of Hispanics said they were Democrats, and 20% of Hispanics said they were Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= As Deportations Rise to Record Levels, Most Latinos Oppose Obama's Policy |work= Pew Hispanic Center |date= December 28, 2011 |publisher= Pew Research Center |first1= Mark Hugo |last1= Lopez |first2= Ana |last2= Gonzalez-Barrera |first3= Seth |last3= Motel |url= http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/12/28/as-deportations-rise-to-record-levels-most-latinos-oppose-obamas-policy/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 midterm elections, 60% of Hispanics voted Democratic, while 38% voted Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Latino Vote in the 2010 Elections |work= Pew Hispanic Center |date= November 3, 2010 |first= Mark Hugo |last= Lopez |publisher= Pew Research Center  |url= http://www.pewhispanic.org/2010/11/03/the-latino-vote-in-the-2010-elections/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 67% of Hispanics voted for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, while 31% of Hispanics voted for Republican presidential candidate John McCain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Hispanic Vote in the 2008 Election |work= Pew Hispanic Center |date= November 5, 2008 |first= Mark Hung |last= Lopez |publisher= Pew Research Center |url= http://www.pewhispanic.org/2008/11/05/the-hispanic-vote-in-the-2008-election/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 69% of Latino voters supported Democratic candidates in congressional races, while 30% supported Republican candidates.

According to an October 2010 report by the [[Pew Hispanic Center]], Hispanics rank education, jobs, and health care as their top three issues of concern. Immigration ranks as the fourth most important issue for all Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics were obtained from CNN’s Election 2010 website and are based on the Edison Research’s national and state exit poll surveys of voters as reported on December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] projected that in November 2012 Hispanics would comprise 17.2 percent of the total U.S. population, 15 percent of adults, 11.2 percent of adult citizens, and 8.9 percent of actual voters. By comparison, the report found that in 2012, non-Hispanic whites are expected to be 73.4 percent of the national vote and non-Hispanic blacks are expected to be 12.2 percent. The report noted that by weight "eight percentage points of the Hispanic vote nationally equals slightly less than one percentage point of the non-Hispanic white vote." The study also compared the 8.9 percent Hispanic share of voters to veterans (12 percent of the electorate), those with family incomes above $100,000 (18 percent), seniors 65 and older (19 percent), married persons (60 percent), and those who live in owner-occupied housing (80 percent).&lt;ref name="cis.org"&gt;Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler, "Projecting the 2012 Hispanic Vote," Center for Immigration Studies, August 2012. Available at: http://cis.org/projecting-2012-hispanic-vote-nationally-battleground-states&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of voter turnout, the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] projected that 52.7 percent (± 0.6) of eligible Hispanics will vote in the 2012 election, an increase from 49.9 percent in 2008 and a continuation of the past decade's long upward trend. The projected Hispanic voter participation rate of 52.7 percent compares to 66.1 percent for non-Hispanic whites and 65.2 percent for non-Hispanic blacks in 2008.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt;

The '''Hostosian National Independence Movement''' ({{lang-es|'''Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano'''}}, MINH) is a [[left-wing|leftist]] and [[Puerto Rican independence movement|pro-independence]] organization (and unregistered political party&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciaworldfactbook.us/north-america/puerto-rico.html&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Puerto Rico]]. {{Citation needed|reason=No evidence of left wing political leanings given|date=July 2017}} As of 2015, Julio Muriente is known to be the leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/05/14/Protesters-decry-cuts-to-Puerto-Rico-University/4051431627246/ |title=Protesters decry cuts to Puerto Rico University |last=Adamczyk |first=Ed |date=14 May 2015 |website=www.upi.com |publisher=UPI |access-date=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The MINH was formed on May 6, 2004, by a merger of the [[National Hostosian Congress]] (CNH) and the ''New Puerto Rican Independence Movement'' (NMIP). The two groups that formed the MINH were organizational descendants of the [[Puerto Rican Socialist Party]] (PSP). The organization's name and ideology are based on the tradition of [[Eugenio María de Hostos]], a historical independence advocate. The official organ of the MINH is ''Red Betances'' and the newspaper "El Hostosiano".

The MINH was founded by the unification of two other independence groups: the "Congreso Nacional Hostosiano (CNH)" and the "Nuevo Movimiento Independentista Puertorriqueno (NMIP)". The MINH is not, nor strives to be, an [[electoral]] party. Instead, the MINH original goal was to operate in [[Civil Society]] as an autonomous entity engaged in [[community organizing]], [[patriotic]] education campaigns, [[anti-colonialism]], and defending/promoting the ideal of [[independence]] among [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Ricans]].

It was an organisational observer of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mea.gov.in/Images/pdf/Members-and-other-participants.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecompetitionworld.com/2014/11/nam-non-alignment-movement.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/non-aligned-movement-nam/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The MINH, as an organization, does not aspire to be an "electoral party", although its members are given the freedom to vote or not vote in Puerto Rican elections. 
Controversies exist within the independence movement because the MINH does not compel its members to vote for any particular party, but rather whichever candidate they, as individuals, believe is the best to administer the country. These controversies have greatly impacted the Puerto Rican independence movement. Along with the MINH, other independence organizations are the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], the [[Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico]], the [[Socialist Front (Puerto Rico)|Socialist Front]], [[Communist Party of Puerto Rico]], and the [[Workers' Socialist Movement (Puerto Rico)|Socialist Workers Movement]].

==Program==
The MINH has also been a strong catalyst in promoting a [[unicameral]] legislature in Puerto Rico, a [[Constituent Assembly]] on Status, and a greater role for Puerto Rico in the international arena, especially in the [[United Nations]]. Since 2004, the MINH has been organizing itself at the national, regional, and municipal levels with "base structures" and "specialized organizations". The MINH National Committee or Headquarters is located in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. All other major Puerto Rican cities ([[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]], [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]], [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]], [[Toa Baja, Puerto Rico|Toa Baja]] and [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]]) have Municipal Committees or "Base Structures" as do various other smaller towns throughout the island. 

The MINH also operates various "Puerto Rico Missions", of which the most important is located in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. Many more missions are planned to be established throughout [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]]. Established groups that share the aims and goals of the MINH can join and affiliate themselves as "Specialized Organizations". The MINH has also established its own newspaper called "El Hostosiano" which is distributed throughout the island.

==Recent Events==

In 2015 they praised (through their spokesperson Héctor Pesquera) Puerto Rican independence protests, saying "...it’s been a long time since an event for independence was so successful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://panampost.com/belen-marty/2015/06/16/push-for-puerto-rican-independence-gathering-steam/ |title=Push for Puerto Rican Independence Gathering Steam |last=Marty |first=Belén |date=16 June 2015 |website=panampost.com |access-date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, MINH (via Wilma Reverón) denounced the collection of DNA samples from 3 independentist militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/04/27/4609/ |title=Puerto Rico: Repression Against the Independentist Movement Intensifies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=25 April 2016 |website=www.thedawn-news.org |access-date= 29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ICWATCH''' is a public database of mainly [[LinkedIn]] profiles of people in the [[United States Intelligence Community]]. The database was created by Transparency Toolkit and is hosted by [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref name="mb"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-database-gathers-the-resumes-of-27000-intelligence-workers |agency= Motherboard |title= This Database Gathers the Resumes of 27,000 Intelligence Workers |date=May 7, 2015 |publisher= Vice.com |author= Joseph Cox |accessdate= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The publication of [[global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures in 2013]] revealed [[code name]]s for surveillance projects including [[MARINA]] and [[MAINWAY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html |publisher= [[The Washington Post]] |title=U.S. surveillance architecture includes collection of revealing Internet, phone metadata |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |author= Barton Gellman |date= June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130617/01163623501/why-nsa-president-bush-got-fisa-court-to-reinterpret-law-order-to-collect-tons-data.shtml |title= Why The NSA and President Bush Got the FISA Court to Reinterpret the Law in Order to Collect Tons of Data |publisher= Techdirt |accessdate= February 26, 2017 |date=June 17, 2013 |author=Mike Masnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then discovered that the [[LinkedIn]] profiles of individuals in the intelligence community mentioned these code names as well as additional ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/346139237856460801 |author= Christopher Soghoian |date= June 15, 2013 |publisher= Twitter |accessdate= February 26, 2017 |title= Tweet by @csoghoian |quote= Linkedin profiles of people in Maryland that mention MARINA &amp; NUCLEON have some fun other codenames like TRAFFICTHIEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130617/13482623512/discovering-names-secret-nsa-surveillance-programs-via-linkedin.shtml |title= Discovering Names of Secret NSA Surveillance Programs Via LinkedIn |publisher= Techdirt |accessdate= February 26, 2017 |date= June 18, 2013 |author= Mike Masnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency Toolkit took advantage of this and automated the collection of LinkedIn profiles mentioning such code names, collating them into a searchable database.&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet_20150506"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/linkedin-serves-up-resumes-of-27000-us-intelligence-personnel/ |publisher=ZDNet |title= LinkedIn serves up resumes of 27,000 US intelligence personnel |author= Rob O'Neill |accessdate= February 22, 2017 |date= May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kalev Leetaru |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/08/13/is-government-secrecy-dead-in-the-internet-and-social-media-era/ |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170222205942/http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/08/13/is-government-secrecy-dead-in-the-internet-and-social-media-era/#d7f01cd6e409 |dead-url=no |publisher=Forbes |title=Is Government Secrecy Dead in the Internet and Social Media Era? |date=August 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |quote=Last year the Transparency Toolkit released ICWATCH, a searchable database of more than 27,000 intelligence community employees, culled entirely from keyword searches of information IC employees uploaded themselves to LinkedIn.

==Name==

The name "ICWATCH" is a play on [[ICREACH]], an alleged [[Classified information|top-secret]], surveillance-related search engine created by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="Intercept"&gt;{{cite web |last= Gallagher |first= Ryan |title= The Surveillance Engine: How the NSA Built Its Own Secret Google |work= [[The Intercept]] |date= Aug 25, 2014 |url= https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/25/icreach-nsa-cia-secret-google-crisscross-proton/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;

==History==

The initial commit to the [[Git]] repository of LookingGlass was made on August 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/LookingGlass/commit/38d1787a21144654c9e7baf895fe34a21e992854 |date= August 23, 2014 |title= First version |author=M.C. McGrath (Shidash) |publisher= [[GitHub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; LookingGlass is a search tool that was built for use in ICWATCH.&lt;ref name="zdnet_20150506" /&gt;

ICWATCH launched on May 6, 2015;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://transparencytoolkit.org/icwatch/ |title= ICWATCH |publisher= Transparency Toolkit |accessdate= February 22, 2017 |date= May 6, 2015 |author= M.C. McGrath}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the same day, Transparency Toolkit, the group that created ICWATCH, presented it at the [[re:publica]] conference.&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt; At launch, the database contained information from over 27,000 LinkedIn profiles.&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcw"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/2919975/new-database-taps-linkedin-to-watch-the-nsa-watchers.html |date= May 7, 2015 |publisher= PCWorld |title= New database taps LinkedIn to watch the NSA watchers |accessdate= February 22, 2017 |author= Ian Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-May 2015, Transparency Toolkit began receiving requests from individuals to be removed from ICWATCH, including [[death threat]]s.&lt;ref name="zdnet"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/death-threat-fbi-complaint-greet-launch-of-intelligence-community-database/ |publisher=ZDNet |title=Death threat, FBI complaint greet launch of intelligence community database |author=Rob O'Neill |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/usa/260577-wikileaks-contractor-database-transparency/ |publisher=RT International |title=WikiLeaks takes spy contractor database under its wing amid death threats |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the threats as well as [[distributed denial-of-service attack]]s made against the site, WikiLeaks began hosting the website and database by the end of May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2015/5/28/the_kill_list_icwatch_uses_linkedin |title=The Kill List: ICWatch Uses LinkedIn Account Info to Out Officials Who Aided Assassination Program |publisher=''[[Democracy Now!]]'' |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet" /&gt;

By May 20, 2015, the number of profiles in ICWATCH had increased to almost 140,000.&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;

In August 2016 [[TechCrunch]] reported that LinkedIn was suing 100 unnamed individuals who had scraped LinkedIn's website, and named ICWATCH as a possible target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/linkedin-sues-scrapers/ |date=August 15, 2016 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |title=LinkedIn sues anonymous data scrapers |author=Kate Conger |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|02}}, the database tracks over 100,000 profiles from LinkedIn, Indeed, and other public sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transparencytoolkit.org/project/icwatch/ |title=ICWATCH |publisher=Transparency Toolkit |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The database can be searched using the company, location, industry, and other parameters of the intelligence workers.&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;

==Findings==

Most of the discovered profiles are not of those in the [[National Security Agency]] but of those working for [[List of United States defense contractors|contractors]].&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;

The project also revealed possible trends in employment in the intelligence community. For instance, the "number of people claiming to work with [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] databases [&amp;hellip;] has increased dramatically over the years since 2008, with just a small decline starting in 2013."&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;

M. C. McGrath of Transparency Toolkit believes that the workers are "for the most part, pretty normal people".&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;

==Reception==

Ian Paul of ''[[PC World]]'' voiced concern for the safety of the individuals listed in the database.&lt;ref name="pcw" /&gt;

The '''International Committee for Democracy in Cuba''' (ICDC) was created in September 2003 as "a response to the latest brutal crackdown by the Cuban government in the spring of that year against those pushing for democratic reforms, freedom of speech and adherence to international human rights agreements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdcprague.org/index.php?id=10|title=International Committee for Democracy in Cuba (ICDC) - About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICDC includes prominent international political figures, diplomats and intellectuals from around the world who want to show political solidarity with fellow democracy activists in Cuba and channel economic support to Cuba’s democratic opposition.

On 17–19 September 2004 the group held a conference of former heads of state, current ministers and representatives from the [[European Union]] and [[Latin America]], leaders from international and regional organizations, intellectuals, academics, [[human rights]] activists, members of [[non governmental organizations]], and representatives of the [[opposition to Fidel Castro|Cuban opposition]].

The group is based in [[Prague]] and headed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] playwright, writer and ex-President [[Václav Havel]] was a member of [[Charter 77]].{{needs update|date=September 2016}}

The '''Jane Addams Children's Book Award''' is given annually to a [[children's literature|children's book]] published the preceding year that advances the causes of [[peace]] and [[social equality]].  The awards have been presented annually since 1953. They were previously given jointly by the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) and the [[Jane Addams|Jane Addams Peace Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan C. |last=Griffith |title=Imagining Social Justice and Peace in a World Community: The Jane Addams Children's Book Award |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/WILLA/fall04/griffith.html |work=WILLA |publisher=The National Council of Teachers of English |date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now presented solely by the Jane Addams Peace Association.

==History==
The Jane Addams Children's Book Award was originally awarded to one book per year without categories. A Picture Book category was added in 1993; the award is currently given to two books annually, one for older children and one for younger children. In 2003, the time of year the award is given changed from September, honoring Jane Addams' birthday, to April, honoring the WILPF's birthday. 

In the sixty-plus years of the award’s history, there has been one public controversy over the selection of its winner.  In 1970, the award was given to ''[[The Cay]]'' by [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]], a book which became highly criticized in the years since its publication.  In 1974, the current award chair, who was not the chair at the time the award was given to ''[[The Cay]]'', publicly stated that she thought it was a mistake to have named ''[[The Cay]]'' an Addams Award winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffith|first1=S. C.|title=The Jane Addams Children’s Book Award: Honoring Children’s Literature for Peace and Social Justice since 1953|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, NJ|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Taylor, who saw the work as "a subtle plea for better race relations and more understanding,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Miller |title=Theodore Taylor, 85, Children's Novelist |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/42476 |work=New York Sun |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; returned the Award "by choice, not in anger, but with troubling questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=T|title=In the Mailbag . . . to the Editor|journal=Top of the News|date=1975|volume=31|issue=3|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years, Taylor reported that the Award had been rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roginski|first1=J.W.|title=Behind the Covers: Interviews of Authors and Illustrators of Children’s Books|date=1985|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|location=Littleton, CO|page=212|chapter=Theodore Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though ''[[The Cay]]'' remains on the list of Addams Award winners, Taylor's claim is widely thought to be true and has become a part of reading and discussing the book with young people today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffith|first1=S.

'''Ken Knabb''' (born 1945) is an American writer, translator, and radical theorist,&lt;ref&gt;Knabb, Ken. "[http://www.bopsecrets.org/recent/france2006.htm Reflections on the Uprising in France]"&lt;/ref&gt; known for his translations of [[Guy Debord]] and the [[Situationist International]].  His own English-language writings, many of which were anthologized in ''Public Secrets'' (1997), have been translated into over a dozen additional languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complete Cinematic Works: Scripts, Stills, Documents|isbn=1902593731|year=2003|authors=Guy Debord, Ken Knabb|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a respected authority on the political significance of [[Kenneth Rexroth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Beat Literature|chapter=Thou Shalt Not Kill|author=Morgan Gibson|year=2007|isbn=1438109083|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Knabb was born in [[Louisiana]] in 1945 and raised in Missouri. He attended [[Shimer College]] from 1961 to 1965, then moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he took part in the countercultural and radical adventures of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Knabb, Ken. "[http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/autobio.htm Confessions of a Mild-Mannered Enemy of the State]"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, having become disillusioned with the increasingly authoritarian tendencies in the [[New Left]] movement, he became an [[anarchism|anarchist]]. Later that same year, he discovered some pamphlets by the Situationist International and was so struck by them that he began experimenting with critiques and interventions in a style similar to that of the situationists. Over the next few years, he taught himself French in order to read the original situationist writings (most of which were then unavailable in English) and made several extended visits to France to meet various situationist groups and individuals, as well as shorter trips to meet contacts in other European countries and in Japan and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Knabb, Ken. "[http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/autobio.htm Confessions of a Mild-Mannered Enemy of the State]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In 1981, Knabb published the ''Situationist International Anthology'', a large collection of articles drawn mostly from the French journal ''Internationale Situationniste''. His other translations include Guy Debord's film scripts (''Complete Cinematic Works''), Debord's ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', and [[Ngo Van]]'s ''In the Crossfire: Adventures of a Vietnamese Revolutionary''. Knabb's own writings include leaflets, comics, pamphlets and articles on [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Gary Snyder]], the 1960s [[hippie|hip counterculture]], the 1970 [[1970 Polish protests|Polish revolt]], the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]], the 1991 [[Gulf war]], the 2006 [[2006 labour protests in France|anti-CPE revolt in France]], the 2011 [[Occupy movement]], and the 2016 Trump election. Longer works include ''The Relevance of Rexroth'' (a study of the anarchist poet and essayist [[Kenneth Rexroth]]), ''Gateway to the Vast Realms'' (a reader's guide to 500 recommended books), and ''The Joy of Revolution'' (an examination of the pros and cons of diverse radical tactics followed by some speculations on how a nonstate and noncapitalist postrevolutionary society might function).&lt;ref&gt;Knabb has published all of his writings without copyright. Most are included in his book ''Public Secrets''. All are online at his "Bureau of Public Secrets" website [http://www.bopsecrets.org]. For bibliographical information, see [http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/biblionotes.htm]. For diverse reviews and reactions to his works, see [http://www.bopsecrets.org/CF/opinions2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perspectives ==
Although Knabb has remained in substantial agreement with most of the situationist perspectives, some of his writings can be seen as attempts to meld, or at least to juxtapose, those perspectives with the rather different tone and scope of Kenneth Rexroth and with the experiential insights of [[Zen Buddhism]] (he is a long-time Zen practitioner). In a 1977 pamphlet, for example, he critiqued what he saw as the situationists' blindspot regarding religion.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/religion.htm The Realization and Suppression of Religion]"&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, he has also criticized the political naiveté of [[Engaged Buddhism|"socially engaged" Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/buddhists.htm Strong Lessons for Engaged Buddhists]"&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his recurring themes is the importance of paying attention to the psychological or "subjective" aspect of radical activities.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/double.htm Double-Reflection]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LGBT conservatism''' refers to a socio-political movement which embraces and promotes the ideology of [[conservatism]] within an [[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]]) context. '''Gay conservatives''' may also refer to lesbian or gay persons with conservative political views. The number of openly LGBT advocates for conservative policies has only become increasingly apparent since the advent of the modern LGBT civil rights movement in the 1970s while many more LGBT conservatives remain closeted in countries where other socially conservative politicians have led the most organized [[opposition to LGBT rights]] efforts as well as the backlash from liberal LGBT. The situation and ideology for LGBT conservatives varies by each country's social and political LGBT rights climate.

==History==
{{See also|LGBT conservatism in the United States#History}}

===Before the Stonewall riots===
In 1852, under the [[Prime Minister of Portugal|prime ministership]] of the [[João Carlos de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha|Duke of Saldanha]], a liberal-conservative [[Cartista]], same-sex sexual intercourse was legalized throughout Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glapn.org/sodomylaws/ |title=Sodomylaws.org |publisher=Sodomylaws.org |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the draft penal law submitted by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] to the [[North German Confederation]] retained the relevant Prussian penal provisions criminalizing male same-sex sexual intercourse, justifying this out of concern for "[[public opinion]]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even though one can justify the omission of these penal provisions from the standpoint of Medicine as well as on grounds taken from certain theories of criminal law{{spaced ndash}}the public's sense of justice (''das Rechtsbewußtsein im Volke'') views these acts not merely as vices but as crimes [...].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 15, 1871, under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Paragraph 175]] was enacted throughout the [[German Empire]].

In August 1885, under [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], the [[Labouchere Amendment]] passed August 7, 1885 becoming Section 11 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/pride/history-lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-equality|title=Key dates for lesbian, gay, bi and trans equality|date=26 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, during the period known as the Conservative Republic ({{lang-es|República Conservadora}}), same-sex sexual intercourse was legalized throughout Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A world survey of laws: Criminalisation, protection and recognition of same-sex law|first= Paoli Itaborahy|last1= Lucas|first2= Jingshu|last2= Zhu|publisher= International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association|date= May 2013|url= http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf|archivedate= 2013-07-19|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 1954, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], during a cabinet meeting, bluntly replied that the Conservative Party was not going to accept responsibility for making the law more lenient towards gay men. He suggested that an [[enquiry]] might be the way forward, proposed limiting press coverage of the convictions of homosexuals, and suggested that any man caught by police should be offered the option of [[medical treatment]]. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t touch the subject,” he said. “Let it get worse – in hope of a more united public pressure for some amendment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/08/06/archives-reveal-churchills-cabinet-discussed-gays/|title=Archives reveal Churchill’s Cabinet discussed gays|publisher=PinkNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Brian Coleman]], a former openly gay Conservative member of the London Assembly and former mayor of Barnet, wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that in the mid-1950s, London police were aware that future Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] was "[[cottaging]]" (seeking out anonymous sex partners in public lavatories) and that they warned him to stop, lest it damage his career. Coleman also claimed that gays "ran" the Conservative Party in London for many years, suggesting Heath may have been “protected”. “[Britain] had managed for decades with gay men holding a significant number of public offices”, Coleman wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/edward-heath-britains-forgotten-mysterious-prime-minister-1316889|title=Edward Heath: Britain’s Forgotten And Mysterious Prime Minister|date=21 June 2013|work=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, after the international conference Wolfenden50, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government appointed the Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution 1957 to investigate what were perceived as two increasing social problems, in the context of rising prosecutions. The committees terms of reference asked members to consider ‘the law and practice’ relating to both ‘homosexual offences and the treatment of persons convicted of such offences’ and to offences connected to ‘prostitution and solicitation for immoral purposes’. The association between homosexuality and prostitution reflected the committee’s assumption that both were forms of deviance threatening the family as ‘the basic unit of society’. The committee’s report in 1957 included as its first recommendation ‘That homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private be no longer a criminal offence’; other recommendations sought the tightening of the law concerning public same-sex behaviour and street prostitution, although acts of selling sex would remain legal.&lt;ref name="Homosexual Offences and Prostitution 1957"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/4824/17/05Waites_UKConfrontingCriminalStories.pdf|title=UNITED KINGDOM: CONFRONTING CRIMINAL HISTORIES |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1965, [[Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran]] and Conservative Party [[Chief Whip]], introduced into the [[House of Lords]] a bill decriminalizing male same-sex sexual intercourse in [[England and Wales]]. During its passage, senior peers inserted a strict privacy clause, applying a more restrictive standard of privacy than for heterosexual behavior. This specified that a ‘homosexual act’ would not be considered ‘private’ if ‘more  than two persons take part or are present’, or if occurring in a public lavatory. The bill passed through the Lords in July 1965 and was brought into the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by Conservative MP [[Humphrey Berkeley]], known to be homosexual by many in parliament. After a Labour victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|general election in 1966]], Berkeley lost his seat and was replaced as the bill’s sponsor by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Leo Abse]].&lt;ref name="Homosexual Offences and Prostitution 1957" /&gt;

Prospective Conservative Prime Minister [[Robert Boothby]] (later Lord Boothby), who was homosexual, was peppered throughout parliament and the establishment, and hence their political colleagues had every interest in decriminalizing their activities. Boothby was involved in a friendship and possibly a sexual relationship with [[Ronnie Kray]], while simultaneously  the long-term lover of Lady [[Dorothy Macmillan]], wife of [[Harold Macmillan]], Conservative Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.&lt;ref name="Homosexual Offences and Prostitution 1957" /&gt;

When the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] passed in 1967, only a handful of Conservatives voted for the decriminalization of male same-sex sexual intercourse, including future Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/08/margaret-thatcher-s-legacy-on-gay-rights|title=Margaret Thatcher's Legacy on Gay Rights|first=Tom|last=Doran|date=8 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 1969, shortly before the end of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) – [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) Grand Coalition headed by CDU Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]], Paragraph 175 was reformed, in that only the "qualified cases" that were previously handled in §175a – sex with a man less than 21 years old, homosexual prostitution, and the exploitation of a relationship of dependency (such as employing or supervising a person in a work situation) – were retained. Paragraph 175b (concerning bestiality) also was removed.

===After the Stonewall riots===

====Rise of LGBT conservatism====
In 1975, the [[Conservative Group for Homosexual Equality]] (CGHE) was founded in the United Kingdom by [[Peter Walter Campbell]]. It was the first LGBT conservative organization ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voice1nthecrowd.blogspot.com/2014/10/peter-campbell-conservative-party.html|title=The Dissident: Peter Campbell, the Conservative Party Paedophile behind Gay Marriage|first=Tony|last=Aster|date=19 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Brian Coleman]], a former openly gay Conservative member of the London Assembly and former mayor of Barnet, wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that many of the gay politicians in the Conservative Party joined the party and became active during the Thatcher years. He also contended that the underlying ethos of [[Thatcherism]] might well be pro-gay and it was Margaret Thatcher's personality which attracted so many homosexual men to the party. The reason he contended that the Iron Lady drew many gay men to the Conservative Party was her pure elegance, feminine perfection, perfect dress sense, and sheer determination to change society and whilst her government might have had an anti-gay aura there was simply nothing in her personal attitude to demonstrate any prejudice, she appointed gay ministers, such as [[Earl of Avon]] (son of ex-Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]]). On the subject of AIDS it was her government with [[Norman Fowler]] as Health Secretary which faced the issue head on and refused to take a moral tone on public information and prevention work. He finishes by stating that "There are many gay Tory men who would like to sleep with David Cameron but it is Lady Thatcher whose portrait hangs over their bed!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/brian-coleman/2007/06/lady-thatcher-gay-tory|title=Thatcher the gay icon|website=www.newstatesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Thatcher ministry]], [[Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980|Criminal Justice Act 1980]] was passed in 1980, legalizing same-sex sexual intercourse in Scotland.

On May 28, 1988, during the [[Third Thatcher ministry]], [[Section 28|Clause 28]] of the [[Local Government Act 1988]] received a 2 to 1 majority in the [[House of Lords]] and a vote of 254 to 201 in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUrbpfDVNeAC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Clause+28+may+1988+vote&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oAHiseWzXs&amp;sig=oCF_h2laEuO8I7zUp-nQ0AU0KXI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBWoVChMI5Lfi2cy3xwIVBj8-Ch31qQAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Clause+28+may+1988+vote&amp;f=false|title=The Unfinished Revolution: Social Movement Theory and the Gay and Lesbian Movement|first=Stephen M.|last=Engel|date=26 July 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the CGHE reconstituted at the Conservative Party Conference and renamed the [[Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] (TORCHE). The organization would remain active til 2004 when it disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqjmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT368&amp;lpg=PT368&amp;dq=1991+Tory+Campaign+for+Homosexual+Equality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=77mjBGwA3f&amp;sig=l1_DEke4WVYjJv4cS7G5NEy837s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwA2oVChMIlpq229e3xwIVyaA-Ch0Elgwr#v=onepage&amp;q=1991+Tory+Campaign+for+Homosexual+Equality&amp;f=false|title=Queering Religion, Religious Queers|first1=Yvette|last1=Taylor|first2=Ria|last2=Snowdon|date=18 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2003, the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist regime in Iraq]] was deposed. The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], established by the [[George W. Bush administration]], abolished the death penalty and reverted to a revised 1988 penal code, thus legalizing same-sex sexual intercourse in Iraq.

On June 24, 2004, [[Fine Gael]] proposed legalizing civil partnerships for same-sex and opposite-sex couples who choose not to marry, the first Irish political party to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0624/51586-gay/|title=FG proposes civil partnership rights|date=24 June 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, in reaction to the legal challenge on tax issues [[Taoiseach]] and [[Fianna Fáil]] leader [[Bertie Ahern]] said "Couples want equality and we should try to deal with some of those issues" but added that moves to legalise gay marriage are "a long way off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4012713.stm|title='Better rights' for gay couples|date=15 November 2004|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Irish presidential election, 2004|2004 Irish presidential election]], [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]], and [[Progressive Democrats]], produced policies or made statements in favor of varying forms of recognition for same-sex couples. During the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 Irish general election]], the manifestos of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Progressive Democrats, supported civil unions for same-sex couples. All parties ran advertisements in [[Gay Community News (Dublin)|Gay Community News]] (GNC) with commitments to same-sex couples.

In 2010, [[Ógra Fianna Fáil]] came out in favor of same-sex marriage.

In 2010, the Botswana government, under the control of the [[Botswana Democratic Party]], passed an amendment to its Employment Act that will bring an end to dismissal based on an individual's sexual orientation or HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/90437/botswana-amendment-to-end-dismissal-based-on-hiv-status|title=Amendment to end dismissal based on HIV status|date=9 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, [[Young Fine Gael]] came out in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yfg.ie/newsevents/press/298-young-fg-propose-the-recognition-of-marriage-for-same-sex-couples|title=Young FG Propose the Recognition of Marriage for Same Sex Couples|date=27 August 2011|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827132123/http://www.yfg.ie/newsevents/press/298-young-fg-propose-the-recognition-of-marriage-for-same-sex-couples|archivedate=27 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2011, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said at a Conservative Party conference that "So I don't support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/05/david-cameron-conservative-party-speech|title=David Cameron's Conservative party conference speech in full|first=|last=guardian.co.uk|date=5 October 2011|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2013, [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|Marriage Act 2013]], during its second reading, received in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] that Conservatives voted 126 for, 134 against (including 8 voted against from the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]), 5 both, and 36 did not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21346694|title=MP-by-MP: Gay marriage vote|date=5 February 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2013, the act, during its third reading, received in the House of Commons that Conservatives voted 117 for, 127 against (including 8 voted against from the Democratic Unionist Party), 7 both, and 51 did not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2013-05-21&amp;number=11&amp;display=allpossible|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill — Third Reading — 21 May 2013  at 18:59 — The Public Whip|website=www.publicwhip.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2013, the act, during its second reading, received in the [[House of Lords]] that Conservatives voted against the [[Geoffrey Dear, Baron Dear|Dear]] Amendment to reject second reading, 66 voted in favour, including 2 in favour from the Democratic Unionist Party, 1 in favour from [[Ulster Unionist Party]], and 2 in favor from [[UK Independence Party]], and 63 did not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/LordsDivisions/Pages/LordsDivisions.aspx?id=51023&amp;epslanguage=en&amp;date=2013-Jun-04&amp;itemId=1&amp;session=2013-May-08|title=Lords Divisions results|website=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act had its third reading on July 15, 2013, and was passed by a simple [[voice vote]].&lt;ref name="timetable"/&gt; The amended Bill returned to the House of Commons for approval of the amendments on 16 July 2013, which the House approved on the same day.&lt;ref name="timetable"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill stages — Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill 2012-13 to 2013-14 |publisher=UK Parliament |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/marriagesamesexcouplesbill/stages.html |accessdate=26 June 2013 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2013, Fine Gael came out in favour of same-sex marriage in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/government-to-call-for-yes-vote-for-gay-marriage-29728937.html|title=Government to call for Yes vote for gay marriage - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Belgium===

In [[Belgium]], while centre-right parties like the [[New Flemish Alliance]] support LGBT rights, the right-wing to far-right [[Flemish Interest]] does not.

===Brazil===
Before and following the [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff]], several gay conservatives have been visible. [[Clodovil Hernandes]] of the [[Christian Labour Party]] and later the [[Party of the Republic]] before his death in 2009 is considered to be the first known gay MP for the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]].

On 16 January 2017, [[Marcelo Crivella]], the mayor of [[Rio de Janeiro]], promoted Nélio Georgini, a gay evangelical conservative, to the head of the city LGBT council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgbtbrasil.com.br/Noticias/411/1/Crivella-nomeia-gay-%E2%80%9Cevangelico%E2%80%9D-para-pasta-em-defesa-de-LGBT|title=Crivella nomeia gay “evangélico” para pasta em defesa de LGBT|website=lgbtbrasil.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Brazilian LGBT community vote 30% in the [[right-wing populist]] [[Jair Bolsonaro]] against 57% of votes for [[left-wing politics|leftist]] [[Fernando Haddad]] in the presidential runoff, according [[Datafolha]]. The 30% of votes in Bolsonaro shocked many in the Brazilian LGBT community, because Bolsonaro is seen by LGBT rights groups as a [[homophobe]] politician [[Opposition to LGBT rights|hostile to LGBT rights]]. The reasons attributed to these votes were the fear of violence, economic insecurity, attachment with traditional values, tiredness with [[Workers' Party]] and sensation of political manipulation of LGBT themes by the left in order to get votes. &lt;ref&gt;https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/10/27/opinion/1540592921_823943.amp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[LGBTory]] was founded in 2015 as a group for LGBT supporters of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and provincial conservative parties across [[Canada]]. Prior to that, small groups existed locally in some Canadian cities or as discussion forums on the Internet.

Openly gay political figures such as [[Scott Brison]], [[Lorne Mayencourt]] and Jaime Watt are or have been associated with conservative parties at the provincial or federal levels, [[Keith Norton]], [[Phil Gillies]] and [[Heward Grafftey]] came out as gay after their careers as politicians had ended, and [[Richard Hatfield]] was outed as gay after his death.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;"Gay politicians come out of the closet and into the cabinet". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Most such figures, however, have been [[Red Tory|Red Tories]], a moderate or even progressive faction within Canadian conservatism, rather than conventionally conservative "Blue" Tories; Brison, in fact, quit the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] after the PCs merged with the more right-wing [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]].

In 2015, a contingent of federal Conservative MPs and provincial [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] MPPs participated in Toronto's annual [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride Week]] parade for the first time in its history. Organized by LGBTory, the marching contingent included federal MPs [[Kellie Leitch]] and [[Bernard Trottier]], Ontario PC leader [[Patrick Brown (politician)|Patrick Brown]] and MPPs [[Lisa MacLeod]] and [[Jack MacLaren]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/06/29/tory-mpp-lisa-macleod-rejects-anti-pride-comments-from-ottawa-radio-host.html "Tory MPP Lisa MacLeod rejects anti-Pride comments from Ottawa radio host"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', June 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; alongside numerous out LGBT party activists and supporters.

LGBT representation in politics is promoted by [[ProudPolitics]], a non-partisan networking and mentoring organization whose members span the political spectrum.

===Chile===
In 2014, the doctrinal council of the conservative [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] voted 72.3% to reject a proposal that would have advocated limiting marriage and adoption to heterosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movilh.cl/consejo-doctrinario-de-rn-rechaza-limitar-idea-de-famiia-al-matrimonio-heterosexual/|title=Consejo doctrinario de RN rechaza limitar idea de familia al matrimonio heterosexual|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Members of the [[European Parliament]] from across the political spectrum, including conservatives, have formed the [[European Parliament Intergroup on LGBT Rights]].

===France===

A 2013 [[IFOP]] survey of French [[LGBT|LGB]] people found that French LGB people have same underlying trends as the rest
of the population, namely a radicalization of positions and some disenchantment with political parties. The left wing parties of France did not capitalize on [[Law 2013-404]] with LGBT voters, which implies that the party positions on social issues are secondary to policy choices, with LGBT people having no distinction on this point the rest of the population. Despite some French media representations, sexual orientation does not appear to determine political views. With increasing acceptance of LGBT people in France, LGBT people in France feel less inclined to mobilize behind parties with the political demands of the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="Political position of gays after the enactment of the act marriage for all"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.ifop.com/media/pressdocument/640-1-document_file.pdf&amp;usg=ALkJrhgx5A9Jl_MIQFgiDX7mz0ZN3xkS3w#5|title=Google Translate|website=translate.googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) from 2012 and 2013 found that 21% of bisexuals supported PS in 2012, but only 16% supported PS in 2013, while LGB people maintained support for PS and the [[Europe Ecology – The Greens]] at 27% and 6% from 2012 to 2013. Law 2013-404 has allowed the left government to maintain its support among LGB people overall, while in steep decline in the overall population. In 2011, 50% of LGB people supported left wing parties, while in 2012, 44% of LGB people supported left wing parties, and in 2013, 36% of LGB people supported left wing parties. When counting gay voters only, 45% supported left wing parties in 2012, while 38% supported left wing parties in 2013. Among non-heterosexuals, 24% supported left wing parties in 2012, while 21% supported left wing parties in 2013. Among heterosexuals, 21% supported left wing parties in 2012, while 18% supported left wing parties in 2013. Disaffection towards the left party is a phenomenon is affecting all sexual orientation categories of the population.&lt;ref name="Political position of gays after the enactment of the act marriage for all" /&gt;

In 2011, 15% of non-heterosexuals supported center-right wing parties, while in 2012, 20% of non-heterosexuals supported center-right wing parties, and in 2013, 22% of non-heterosexuals supported center-right wing parties. In 2011, 17% of bisexuals supported center-right wing parties, while in 2012, 21% of bisexuals supported center-right wing parties, and in 2013, 17% of bisexuals supported center-right wing parties. In 2011, 13% of LGB people supported center-right wing parties, while in 2012, 20% of LGB people supported center-right wing parties, and in 2013, 21% of LGB people supported center-right wing parties. In 2011, 21% of heterosexuals supported center-right wing parties, while in 2012, 25% of heterosexuals supported center-right wing parties, and in 2013, 22% of heterosexuals supported center-right wing parties.&lt;ref name="Political position of gays after the enactment of the act marriage for all" /&gt;

Despite their opposition to Law 2013-404, the center right parties maintains its support among the LGB electorate, but in a more fragmented way than in the past. In 2012, 16% of LGB people supported the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UPM), while in 2013, 14% of LGB supported the UPM. In 2012, 20% of heterosexuals people supported the UPM, while in 2013, 17% of heterosexuals supported the UPM. This decline of support for UPM helped benefit of the [[Union of Democrats and Independents]], with 6% among LGB people in 2013, given that the positions taken by some of its leaders, such as [[Rama Yade]] and [[Jean-Louis Borloo]], in favor of same-sex marriage it was perhaps not unrelated.&lt;ref name="Political position of gays after the enactment of the act marriage for all" /&gt;

In 2012, 10% of non-heterosexuals supported the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], while in 2013, 16% of non-heterosexuals supported the National Front. In 2012, 9% of bisexuals supported the National Front, while in 2013, 16% of bisexuals supported the National Front. In 2012, 10% of [[LGBT|LGB]] people supported the National Front, while in 2013, 15% of LGB supported the National Front. In 2012, 9% of heterosexuals people supported the National Front, while in 2013, 13% of heterosexuals supported the National Front.&lt;ref name="Political position of gays after the enactment of the act marriage for all" /&gt;

Support for the National Front is  stronger in the ranks of LGB people than among all the French people, with 13% support for the National Front in 2013. The National Front is benefiting among LGB voters, with a +5% increase between 2012 and 2013, than in the rest of the population, +4% of heterosexuals in the same period. The increase of the National Front among LGB people is probably due to the composition of the electorate, with more male, urban, and younger people than the average population therefore generally more willing to vote for the National Front. In Paris, 26% of LGB residents support the National Front, with 16% heterosexuals support National Front. The National Front's hostility towards Islamism can seduce LGB people for whom Islam can appear as a threat against their lives and freedoms.&lt;ref name="Political position of gays after the enactment of the act marriage for all" /&gt;

===Netherlands===
Much of the Dutch right wing (including figures such as [[Geert Wilders]]) has evolved to include LGBT rights platforms which do not conflict with the current status quo but also embrace an increased perturbation to supposed threats from minority religions (especially Islam) which, in their view, threaten to upend the vestiges of the liberalism and tolerance which has been associated with the Dutch social climate.

===Sweden===
The Open Moderates is the LGBT-organisation of the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]]. The Open Moderates is an organization for everyone that shares the values of the Moderate Party and who believe that LGBT-issues are important political issues to work with from a centre-right perspective.

The origin of the Open Moderates is the Stockholm-based club “Gay Moderates” that was formed already in the late 1970s. That club had mostly social activities and it was active upon until the mid-1990s. A new generation took over and reorganized the Gay Moderates as a new more political network to lobby the Moderate Party. In 2003 the name was changed to the current Open Moderates to signal that the organisation is open to everyone regardless of sexual orientation that want to work with LGBT political issues.

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], the centre-right party [[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland]] support LGBT rights,&lt;ref name="Colours"&gt;{{cite news | title=Swiss Political Parties Reveal Their Colours | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/yes-or-no-_swiss-political-parties-reveal-their-colours/41640412 | date=September 11, 2015 | publisher=''[[Swissinfo]]'' | accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the right-wing [[Swiss People's Party]] does not.

===United Kingdom===
In April 2015, [[PinkNews]] found 26% of British LGBT people supported the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]], a 5% increase from the last election in 2010, 26% support the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], a 2% decrease from the last election in 2010, 19% support the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], a 21% decrease from the last election in 2010, 20% support the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]/[[Scottish Green Party]]/[[Green Party in Northern Ireland]], a 16% increase from the last election in 2010, and 2% supported the [[UK Independence Party]]. This is the first time in the 10 years that PinkNews has polled the LGBT community that the Conservatives have led the survey of voting intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/23/tories-level-labour-gay-vote|title=Tories draw level with Labour in winning gay vote|first=André|last=Rhoden-Paul|date=23 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first LGBT [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] group was called CGHE (Conservative Group for Homosexual Equality). That group was reconstituted at the Conservative party Conference in 1991 and was renamed TORCHE (the Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality). This group was active until 2003. Some years later [[LGBTory (United Kingdom)|LGBTory]] was formed. LGBTory has an active membership often organised using its Facebook groups and pages and attends vigils and LGBT Pride events across the UK including [[Pride London]], [[Pride Scotia]], [[Leeds Pride]], [[Manchester Pride]], [[Doncaster Pride]] and [[Brighton Pride]].

LGBTory campaigned in seats throughout the campaign for the 6 May 2010 General Election. There are now at least 12 openly gay and lesbian Conservative MPs in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliament]].

LGBTory works to promote LGBT Equality within the Conservative Party and generally across the UK, actively campaigning against the Gay Blood Ban and for marriage equality, regardless of sexuality or gender identity.

The [[UK Independence Party]] has an officially recognised LGBTQ in UKIP campaigning group which is active on the social media sites [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. It has been represented at the party's annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/09/25/ukip-approves-internal-lgbt-campaign-group/|title=UKIP approves internal LGBT campaign group|first=Scott|last=Roberts|work=PinkNews|date=25 September 2012|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Whittle (politician)|Peter Whittle]] of the UKIP was the only LGBT candidate in the [[London Assembly election, 2016|2016 London Assembly election]] and afterwards was selected as the UKIP's deputy leader.

On 21 March 2014 the '''[[All India Forward Bloc]]''' released its first list of candidates for the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 Lok Sabha election]].

|The flag design features a stylised [[Golden Wattle]] blossom centred on a green or blue background. The Golden Wattle is one of Australia's most enduring symbols: It has been a part of Aboriginal culture for thousands of years, it’s the inspiration behind the [[national colours of Australia]] - green and gold, and is the official [[List of Australian floral emblems|floral emblem of Australia]]. The wattle emblem is made up of smaller spherical flowers. Each flower is arranged in a circle to create the [[Commonwealth Star]] in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenwattleflag.com/#flag |title=The Golden Wattle flag |website=goldenwattleflag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Natural Colours of our Country Flag
|This flag design is inspired by the natural colours and shape of the Australian country. The black and red layers are inspired by the [[Australian Aboriginal flag]] (representing the earth and the night sky respectively as well as the Aboriginal peoples and their connection to the land). The blue layer represents the seas and waterways as well as Australia's history as part of the Commonwealth and our current [[Australian Flag]]. The yellow country represents the sun (giver of life) and sandy shores and wheat farms. The green represents the bush and trees. Together the green and gold produce the [[Golden Wattle]] and the [[National colours of Australia]]. Australians are people of all colours, shapes, cultures and sizes. All of these differences and our countries natural beauty makes Australia unique. This flag could be a good flag for a new Australian Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@juliussky/https-medium-com-juliussky-new-australian-reconciliation-republic-flag-28e8f2810c28 |title=New Australian Flag?

| Eureka Australis
| As stated by the name, this proposal is inspired by the Eureka flag. It takes from it the eight pointed star - which also symbolises the first federation flag, as well as the aboriginal people of the country -, with 4 seven-pointed stars on top of the cross. Unlike the original Eureka flag, the cross goes through the flag from extreme to extreme to resemble the St. George cross as a mean of depicting the country's British heritage. It uses Australia's national colours, plus white which provides a smoother transition between the yellow and green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eureka_Australis.png |title=Eureka Australis |website=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Under the Southern Cross Flag
|The Under the Southern Cross (By Justin R Smith) flag reflects all of Australia’s natural beauty. Australia’s official flora is represented in the colours green and gold. The Golden Wattle, which is Australia’s National flower. Australia’s official fauna is represented by a Kangaroo. The Kangaroo is white to symbolise peace. The Southern Cross constellation represents Australia’s position on Earth as being in the Southern Hemisphere. Each star has 8 points instead of 7 except for the centre star (Epsilon Crucis) which has 5 points. The 8-pointed stars represent the unity of the states and territories. The reason behind the extra point is that in 2018 the Northern Territory is expected to hold a referendum granting them statehood. Should this go ahead Australia will have 7 states. The other point is for the ACT like on the current Australian Flag. There is no single Commonwealth/ Federation star, instead it could be said that there are four. Regardless of the results in the NT there are many modern and past Australian Flags that have contained an 8-pointed Southern Cross stars including, The Eureka Stockade flag (1854), The National Colonial Flag (1881), NSW Ensign/ Australian Ensign (1832), Herald Federal Flag, the first flag of Australia from 1901–1903, the first Official National Australian Flag and also modern ones like the New South Wales, Victoria and the Northern Territory flags.

'''The Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act of 1992''' (Public Law 102-301) is a [[Federal law]] that established five new designated [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Areas]] and three new designated [[National Wild and Scenic Rivers System|Wild and Scenic Rivers]] in the [[Los Padres National Forest]] and [[Angeles National Forest]] in [[California]]. The law was sponsored by California Republican and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] native [[Robert J. Lagomarsino]] while he represented [[California's 19th congressional district|California's 19th District]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The legislation was cosponsored by Democratic and Republican representatives from districts representing the entirety of the Los Padres National Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/2556|title=H.R.2556 - Entitled "Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act".|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signed by President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]], the law designated 316,050 acres of new wilderness, expanded existing wilderness by 84,400 acres, and designated 84 miles of new Wild and Scenic Rivers. Most of the areas protected by the law provide habitat for the [[California condor]], a species that was extant only in captivity as of 1987 when all 27 condors left in the world were being kept in California breeding facilities and for which the legislation was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/conservation/birds/california-condor|title=California Condor|last=|first=|date=|website=California Department of Fish and Wildlife|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months before the bill was signed into law in 1992, two of the captive California condors were reintroduced into the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, a protected area that would go on to become part of the new [[Sespe Wilderness]] in Ventura County, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-15/news/mn-129_1_california-condor|title=First Captive California Condors Freed in Wild : Wildlife: Reintroduction of rare species comes 10 years after a disputed breeding program was started.|last=Stammer|first=Larry|date=15 January 1992|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act was first introduced to Congress as H.R. 4747 ([[100th United States Congress|100th U.S. Congress]]) by Representative Robert J. Lagomarsino in 1988. This first version of the legislation sought only to establish the Sespe and Matilija Wilderness Areas in addition to expanding the [[San Rafael Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/4747|title=H.R. 4747 - 100th U.S. Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagomarsino then reintroduced the bill in 1989 as H.R. 1473 ([[101st United States Congress|101st U.S. Congress]]), which was altered from the previous version to also designate the [[Garcia Wilderness|Garcia]] and San Emigdio Mesa Wilderness Areas while expanding the [[Ventana Wilderness]]. This version of the legislation would have also designated portions of [[Sespe Creek]], [[Sisquoc River]], and [[Big Sur River]] as Wild and Scenic Rivers. The bill passed the House of Representatives with amendments in October 1989, but never received a floor vote in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/1473|title=H.R. 1473 - 101st U.S. Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Lagomarsino worked closely with both of California's senators at the time, Democratic Senator [[Alan Cranston]] and Republican Senator [[John F. Seymour]], in developing the final bill that would be eventually signed into law. The bill introduced to and eventually passed by both houses of the [[102nd United States Congress|102nd U.S. Congress]] changed from the previous version by also establishing the [[Chumash Wilderness|Chumash]] and [[Silver Peak Wilderness|Silver Peak]] Wilderness Areas, containing no provisions allowing for new directional oil drilling leases under wilderness, and modified language regarding water rights and management of wilderness areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1991-pt10/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1991-pt10-1-3.pdf|title=Congressional Record, Extensions of Remarks|last=|first=|publisher=United States Government Publishing Office|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=13623-13624}}&lt;/ref&gt; President George H.W. Bush signed the Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act into law in 1992, lauding the legislation for protecting habitat critical to the recovery of the nearly extinct California condor, increasing the amount of national forest lands in California protected under the [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Act of 1964]] by 10%, and permanently protecting nearly half of the Los Padres National Forest as wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=21118|title=Statement on Signing the Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act|last=Bush|first=George|date=19 June 1992|website=The American Presidency Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designation of New Wilderness Areas ==
Five new wilderness areas totaling 316,050 acres were designated within the Los Padres National Forest (although the Sespe Wilderness includes a small portion of the Angeles National Forest ):
* Sespe Wilderness - 219,700 acres  
* Chumash Wilderness - 38,150 acres  
* Matilija Wilderness - 29,600 acres  
* Silver Peak Wilderness - 14,500 acres  
* Garcia Wilderness - 14,100 acres  
These wilderness areas span Kern, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties as well as the Los Padres National Forest's Santa Lucia, Monterey, Mount Pinos, and Ojai Ranger Districts

== Expansion of Existing Wilderness Areas ==
Two existing wilderness areas within the Los Padres National Forest were expanded by 84,400 acres:
* San Rafael Wilderness - 46,400 acres
* Ventana Wilderness - 38,000 acres
These wilderness areas span Monterey and Santa Barbara Counties and the Los Padrs National Forest's Santa Barbara, Santa Lucia, and Monterey Ranger Districts.

== Designation of Wild and Scenic Rivers ==
The legislation amended the [[National Wild and Scenic Rivers System|Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968]] to establish 84 miles of three streams within the Los Padres National Forest as new Wild and Scenic Rivers:
* Sisquoc River - 33 miles (Wild River)
* Sespe Creek - 31.5 miles (4 miles as a Scenic River and 27.5 miles as a Wild River)
* Big Sur River - 19.5 miles (Wild River)

== Other Provisions ==
In designating the Sespe Wilderness, the Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act also recognized an existing 18-mile trail between Reyes Creek and Lion Campgrounds as the Gene Marshall-Piedra Blanca [[National Recreation Trail]]. The legislation established water rights to begin reserving a quantity of water "sufficient to fulfill the purposes of this Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/2556/text|title=Text: H.R.2556 — 102nd Congress (1991-1992|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the legislation amended the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 by adding portions of [[Piru Creek]], [[Little Sur River]], [[Matilija Creek]], Lopez Creek, and Sespe Creek to the list of streams for potential designation as Wild and Scenic Rivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4036">The '''Meadeau View Institute''' was a conservative organization that operated in [[Duck Creek, Utah]], from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=backers&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/366360/BACKERS-TRIED-IN-VAIN-TO-RECOVER-LOSSES.html |title=Backers Tried in Vain to Recover Losses |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |work=[[Deseret News]] |last=Parkinson |first=Paul |author2=Cates, Karl |date=July 26, 1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728043614/http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/366360/BACKERS-TRIED-IN-VAIN-TO-RECOVER-LOSSES.html |archivedate=July 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was notable for seeking to build a Utopian community of alternative-lifestyle conservatives in Southern Utah. The community collapsed in 1994 due to financial problems incident to the loss of property in an accidental explosion.

== Founding ==
[[William H. Doughty]], the institute's founder and money manager, accepted over $1 million in donations and loans from backers in an attempt to build a conservative Utopia in [[Duck Creek, Utah|Duck Creek]] and [[Mammoth Valley]], [[Utah]] (near [[Hatch, Utah|Hatch]]). In December 1986, Doughty purchased a vacant lodge in Duck Creek from Harry and Gabrielle Moyer, who carried the note for him. He later moved his [[Institute for Constitutional Education]] (ICE) from [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] to the lodge. Contributors include [[W. Cleon Skousen]], [[Glenn Kimber]], and [[Donald N. Sills]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Collapse==
During the winter of 1993, snow build-up from a record snowfall led to a propane explosion at the Meadeau View lodge.  The investment which had been made in this asset was lost, as well as the income from seminars and conferences.  As a result, donations and other fundraising efforts also failed, leading to the demise of the organization.  The fledgeling [[George Wythe College]], which had been holding classes in the lodge, moved to Cedar City, and those who sought to build the community, including Shanon Brooks (who later became president of George Wythe University), left.&lt;ref name="wheredidmoneygo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/366287/EX-DEVOTEES-WANT-TO-KNOW-WHERE-DID-THE-MONEY-GO.html |title=Ex-Devotees Want To Know Where Did The Money Go? |last=Parkinson |first=Paul |author2=Cates, Karl |date=July 25, 1994 |publisher=Deseret News |accessdate=November 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730084436/http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/366287/EX-DEVOTEES-WANT-TO-KNOW-WHERE-DID-THE-MONEY-GO.html |archivedate=July 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, Doughty still maintained a ranch in Mammoth Valley.

== Aftermath ==
The ''[[Deseret News]]'' reported that participants who lost money were reluctant to come forward to authorities, due to their inherent distrust for the government.&lt;ref name=backers/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3149">In [[Troy, New York]], on March 6, 1894 during an election riot between pollwatchers and [[Edward Murphy, Jr.|operatives of the local Democratic political ward boss]] who were engaged in repeat voting, a young poll watcher, Robert Ross, was shot and killed. His brother, William, was also shot but survived.

Bartholomew Shea and John McGough were at the polling booth of the third district of the Thirteenth Ward. William and Robert Ross were present as poll watchers. ''"The row started when one of the Shea gang sought to vote upon another citizen's name and in a twinkling clubs and revolvers were flourished. Many shots were fired and when the fight closed it was found that Robert Ross had been fatally shot, that his brother, William, [sic] received a bullet in the neck and that Shea and McGough, who fled from the scene, had each been slightly wounded."''&lt;ref name="correctionhistory"&gt;[http://www.correctionhistory.org/northcountry/html/crimes/batshea3.htm Correctionhistory.org account of the events leading to Shea's trial and conviction, with details not included in ''New York Times'' accounts]&lt;/ref&gt; Shea and McGough were caught and arrested, at which time McGough initially claimed he had fired the shot that killed Ross, but later apparently withdrew this claim, only to repeat the claim years later, after Shea's execution in 1896.&lt;ref name="correctionhistory"/&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' report on the incident laid blame directly on former Troy Mayor [[Edward Murphy, Jr.]], who had been elected to the [[United States Senate]] the previous year (he would serve one term), which included the following excerpt: ''"The gun that shot Robert Ross has been loaded on election day in Troy ever since "Boss" Murphy's gang began their systematic frauds, a dozen years ago."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/03/08/106899552.pdf ''CITIZENS OF TROY AROUSED; DETERMINED TO AVENGE THE MURDER OF ROBERT ROSS. The Blood-Stained Election of Tues-day the One Subject of Interest- Murphy's Methods Denounced, on All Sides -- A Mass Meeting Called for To-night to Express the Public Indignation -- The Alleged Murderer Treated with Tender Care in Jail.''], March 7, 1894; accessed January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGough and Shea were arrested and an original suspect in the shootings, John Boland, was released from custody. The trial of Shea and McGough began on May 28, 1894. Shea and McGough were convicted on July 4, 1894. McGough was sentenced by a jury to 20 years imprisonment, and Shea was sentenced to death. Several lengthy appeals and efforts to have Shea's sentence commuted failed and he was executed in 1896.

'''Northern Future Forum''' is an annual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWEDEN: Stockholm hosts Northern Future Forum, an annual summit of Nordic, Baltic and British leaders|url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/RTV/2012/02/11/RTV442812/|publisher=ITN|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; informal meeting of  prime ministers, policy innovators, entrepreneurs and business leaders from the 9 nations of [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK NORDIC BALTIC SUMMIT London 2011: About the Summit|url=http://uknordicbaltic.readandcomment.com/introduction/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130061915/http://uknordicbaltic.readandcomment.com/introduction/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 January 2011|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=18 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially referred to as the '''UK Nordic Baltic Summit''', the name Northern Future Forum was introduced at the second meeting in Stockholm, 2012. The group had a period of abeyance since the Stavanger meeting in 2016 was postponed following the outcome of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]], and David Cameron subsequently stepping down as UK prime minister, to be succeeded by [[Theresa May]]. The summit was reconvened in October 2018 in Oslo.

Former Swedish prime minister [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] first suggested that the UK and [[NB8|Nordic-Baltic Eight]] nations have a summit during his November 2010 visit to the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Downing St’s Viking invasion|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bdf9161e-1f6d-11e0-87ca-00144feab49a.html#axzz1sO3IAqVw|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|UK general election in May]] and [[David Cameron]] becoming prime minister of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|UK coalition government]].

==Summits==
The Northern Future Forum was established to be a more relaxed meeting than usual international summits, with more of a collegiate atmosphere where leaders are encouraged to learn and interact with experts in the topics under discussion, rather than delivering set-piece speeches or engaging in behind-the-scenes trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Liam|title=The Northern Future Forum|url=http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/07/nff/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=UK Government Digital Service Blog|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described in a press release from [[Erna Solberg]] announcing the 2016 meeting in Norway as ‘[The] NFF is a little unusual, but very exciting meeting place for us politicians. In this concept, we get a different insights into innovative trends, presented by today's experts and entrepreneurs, who in different ways are building what is our common future’&lt;ref name="Stavanger"&gt;{{cite news|title=Internasjonal prestisje-konferanse med 9 statsministre til Stavanger!  - Nyhetsbrev 3 - 2016 - Nyhetsbrev 2016 - Nyhetsbrev - Media - Region Stavanger|url=http://www.regionstavanger.com/no/Media/Nyhetsbrev/Nyhetsbrev-2016/Nyhetsbrev-3-2016/Internasjonal-prestisje-konferanse-med-9-statsministre-til-Stavanger-/|accessdate=11 July 2016|work=www.regionstavanger.com|publisher=Stavanger Region|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London 2011===
[[File:Apvienotās Karalistes, Ziemeļu un Baltijas valstu samits Londona 2011 (5374931642).jpg|thumb|right|UK Nordic Baltic Summit]]
On the 19–20 January London hosted the inaugural UK-Nordic-Baltic meeting at [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in the [[East End of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Reaching the summit|url=http://www.thelocal.se/blogs/diplomaticdispatch/2011/01/24/reaching-the-summit/|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=The British Ambassador to Sweden blogs on The Local|date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first summit hosted 120 participants&lt;ref name="baltic" &gt;{{cite web|title=UK-Nordic-Baltic Summit to form new "alliance"|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/27816/|publisher=Baltic Times|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and touched on themes of improving business ties in the region, with a focus on low carbon and high-tech industries. Other topics included how best to foster equality, wellbeing and competitiveness in the economic climate during the [[2008–2012 global recession]].

*Technology and Innovation
*Jobs, Family and Gender Equality
*Green Economy and Sustainable Business

The British Prime Minister, David Cameron ended the first summit calling for a new alliance of Northern European nations.&lt;ref name="baltic" /&gt;

===Stockholm 2012===
The second summit on the 8–9 February, was hosted in [[Stockholm]]. The second meeting saw the name changed to the "Northern Future Forum".
The event was hosted in [[Fotografiska]], The Swedish Museum of Photography, in the [[Södermalm]] district of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SWEDEN: Stockholm hosts Northern Future Forum, an annual summit of Nordic, Baltic and British leaders|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist/RTV/2012/02/11/RTV442812/|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=ITN source|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference topics intended to focus on long-term sustainable growth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Northern Future Forum 2012|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/15274/a/179557|publisher=sweden.gov.se|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were:
*How do we get more women into top positions and more women entrepreneurs?
*How do we get senior citizens to stay longer in the labour force?

===Riga 2013===
The third summit was held on February 27–28, 2013 in [[Riga]], Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Northern Future Forum 2013" to take place in Riga|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/forums/?doc=54303|publisher=The Baltic Course|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening and closing plenary were held in the [[Latvian Museum of Decorative Arts and Design]] with discussions and a media centre at [[Convent Yard, Riga|Hotel Konventa sēta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern future forum 2013, Google Map locations|url=https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203065216385919240067.0004d5acc883c8936addb&amp;msa=0|publisher=futureforum2013.gov.lv/en/|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Stockholm 2012 meeting the Latvian prime minister [[Valdis Dombrovskis]] had proposed that Riga could host the next forum meeting, which was supported by the other members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Year’s Northern Future Forum to be Held in Rīga|url=http://www.today.lv/next-year’s-northern-future-forum-to-be-held-in-riga/|publisher=Latvia Today|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In 2013, the "Northern Future Forum" will be held in Rīga|url=http://www.mk.gov.lv/en/aktuali/zinas/2012/1/020212pm03/|publisher=The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main issues chosen for the Forum: 
* Can the green economy be competitive?
* Addressing the [[digital divide]] in society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topics for the Northern Future Forum|url=http://www.futureforum2013.gov.lv/en/about-nff/topics-for-the-forum|publisher=2013 Northern Future Forum|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Prime Minister [[Jyrki Katainen]], was unable to attend due to domestic political reasons, and was represented by Olli-Pekka Heinonen, state secretary to the PM’s bureau, and state secretary to the Finnish Economy and Employment Ministry Marja Rislakki. The British PM David Cameron returned to his country shortly after the opening plenary meetings, replaced by Planning Minister [[Nick Boles]]. David Cameron met with Latvian PM Valdis Dombrovskis the evening before the forum opening in order to discuss Latvia and the UK’s bilateral relations, including economic cooperation and problems within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Northern Future Forum in Riga to gather representatives of nine countries|url=http://bnn-news.com/northern-future-forum-riga-gather-representatives-countries-89164|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=Baltic News Network|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helsinki 2014===
At the closing plenary in Riga 2013, Marja Rislakki, State Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and Economy of Finland made a proposal to hold the Northern Future Forum 2014 in Helsinki, Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V.Dombrovskis: "Findings of the Northern Future Forum should be implemented in Latvia, as well as in the EU"|url=http://www.mk.gov.lv/en/aktuali/zinas/2013/february/010313-mp-01/|publisher=The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFF convened in Helsinki during 6–7 November 2014 at the [[Aaltoes|Startup Sauna]] business accelerator of [[Aalto University]]'s [[Otaniemi]] campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clerc|first=Louis|title=Northern Future Forum: Uniscan Reborn?|url=http://www.utu.fi/en/sites/europeanstudies/blog/Pages/Uniscan-Reborn.aspx|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=University of Turku|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stubb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime Minister Alexander Stubb to host Northern Future Forum in Helsinki|url=http://vnk.fi/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet/tiedote/en.jsp?oid=425210|accessdate=11 October 2014|publisher=Finnish Prime Minister's Office|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion themes of the 2014 meeting were:&lt;ref name="Stubb"/&gt;
*Competitiveness of education systems 
*Promotion of innovative business activity.

===Reykjavik 2015===
At the Helsinki meeting the [[Prime Minister of Iceland]] [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]] invited delegates to Reykjavik for the next Northern Future Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kolyako|first1=Nina|title=Latvian and Nordic PMs discussed the promotion of innovative entrepreneurship|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/markets_and_companies/?doc=98708|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=Baltic Course|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was held on 28–29 October at the [[University of Iceland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine Prime Ministers discuss creative industries and public sector innovation at Northern Future Forum in Reykjavik|url=http://www.mfa.is/news-and-publications/nr/8508|accessdate=15 October 2015|publisher=Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; being held in continuation of the 67 session of the [[Nordic Council]] in Reykjavik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NORTHERN FUTURE FORUM 2015 HOSTED BY PRIME MINISTER OF  ICELAND, SIGMUNDUR DAVÍÐ GUNNLAUGSSON|url=http://nff2015.is/press/|accessdate=15 October 2015|publisher=Northern Future Forum Reykjavik 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes for this year's meeting were:
*The importance of creative industries
*Innovation as a catalyst for change in the way public service is run.

Attending the forum British Prime Minister David Cameron became the first British Premier to officially visit Iceland since it became a republic in 1944, the last being [[Winston Churchill]] in August 1941, over 70 years previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hafstad|first1=Vala|title=Cameron Is Coming|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/10/12/cameron-coming|accessdate=25 October 2015|publisher=Iceland Review|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British PM on official visit to Iceland|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2015/10/12/british_pm_on_official_visit_to_iceland/|accessdate=28 October 2015|publisher=Iceland Monitor|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===(Stavanger 2016) postponed===
The 2016 Northern Future Forum was due to be held in [[Stavanger]] on 26–27 October 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cameron-konferanse legges til Stavanger|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/Britisk-nordisk-kjempekonferanse-legges-til-Stavanger-3908103.html|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=Stavanger Aftenbladet|date=14 April 2016|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; though was initially stated to be postponed to an unknown future date, following David Cameron's resignation as British Prime Minister after the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]] and [[Theresa May]]'s appointment as UK Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solberg|first1=Erna|title=Britain – a close friend and a good partner|url=https://erna.no/2016/07/13/britain-a-close-friend-and-a-good-partner/|accessdate=20 July 2016|work=Erna Solbergs blogg|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes for the forum were to include:&lt;ref name="Stavanger"/&gt;
*How innovation and new technology can contribute to economic development. 
*How a [[sharing economy]] can affect the labour market.

===Oslo 2018===
In 2018 the Northern Future Forum was held on the 29-30 October at the Oslo Cancer Cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seks statsministre samlet i Oslo for å diskutere helseteknologi |url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/ni-statsministre-samlet-i-oslo-for-a-diskutere-helseteknologi/id2617379/ |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=Regjeringen.no |date=30 October 2018 |language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
Media commentary as to wider implications of the Northern Future Forum have been varied, with the Swedish press being quite skeptical during the second meeting in Stockholm. [[The Local]] (Sweden) stated that the ‘meeting might have a longer-term strategic purpose, at least for British Prime Minister David Cameron: to forge a long-term alliance between the Northern European countries,’&lt;ref name="Local" &gt;{{cite web|title=Brits in Sweden to forge northern alliance: paper|url=http://www.thelocal.se/39024/20120209/|publisher=The Local|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing that there appeared to be a ''"risk that David Cameron wants the northern partnership to challenge Brussels."''&lt;ref name="Local" /&gt;

The pro-EU liberal [[Dagens Nyheter]] suggested: ‘Behind the scenes, this “Northern Alliance” will also debate ways to frustrate a “French model” for the European economy.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cameron flies to Stockholm to strengthen alliance|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7b34b72e-5276-11e1-ae2c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1sO3IAqVw|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dagens Nyheter [[Editorial]] described the second assembly as a ''"meeting with risks",'' seeing it as being potentially divisive within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Möte med risker|url=http://www.dn.se/ledare/huvudledare/mote-med-risker|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|accessdate=18 April 2012|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Baltic Times]] saw the forum as a mirror to the [[Union for the Mediterranean#Mediterranean Union|Mediterranean Union]] proposed by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]&lt;ref name="baltic" /&gt; with Nouvelle-Europe comparing it to other groupings of EU members such as the [[Visegrád Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kreilinger|first=Valentin|title=Why Nordic countries are a cornerstone of British foreign policy|url=http://www.nouvelle-europe.eu/node/1019|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=Nouvelle Europe [en ligne]|date=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lithuania Tribune noted that the forum is unique as a pan-European meeting in that there are no negotiations, and no conditional agreements reached during the event.&lt;ref name="Rydstrom" &gt;{{cite news|last=Rydström|first=Fredrik|title=The Northern Future Forum: a peripheral affair or an important international event?|url=http://www.lithuaniatribune.com/2012/02/19/the-northern-future-forum-a-peripheral-affair-or-an-important-international-event/|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=Lithuania Tribune|date=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that given the contemporary [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] the discussion topics at the Stockholm meeting rendered the group a rather peripheral event. However, the article also suggested that the informal nature of the forum raised an antidote to increasing mistrust between European nations in the wake of the eurozone crisis.&lt;ref name="Rydstrom" /&gt;

The initial founding of the group in 2011 met with some trepidation among the Russian media, fearing the group could amount to an ‘Arctic branch of [[NATO]]’, which may act to ease the accession of neutral Finland and Sweden into the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balmasov|first1=Sergei|title=Arctic NATO to watch the Russians|url=http://english.pravda.ru/world/europe/20-01-2011/116584-arctic_nato-0/#|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Pravda|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[representative democracy|representative]] [[democracy]], the term '''paper candidate''' is often given to a candidate who stands for a [[political party]] in an [[electoral division]] where the party in question enjoys only low levels of support. Although the candidate has little chance of winning, a major party will normally make an effort to ensure it has its name on the [[ballot]] paper in every [[constituency]]. In two-party systems, a paper candidate may also be known as '''[[tokenism|token]] opposition'''.

Paper candidates may be local party members, or [[Carpetbagging|members from neighbouring areas or from central office]] depending on the laws of the jurisdiction (most U.S. states, for example, require all candidates for office to reside in the district they intend on representing for a certain length of time). The main purpose of fielding paper candidates is to maintain or improve the profile of a political party and, in two-party systems, to provide at least nominal opposition to a seemingly unassailable incumbent. Another potential use for paper candidacy is to allow a candidate who wants off the ballot of another race to do so by running for something else, a race they cannot possibly win (such as [[Rick Lazio]], who lost a Republican primary for New York Governor in 2010 but still had a third-party ballot line; Lazio was nominated for a judicial seat in the Bronx that was so heavily Democratic that he could not have possibly won if he wanted to, and he did not).&lt;ref&gt;Paybarah, Azi (September 28, 2010). [http://www.wnyc.org/story/195556-judge-lazio/ Judge Lazio]. ''WNYC''. Retrieved May 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper candidates themselves typically do little or no campaigning and neither incur nor claim any expenses. There are circumstances where a paper candidate can win election, often when the opposing candidate is unexpectedly embroiled in scandal; for example, then-27-year-old American [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], who ran as a token opponent to New Jersey congressman [[Frank Thompson]] in 1978 and 1980, won the latter contest after Thompson was embroiled in the [[Abscam]] scandal.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Gruson, Lindsey. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DA1F31F933A2575BC0A967958260 "Decade of Rep. Smith: Fluke to Tactician"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 10, 1991. Accessed March 28, 2008. "He switched parties but lost in 1978 as the token opposition to Frank Thompson, a veteran Democrat who was chairman of the House Administration Committee. But he won in 1980, when Mr. Thompson was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal and later served two years in prison."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, paper candidates are commonly fielded in different locations by all the major parties in both local and national elections.

A [[dummy candidate]] is similar to a paper candidate in that both types do not intend to win their race; however, they differ in that a dummy candidate typically has an ulterior motive for being in the race, such as to dishonestly divert votes away from more legitimate candidates or to take advantage of benefits afforded to political candidates. Another related concept is the [[stalking horse]] candidate, a junior or little-known politician who challenges an incumbent to test the support for a more serious challenge from someone else.

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, major parties often find it difficult to field a full list of candidates for all council seats up for election, especially in the case of councils with "all-up" elections. Parties find it desirable to persuade people to stand as paper candidates so that:

* Supporters have an opportunity to vote for the party
* The total vote obtained across the council and the nation is maximised
* All seats are contested so there is no risk that candidates from other parties can be declared elected unopposed

In Britain, being nominated as a local election candidate simply involves signing some forms, with no deposit required. A paper candidate will often do no campaigning at all and so be able to submit a zero return of election expenses, simplifying the paperwork for the election agent.

Some paper candidates stand in order to help their party but do not wish to be elected to the post in question. In fact, some paper candidates only agree to stand after receiving assurances that there is no "risk" of them getting elected. Following the [[Scottish National Party]]'s landslide in Scotland in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], when they went from 6 to 56 seats, it was reported that some candidates were so surprised at winning they considered resigning immediately after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=David|title=Accidental MPs? Labour's Brian Donohoe says some SNP candidates nearly quit when they were elected by surprise|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14183215.Accidental_MPs__Labour_s_Brian_Donohoe_says_some_SNP_candidates_nearly_quit_when_they_were_elected_by_surprise/|accessdate=7 January 2016|work=Glasgow Herald|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One main disadvantage to fielding paper candidates in an electoral system like the UK's is that unsavoury details about one candidate's past tend to be more damaging to a party's image across the country, no matter what that candidate's chances of election actually are. Therefore, paper candidates for major parties in Britain are almost as heavily [[vetting|vetted]] as candidates who are expected to win their seats.

== Canada ==
In Canada, paper candidates may exist at both the [[Elections in Canada#National elections|federal]] and [[Elections in Canada#Provincial and territorial|provincial / territorial]] levels. As in Great Britain, they most commonly exist to allow the main political parties to field candidates in as many constituencies as possible. From 2004 to 2011, parties at the federal level had a financial incentive to draw as many votes as possible due to a [[Federal political financing in Canada#Per-vote subsidy|per-vote subsidy]], paid to all parties with at least 2% of the total popular vote regardless of the number of seats actually won.&lt;ref name="Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/per-vote-subsidy-but-a-fraction-of-taxpayer-support-for-political-parties/article1880294/ |title=Per-vote subsidy but a fraction of taxpayer support for political parties |first=Éric|last=Grenier |work=The Globe and Mail |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy, enacted under the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], was fully phased out in 2015 under the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]].

Alternatively, paper candidates might be used if the party is not seriously contesting the election but must run candidates so it can either get registered or stay registered for some other purpose. An example of this scenario in action is found in [[Saskatchewan]], where the "dormant" [[Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan|Progressive Conservatives]] continued to run at least ten candidates in the province's general elections until the relevant law was amended, to keep its registration with [[Elections Saskatchewan]] (and to avoid losing control of what is believed to be a substantial amount of money).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} (In Saskatchewan's case, candidates affiliated with the national [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] typically run under the banner of the [[Saskatchewan Party]] in provincial elections.)

An extreme version of a paper candidate, is a "Name on Ballot", often referred to by the acronym "nob". Many NoBs will only put up campaign signs, and some do not even do that. In most cases, the only requirement is that the candidate show up at the returning officer's headquarters for a few moments to take an oath and pay the required [[Deposit (politics)|nomination deposit]]. In Alberta candidates don't even need to show up to talk to a returning officer, as long as someone on behalf of the party drops off the requisite paperwork and funds. In many smaller parties, such as the [[New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island|Prince Edward Island New Democrats]], a majority of the party's candidates in any given election are NoBs. The term is often worn as a badge of pride in one's loyalty to the party. PEI New Democrat Dr. Bob Perry, who has been a NoB many times in the past, often calls himself "Dr. NoB" at election time.

Paper candidates ("poteau" in [[Canadian French]], a term meaning that the candidate will only be seen on posters on poles), particularly of the name-on-ballot variety, can sometimes provide unwanted attention for the candidate's party, particularly if they become viable prospects for election. For example, in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]], a sudden increase in opinion-poll support, particularly in [[Quebec]], for the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] &amp;ndash; which historically has had a minimal presence in that province &amp;ndash; led to greater scrutiny of some of that party's lower-profile Quebec candidates — one of whom, [[Ruth Ellen Brosseau]], won even though she had never been in her riding and spoke its dominant language poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Ruth Ellen Brosseau: de "poteau" à députée| url= http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/elections-federales/201105/04/01-4395914-ruth-ellen-brosseau-de-poteau-a-deputee.php| language= French | date= 4 May 2011| work=La Presse| accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Las Vegas-vacationing anglophone Quebec MP gets spoofed on Facebook page| url= http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/las-vegas-vacationing-anglophone-quebec-mp-gets-spoofed-150019419.html |date=4 May 2011| work= Daily Brew (blog) |first=Marc|last= Weisblott | publisher= Yahoo!

''[[National Post]]'', August 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] also had a number of paper candidates who won election in the party's historic landslide victory in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]].

is the economic and social stability attained in the conquered provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which, at the height of the Empire's power during the 16th and 17th centuries, applied to lands in the [[Balkans]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Caucasus]].

{{Executive}}

The '''president''' is a common title for the [[head of state]] in most republics. In politics, president is a [[title]] given to leaders of [[republic]]an [[state (polity)|state]]s.

The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of [[government]]. In [[parliamentary republic]]s, they are limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial. In [[presidential republic|presidential]] and [[semi-presidential republic]]s, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also (in most cases) the functions of the [[head of government]]. In authoritarian regimes, a [[dictator]] or leader of a [[one-party state]] may also be called a president.

== Description ==
The title ''president'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''prae-'' "before" + ''sedere'' "to sit." As such, it originally designated the officer who presides over or "sits before" a gathering and ensures that debate is conducted according to the [[rules of order]] (''see also'' [[chairman]] and [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]), but today it most commonly refers to an executive official in any social organization.  Early examples are from the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (from 1464) and the founding [[President of the Royal Society]] [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]] in 1660. This usage survives today in the title of such offices as "[[President of the Board of Trade]]" and "[[Lord President of the Council]]" in the [[United Kingdom]], as well as "President of the Senate" in the [[United States]] (one of the roles constitutionally assigned to the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]).  The officiating priest at certain [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] religious services, too, is sometimes called the "president" in this sense. However, the most common modern usage is as the title of a [[head of state]] in a [[republic]].

In pre-revolutionary [[France]], the president of a ''[[Parlement]]'' evolved into a powerful [[magistrate]], a member of the so-called ''[[noblesse de robe]]'' ("[[nobility]] of the gown"), with considerable judicial as well as administrative authority.  The name referred to his primary role of presiding over trials and other hearings.  In the 17th and 18th centuries, seats in the ''Parlements,'' including presidencies, became effectively hereditary, since the holder of the office could ensure that it would pass to an heir by paying the crown a special tax known as the ''[[paulette (tax)|paulette]]''.  The post of "first president" (''premier président''), however, could only be held by the [[King of France|King]]'s nominees.  The ''Parlements'' were abolished by the [[French Revolution]].  In modern France the chief judge of a court is known as its president (''président de la cour'').

The first usage of the word ''president'' to denote the highest official in a government was during the [[Commonwealth of England]]. After the abolition of the monarchy the English [[Council of State]], whose members were elected by the House of Commons, became the [[executive (government)|executive]] government of the Commonwealth. The Council of State was the successor of the [[Privy Council]], which had previously been headed by the [[Lord President of the Council|Lord President]]; its successor the Council of State was also headed by a Lord President, the first of which was [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]]. However, the Lord President alone was not head of state, because that office was vested in the council as a whole.

The modern usage of the term ''president'' to designate a single person who is the [[head of state]] of a [[republic]] can be traced directly to the [[United States Constitution]] of 1787, which created the office of [[President of the United States]]. Previous American governments had included "presidents" (such as the [[president of the Continental Congress]] or the president of the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]]), but these were presiding officers in the older sense, with no executive authority.  It has been suggested that the executive use of the term was borrowed from early American colleges and universities, which were usually headed by a ''president.''  British universities were headed by an official called the "[[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]" (typically a ceremonial position) while the chief administrator held the title of "[[Vice-Chancellor]]".  But America's first institutions of higher learning (such as [[Harvard University]] and [[Yale University]]) didn't resemble a full-sized university so much as one of its constituent colleges. A number of colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] featured an official called the "president". The head, for instance, of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] was called the ''master'' and his second the ''president.'' The first president of Harvard, [[Henry Dunster]], had been educated at Magdalene.  Some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility, considering himself only a temporary place-holder. The presiding official of Yale College, originally a "rector" (after the usage of continental European universities), became "president" in 1745.

A common style of address for presidents, "[[Mr. President (title)|Mr/Mrs. President]]," is borrowed from British Parliamentary tradition, in which the presiding Speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] is referred to as "Mr/Mrs. Speaker."  Coincidentally, this usage resembles the older French custom of referring to the president of a ''parlement'' as "''Monsieur/Madame le Président''", a form of address that in modern France applies to both the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]] and to chief judges.  Similarly, the Speaker of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] is addressed by [[francophone]] parliamentarians as "''Monsieur/Madame le/la Président(e)''".  In [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s novel ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' of 1782, the character identified as ''Madame la Présidente de Tourvel'' ("Madam President of Tourvel") is the wife of a magistrate in a ''parlement''.  The fictional name Tourvel refers not to the ''parlement'' in which the magistrate sits, but rather, in imitation of an aristocratic title, to his private estate.

Once the United States adopted the title of "president" for its republican head of state, many other nations followed suit. [[Haiti]] became the first presidential republic in [[Latin America]] when [[Henri Christophe]] assumed the title in 1807.  Almost all of the American nations that became independent from [[Spain]] in the early 1810s and 1820s chose a US-style president as their chief executive.  The first European president was the president of the [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic of 1802]], a [[Sister Republic|client state]] of revolutionary France, in the person of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].  The first [[Africa]]n president was the [[President of Liberia]] (1848), while the first [[Asia]]n president was the [[President of the Republic of China]] (1912).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the powers of presidencies have varied from country to country. The spectrum of power has included presidents-for-life and hereditary presidencies to ceremonial heads of state.

Presidents in the countries with a democratic or representative form of [[government]] are usually elected for a specified period of time and in some cases may be re-elected by the same process by which they are appointed, i.e. in many nations, periodic popular elections. The powers vested in such presidents vary considerably. Some presidencies, such as that of [[President of Ireland|Ireland]], are largely ceremonial, whereas other systems vest the president with substantive powers such as the appointment and dismissal of [[prime minister]]s or [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]], the power to declare [[war]], and powers of [[veto]] on legislation. In many nations the president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the nation's armed forces, though once again this can range from a ceremonial role to one with considerable authority.

===Presidential systems===
{{main|President of the Republic}}
[[File:Dilma and Obama 2011.jpg|thumb|Presidents [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]] of the United States and Brazil.]]
In almost all states with a [[presidential system]] of government, the president exercises the functions of [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], i.e. the president directs the executive branch of government. When a President not only is head of state, but also head of government, is this, ''in Europe'' known to be a ''President of Counsel'' from the French '''Présidente du Conseil''', used 1871-1940 and 1944-1958, as the [[Third French Republic|Third]] and [[Fourth French Republic]]s. In the [[United States]] the President has always been both ''Head of State'' and ''Head of Government'' and has always had the title of President.

Presidents in this system are either ''directly'' elected by popular vote or ''indirectly'' elected by an electoral college or some other democratically elected body.

In the [[United States]], the [[President of the United States|President]] is ''indirectly'' elected by the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election. In most states of the United States, each elector is committed to voting for a specified candidate determined by the popular vote in each state, so that the people, in voting for each elector, are in effect voting for the candidate. However, for various reasons the numbers of electors in favour of each candidate are unlikely to be proportional to the popular vote. Thus, in five close United States elections ([[U.S. presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]], and [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016]]), the candidate with the most popular votes still lost the election.
[[File:President Bush and President Johnson Sirleaf, 2008.jpg|thumb|Presidents [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf|Johnson-Sirleaf]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] of Liberia and the United States.]]
In [[Mexico]], the [[President of Mexico|president]] is ''directly'' elected for a six-year term by popular vote. The candidate who wins the most votes is elected president even without an absolute majority. The president may never get another term. The [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006 Mexican elections]] had a fierce competition, the electoral results showed a minimal difference between the two most voted candidates and such difference was just about the 0.58% of the total vote. The [[Federal Electoral Tribunal]] declared an elected president after a controversial post-electoral process.

In [[Brazil]], the [[President of Brazil|president]] is ''directly'' elected for a four-year term by popular vote. A candidate has to have more than 50% of the valid votes. If no candidates achieve a majority of the votes, there is a [[runoff election]] between the two candidates with most votes. Again, a candidate needs a majority of the vote to be elected. In Brazil, a president cannot be elected to more than two consecutive terms, but there is no limit on the number of terms a president can serve.

Many [[South America]]n, [[Central America]]n, [[Africa]]n and some [[Asia]]n nations follow the presidential model.

===Semi-presidential systems===
[[File:Tsai Ing-wen 20170613.jpg|thumb|Taiwanese President [[Tsai Ing-wen|Tsai Ing-Wen]].]]
A second system is the [[semi-presidential system]], also known as the [[France|French]] model. In this system, as in the parliamentary system, there are both a president and a prime minister; but unlike the parliamentary system, the president may have significant day-to-day power. For example, in France, when their party controls the majority of seats in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], the [[President of France|president]] can operate closely with the parliament and [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]], and work towards a common agenda. When the National Assembly is controlled by their opponents, however, the president can find themselves marginalized with the opposition party prime minister exercising most of the power. Though the prime minister remains an appointee of the president, the president must obey the rules of parliament, and select a leader from the house's majority holding party. Thus, sometimes the president and prime minister can be allies, sometimes rivals; the latter situation is known in France as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]. Variants of the French semi-presidential system, developed at the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] by [[Charles de Gaulle]], are used in [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Yu-chung|date=2017|title=Institutional resilience of Taiwan’s semi-presidential system: the integration of the president and premier under party politics|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Political Science|volume=26:1|pages=53–64|doi=10.1080/02185377.2017.1366347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lanka]] and several [[post-colonial]] countries which have emulated the French model. In Finland, although the 2000 constitution moved towards a ceremonial presidency, the system is still formally semi-presidential, with the [[President of Finland]] retaining e.g. foreign policy and appointment powers.

===Parliamentary systems===

{{see also|Parliamentary system|Parliamentary republic}}
The [[parliamentary republic]], is a parliamentary system in which the presidency is largely ceremonial with either ''[[de facto]]'' or no significant executive authority (such as the [[President of Austria]]) or ''[[de jure]]'' no significant executive power (such as the [[President of Ireland]]), and the executive powers rests with the [[Prime Minister]] who automatically assumes the post as head of a majority party or coalition, but takes oath of office administered by the president. However, the president is head of the civil service, commander in chief of the armed forces and in some cases can dissolve parliament. Countries using this system include [[Austria]], [[Armenia]], [[Albania]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;But presidential moral suasion is increasingly confirming that the "neutral powers", in this country, often find in the head of state the best defender from executive interference: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero |title = Autorità indipendenti e sistema costituzionale |journal= L'ago e il filo|date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89422474}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malta]], [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]].

A variation of the [[parliamentary republic]] is a system with an [[executive president]] in which the president is the head of state and the government but unlike a [[presidential system]], is elected by and accountable to a parliament, and referred to as president. Countries using this system include [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]] and [[Suriname]].

===Collective presidency===
[[File:Bundesrat der Schweiz 2015.jpg|thumb|The seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]] serves as collective [[head of government]] and [[head of state|state]] of [[Switzerland]].]]

Only a tiny minority of modern republics do not have a single head of state.  Some examples of this are:
* [[Switzerland]], where the headship of state is collectively vested in the seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]], although there is also a [[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]], who is a member of the Federal Council elected by the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] (the Swiss [[parliament]]) for a year ([[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] mandates that the post rotates every [[New Year's Day]]).
* The [[Captains Regent]] of [[San Marino]] elected by the [[Grand and General Council]].
* In the former [[Soviet Union]], while the real power was exercised by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] executed powers of collective [[head of state]], and its [[chairman]] was often called "president" in the [[Western World|West]].
* [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] until its [[breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]].
* [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
* [[National Council of Government (Uruguay)]]
* [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] in [[Nicaragua]]

===Dictatorships===
In [[dictatorship]]s, the title of president is frequently taken by self-appointed or military-backed leaders. Such is the case in many states: [[Idi Amin]] in [[Uganda]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in [[Zaire]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in [[Philippines]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]] are some examples. Other presidents in authoritarian states have wielded only symbolic or no power such as [[Craveiro Lopes]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] under the "Trujillo Era" of the [[Dominican Republic]].

[[President for Life]] is a title assumed by some [[dictator]]s to try to ensure that their authority or legitimacy is never questioned. Ironically, most leaders who proclaim themselves President for Life do not in fact successfully serve a life term. On the other hand, presidents like [[Alexandre Pétion]], [[Rafael Carrera]], [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[François Duvalier]] died in office. [[Kim Il-sung]] was named [[Eternal President of the Republic]] after his death.

In ancient Rome, [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] appointed himself in 82 BC to an entirely new office, ''dictator [[rei publicae]] constituendae causa'' ("dictator for the making of laws and for the settling of the constitution"), which was functionally identical to the dictatorate ''rei gerundae causa'' ("for the matter to be done," e.g., a military command against a specific enemy) except that it lacked any set time limit, although Sulla held this office for over two years before he voluntarily abdicated and retired from public life.

The second well-known incident of a leader extending his term indefinitely was Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]], who made himself "[[Roman dictator|Perpetual Dictator]]" (commonly mistranslated as 'Dictator-for-life') in 45 BC. His actions would later be mimicked by the French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who was appointed "First Consul for life" in 1802 and five years later, the French senate proclaimed him [[emperor]] (a [[monarchy|monarchical]] title).

Several presidents have ruled until their death, but they have not proclaimed themselves as President for Life. For instance, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] of [[Romania]], who ruled until his execution (see [[Romanian Revolution]]).

=== Presidential symbols ===
As the country's head of state, in most countries the president is entitled to certain perquisites, and may have a prestigious residence, often a lavish mansion or palace, sometimes more than one (e.g. summer and winter residences, or a country retreat) Customary symbols of office may include an official uniform, decorations, a presidential seal, coat of arms, flag and other visible accessories, as well as military honours such as [[gun salute]]s, [[ruffles and flourishes]], and a presidential guard. A common presidential symbol is the [[presidential sash]] worn most often by presidents in [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]] as a symbol of the continuity of the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=J.

== Titles for non-heads of state ==

=== As head of government ===
Some countries with parliamentary systems use a term meaning/translating as "president" (in some languages indistinguishable from chairman) for the head of parliamentary government, often as President of the Government, [[President of the Council of Ministers]] or [[President of the Executive Council (disambiguation)|President of the Executive Council]].

However, such an official is explicitly not the president of the ''country''. Rather, he/she is called a president in an older sense of the word, to denote the fact that he/she heads the ''[[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]''. A separate [[head of state]] generally exists in their country that instead serves as the president or monarch of the country.

Thus, such officials are really [[premier]]s, and to avoid confusion are often described simply as 'prime minister' when being mentioned internationally.

There are several examples for this kind of presidency:
* The [[Prime Minister of Spain]] is officially referred to as the President of the Government of [[Spain]], and informally known as the "president". Spain is also a kingdom with a reigning [[King of Spain|king]].
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] is [[President of the Council of Ministers]] (''[[Italian language|Italian]] Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri'')
* Under the French [[French Third Republic|Third]] and the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republics]], the "[[President of the Council of Ministers|President of the Council]]" (of ministers – or prime minister) was the head of government, with the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]] a largely symbolic figurehead.
* The [[Prime minister]] of the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922 to 1937 was titled [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State]]. At the same time, the Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy with a reigning monarch, the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]], as well as a resident [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] carrying out many head of state functions.
* Under the [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] of [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]], the President of the Council of Ministers (''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] Presidente do Conselho de Ministros'') was the head of government, with the [[Monarch]] being the head of State. Under the [[Portuguese First Republic|Portuguese First]] and [[New State (Portugal)|Second Republics]], the head of government was the President of the [[Ministry (collective executive)|Ministry]] (''Portuguese Presidente do Ministério'') and then the President of the Council of Ministers, with the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]] as the head of State.
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Croatian prime minister]] is President of the Government of the Republic of Croatia ({{lang-hr|Predsjednik Vlade Republike Hrvatske}}).
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Polish prime minister]] is [[President of the Council of Ministers]] (''[[Polish language|Polish]] Prezes Rady Ministrów'').
* In British constitutional practice, the chairman of an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], acting in such a capacity, is known as a President of the Executive Council. Usually this person is the [[Governor]] and it always stays like that.
* Between 1918 and 1934, [[Estonia]] had no separate head of state. Both [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Ministers]] (1918-1920) and [[State Elder]]s (1920-1934) often translated as "Presidents") were elected by the parliament.

=== Other executive positions ===

==== Sub-national ====
''President'' can also be the title of the chief executive at a lower administrative level, such as the [[Parish President|parish president]]s of the [[parish]]es of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]], the presiding member of city council for villages in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]], or the [[municipal president]]s of [[Mexico]]'s [[municipio (Mexico)|municipalities]]. Perhaps the best known sub-national presidents are the [[borough president]]s of the [[borough (New York City)|Five Boroughs]] of [[New York City]].

=====Poland=====
In Poland the ''President of the City'' ({{lang-pl|Prezydent miasta}}) is the executive authority of the municipality elected in direct elections, the equivalent of the [[mayor]].  The Office of the President (Mayor) is also found in Germany and Switzerland.

=====Russia=====
Governors of [[Russian republics|ethnic republics]] in the [[Russian Federation]] used to have the title of President, occasionally alongside other, secondary titles such as ''Chairman of the Government'' (also used by [[Prime Minister of Russia]]). This likely reflects the origin of Russian republics as homelands for various ethnic groups: while all [[federal subjects of Russia]] are currently ''[[de jure]]'' [[Symmetric federalism|equal]], their predecessors, the [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union|ASSR]]s, used to [[asymmetric federalism|enjoy more privileges]] than the ordinary krais and oblasts of the [[RSFSR]] (such as greater representation in the [[Soviet of Nationalities]]). Thus, the ASSRs and their eventual successors would have more in common with [[nation-state]]s than with ordinary administrative divisions, at least in spirit, and would choose titles accordingly.

Over the course of the 2010s the presidents of Russian republics would progressively change their title to that of [[Head]] ({{lang-ru|глава}}), a proposition suggested by the [[President of Chechnya]] [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] and later made law by the [[Parliament of Russia]] and President [[Dmitriy Medvedev]] in 2010. Despite this, however, Presidents of [[Tatarstan]] would reject this change and, as of 2017, retain their title in defiance of Russian law. The new title did not result in any changes in the powers wielded by the governors.

=====United Kingdom=====
The [[Lord President of the Council]] is one of the [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]] in [[England]] who presides over meetings of British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]; the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] headed by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] is technically a committee of the Council, and all decisions of the Cabinet are formally approved through [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]]. Although the Lord President is a member of the Cabinet, the position is largely a ceremonial one and is traditionally given to either the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] or the [[Leader of the House of Lords]].

Historically the [[President of the Board of Trade]] was a cabinet member.

======Dependencies======
In [[Alderney]], the elected head of government is called the [[President of the States of Alderney]].

In the [[Isle of Man]], there is a [[President of Tynwald]].

=====Spain=====
In [[Spain]], the executive leaders of the [[autonomous communities]] (regions) are called presidents. In each community, they can be called ''Presidente de la Comunidad'' or ''Presidente del Consejo'' among others. They are elected by their respective regional assemblies and have similar powers to a state president or governor.

====Deputies====
Below a president, there can be a number of or "vice presidents" (or occasionally "deputy presidents") and sometimes several "assistant presidents" or "assistant vice presidents", depending on the organisation and its size. These posts do not hold the same power but more of a subordinate position to the president. However, power can be transferred in special circumstances to the deputy or vice president.  Normally vice presidents hold some power and special responsibilities below that of the president. The difference between vice/deputy presidents and assistant/associate vice presidents is the former are legally allowed to run an organisation, exercising the same powers (as well as being second in command) whereas the latter are not.

===Legislatures===
In some countries the speaker of their unicameral legislatures, or of one or both houses of bicameral legislatures, the speakers have the title of president of "the body", as in the case of [[Spain]], where the Speaker of the Congress is the [[President of the Congress of Deputies]] and the Speaker of the Senate is the [[President of the Spanish Senate|President of the Senate]].

===Judiciary===
====France====
In [[France|French]] legal terminology, the president of a court consisting of multiple [[judge]]s is the foremost judge; he chairs the meeting of the court and directs the debates (and this thus addressed as "Mrs President", "Madame la Présidente", Mr President", or ''Monsieur le Président''. In general, a court comprises several chambers, each with its own president; thus the most senior of these is called the "first president" (as in: "the First President of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] is the most senior judge in France").  Similarly in English legal practice the most senior judge in each division uses this title (e.g. President of the Family Division, President of the Court of Appeal).

====Spain====
In the [[Spanish Judiciary]], the leader of a court of multiples judges is called President of the Court. The same happens with the different bodies of the Spanish judicial system, where we can find a [[President of the Supreme Court of Spain|President of the Supreme Court]], a [[Audiencia Nacional|President of the National Court]] and Presidents in the [[Superior Court of Justice of Spain|Regional High Courts of Justice]] and in the Provincial Courts. The body that rules over the Judiciary in Spain is the [[General Council of the Judiciary]], and its president is the President of the Supreme Court, which is normally called ''President of the Supreme Court and of the GCJ''.

The [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] is not part of the Judiciary, but the leader of it is called [[President of the Constitutional Court (Spain)|President of the Constitutional Court]].

====United Kingdom====
In the recently established [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], the most senior judge is called the [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|President of the Supreme Court]]. The Lady/Lord President of the Court of Session is head of the judiciary in [[Scotland]], and presiding judge (and Senator) of the [[College of Justice]] and [[Court of Session]], as well as being Lady/Lord Justice General of Scotland and head of the [[High Court of Justiciary]], the offices having been combined in 1784.

'''Real estate licenses''', authorizations issued by state governments, give agents and brokers the legal ability to represent a home seller or buyer in the process of buying or selling [[real estate]]. [[Real estate agents]] and [[real estate brokers]] are required to be licensed when conducting real estate transactions in the [[United States]] and many other countries.
 
Through a complicated arrangement, the [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR), a trade and lobbying group for agents and brokers, sets policies for most of the [[multiple listing service]]s. As the [[Internet]] gained widespread use in the late 1990s, NAR created regulations allowing ''Information Data Exchanges'' (or ''[[Internet Data Exchange]]s'') ''(IDX)'' whereby brokers would allow a portion of their data, such as listings of homes for sale, to be seen online via brokers' or agents' websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realtor.org/topics/internet-data-exchange-idx/internet-data-exchange-idx-background-and-faq | title=Internet Data Exchange (IDX) Background and FAQ | publisher=National Association of Realtors | accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association attempted to limit online access to some or all of that data, particularly by brokers operating solely on the Internet. In 2005, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] brought an [[antitrust]] lawsuit against the NAR trade group. The complaint accused the association of unfairly limiting access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which effectively prevented online brokerages from competing with traditional brick-and-mortar offices. The Justice Department accused the NAR of conspiring to restrain trade.  

==License reciprocity agreements==

Some U.S. states have [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] agreements in place allowing licensees from other states to become licensed in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realtor.org/field-guides/field-guide-to-license-reciprocity/license-recognition | title=Field Guide to License Reciprocity / License Recognition | publisher=National Association of Realtors | accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of each reciprocal agreement vary from state to state.  Some states have [[education]] requirements that must be met by the agent while others require only that the agent fill out a reciprocal license application with the State.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

'''Redistribution''' is the process, used in many Commonwealth countries, by which electoral districts are added, removed, or otherwise changed. Redistribution is a form of [[boundary delimitation]] that changes [[electoral district]] boundaries, usually in response to periodic census results.&lt;ref name = ACE&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/bd/bdz01 Boundary Delimitation Glossary] ACE:The Electoral Knowledge Network. Accessed 4 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Redistribution is required by law or constitution at least every decade in most [[representative democracy]] systems that use [[first-past-the-post]] or similar electoral systems to prevent geographic [[malapportionment]]. The act of manipulation of electoral districts to favour a candidate or party is called [[gerrymandering]].

==Australia==
{{Main|Redistribution (Australia)}}
In Australia, redistributions are carried out by independent and non-partisan commissioners in the [[Commonwealth]], and in each state or territory. The various electoral acts require the population of each seat to be equal, within certain strictly limited variations. The longest period between two redistributions can be no greater than seven years.  Many other triggers can force redistribution before the chronological limit is reached. The redistribution is drafted by civil servants.

==Canada==
{{Main|Electoral district (Canada)#Boundary adjustment}}
In Canada, the constitution mandates that redistribution occur "on the completion of each decennial census."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/30---31-vict-c-3/latest/30---31-vict-c-3.html|title= The Constitution Act, 1867 (UK), 30 &amp; 31 Victoria, c 3, Section 51 (1) |publisher=[[Canadian Legal Information Institute]] |accessdate=25 August 2013 |date=1 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; District boundaries are based on electoral quotients, with some exceptions. When the census indicates that a population change has occurred, an independent boundary commission issues a report of recommended changes.  Changes are only made if passed into law—by Parliament for national redistribution, by the provincial legislature for provincial redistribution.

==India==

India has an established process to redistribute its legislative districts. Redistributions are approved by political appointees to the [[Boundary Commission of India]].

==Ireland==
{{further|Constituency Commission}}
The [[Constitution of Ireland]] states that general elections to the [[Dáil]] (lower house) must use the [[single transferable vote]] (STV), that each [[Dáil constituency]] must return at least three members ([[Teachta Dála|TD]]s), that boundaries must be revised at least every twelve years, and that the ratio of TDs to inhabitants (not voters or citizens) be between 20,000 and 30,000 on average and "so far as it is practicable" equal between constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html#article16|title=Constitution Of Ireland |page=Article 16 |nopp=Y |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Category:Electoral Acts (Ireland)|Electoral Acts]] are passed by the [[Oireachtas]] to revise boundaries in light of the most recent census.&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forde |first1=Michael |last2=Leonard |first2=David |title=Constitutional Law of Ireland |date=2013 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=9781847667380 |pages=§§21.05–21.08 |nopp=Y |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=YVsQAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;ots=FaEsCwTjiE&amp;dq=constituency%20population%20unconstitutional%2030000&amp;pg=PA605#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In constituencies for the [[Next Irish general election|next general election]], the 2016 population per TD averages 29,762, varying from 28,199 in [[Dublin North-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-West]] to 31,270 in [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil constituency)|Dún Laoghaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Constituency Commission |title=Constituency Commission Report 2017: Dáil and European Parliament Constituencies |date=2017 |publisher=Stationery Office |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-4064-2952-7 |page=66 |url=http://www.constituency-commission.ie/docs/Constituency%20Commission%20Report%202017.pdf#page=68 |format=PDF |chapter=Appendix 2: Statistics relating to recommended Dáil constituencies}}; {{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Bill 2017: Second Stage |url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/seanad/2017-12-15/10/ |website=Seanad Éireann debate |publisher=Oireachtas |accessdate=2 October 2018 |language=en-ie |date=15 December 2017}}; {{cite web |title=Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2017 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/39/enacted/en/html |website=electronic Irish Statute Book |accessdate=2 October 2018 |language=en |date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977, an independent body (since 1997 a permanent [[Constituency Commission]]) recommends boundaries, which the Oireachtas usually accepts.&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"/&gt; The terms of reference of the Commission have set five seats as the maximum and discourage constituencies crossing [[counties of Ireland|county]] boundaries.{{#tag:ref|Large counties may be split into multiple constituencies, and small counties paired in a single constituency, but combining part of one county with part or all of another causes controversy.|group="n"}}&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"/&gt;  A separate [[Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee]] fulfils a similar function for [[Local Electoral Area]] boundaries.

Japan does not have an established process to redistribute its legislative districts. The frequency of redistributions is irregular and not triggered a particular event. Redistributions are approved by the national legislature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==New Zealand==
New Zealand has a fixed process to determine how its legislative districts are redistributed. Redistribution in New Zealand happens every five years following the census.&lt;ref name="New Zealand"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Calculating future Māori and General Electorates &amp;#124; Electoral Commission |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/electorates/electorate-boundaries-and-review/calculating-future-maori-and-general |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, redistricting is carried out by [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] after every decennial census is published. However, Congress has never passed a general redistricting act, and instead redistricts provinces or cities piecemeal, or creates new provinces or cities with legislative districts. The last general redistricting law was via the ordinance in the 1987 constitution, which was based from the 1980 census. The creation of a new province or city needs the approval of the public via a [[plebiscite]], while piecemeal redistricting does not need a plebiscite.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)}}

In the United Kingdom, there are four Boundary Commissions (one each for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) responsible for reviewing the boundaries of Parliamentary constituencies. Members of Boundary Commissions are political appointees.

{{Main|Redistricting}}

In the United States, redistribution occurs after each decennial census. Most states' legislative district redistributions are approved by the state legislature. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings (such as the [[One_man,_one_vote#United_States|one man, one vote]] principle) require that legislative districts have roughly equal populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10529">'''Reprivatization''' refers to the process of restoring to its former [[owner]]s [[property|properties]] seized by a [[government]], or to the process of [[Nationalization#Compensation|compensating]] previously uncompensated former owners. This is often a component of larger [[privatization]] schemes.  The term is most often used in the connection with privatization in former [[Soviet Bloc]] countries or in reference to settlements concerning the property of [[The Holocaust|murdered or displaced]] European Jews.
The difference between reprivatization and privatization is that only state (nationwide) property can become the subject of the transaction, but not municipal property. The economic content of these concepts also has differences: the privatized property is obtained due to the costs of the state, but the reprivatized property previously belonged to individuals who received income from its exploitation, they also created it.

Reprivatization is often sought by members of the old nobility or their descendants who desire the return of the traditional family home for sentimental and/or financial reasons; by Holocaust survivors, their descendants, or survivors of persons who died in [[Extermination camp|Nazi death camps]] and whose property was confiscated by the Nazis or by later Communist states and disposed of in various ways; and by corporations or other parties whose property was nationalized.  It is very difficult to work out a one-size-fits all regime for property restitution, and it is often pursued on an ''ad hoc'' basis in the courts with varying degrees of success in different jurisdictions.

A significant barrier to reprivatization is created by larger political questions, which vary by country.  In Eastern Europe, there is frequently a desire to avoid the inflammation of ethnic tensions and the ostensible reversal of [[Potsdam conference]] policies; see [[Federation of Expellees]].

Outstanding reprivatization issues can sometimes be a barrier to [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], as investors are wary of investing in a property to which the title is disputed or faulty.

== Reasons for reprivatization ==
Reprivatization can be caused by the need:
*to reduce the number of state property
*to increase the size of the private sector in the country's economy
*to strengthen competition in various industries
*to increase the efficiency of the use of property as a source of improving the well-being of individuals and as a consequence of the country as a whole
*to eliminate the state monopoly in certain areas

== Forms and types of reprivatization ==
There are two main forms of reprivatization:
*[[Restitution]]. In this case, the property is returned to the former private owner.
*[[Financial compensation|Compensation]]. The value of the property is reimbursed through the provision of government securities or cash.
In their pure form, both these forms are rare. Most often they are used at the same time, compensating for part of the costs in the form of reimbursement of funds, the rest is provided in kind.
In addition, reprivatization can also be accompanied by compensation for material damage (lost profits, downtime). Requirements for reimbursement can be put forward both by the former owner and by the state itself:
*The owner can claim compensation for the amount of income that he could receive if his property was not nationalized.
*The state can claim for reimbursement of expenses incurred, as a rule, it may be expenses for modernization, maintenance of the relevant condition,

== Reprivatization by country ==

=== Great Britain ===
Most often, when discussing reprivatization, it turns to the example of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. With the coming to power in 1979, the "Iron Lady" received the country's economy in a rather deplorable state. Therefore, after a short, tough and, in the end, victorious campaign against the trade unions, she decided to increase the role of the state in the economic system of Great Britain. One of the ways to implement the plan was to choose reprivatization.

Large-scale reprivatization touched the oil, gas, electronic, aerospace and some other industries. Many enterprises that were in a difficult economic situation (including [[British Airways]], British Petroleum), legally transferred to state ownership and received considerable financial support from it. And all this is only to be transferred to private hands through privatization ten years later.

=== Germany ===
The revival of entrepreneurship in the first period after the [[World War II]] went on in the eastern lands in several forms. These were the creation of new firms, reprivatization, the organization of joint ventures with the participation of Western capital and former national enterprises. A kind of transitional measure is the decentralization of management within the former combines, as a result of which the former state enterprises begin to act as free producers in the market environment.
Immediately after the unification of Germany, about 6,000 applications for the redemption of enterprises by their former owners were filed. With full redemption of the household enterprises had the opportunity to obtain a loan from the German Credit Bank under the collateral value of the land plot.

=== Spain ===
The history of privatization and nationalization in Spain is the story of the "nationalization of losses and the privatization of profits." In crisis , the government bought up or otherwise nationalized loss-making enterprises, actually saving them from bankruptcy. Later, when for some reason they became profitable and successful companies, the government again sold them to private hands. At the same time, traditionally unprofitable industries, such as, for example, the coal industry, radio and television, railway and shipbuilding companies, remain in the hands of the state.
Analysts state that the goals of privatization - to increase budget revenues as much as possible and to increase competition in different markets - are in general contradictory to each other, so it was possible to achieve either one or the other, but not both.

=== France ===
In France, as in many other European countries, a vast public sector of the economy was formed after the World War II. However, subsequently the country's leadership did not adhere to a unified policy regarding the management of state property and its fate as a whole. Here, in comparison with other developed countries, the most pronounced were the so-called waves of property transformation. The processes of nationalization and privatization consistently succeeded each other, depending on who was in power.
The last large-scale nationalization took place in the early 80's. Large commercial banks and many industrial enterprises were nationalized. However, during the reign of President François Mitterrand, the French economy was already experiencing difficulties due to high state participation and a large number of state companies. In connection with this, in the presidency of Jacques Chirac in the late 1990s. processes of privatization of the state enterprises have begun.

===  Poland ===
Unlike the industrial sector, Poland's agricultural sector remained largely in private hands during the decades of communist rule. Most of the former state farms are now leased to farmer tenants. Lack of credit is hampering efforts to sell former state farmland. Currently, Poland's 2 million private farms occupy 90% of all farmland and account for roughly the same percentage of total agricultural production. These farms are small—8 hectares (ha) on average—and often fragmented. Farms with an area exceeding 15 ha accounted for only 9% of the total number of farms but cover 45% of total agricultural area. Over half of all farming households in Poland produce only for their own needs with little, if any, commercial sales.

=== Ukraine ===
Reforms in the more politically sensitive areas of structural reform and land privatisation are still lagging. The parliament has approved a foreign investment law allowing Westerners to purchase businesses and property, to repatriate revenue and profits, and to receive compensation in the event that property is nationalized by a future government. Outside institutions—particularly the IMF—have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms and have threatened to withdraw financial support.

Reprivatization in both political and economic terms is noted by the authors of the monograph "Privatization and Reprivatization in Ukraine after the [[Orange Revolution]]" - proved to be an ineffective way of reviewing the results of privatization in Ukraine. Reprivatization, which was carried out through the courts, proved to be a long and exhausting process. "The process of reprivatization as a way to review the results of privatization was formed under the influence of the general revolutionary moods of the population and the character of the first government team led by [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], accustomed to an irreconcilable opposition struggle".


Kryvorizhstal is Ukraine's largest integrated steel company.

In 2004, the enterprise became an open joint-stock company "Kryvorozhskiy Mining and Metallurgical Combine". In the same year, the government of Ukraine allowed a consortium created by the structures of politicians and businessmen Rinat Akhmetov and Victor Pinchuk (son-in-law of President Leonid Kuchma) to privatize the largest steel plant for $ 803 million.

After the Tymoshenko government came to power in February 2005, the procedure of judicial return of the plant to state property was launched. On April 22, 2005, the Kiev Economic Court declared illegal the sale of a 93.02% stake in Kryvorizhstal and decided to return them to the state.

On October 24, 2005, Kryvorizhstal was reprivatized. The world's largest metallurgical company Mittal Steel won the contest. It laid out for a 93.02% stake in Kryvorozhstal OJSC 24.2 billion UAH ($ 4.8 billion).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1247">'''Rodobrana''' (literally Home Defense/Nation's Defense) was a Slovak paramilitary organization of the [[Slovak People's Party]]. The organization existed, officially, from 1923 to 1927 in [[Czechoslovakia]], when the authorities ordered its dissolution, though many of its members continued to function in other party organizations. It was a predecessor of the [[Hlinka Guard]]. According to [[Beneš decrees|Beneš decree]] [[Beneš decrees#List of decrees|No. 16/1945 Coll.]], membership of Rodobrana was punishable by 5-20 years of imprisonment, or life in prison in case of aggravated circumstances.

==Rural housing in the United Kingdom==
The lack of affordable housing is one of the most critical issues facing rural communities in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Some of the consequences of this are:
*People have to move away to find affordable housing which means that families are separated by distance and are less able support each other by providing childcare or to do shopping for elderly relatives
*Local services such as schools and shops will become increasingly difficult to maintain without enough people using them
*Rural enterprise is stifled as employers are unable to find workers who can afford to live locally

An integrated approach is therefore key{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} to sustain rural communities.

==Rural housing in the United States==
The lack of [[affordable housing]] in rural areas of the United States continues to be a critical issue and concern. Factors that can affect affordable rents and home ownership opportunities in Rural America include: lower income levels, urban sprawl pushing housing costs up, loss of high paying jobs and lack of access to credit.

Though the [[American Housing Survey]] (AHS) "Homeownership rates increased for virtually all racial and ethnic groups, income groups, regions, and rural and urban areas during the 1990s." However, according to the US Housing Market Conditions, 2nd quarter, 2007 report by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], "Housing affordability worsened as sales prices of existing homes increased and mortgage interest rates increased. Housing market performance was weak in the second quarter of 2007, with generally falling production levels and weak existing home sales. The exceptions are the increase in new home sales and the slight increase in housing starts. Inventories of new and existing homes available for sale continue at very high levels, with enough houses available to last nearly 8 months. The home ownership rate declined to 68.2 percent in the second quarter of 2007."

Programs that are addressing the needs of rural housing can be seen through the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]’s, [[Rural Housing Service]]. Other assistance is available through the [http://www.ruralhome.org/ Housing Assistance Council] which is a non-profit organisation. In the United States, "the Housing Assistance Council (HAC) has been helping local organizations build affordable homes in rural America since 1971. HAC emphasizes local solutions, empowerment of the poor, reduced dependence, and self-help strategies. HAC assists in the development of both single- and multi-family homes and promotes home-ownership for working low-income rural families through a self-help, "sweat equity" construction method. The Housing Assistance Council offers services to public, non-profit, and private organisations throughout the rural United States. HAC also maintains a special focus on high-need groups and regions: Indian country, the Mississippi Delta, farmworkers, the Southwest border colonias, and Appalachia.”

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] researches and compiles data sources for rural areas of the United States, through the [[Economic Research Service]], as seen in their article, "One in Four Nonmetro Households are Housing Stressed,” where it indicates that, "Of the Nation’s 2,000-plus nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) counties, 302 are defined as housing stressed." It also states, "The principal component of housing stress is high housing expenses relative to income...” The [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[National Agricultural Library]]’s, Rural Information Center’s Housing page also provides additional resources for rural housing within the United States and works with rural communities and citizens to assist them in housing information needs.

==Rural housing in India==
{{Main|Indira Awaas Yojana}}
In India, rural housing is provided through [[Indira Awaas Yojana]], a welfare program of the Government of India. It was first implemented in 1985&lt;ref name=IAYrural2&gt;{{cite web|title=GUIDELINES for INDIRA AWAAS YOJANA-Introduction|url=http://rural.nic.in/iaygd2.htm|publisher=rural.nic.in|accessdate=8 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225101132/http://rural.nic.in/iaygd2.htm|archivedate=25 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2011 budget the program was funded in the amount of {{INRConvert|89.96|b}}.&lt;ref name=FY2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Balchand|first=K.|title=Pranab shifts focus to Bharat Nirman|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/article1497882.ece|accessdate=8 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Serbian Radical Party''' ({{lang-sr|Српска радикална странка, CPC / Srpska radikalna stranka, '''SRS'''}}) is a [[Serbian nationalism|nationalist]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[List of political parties in Serbia|political party]] in [[Serbia]]. The party was founded in 1991 by paramilitary leader [[Vojislav Šešelj]].{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=193}}&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012401340.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Serbian Radical Party Riding High|first=Dusan|last=Stojanovic|accessdate=23 May 2010|date=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Šešelj was convicted of [[crimes against humanity]] by the [[International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).

Šešelj led the party from its foundation in 1991 until his indictment in 2003, when he voluntary surrendered to the ICTY to defend himself against charges of [[war crimes]] and crimes against humanity that he was alleged to have committed during the [[Croatian War of Independence]] and the [[Bosnian War]].

Under [[Tomislav Nikolić]]'s leadership, however, nationalist rhetoric within the party subsided as Nikolić focused primarily on social issues and the economy.&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt; Due to his support for the [[accession of Serbia to the European Union]] conflicting with the party's original hardline policy, Nikolić was expelled in 2008. With his supporters breaking apart from the SRS, he founded the [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS)&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt; which succeeded the SRS as the country's leading party.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) was formed on 23 February 1991 by the merger of [[Vojislav Šešelj]]'s Serbian Chetnik Movement (SČP) and the National Radical Party (NRS).&lt;ref name=ram&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;pg=PA358#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Sabrina P.|last=Ramet|title=The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918–2005|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University|isbn=978-0-253-34656-8|pages=358–359|accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SČP had been formed in 1990, although it was denied official registration due to its overt identification with the historical [[Chetniks]]. Formation of the new party followed Šešelj's breakaway from the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO) due to internal quarrels with [[Vuk Drašković]]; the SPO having been founded by the merger of Šešelj's former Serbian Freedom Movement and Drašković's faction from the [[Serbian National Renewal]].&lt;ref name=ram/&gt; Šešelj was chosen as the first president of the SRS while [[Tomislav Nikolić]], a member of the NRS, became deputy president.&lt;ref name=ram/&gt; Led by Milošević, the [[Socialist Party of Serbia|Socialist Party]] (SPS) contributed greatly to the rise of the SRS through its use of the media.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=193}} With the SRS allowed to promulgate its ultranationalist views on state television, the SPS could present itself as a comparatively moderate, yet still patriotic party.{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=416}} Šešelj promoted popular notions of an "international conspiracy against the Serbs," the foremost of which involved Germany, the [[Holy See|Vatican]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Italy, [[Turkey]], as well as the centrist Serbian political parties. Such conspiracy theories were also promoted by Milošević-controlled media.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=200}} In 1991, Šešelj became a Member of Parliament as an independent candidate,{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=415}} and created a belligerent image by engaging in physical fights with opponents of the government.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=200}}
[[File:Beograd Zemun SRS-building.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Serbian Radical Party headquarters in [[Zemun]], Belgrade]]
The 22.6% of the vote won by the SRS in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 parliamentary election]] confirmed the party's rapid rise and made it the second largest parliamentary party.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=201}} Šešelj campaigned for the election on issues such as driving [[Albanians]] out of [[Kosovo]] to [[Albania]], expelling Muslims from [[Sandžak]], and forcing the [[Croats]] out of Vojvodina.{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=415–416}} Having helped engineer the party's election to parliament,{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=416}} the SPS formed an informal coalition with the SRS,{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|pp=201–202}} and collaborated on ousting moderate politicians from public office.{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=416}}&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/03/99/kosovo_strikes/316198.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Vojislav Seselj: Milosevic's hard-line ally |date=10 April 1999|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=202}} However, by late 1993 the parties had turned against each other.{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=416}}&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt;{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=203}} Milošević saw it necessary to change his policies and distance himself from the SRS in order for his new peacemaking orientation to be taken seriously by the West, as well as to counter the effects of United Nations sanctions against the country.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=203}} Many socialists also feared competition from the party based on its strong growth record.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=203}} As discord erupted among the opposition including the SRS, Milošević called new [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1993|elections in 1993]]. These cut SRS support almost in half, while the SPS increased its share of the vote from 28% to 38%.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=204}} Although most people had grown tired of the wars, UN sanctions and the catastrophic economic situation, the SRS had also been subjected to powerful state propaganda and exclusion by the media.&lt;ref&gt;Pribićević, 1999, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Milošević's agreement to the [[Dayton accords]] in 1995 to bring peace to Bosnia, Šešelj denounced Milošević as "the worst traitor in Serbian history", and likened the event to Serbia's greatest defeat since the [[Battle of Kosovo]] fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1389.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt;

In 1995, Šešelj and the SRS joined in a technical coalition with the centrist [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] (DS) and the conservative [[Democratic Party of Serbia]] (DSS).{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=208}} This gave Šešelj a degree of democratic legitimacy, although the coalition withered away by the end of the same year.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=208}} When Šešelj beat the SPS candidate for the [[Serbian presidential election, September–October 1997|1997 presidential election]], despite the contest being declared invalid due to low turnout, he was again brought into the Serbian government.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; In 1998 the SRS and SPO entered the so-called "war" government, and as Deputy Prime Minister, Šešelj passed new information laws and helped launch propaganda offensives against [[Albanians in Kosovo|Kosovo Albanians]].&lt;ref name=b417&gt;{{harvnb|Bugajski|2002|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. officials in turn branded him a "fascist", while the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] declared that they would never deal with him.&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; Following the 1999 [[NATO]] occupation of [[Kosovo]], Šešelj resigned from government until his party was enticed to re-enter the administration by the SPS.&lt;ref name=b417/&gt; As the party had held posts under Milošević's regime, it was excluded from the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS), and suffered a major defeat in the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary election]] when Milošević was ousted.&lt;ref name=b417/&gt;&lt;ref name=urn/&gt;

During the [[Yugoslav Wars]] some SRS supporters including Šešelj were active in paramilitary units loyal to Milošević, serving as his "iron fist" during military campaigns.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|pp=193–194}} Milošević's regime at times supported Šešelj and provided him with arms, whilst at others it accused him of war crimes.{{sfn|Pribićević|1999|p=194}} The SRS was also provided with resources to establish paramilitary volunteer forces such as the [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]].{{sfn|Bugajski|2002|p=416}} As the SRS protested against Milošević's extradition to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) in 2001, Milošević urged his supporters to vote for the SRS rather than his own SPS.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; The ICTY also indicted Šešelj, who has been on trial since 2007 following his surrender in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2317765.stm|title= Profile: Vojislav Seselj |work=BBC News  | date=7 November 2007 | accessdate=25 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy President Nikolić became the new ''de facto'' SRS leader and presented a more moderate face, with a new approach to international cooperation and a vision of Serbia acting as a "link between the West and the East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3341231.stm|title=Serbia vote: Parties and players|work=BBC News|date=24 December 2003|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikolić leadership===
During the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 parliamentary election]], the SRS condemned cooperation with the war crimes tribunal, corruption scandals in government, poor living standards, and slightly moderated its formerly aggressive rhetoric.&lt;ref name=urn&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8CzZkOwCNIC&amp;pg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Focus on politics and economics of Russia and Eastern Europe|first=Ulric R.|last=Nichol|year=2007|publisher=Nova|isbn=978-1-60021-317-5|page=239|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it won a clear [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] with 28% of the vote and 82 seats, the party was still viewed as a pariah by its democratic rivals and was thus left in opposition.&lt;ref name=urn/&gt; In the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]] it won 29% of the vote and 81 seats. The SRS caucus in parliament elected Nikolić as its president and [[Aleksandar Vučić]] vice-president. Nikolić was later chosen as parliamentary speaker, supported by the DSS amidst a deadlock in coalition talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6633801.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Hardliner elected Serbia speaker|date=8 May 2007|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stepped down just five days later, as the DS and DSS agreed to form a coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6652211.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Radical Serbia speaker steps down|date=13 May 2007|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After disagreements with Šešelj, on 8 September 2008, Nikolić formed the new parliamentary group ''Napred Srbijo!'' ("Forward Serbia!") along with a number of other SRS members.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt; Šešelj responded with a letter on 11 September addressed to SRS members, in which he condemned the Nikolić group as "traitors" and "Western puppets", while calling on SRS members to remain loyal to the ideologies of "Serbian nationalism, anti-globalism, and [[Russophilia]]."&lt;ref name=mr&gt;{{cite book|page=12|date=October 2009|first=Michael|last=Rossi|title=Resurrecting The Past: Democracy, National Identity and Historical Memory in Modern Serbia|format=PhD thesis|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolić and his group were officially expelled from the SRS the next day,&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=109274|work=Mondo|title=Nikolić i klub isključeni, Vučić odsutan|language=Serbian|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to which Nikolić announced that he would form his own party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2008/09/12/nb-05|work=[[Southeast European Times]]|title=Former SRS deputy leader Nikolic to form own party in Serbia|location=[[Belgrade]]|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September, SRS general secretary [[Aleksandar Vučić]] also resigned from the SRS.&lt;ref name=mr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=109484|work=Mondo|title=Nikolić: I Vučić napustio radikale|language=Serbian|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolić and Vučić then launched the [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS) on 21 October of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2008/09/17/nb-04|title=Nikolic's new party to hold founding session next month in Belgrade|work=[[Southeast European Times]]| date=17 September 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2011|location=[[Belgrade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dalje.com/en-world/nikolic-is-president-of-serbian-progressive-party/194798|title=Nikolic Is President of Serbian Progressive Party|work=Dalje.com|date=21 October 2008|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Šešelj's return===

The party counted Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]] and the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] as one of its political and financial backers until the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], as the parties found common cause in defiance of the United States.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; Similar sentiment led the party to back Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]] following the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] by [[NATO]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">The '''Society for the Education of Africans''' was an English [[abolitionist]] organisation which provided for the education of the sons of prominent Africans in the first decade of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="African academy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouser|first1=Bruce|title=African academy 1799-1806|journal=History of Education|date=2004|volume=33|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was led by the [[Clapham Sect]], and founded the [[African Academy (Clapham)|African Academy]] in Clapham in 1799. Soon twenty boys and four girls arrived in [[Portsmouth]] from [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] and were placed in the stewardship of [[Zachary Macaulay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Killingray|first1=David|authorlink1=Godly Examples and Christian Agents|editor1-last=Stanley|editor1-first=Brian|editor2-last=Becker|editor2-first=Judith|title=Europe as the Other: External Perspectives on European Christianity|date=2014|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society also had a significant overlap with the [[Church Mission Society]], which was also founded in 1799, under the name of the Society for Missions to Africa and the East.

The concept was first formulated by [[John Campbell (missionary)|John Campbell]] who recorded his thoughts of 1796 thus:
:"Might we not bring over Africa to England; educate her; when some through grace and gospel might be converted, and sent back to Africa,-if not any converted, yet they might help to spread civilization, so all would not be lost"&lt;ref name="Phillip"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillip|first1=Rodert|title=The life, times, and missionary enterprises of the Rev. John Campbell|date=1841|pages=160–1|publisher=Snow|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/lifetimesmission00phil|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160–161}}

Campbell's original plan was to set up the school in Edinburgh, and he proceeded to discuss the matter with various friends there, who approved of it. Then he raised the proposal with various members of the Clapham Sect, receiving approval from [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]]. However, when he entered into more details discussion with [[Charles Grant (British East India Company)|Charles Grant]], Grant recommended the plan be deferred until after the war with France was over. Campbell raised the proposal with [[Robert Haldane]], the evangelical philanthropist, who agreed to fund the scheme.&lt;ref name="Phillip"/&gt;{{rp|177}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2773">A '''specialist law enforcement agency''' is a [[law enforcement agency]] which specialises in the types of laws it enforces, or types of activities it undertakes, or geography it enforces laws in, or these in combination.

The specialisation may be imposed voluntarily by policy, consensus with other agencies, or logistical constraints, or it could be imposed legally by [[law]] and [[jurisdiction]], or it is result of the historical evolution of the agency, or combinations thereof.

For example, some agencies only enforce laws related to [[tax]]ation or [[customs]].  Other agencies can only operate in certain areas, for example [[government]]-occupied buildings and land, or on waterways.  Some agencies have otherwise unrestricted jurisdiction, but specialise in certain types of operations, for example [[highway patrol]]s.

Specialities can include:
*{{Specialist lea type descr |institution}} For example, [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs Police]].
*{{Specialist lea type descr |border}} For example, [[United States Border Patrol]].
*{{Specialist lea type descr |water}} For example, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office for Law Enforcement]].
*{{Specialist lea type descr |envher}} For example, [[United States Park Police]].
*{{Specialist lea type descr |postal}} For example, [[United States Postal Inspection Service]].

The '''Suppression of Communism Act 44 of 1950''' (renamed the '''Internal Security Act''' in 1976) was legislation of the national government in [[South Africa]], passed on 26 June 1950 (and coming into effect on 17 July)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/general/1950s.html General South African History Timelines] South African History Online&lt;/ref&gt; which formally banned the [[South African Communist Party|Communist Party of South Africa]] and proscribed any party or group subscribing to [[communism]] according to a uniquely broad definition of the term.

Section of gathering of over 20,000 people-Africans, Indian and Coloured.

The Act defined communism as any scheme aimed at achieving change--whether economic, social, political, or industrial--"by the promotion of disturbance or disorder" or any act encouraging "feelings of hostility between the European and the non-European races...calculated to further [disorder]". The government could deem any person to be a communist if it found that person's aims to be aligned with these aims. After a nominal two-week appeal period, the person's status as a communist became an unreviewable matter of fact, and subjected the person to being barred from public participation, restricted in movement, or imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+za0033) Separate and Unequal] ''South Africa: A Country Study'', Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Justice Takes Its Course |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816614,00.html |format= |agency= |work=Time |date=28 July 1952 |accessdate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was frequently used to silence critics of [[racial segregation]] and [[apartheid]]. Justice [[Frans Lourens Herman Rumpff|Frans Rumpff]], presiding in the 1952 trial of [[African National Congress]] leaders, observed such "statutory communism" might have "nothing to do with communism as it is commonly known."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death the Leveler |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820489-2,00.html |work=Time |date=15 December 1952 |accessdate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Passage of the Act was facilitated by the involvement of communists in the anti-apartheid movement. The Act facilitated the government suppression of organisations such as the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|PAC]] that advocated for black equal rights.&lt;ref name="byrnes"&gt;{{cite book | last = Byrnes | first = Rita M. | title = South Africa: A Country Study | publisher = GPO for the Library of Congress | year = 1996 | location = Washington | pages = | url = http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/ | chapter= Legislative Implementation of Apartheid|chapterurl=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/25.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suppression of Communism Act forced these groups to go underground with their activism. Because of this act, groups such as [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]], led by [[Nelson Mandela]] as a branch of the ANC, did seek financial support from the Communist Party. Most of the Act was repealed in 1982 by the Internal Security Act No 74&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidlaws/g/No15of54.htm Riotous Assemblies and Suppression of Communism Amendment Act No 15 of 1954] About.Com: African History&lt;/ref&gt; and the remainder in 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7379">The '''Hartwell Paper''' called for a reorientation of [[climate policy]] after the perceived failure in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 of the UNFCCC climate conference in Copenhagen]]. It was a response to the [[United Nations]]' [[Kyoto Protocol]], a previous international agreement meant to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The paper was published in May 2010 by the [[London School of Economics]] in cooperation with the [[University of Oxford]]. The authors are 14 natural and social scientists from Asia, Europe and North America, including [[Mike Hulme]], [[Roger A. Pielke (Jr)]], [[Nico Stehr]] and [[Steve Rayner]], who met under the [[Chatham House Rule]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf|title=The Hartwell Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors saw the [[Great Recession|2009 economic crisis]] as an opportunity to re-evaluate global priorities. They argued that "decarbonisation will only be achieved successfully as a benefit contingent upon other goals which are politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic."

[[File:Hartwell House, Bucks.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], where the meetings took place.]]

They emphasize [[human dignity]] as a necessary guiding principle for climate [[Climate policy|policy]]: "To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary. It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness – which has failed and will continue to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 EU Climate Policy after the Crash of 09.] The European Business Review, September 2010 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325063036/http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of human dignity is expanded to three main objectives:
* 1. Energy access for all - the paper advocates taking investments in the innovations of renewable energy to decrease energy costs and to make them more affordable to society. Only this diversification of energy could extend the access to energy, especially in undeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 2. Development that does not interfere with essential Earth systems.
* 3. Societies well equipped to withstand climate-related dangers.

Their ultimate goal is "to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less than those using [[fossil fuels]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/theHartwellPaper The Hartwell Paper.] [[London School of Economics]], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16099521 Oblique strategies], [[The Economist]], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8673828.stm After the crash - a new direction for climate policy.] BBC News, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartwell Paper recommends that they are to achieve this goal by introducing low [[carbon]] [[Carbon tax|taxes]]. However, this money is able to be used to develop a CO2 free energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Kyoto and Climate Change Misconceptions ==

"The previous 'Kyoto' model has dangerously narrowed the option space for thinking seriously and realistically about energy and environmental policies. The Hartwell Paper wishes to contribute to a new pragmatism in the policy discourse surrounding climate change. To this end, we gathered at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire in February 2010 and this paper is the base of our work".

The Hartwell Paper argues that, although we should attempt to reduce climate change, we must also prepare to adapt if necessary. According to the authors, the Kyoto principles implied that adaptation to the environment should be seen as a failure to halt climate change. Those at the Hartwell meeting proposed that these strategies; mitigation, and adaptation, should both be employed. This is to keep in mind the dignity of those who would be most affected while simultaneously slowing global warming.

The following are climate myths presented in the paper:
* '''Climate change is a problem that must be solved''' - "Rather than being a discrete problem to be solved. Climate change is better understood as a persistent condition that must be coped with and can only be partially managed more – or less – well. It is just one part of a larger complex of such conditions encompassing population, technology, wealth disparities, resource use, etc."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''The "deficit model" of science''' - The idea that the lack of information hinders the making of environmental progress. Once the science is understood by all, an agreement can be reached. The Hartwell authors call this a myth, saying that it doesn't address the varying political and religious ideologies that can result in differing interpretations of scientific data. "In turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be ‘science driven’ as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key Features of Hartwell Plan ==

The authors propose a holistic model of environmental practice. They believe there has been too much emphasis placed on carbon dioxide as if it is our only problematic emission. They state that while the CO2 reduction is central to the plan, smaller changes in a variety of practices and industries are also important.
* Diversification and moving away from fossil fuels
* Eradication of "Black Carbon" - Black Carbon is simply soot, which can come from burning wood or coal within the home. This has an environmental effect far greater (per ton) than simple CO2. According to the authors, this is an important step to take, as it should be much easier than phasing out gasoline.
* Reduce Tropospheric Ozone
* Protect Tropical Forests
* The "Kaya Identity" - these are four primary factors when it comes to a region's environmental footprint. They are population, wealth, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Nations face different environmental issues, and the solution for one is not the solution for all.

== Reception and Criticism ==

The Hartwell Paper has received both praise and criticism. According to The Economist, the Hartwell approach to decarbonisation has been a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16099521|title=Oblique strategies|date=2010-05-11|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because large, rapidly industrializing nations are driven by fossil fuels, the authors claim that slowing this process just isn't politically feasible. ''The Economist'' article argues that Hartwell's "oblique strategies" may be more difficult to turn into policy than a more direct attack on carbon dioxide emissions.

'''''The Political Machine 2008''''' is a [[government simulation game]] from [[Stardock]] and the second game in ''[[The Political Machine (series)|The Political Machine]]'' series, in which the player leads a campaign to elect the [[President of the United States]]. The player accomplishes this goal by traveling from state to state and engaging in a variety of activities to either raise money or raise poll numbers. It is the sequel to ''[[The Political Machine]]'' released in 2004. ''The Political Machine 2008'' features new candidates such as [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]]. The game focuses on much more current issues and the constant need for money.&lt;ref&gt;Stardock. [http://www.stardock.com/newsitem.asp?id=1022 "The Political Machine 2008 lets gamers run for President"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The game features three more [[scenario]]s, election in the American Civil War, an election taking place in an alternative European Union, and an alien world.

The developers said that they would add new content into the game before November 4 (the election) and update the issues as they changed in importance. New candidates were also planned once minor bugs were ironed out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.politicalmachine.com/317010 The Political Machine forum post] (about halfway down the page)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tea Party Goes to Washington''''' is a book by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] of [[Kentucky]]. The book, co-written by radio host, columnist, and blogger [[Jack Hunter (radio host)|Jack Hunter]],&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Tom]] (2011-02-21) [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/2011/02/21/rand-pauls-tea-party-manifesto/ Rand Paul’s Tea Party Manifesto], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; describes the [[Tea Party movement]]'s impact in the [[2010 midterm elections]] in the United States, and ultimately their impact on the entire political system.

Paul was elected to the United States Senate on November 2, 2010, along with the help of various Tea Party activists across Kentucky, and has strongly embraced the group. Paul considers himself a member of the Tea Party, and has since founded the [[Tea Party Caucus]] in the United States Senate, along with several other Senators, including Senators [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]], [[Jim DeMint]] and [[Jerry Moran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/27/eveningnews/main7291245.shtml |title=Senate Tea Party Caucus Makes Its Mark |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2011-02-18 |date=2011-01-27 |last=Cordes |first=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a review of the book, historian [[Thomas Woods]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Tea Party Goes to Washington'' . . . is a much bolder book than Rand skeptics would have expected, and it is also a strategically clever book . . . To be sure, Rand’s anecdotes from the campaign trail and from his days as a boy growing up in the Paul household are well executed and engaging, rather than cloying and phony as in so many political books. More importantly, Senator Paul is willing to stake out positions—on the [[Patriot Act]], the [[U.S. Constitution]], the federal budget, [[Austrian economics]], and so on—that are not exactly standard fare for a man in his position.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;

[[Image:Pictograph of Bomoseen.jpg|thumb|right|375px|Pictograph signature of Bomoseen (or Bomazeen), Abenaki sachem]]
The '''Treaty of Portsmouth''', signed on July 13, 1713, ended hostilities between Eastern [[Abenaki]]s with the British provinces of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]] and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]. The agreement renewed a treaty of 1693 the natives had made with Governor Sir [[William Phips]], two in a series of attempts to establish peace between the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] and [[colonist]]s after [[Queen Anne's War]].

==Queen Anne's War==
During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], [[France]] began a conflict with [[England]] which would extend to their colonies. Called [[Queen Anne's War]] in the [[New World]], [[New France]] openly fought [[New England]] for domination of the region between them, with the French enlisting the Abenaki tribes inhabiting it as allies. Occasionally under French command, Indians attacked numerous English settlements along the [[Maine]] coast, including Casco (now [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]), [[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]], [[Saco, Maine|Saco]], [[Wells, Maine|Wells]], [[York, Maine|York]] and [[Berwick, Maine|Berwick]], in [[New Hampshire]] at [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]], Oyster River Plantation (now [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]]), and [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]], and down into [[Massachusetts]] at [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]], [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] and [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], site of the [[Deerfield Massacre]]. Houses were burned, and the inhabitants either killed or abducted to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]. The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, however, restored peace between France and England. As part of the agreement, [[Acadia]] fell under British sovereignty. When the Indians realised that they could no longer depend on the French for protection, the [[sachem]]s sought a [[truce]], and proposed a peace conference to be held at Casco. [[Joseph Dudley]], governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, agreed to a conference, but chose instead to host it at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], which was protected by the guns of [[Fort William and Mary]]. For a more detailed timeline of events leading from first contact to the 1713 treaty, see references and resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1713treatyofportsmouth.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles of agreement==
On July 11, 1713, Governor Dudley and various dignitaries from New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bay (which then included Maine) met with delegates from Abenaki tribes, including the Amasacontee, [[Maliseet]], [[Norridgewock]], [[Pennacook]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] and Sokoki. The agreement was read aloud by sworn interpreters to the sachems, eight of whom on July 13 signed with [[totem]]ic [[pictograph]]s. Others would do so the following year after similar interpretation at another convention. "Being sensible of our great offense and folly," the Indians agreed to:

* acknowledge themselves submissive, obedient subjects of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]
* cease all acts of hostility towards subjects of Great Britain and their estates
* allow English settlers to return to their former settlements without molestation or claims by the Indians
* trade only at English [[trading post]]s established, managed and regulated with governmental approval
* not come near English plantations or settlements below the [[Saco River]], "to prevent mischiefs and inconveniences"
* address all grievances in an English court, rather than in "private revenge"
* confess that they had broken peace agreements made in 1693, 1699, 1702 and 1703, and now ask for forgiveness and mercy
* not make any "perfidious treaty or correspondence" [with the French] against the English; should any exist, to reveal it "seasonally"
* cast themselves upon Her Majesty for mercy and pardon for past rebellions, hostilities and violations of their promises

&lt;/gallery&gt;

At the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth were also the St John River Maliseet [Wolastoqiyik], Mi'kmaw ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]), and Abenaki [Aln8bak] nations of [[Acadia]]. According to a Mi'kmaw History Post-Contact timeline, the treaty ensured they were not to be molested in their lands and were "to enjoy free liberty for hunting, fishing, fowling, and all other lawful liberties and privileges". The Wabanaki regarded the Treaty of Portsmouth as the reaffirmation of the Treaty of 1699 at Mare's Point, limiting British settlements to the west of the Kennebec River, while the British also would keep Port Royal ([[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]]). The Mi'kmaq and Maliseet stated that Acadia [Lnue'gati] belonged to them, and that the French King could not give it to the English King, since he did not own it. The British made efforts to win over the Wabanaki by using superior goods and ceremonial presents for the fur trade. They also tried to have the Wabanaki expel French soldiers and priests from their villages, but without much success. The Mi'kmaq did not sign the Treaty of Portsmouth. The British saw the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Treaty of Portsmouth as an opportunity to regain the settlements of Saco, Scarborough, and Falmouth, and a new chance to exploit the Wabanaki territories between the [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] and [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|St Croix]] rivers, in violation of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muiniskw.org/pgHistory2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The English failed to fulfil their obligations under the treaty.  Massachusetts did not, as promised, establish official trading posts selling cheap goods at honest prices to the Indians. Tribes were forced to continue exchanging their [[fur trading|furs]] with private traders, who were notorious for cheating them. In addition, Indians regarded as threats the British [[blockhouse]]s being built on their lands, and objected to ongoing encroachment of settlers on lands they claimed. Their discontent was encouraged by [[Sebastien Rale]] and other French [[Jesuit]] priests embedded with the tribes who promoted New France's interests. In response to what they perceived as British violations of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Abenakis resumed raids on the encroaching British settlements. Consequently, on July 25, 1722, Governor [[Samuel Shute]] declared war against the Eastern Indians in what would be called [[Father Rale's War]]. Boundary struggles between New France and New England would continue until the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

'''USS ''Recruit''''', also known as the '''Landship ''Recruit''''', was a wooden mockup&lt;!--full size, or semi-scale?--&gt; of a [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]] constructed by the [[United States Navy]] in [[Manhattan]] in New York City, as a [[Military recruitment|recruiting]] tool and training ship during the [[First World War]]. Commissioned as if it were a normal vessel of the U.S. Navy and manned by a crew of trainee sailors, ''Recruit'' was located in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] from 1917 until the end of the war. In 1920, with the reduced requirements for manning in the post-war Navy, ''Recruit'' was decommissioned and dismantled, having recruited 25,000 sailors into Navy service.

==Description==
Operating as the U.S. Navy's headquarters for recruiting in the New York City district, ''Recruit'' was a fully rigged battleship, and was operated as a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref name="PopSci"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=August 1917 |title=The "Recruit" – Our Only Land Battleship |journal=Popular Science Monthly |publisher=Modern Publishing |location=New York |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=212–213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=%22USS+Recruit%22+%22new+York%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Q6TejWD1P&amp;sig=-Y3dlLFUbeAD0zo6OS816LdPREY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rMrZS9v_J4iy9gT_y41c&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22USS%20Recruit%22%20%22new%20York%22&amp;f=false |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the command of Acting Captain C. F. Pierce and with a complement of thirty-nine [[sailors|bluejackets]] from the [[Newport Training Station]] for crew, ''Recruit'' served as a training ship in addition to being a recruiting office.&lt;ref name="Nabu"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of History: The Events of 1916 ... 1917 and Summary |last=Thompson |first=Holland |authorlink= |author2=William Matthew Flinders Petrie |author3=James Bryce Bryce |year=2010 |publisher=Nabu Press |location= |isbn=1-146-93246-4 |page=739 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mT0QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA739&amp;lpg=PA739&amp;dq=%22Landship+Recruit%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rY7fj8qCi_&amp;sig=zJYODOksSTEBsots2HnZS7vy20w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IMTZS7O8JJSY8ASY4-BF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwBw |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy also offered public access and tours of the ship, allowing civilians to familiarize themselves with how a Navy warship was operated.&lt;ref name="PopSci"/&gt;

The accommodations aboard ''Recruit'' included fore and aft examination rooms, full officer's quarters, a [[radio|wireless]] station, a heating and ventilation system that was capable of changing the temperature of the air inside the ship ten times within the span of an hour, and cabins for the accommodation of the sailors of its crew.&lt;ref name="PopSci"/&gt;

Two high [[cage mast]]s, a conning tower, and a single dummy smokestack matched ''Recruit''{{'}}s silhouette to the layout of seagoing U.S. battleships of the time. Three twin turrets contained a total of six wooden versions of {{convert|14|in|adj=on}} guns, providing the ship's 'main battery'. Ten wooden {{convert|5|in|adj=on}} guns in [[casemate]]s represented the secondary anti-[[torpedo-boat]] weaponry of a battleship, while two replicas of one-pounder [[Salute#Heavy arms: gun salutes|saluting gun]]s completed the ship's 'armament'.&lt;ref name="PopSci"/&gt;

==Events==
[[File:USS Recruit in Union Square NYC 1917.jpg|thumb|''Recruit'' on [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]]]
Following its completion and commissioning, the Landship ''Recruit'' hosted a variety of different events and receptions intended to bring civilians aboard the ship, the first of which took place on the afternoon of 8 September 1917.&lt;ref name="Opening"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/09/08/96266838.pdf "A Reception on Landship Recruit"], ''The New York Times'', 8 September 1917. Retrieved 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some events were of a patriotic nature in keeping with the wartime spirit, including the presentation and unfurling of a recreated [[Betsy Ross]] [[Flag of the United States|American flag]],&lt;ref name="LadiesSew"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/03/08/103454645.pdf "Betsy Ross Sewing Party"], ''The New York Times'' 8 March 1918. Retrieved 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; while others were purely social events, including dances for New York's socialites.&lt;ref name="ShorpyDance"&gt;[http://www.shorpy.com/node/3562 Shorpy], Shorpy.com presentation of period photograph with caption describing activities onboard ship.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
After spending over two years in Union Square, the Landship ''Recruit'' was decommissioned and dismantled, the Navy intending to move it to Coney Island's [[Luna Park]], where it would be maintained as a recruiting depot following its success at its Union Square location;&lt;ref name="shipgone"/&gt; ''Recruit'' struck its colors on 16 March 1920;&lt;ref name="shipgone"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the "Landship" had helped the U.S. Navy recruit 25,000 men into the service&lt;ref name="shipgone"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/03/17/118309406.pdf "Landship Recruit sails"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 March 1920. Retrieved 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;—625 times the size of her own crew, and enough to crew twenty-eight {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|0}} battleships. However, the cost of a move to Coney Island proved to exceed the value of the materials used in the vessel, so following its dismantling it was never reassembled, the materials being most likely reused in local projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/nyregion/uss-recruit-intrepid-battleship.html|title=In New York, a Battleship That Never Left Dry Land|last=La Gorce|first=Tammy|date=9 April 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=MB4|accessdate=2017-11-03|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wage slavery''' is a term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between [[Ownership|owning]] and [[Employment|renting]] a person. It is usually used to refer to a situation where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s or a [[salary]], especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=wage slave|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave|publisher=[[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wage slave|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave|publisher=[[dictionary.com]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[exploitation of labour]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html|title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky|page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html|publisher=[[Spunk Library]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism of social stratification covers a wider range of employment choices bound by the pressures of a [[Social hierarchy|hierarchical]] society to perform otherwise unfulfilling work that deprives humans of their "species character"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avineri|1968|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not only under threat of [[starvation]] or [[poverty]], but also of [[social stigma]] and [[Social status|status]] [[wikt:diminution|diminution]].&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh 1857"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schalkenbach1"&gt;{{Harvnb|George|1981|loc=[http://schalkenbach.org/library/henry-george/social-problems/sp15.html "Chapter 15"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html "Conversation with Noam Chomsky", p. 2 of 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities between wage labor and slavery were noted as early as [[Cicero]] in Ancient Rome, such as in ''[[De Officiis]]''.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|author-link=Cicero|translator-last=Miller|translator-first=Walter|translator-link=Walter Miller (philologist)|orig-year=First written in October–November 44&amp;nbsp;BC|chapter=Liber I|trans-chapter=Book I|chapter-url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-de_officiis/1913/pb_LCL030.3.xml|editor-last=Henderson|editor-first=Jeffrey|title=De Officiis|trans-title=On Duties|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL030/1913/volume.xml|dead-url=no|series=[[Loeb Classical Library]] [LCL030]|language=la, en|volume=XXI|edition=Digital|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|date=1 January 1913|pages=[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-de_officiis/1913/pb_LCL030.153.xml 152–153 (XLII)]|doi=10.4159/DLCL.marcus_tullius_cicero-de_officiis.1913|isbn=978-0-674-99033-3|oclc=902696620|ol=7693830M|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406221818/https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-de_officiis/1913/pb_LCL030.153.xml|archive-date=6 April 2018|quote=XLII. Now in regard to trades and other means of livelihood, which ones are to be considered becoming to a gentleman and which ones are vulgar, we have been taught, in general, as follows. First, those means of livelihood are rejected as undesirable which incur people’s ill-will, as those of tax-gatherers and usurers. Unbecoming to a gentleman, too, and vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery. Vulgar we must consider those also who buy from wholesale merchants to retail immediately; for they would get no profits without a great deal of downright lying; and verily, there is no action that is meaner than misrepresentation. And all mechanics are engaged in vulgar trades; for no workshop can have anything liberal about it. Least respectable of all are those trades which cater for sensual pleasures[.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines. Before the [[American Civil War]], Southern defenders of [[African American]] slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foner|1995|p=xix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States abolished slavery after the Civil War, but labor union activists found the metaphor useful and appropriate. According to [[Lawrence B. Glickman|Lawrence Glickman]], in the [[Gilded Age]] "[r]eferences abounded in the labor press, and it is hard to find a speech by a labor leader without the phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence B.

The introduction of wage labor in 18th-century Britain was met with resistance, giving rise to the principles of [[syndicalism]].&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, some labor organizations and individual social activists have espoused [[workers' self-management]] or [[worker cooperative]]s as possible alternatives to wage labor.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Portrait Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The view that working for wages is akin to slavery dates back to the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''. Geoffrey W. Bromiley. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8028-3784-0}}. p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Rome, [[Cicero]] wrote that "whoever gives his labor for money sells himself and puts himself in the rank of slaves".&lt;ref name="Cicero"/&gt;

In 1763, the French journalist [[Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet|Simon Linguet]] published an influential description of wage slavery:&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"/&gt; {{quote|The slave was precious to his master because of the money he had cost him&amp;nbsp;... They were worth at least as much as they could be sold for in the market&amp;nbsp;... It is the impossibility of living by any other means that compels our farm labourers to till the soil whose fruits they will not eat and our masons to construct buildings in which they will not live&amp;nbsp;... It is want that compels them to go down on their knees to the rich man in order to get from him permission to enrich him&amp;nbsp;... what effective gain [has] the suppression of slavery brought [him ?] He is free, you say. Ah! That is his misfortune&amp;nbsp;... These men&amp;nbsp;... [have] the most terrible, the most imperious of masters, that is, need.&amp;nbsp;... They must therefore find someone to hire them, or die of hunger. Is that to be free?}}

The view that wage work has substantial similarities with [[chattel slavery]] was actively put forward in the late 18th and 19th centuries by defenders of chattel slavery (most notably in the Southern states of the United States) and by opponents of capitalism (who were also critics of chattel slavery).&lt;ref name="schalkenbach1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=?}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some defenders of slavery, mainly from the [[Confederate States of America|Southern slave states]], argued that Northern workers were "free but in name – the slaves of endless toil" and that their slaves were better off.&lt;ref name="urlThe Hireling and the Slave – Antislavery Literature Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antislavery.eserver.org/proslavery/graysonhireling|title=The Hireling and the Slave – Antislavery Literature Project|accessdate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/lincolns-wage/ Wage Slavery], PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; This contention has been partly corroborated by some modern studies that indicate slaves' material conditions in the 19th century were "better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time".&lt;ref name="Margo Steckel"&gt;{{Harvnb|Margo|Steckel|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fogel"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fogel|1994|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote that "[i]t is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thoreau|2004|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] in the United States regarded the analogy as spurious.&lt;ref name="Foner 1998 p66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Foner|1998|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that wage workers were "neither wronged nor oppressed".&lt;ref name="Weininger 2002 p95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Weininger|2002|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] argued that the condition of wage workers was different from slavery as laborers were likely to have the opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving [[self-employment]].&lt;ref name="Sandel 181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA181 181–84]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolitionist and former slave [[Frederick Douglass]] initially declared "now I am my own master", upon taking a paying job.&lt;ref name="Douglass 95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Douglass|1994|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later in life he concluded to the contrary, saying "experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Douglass|2000|pp=676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Douglass|1886|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/threeaddresseson00dougrich/threeaddresseson00dougrich_djvu.txt 12–13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass went on to speak about these conditions as arising from the unequal bargaining power between the ownership/capitalist class and the non-ownership/laborer class within a compulsory monetary market: "No more crafty and effective devise for defrauding the southern laborers could be adopted than the one that substitutes orders upon shopkeepers for currency in payment of wages. It has the merit of a show of honesty, while it puts the laborer completely at the mercy of the land-owner and the shopkeeper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Douglass|1886|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/threeaddresseson00dougrich/threeaddresseson00dougrich_djvu.txt 16]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CottonNegrosSouth.jpg|thumb|[[African American]] wage workers picking cotton on a plantation in the South]]
Self-employment became less common as the [[artisan]] tradition slowly disappeared in the later part of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt; In 1869, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the system of wage labor as "a system of slavery as absolute if not as degrading as that which lately prevailed at the South".&lt;ref name="Sandel 181"/&gt; [[E. P. Thompson]] notes that for British workers at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the "gap in status between a 'servant,' a hired wage-laborer subject to the orders and discipline of the master, and an artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough for men to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one side to the other. And, in the value system of the community, those who resisted degradation were in the right".&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"/&gt; A "Member of the Builders' Union" in the 1830s argued that the trade unions "will not only strike for less work, and more wages, but will ultimately abolish wages, become their own masters and work for each other; labor and capital will no longer be separate but will be indissolubly joined together in the hands of workmen and work-women".&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"/&gt; This perspective inspired the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]] of 1834 which had the "two-fold purpose of syndicalist unions – the protection of the workers under the existing system and the formation of the nuclei of the future society" when the unions "take over the whole industry of the country".&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"/&gt; "Research has shown", summarises [[William Lazonick]], "that the 'free-born Englishman' of the eighteenth century – even those who, by force of circumstance, had to submit to agricultural wage labour – tenaciously resisted entry into the capitalist workshop".&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"/&gt;

The use of the term "wage slave" by labor organizations may originate from the labor protests of the [[Lowell Mill Girls]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laurie|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery of wage slavery was widely used by labor organizations during the mid-19th century to object to the lack of workers' self-management. However, it was gradually replaced by the more neutral term "wage work" towards the end of the 19th century as labor organizations shifted their focus to raising wages.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] described capitalist society as infringing on individual [[autonomy]] because it is based on a materialistic and commodified concept of the body and its liberty (i.e. as something that is sold, rented, or [[Social alienation|alienated]] in a [[class society]]). According to [[Friedrich Engels]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Engels|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm|author=Engels, Friedrich|date=October–November 1847|publisher=Marxists.org|title=The Principles of Communism}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly. The individual slave, property of one master, is assured an existence, however miserable it may be, because of the master's interest. The individual proletarian, property as it were of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labor only when someone has need of it, has no secure existence.}}

=== Similarities of wage work with slavery ===
Critics of wage work have drawn several similarities between wage work and slavery:
# Since the chattel slave is property, his value to an owner is in some ways higher than that of a worker who may quit, be fired or replaced. The chattel slave's owner has made a greater investment in terms of the money paid for the slave. For this reason, in times of recession chattel slaves could not be fired like wage laborers. A "wage slave" could also be harmed at no (or less) cost. American chattel-slaves in the 19th century had improved their standard of living from the 18th century&lt;ref name="Margo Steckel"/&gt; and – according to historians Fogel and Engerman – plantation records show that slaves worked less, were better fed and whipped only occasionally – their material conditions in the 19th century being "better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time".&lt;ref name="Fogel"/&gt; This was partially due to slave psychological strategies under an economic system different from capitalist wage-slavery. According to Mark Michael Smith of the Economic History Society, "although intrusive and oppressive, paternalism, the way masters employed it, and the methods slaves used to manipulate it, rendered slaveholders' attempts to institute capitalistic work regimens on their plantation ineffective and so allowed slaves to carve out a degree of autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1998|p= 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unlike a chattel slave, a wage laborer can (barring [[unemployment]] or lack of job offers) choose between employers, but those employers usually constitute a minority of owners in the population for which the wage laborer must work while attempts to implement [[workers' control]] on employers' businesses may be considered{{by whom?|date=December 2018}} an act of theft or insubordination and thus be met with violence, imprisonment or other legal and social measures. The wage laborer's starkest choice is to work for an employer or to face poverty or starvation. If a chattel slave refuses to work, a number of punishments are also available; from beatings to food deprivation – although economically rational slave-owners practiced positive [[reinforcement]] to achieve best results and before losing their investment by killing an expensive slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&amp;id=3089# |title= The Gray Area: Dislodging Misconceptions about Slavery |access-date= 2008-09-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114032053/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&amp;id=3089# |archive-date= 2009-01-14 |dead-url= yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://home.triad.rr.com/warfford/Roman_Empire/slavery.html# |title= Roman Household Slavery |access-date= 2008-09-27 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080928184135/http://home.triad.rr.com/warfford/Roman_Empire/slavery.html# |archive-date= 2008-09-28 |dead-url= yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Historically, the range of occupations and status positions held by chattel slaves has been nearly as broad as that held by free persons, indicating some similarities between chattel slavery and wage slavery as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery/24172/Slave-occupations "The sociology of slavery: Slave occupations"]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. "The highest position slaves ever attained was that of slave minister [...] A few slaves even rose to be monarchs, such as the slaves who became sultans and founded dynasties in Islām. At a level lower than that of slave ministers were other slaves, such as those in the [[Roman Empire]], the Central Asian [[Samanid Empire | Samanid domains]], [[Ch'ing]] China, and elsewhere, who worked in government offices and administered provinces. [...] The stereotype that slaves were careless and could only be trusted to do the crudest forms of manual labor was disproved countless times in societies that had different expectations and proper incentives".&lt;/ref&gt;
# Like chattel slavery, wage slavery does not stem from some immutable "human nature", but represents a "specific response to material and historical conditions" that "reproduce[s] the inhabitants, the social relations… the ideas… [and] the social form of daily life".&lt;ref name="Perlman 2002 p2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Perlman|2002|p= 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Similarities became blurred when proponents of wage labor won the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, in which they competed for legitimacy with defenders of chattel slavery. Each side presented an over-positive assessment of their own system while denigrating the opponent.&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh 1857"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner 1998 p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weininger 2002 p95"/&gt;

According to American [[Anarcho-syndicalism| anarcho-syndicalist]] philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]], workers themselves noticed the similarities between chattel and wage slavery. Chomsky noted that the 19th-century [[Lowell Mill Girls]], without any reported knowledge of European [[Marxism]] or [[anarchism]], condemned the "degradation and subordination" of the newly-emerging industrial system and the "new spirit of the age: gain wealth, forgetting all but self", maintaining that "those who work in the mills should own them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They expressed their concerns in a [[Protest songs in the United States | protest song]] during their 1836 strike: &lt;poem&gt;:Oh! isn't it a pity, such a pretty girl as I
:Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die?
:Oh! I cannot be a slave, I will not be a slave,
:For I'm so fond of liberty,
:That I cannot be a slave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/americanstudies/lavender/liberty.html|title=Liberty|work=American Studies|publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Defenses of both wage labor and chattel slavery in the literature have linked the subjection of man to man with the subjection of man to [[nature]] – arguing that [[hierarchy]] and a social system's particular [[relations of production]] represent [[human nature]] and are no more coercive than the reality of [[human condition | life itself]]. According to this narrative, any well-intentioned attempt to fundamentally change the ''status quo'' is naively [[utopia]]n and will result in more oppressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carsel|1940}}; {{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857}}; {{Harvnb|Norberg|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosses in both of these long-lasting systems argued that their respective systems [[wealth creation | created a lot of wealth and prosperity]]. In some sense, both did create jobs, and their investment entailed risk. For example, slave-owners risked losing money by buying chattel slaves who later became ill or died; while bosses risked losing money by hiring workers (wage slaves) to make products that did not sell well on the market. Marginally, both chattel and wage slaves may become bosses; sometimes by working hard. The "rags to riches" story occasionally comes to pass in capitalism; the "slave to master" story occurred in places like colonial Brazil, where slaves could buy their own freedom and become business owners, self-employed, or slave-owners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|2005|p= 201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus critics of the concept of wage slavery do not regard [[social mobility]], or the hard work and risk that it may entail, as a redeeming factor.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Iain. B.7.2 Does social mobility make up for class inequality? An Anarchist FAQ: Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[David Graeber]] has noted that historically the first wage-labor contracts we know about – whether in ancient Greece or Rome, or in the Malay or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Swahili_city-states Swahili city-states] in the Indian Ocean – were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money and the slaves another, with which to maintain their living expenses). According to Graeber, such arrangements were quite common in [[New World slavery]] as well, whether in the United States or in Brazil. [[C. L. R. James]] (1901-1989) argued that most of the techniques of human organization employed on factory workers during the [[Industrial Revolution]] first developed on [[slave plantation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Decline in use of term ===
[[File:Wage Slavery Use Study.svg|thumb|400px|By the end of the 19th century, both the use of the term wage slavery and its meaning declined]]
The usage of the term "wage slavery" shifted to "wage work" at the end of the 19th century as groups like the [[Knights of Labor]] and [[American Federation of Labor]] shifted to a more reformist, trade union ideology instead of worker's self-management. Much of the decline was caused by the rapid increase in manufacturing after the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent dominance of wage labor as a result. Another factor was immigration and demographic changes that led to ethnic tension between the workers.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;

As Hallgrimsdottir and Benoit point out: {{quote|[I]ncreased centralization of production&amp;nbsp;... declining wages&amp;nbsp;... [an] expanding&amp;nbsp;... labor pool&amp;nbsp;... intensifying competition, and&amp;nbsp;... [t]he loss of competence and independence experienced by skilled labor" meant that "a critique that referred to all [wage] work as slavery and avoided demands for wage concessions in favor of supporting the creation of the producerist republic (by diverting strike funds towards funding&amp;nbsp;... co-operatives, for example) was far less compelling than one that identified the specific conditions of slavery as low wages.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Some anti-capitalist thinkers claim that the [[elite]] maintain wage [[slavery]] and a divided working class through their influence over the media and entertainment industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/19/144225|title=Democracy Now|date=19 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113204609/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F19%2F144225|archivedate=13 November 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1992----02.htm|title=Interview|year=1992|author=Chomsky, Noam|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721164116/http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1992----02.htm|archivedate=21 July 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational institutions, unjust laws, nationalist and corporate [[propaganda]], pressures and incentives to internalize values serviceable to the power structure, [[State (polity)|state]] violence, fear of [[unemployment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://question-everything.mahost.org/Socio-Politics/thoughtcontrol.html|title=Thought Control|work=Socio-Politics|publisher=Question Everything}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a historical legacy of exploitation and profit accumulation/transfer under prior systems, which shaped the development of economic theory. [[Adam Smith]] noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low and have the upper hand in conflicts between workers and employers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-b5-c1-article-2-ss3.htm Adam Smith – An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations – The Adam Smith Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The interest of the dealers&amp;nbsp;... in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public... [They] have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public&amp;nbsp;... We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate&amp;nbsp;... It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms.}}

=== Capitalism ===
The concept of wage slavery could conceivably be traced back to pre-capitalist figures like [[Gerrard Winstanley]] from the radical Christian [[Diggers]] movement in England, who wrote in his 1649 pamphlet, ''The New Law of Righteousness'', that there "shall be no buying or selling, no fairs nor markets, but the whole earth shall be a common treasury for every man" and "there shall be none Lord over others, but every one shall be a Lord of himself".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graham|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] stated that "the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil (for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics)",&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' 1328b–1329a, H. Rackham trans.&lt;/ref&gt; often paraphrased as "all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind".&lt;ref name="quotationspage.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/1097.html | title=The Quotations Page: Quote from Aristotle}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] wrote in 44 BC that "vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery".&lt;ref name="Cicero"/&gt; Somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of [[liberalism]], like [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Thomas Paine]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html Social Security Online History Pages]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry George]], who inspired the economic philosophy known as [[Georgism]];&lt;ref name="schalkenbach1" /&gt; and the [[Distributism|Distributist]] school of thought within the [[Catholic Church]].

[[File:Kronstadt attack.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Red Army]] troops attack [[Kronstadt]] [[libertarian socialist]] "wage slavery" critics who had demanded among other things that "handicraft production be authorized provided it does not utilize wage labour"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brendel|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
To [[Karl Marx]] and anarchist thinkers like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]], wage slavery was a [[Class (social)|class condition]] in place due to the existence of [[private property]] and the [[Sovereign state|state]]. This class situation rested primarily on:
# The existence of property not intended for active use;
# The concentration of ownership in few hands;
# The lack of direct access by workers to the [[means of production]] and consumption goods; and
# The perpetuation of a [[Reserve army of labour|reserve army of unemployed workers]].
And secondarily on:
# The waste of workers' efforts and resources on producing useless luxuries;
# The waste of goods so that their price may remain high; and
# The waste of all those who sit between the producer and consumer, taking their own shares at each stage without actually contributing to the production of goods, i.e. the [[Reseller|middle man]].

=== Fascism ===
Fascist economic policies were more hostile to independent trade unions than modern economies in Europe or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Grand|2004|pp=48–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism was more widely accepted in the 1920s and 1930s, and foreign corporate investment (notably from the United States) in Italy and Germany increased after the fascists took power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/thistle/www/v13/3/oil.html A People's History of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1962|pp=725–726}}: "General Motors' involvement in Germany's military preparations was the logical outcome of its forthright export philosophy of seeking profits wherever and however they might be made, irrespective of political circumstances. [...] By April 1939, G.M. had applied its credo to its fullest limits, for Opel, its wholly owned subsidiary, was (along with Ford) Germany's largest tank producer. [...] The details of additional American business involvement with German industry fill dozens of volumes of government hearings".&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascism has been perceived by some notable critics, like [[Buenaventura Durruti]], to be a last resort weapon of the privileged to ensure the maintenance of wage slavery: {{quote|No government fights fascism to destroy it. When the [[bourgeoisie]] sees that power is slipping out of its hands, it brings up fascism to hold onto their privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Quote from an interview with Pierre van Paassen (24 July 1936), published in the ''Toronto Daily Star'' (5 August 1936)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Psychological effects ==
[[File:WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]]]
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era. In his 1791 book ''[[The Limits of State Action]]'', classical liberal thinker [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] explained how "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the laborer works under external control, "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DIpW10rWZFAC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they explore human authority and obedience, both the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram]] and [[Stanford prison experiment|Stanford experiments]] have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thye|Lawler|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-identity problems and stress ===
According to research{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, modern work provides people with a sense of personal and social identity that is tied to:
# The particular work role, even if unfulfilling; and
# The social role it entails e.g. family bread-winning, friendship forming and so on.
Thus job loss entails the loss of this identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Price|Friedland|Vinokur|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] argued that if a person perceives himself as being what he owns, then when that person loses (or even thinks of losing) what he "owns" (e.g. the good looks or sharp mind that allow him to sell his labor for high wages) a fear of loss may create anxiety and authoritarian tendencies because that person's sense of identity is threatened. In contrast, when a person's sense of self is based on what he experiences in a state of being (creativity, love, sadness, taste, sight and the like) with a less materialistic regard for what he once had and lost, or may lose, then less authoritarian tendencies prevail. In his view, the state of being flourishes under a worker-managed workplace and economy, whereas self-ownership entails a materialistic notion of self, created to rationalize the lack of worker control that would allow for a state of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fromm|1995|p=?}}.&lt;br&gt;You can see Fromm discussing these ideas [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7GpHrdXOFI here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative journalist [[Robert Kuttner]] analyzed the work of public-health scholars Jeffrey Johnson and Ellen Hall about modern conditions of work and concludes that "to be in a life situation where one experiences relentless demands by others, over which one has relatively little control, is to be at risk of poor health, physically as well as mentally". Under wage labor, "a relatively small elite demands and gets empowerment, self-actualization, autonomy, and other work satisfaction that partially compensate for long hours" while "epidemiological data confirm that lower-paid, lower-status workers are more likely to experience the most clinically damaging forms of stress, in part because they have less control over their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuttner|1997|pp=153–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wage slavery and the educational system that precedes it "implies power held by the leader. Without power the leader is inept. The possession of power inevitably leads to corruption&amp;nbsp;... in spite of&amp;nbsp;... good intentions&amp;nbsp;... [Leadership means] power of initiative, this sense of responsibility, the self-respect which comes from expressed manhood, is taken from the men, and consolidated in the leader. The sum of their initiative, their responsibility, their self-respect becomes his&amp;nbsp;... [and the] order and system he maintains is based upon the suppression of the men, from being independent thinkers into being 'the men'&amp;nbsp;... In a word, he is compelled to become an autocrat and a foe to democracy". For the "leader", such marginalisation can be beneficial, for a leader "sees no need for any high level of intelligence in the rank and file, except to applaud his actions. Indeed such intelligence from his point of view, by breeding criticism and opposition, is an obstacle and causes confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ablett|1991|pp=15–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wage slavery "implies erosion of the human personality&amp;nbsp;... [because] some men submit to the will of others, arousing in these instincts which predispose them to cruelty and indifference in the face of the suffering of their fellows".&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Jose Peirats, The CNT in the Spanish Revolution, vol. 2, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological control ===
{{anarchism sidebar|economics}}

==== Higher wages ====
In 19th-century discussions of labor relations, it was normally assumed that the threat of starvation forced those without property to work for wages. Proponents of the view that modern forms of employment constitute wage slavery, even when workers appear to have a range of available alternatives, have attributed its perpetuation to a variety of social factors that maintain the [[cultural hegemony|hegemony]] of the employer class.&lt;ref name="Perlman 2002 p2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gramsci, A. (1992) ''Prison Notebooks''. New York : Columbia University Press, pp. 233–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In an account of the [[Lowell Mill Girls]], Harriet Hanson Robinson wrote that generously high wages were offered to overcome the degrading nature of the work: {{quote|At the time the Lowell cotton mills were started the caste of the factory girl was the lowest among the employments of women.&amp;nbsp;... She was represented as subjected to influences that must destroy her purity and selfrespect. In the eyes of her overseer she was but a brute, a slave, to be beaten, pinched and pushed about. It was to overcome this prejudice that such high wages had been offered to women that they might be induced to become millgirls, in spite of the opprobrium that still clung to this degrading occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Harriet H. "[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/robinson-lowell.asp Early Factory Labor in New England]," in Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Fourteenth Annual Report (Boston: Wright &amp; Potter, 1883), pp. 38082, 38788, 39192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book ''[[Disciplined Minds]]'', [[Jeff Schmidt (writer)|Jeff Schmidt]] points out that professionals are trusted to run organizations in the interests of their employers. Because employers cannot be on hand to manage every decision, professionals are trained to "ensure that each and every detail of their work favors the right interests–or skewers the disfavored ones" in the absence of overt control: {{quote|The resulting professional is an obedient thinker, an intellectual property whom employers can trust to experiment, theorize, innovate and create safely within the confines of an assigned ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmidt|2000|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Parecon]] (participatory economics) theory posits a social class "between labor and capital" of higher paid professionals such as "doctors, lawyers, engineers, managers and others" who monopolize empowering labor and constitute a class above wage laborers who do mostly "obedient, rote work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tedrow|first=Matt&lt;!-- Don't know where 'DC' comes from. You can look up Tedrow on Twitter. He's also currently (05/3/2013) doctoral student at Texas. --&gt;|date=4 July 2007|title=Parecon and Anarcho-Syndicalism: An Interview with Michael Albert|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/parecon-and-anarcho-syndicalism-an-interview-with-michael-albert-by-michael-albert|publisher=[[ZNet]]|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lower wages ====
The terms "employee" or "worker" have often been replaced by "associate". This plays up the allegedly voluntary nature of the interaction while playing down the subordinate status of the wage laborer as well as the worker-boss class distinction emphasized by labor movements. Billboards as well as television, Internet and newspaper advertisements consistently show low-wage workers with smiles on their faces, appearing happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ehrenreich|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Job interviews and other data on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to feign unremunerative motivation.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich 2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ehrenreich|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich 2011"/&gt;

At the same time, employers in the service industry have justified unstable, part-time employment and low wages by playing down the importance of service jobs for the lives of the wage laborers (e.g. just temporary before finding something better, student summer jobs and the like).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klein|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yq_WAUXqRAEC&amp;pg=PA232 232]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClelland|first=Mac|title=I Was a Warehouse Wage Slave|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor|journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|issue=March/April 2012|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, "scientific methods of strikebreaking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steuben|1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were devised – employing a variety of tactics that emphasized how strikes undermined "harmony" and "Americanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=Y5Ouy4XoXPsC&amp;pg=PA229 229]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Early 20th century", but sources are early 21st century? --&gt;

== Workers' self-management ==
[[File:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Noam Chomsky]] has written in support of labour movements]]
{{Anarcho-communism sidebar|Concepts}}
Some social activists objecting to the [[market system]] or [[price system]] of wage working historically have considered [[syndicalism]], [[worker cooperative]]s, [[workers' self-management]] and [[workers' control]] as possible alternatives to the current wage system.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"/&gt;

=== Labor and government ===
The American philosopher [[John Dewey]] believed that until "industrial feudalism" is replaced by "industrial democracy", politics will be "the shadow cast on society by big business".&lt;ref&gt;"As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance", in "The Need for a New Party" (1931), Later Works 6, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]] has postulated in his [[investment theory of party competition]] that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ferguson|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that political theory tends to blur the 'elite' function of government: {{quote|Modern political theory stresses Madison's belief that "in a just and a free government the rights both of property and of persons ought to be effectually guarded." But in this case too it is useful to look at the doctrine more carefully. There are no rights of property, only rights to property that is, rights of persons with property,...

[In] representative democracy, as in, say, the United States or Great Britain […] there is a monopoly of power centralized in the state, and secondly – and critically – […] the representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere […] That is, as long as individuals are compelled to rent themselves on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very limited, if even meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19760725.htm|title=The Relevance of Anarcho-syndicalism|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=July 25, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this regard, Chomsky has used Bakunin's theories about an "instinct for freedom",&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20070921.htm|title=A Revolution is Just Below the Surface|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the militant history of labor movements, Kropotkin's mutual aid evolutionary principle of survival and [[Marc Hauser]]'s theories supporting an innate and universal moral faculty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the incompatibility of oppression with certain aspects of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3740467851698161135 On Just War Theory at West Point Academy: Hauser's theories "could some day provide foundations for a more substantive theory of just war," expanding on some of the existing legal "codifications of these intuitive judgments" that are regularly disregarded by elite power structures. (min 26–30)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20040714.htm|title=Interview|author=Chomsky, Noam|date=14 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on environmental degradation ===
[[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] philosophy professor John Clark and libertarian socialist philosopher [[Murray Bookchin]] have criticized the system of wage labor for encouraging environmental destruction, arguing that a self-managed industrial society would better manage the environment. Like other anarchists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionE An Anarchist FAQ Section E – What do anarchists think causes ecological problems?]&lt;/ref&gt; they attribute much of the Industrial Revolution's pollution to the "hierarchical" and "competitive" economic relations accompanying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bookchin|1990|p=44}}; {{Harvnb|Bookchin|2001|pp=1–20}}; {{Harvnb|Clark|1983|p=114}}; {{Harvnb|Clark|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment contracts ===
Some criticize wage slavery on strictly contractual grounds, e.g. [[David Ellerman]] and [[Carole Pateman]], arguing that the [[employment contract]] is a legal fiction in that it treats human beings juridically as mere tools or inputs by abdicating responsibility and self-determination, which the critics argue are inalienable. As Ellerman points out, "[t]he employee is legally transformed from being a co-responsible partner to being only an input supplier sharing no legal responsibility for either the input liabilities [costs] or the produced outputs [revenue, profits] of the employer's business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|2005|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such contracts are inherently invalid "since the person remain[s] a ''de facto'' fully capacitated adult person with only the contractual role of a non-person" as it is impossible to physically transfer self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|2005|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Pateman argues: {{quote|The contractarian argument is unassailable all the time it is accepted that abilities can 'acquire' an external relation to an individual, and can be treated as if they were property. To treat abilities in this manner is also implicitly to accept that the 'exchange' between employer and worker is like any other exchange of material property .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The answer to the question of how property in the person can be contracted out is that no such procedure is possible. Labour power, capacities or services, cannot be separated from the person of the worker like pieces of property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|2005|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a modern liberal capitalist society, the employment contract is enforced while the enslavement contract is not; the former being considered valid because of its consensual/non-coercive nature and the latter being considered inherently invalid, consensual or not. The noted economist [[Paul Samuelson]] described this discrepancy: {{quote|Since slavery was abolished, human earning power is forbidden by law to be capitalized. A man is not even free to sell himself; he must rent himself at a wage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&amp;Pol-Econ/Inalienable-rights-and-contracts.pdf Ellerman, David, ''Inalienable Rights and Contracts'', 21]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some advocates of [[right-libertarianism]], among them philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: {{quote|The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery. I believe that it would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others like [[Murray Rothbard]] allow for the possibility of [[debt slavery]], asserting that a lifetime labour contract can be broken so long as the slave pays appropriate damages: {{quote|[I]f A has agreed to work for life for B in exchange for 10,000 grams of gold, he will have to return the proportionate amount of property if he terminates the arrangement and ceases to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rothbard|2009|p=164 n.34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Schools of economics ==
In the philosophy of mainstream, [[neoclassical economics]], [[wage labor]] is seen as the [[Labour economics|voluntary sale of one's own time and efforts]], just like a carpenter would sell a chair, or a farmer would sell wheat. It is considered neither an antagonistic nor abusive relationship and carries no particular moral implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mankiw|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian economics]] argues that a person is not "free" unless they can sell their labor because otherwise that person has no [[self-ownership]] and will be owned by a "third party" of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mises|1996|pp=[https://www.mises.org/humanaction/pdf/ha_10.pdf 194–99]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Post-Keynesian economics]] perceives wage slavery as resulting from [[inequality of bargaining power]] between labor and capital, which exists when the economy does not "allow labor to organize and form a strong countervailing force".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bober|2007|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qb47lG7sf4AC&amp;pg=PA41 41–42]}}. See also {{Harvnb|Keen|c. 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main forms of [[socialist economics]] perceive wage slavery differently:
# [[Libertarian socialism]] sees it as a lack of [[workers' self-management]] in the context of substituting state and capitalist control with political and economic decentralization and [[confederation]].
# [[State socialism|State socialists]] view it as an injustice perpetrated by capitalists and solved through [[nationalization]] and [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5789">The '''Weeks Act''' is a federal law (36 Stat. 961) enacted by the [[United States Congress]] on March 1, 1911. Introduced by [[Massachusetts]] Congressman [[John W. Weeks]] and signed into law by President [[William Howard Taft]], the law authorized the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|US Secretary of Agriculture]] to "Examine, locate and recommend for purchase ... such lands within the watersheds of navigable streams as ... may be necessary to the regulation of flow of navigable streams...." This meant that the federal government would be able to purchase private land if the purchase was deemed necessary to protect [[river]]s' and [[Watersheds of North America|watersheds]]' [[River source|headwaters]] in the [[eastern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Richard C. "Weeks Act 1911." ''Encyclopedia of American Forest History''(1983): 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the law allowed for land acquired through this act to be preserved and maintained as national forest territory. Six years earlier, the [[Transfer Act of 1905]] transferred control over the federal forest reserves from the [[General Land Office]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and its [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]. Responsibility for land purchased through the Weeks Act was not given to former Chief Forester [[Gifford Pinchot]] because he resigned in 1907, with the stipulation that he would only resign if he could appoint his successor. This stipulation led to the Forest Service's tradition of picking a head with forestry knowledge. With the land acquired through the Weeks Act, Pinchot's successor obtained the power to issue permits for water power development on National Forests. The Weeks Act appropriated $9 million to purchase 6 million acres (24,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/about/history/pdf/A_History_of_Water_Resource_001.pdf A History of Water Resource activities of the United States Department of Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weeks Act also provided measures for more cooperation between federal and state governments in regard to fire control. This legislation was heavily influenced by the fire season of 1910 because it wreaked havoc across the western United States, particularly in [[Idaho]], where 85 people, including 72 firefighters, were killed in fires and more than 3 million acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land and roughly 8,000,000,000 board feet (19,000,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of timber were destroyed by fires that year. This year's fire season alone put the US Forest Service $1.1 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;Cermak, Robert W. ''Fire In The Forest-A History of Forest Fire Control on the National Forests in California 1898-1956'' USDA Forest Service Publishers, 2005  p.58 {{ISBN|1-59351-429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weeks Act also authorized establishment of the '''National Forest Reservation Commission''' to consider and approve purchase of these identified lands. The commission was composed of the secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and [[United States Secretary of Defense|War]] (for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]]), as well as two members each from the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]]. [[Jacob Gallinger]], who had sponsored the Senate’s version of the bill, was named a member of the initial committee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/the-weeks-act/protection-and-restoration/ Protection and Restoration]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission would exist from 1911 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NFRC_members.pdf National Forest Reservation Commission Members, 1911-1966]&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafting of Weeks Act was originally motivated by the intent to purchase lands in eastern United States, where the federal government owned no large tracts of land devoted to conservation. Later western lands were acquired under the Weeks Act.  The Weeks Act was substantially expanded and modified by the [[Clarke–McNary Act]] in 1924.

Major national forests that were formed under the Weeks Act are the [[Allegheny National Forest]], [[White Mountain National Forest]], [[Green Mountain National Forest]], [[Pisgah National Forest]], [[George Washington and Jefferson National Forests|George Washington National Forest]], and [[Ottawa National Forest]]. To date, the Weeks Act has protected more than 20 million acres of forestland, which has had a tremendous benefit for ecosystems and society by providing habitat for plants and animals, creating lucrative recreation spots for tourists, and creating economic opportunities for local communities, stimulating the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/the-weeks-act/ Weeks Act - Forest History Society], Retrieved 2015-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Brooke Joyce''' (24 April 1906&amp;nbsp;– 3 January 1946), nicknamed [[Lord Haw-Haw]], was an American-born, Anglo-Irish [[Fascism|Fascist]] politician and [[Nazi propaganda]] broadcaster to the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]]. He took German citizenship in 1940. He was convicted of one count of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]] in 1945 and sentenced to death. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] upheld his conviction. He was hanged on 3 January 1946, making him the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom. ([[Theodore Schurch]] was hanged the following day, but for the crime of [[Treachery Act 1940|treachery]] rather than treason.)

==Early life==
William Brooke Joyce was born on Herkimer Street in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christenson|first=Ron |title=Political trials in history: from antiquity to the present |editor=Ron Christenson|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1991|isbn=978-0-88738-406-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBdOvs2THGEC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22William+Joyce%22++born+Brooklyn|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States]]. His father was Michael Francis Joyce (9 December 1866 – 19 February 1941) an [[Irish Catholic]] from a family of farmers in [[Ballinrobe]], [[County Mayo]], who had taken United States citizenship on 25 October 1894. His mother was Gertrude Emily Brooke, who although born in [[Shaw and Crompton]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]], was from a well-off [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Anglo-Irish]] family of medical practitioners associated with [[County Roscommon]]. 

A few years after William's birth, the family returned to [[Salthill]], [[Galway]], permanently. Joyce attended [[Coláiste Iognáid]], a Jesuit school in Galway (from 1915–21). Joyce's mother was strongly [[Anglocentric]] and despite tensions with her father for marrying a Roman Catholic, remained staunchly Protestant and [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]] herself, hostile to [[Irish nationalism]]. Joyce's father bought up houses and rented some to the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC).

It was during the [[Irish War for Independence]] that Joyce was recruited by Capt. Patrick William Keating as a courier for [[British Army]] intelligence in Galway, then fighting against the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–22)|Irish Republican Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=87350 Lord Haw-Haw and the Black and Tans], Axishistory.com; accessed 28 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=William|title=Twilight over England|publisher=Imperial War Museum, Department of Printed Books|year=1992|edition=Issue 5 of Facsimile reprint series|pages=Introduction (x)|isbn=978-0-901627-72-8|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=-mxnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22william+joyce%22+%22black+and+tans%22&amp;q=%22black+and+tans%22#search_anchor|accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to have hung around with [[Black and Tans]] at Lenaboy Castle, which reportedly resulted in the Irish Republican Army dispatching a volunteer, Michael Molloy, to murder Joyce on his way home from school in December 1921, although minors were normally excluded from being executed by the IRA, usually being expelled or ostracised. Joyce reputedly survived only because his father had moved his family to another house on a different route. Capt. Keating arranged for William Joyce to be mustered into the [[Worcester Regiment]] soon after, taking him out of the dangerous situation in Ireland to [[Norton Barracks]]. A few months later he was discharged when it was found out he was underage.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson, "After the Victorians", Hutchinson, London, 2005, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce remained in England and briefly attended [[King's College School]], [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], on a foreign exchange. His family followed him to England two years later, having backed the losing side in the conflict in Ireland. Joyce had relatives in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], whom he visited on a few occasions. He then applied to [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] of the [[University of London]], where he entered the [[Officer Training Corps]]. At Birkbeck, he obtained a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|first-class honours]] degree in English.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson, ''After the Victorians'', Hutchinson, London, 2005.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Holmes, Colin (2016). Searching for Lord Haw-Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce. Routledge. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he applied for a job in the [[Foreign Office]], but was rejected and took a job as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt; Holmes, Colin (2016). Searching for Lord Haw-Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce. Routledge. p. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed an interest in [[Fascism]], and he worked with (but never joined) the [[British Fascists]] of [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]].

On 22 October 1924, while stewarding a meeting in support of Jack Lazarus (the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate for [[Lambeth North (UK Parliament constituency)|Lambeth North]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|general election]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Razor Slashing Victim|publisher=Daily Mail|date=24 October 1924 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was attacked by Communists and received a deep razor slash that ran across his right cheek. It left a [[Glasgow smile|permanent scar which ran from the earlobe to the corner of the mouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Rebecca|title=The New Meaning of Treason|page=25|publisher=Viking Press|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Joyce often said that his attackers were Jewish, biographer Colin Holmes claims that Joyce's first wife told him in 1992 that "it wasn't a Jewish Communist who disfigured him .... He was knifed by an Irish woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Colin|title=Searching for Lord Haw-Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce|publisher=Routledge|page=52-53 |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Union of Fascists==
[[File:Flag of the British Union of Fascists.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[British Union of Fascists]]]]
In 1932, Joyce joined the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF) under Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], and swiftly became a leading speaker, praised for his power of oratory. The journalist and novelist [[Cecil Roberts]] described a speech given by Joyce:{{quote|Thin, pale, intense, he had not been speaking many minutes before we were electrified by this man&amp;nbsp;... so terrifying in its dynamic force, so vituperative, so vitriolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Selwyn|first=Francis|title=Hitler's Englishman: the crime of Lord Haw-Haw|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1987|page=61|isbn=978-0-7102-1032-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6t0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22he+had+not+been+speaking+many+minutes+before+we+were+electrified%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22he%20had%20not%20been%20speaking%20many%20minutes%20before%20we%20were%20electrified%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1934, Joyce was promoted to the BUF's Director of Propaganda, replacing [[Wilfred Risdon]] (who had expressed concern to Mosley about the use of the spotlights at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] rally in June) and later appointed deputy leader. As well as being a gifted speaker, Joyce gained the reputation of a savage brawler. His violent [[rhetoric]] and willingness to physically confront [[Antifascism|anti-fascist]] elements head-on played no small part in further marginalizing the BUF. After the bloody debacle of Olympia, Joyce spearheaded the BUF's policy shift from campaigning for economic revival through [[corporatism]] to a focus on [[antisemitism]]. He was instrumental in changing the name of the BUF to "British Union of Fascists and National Socialists" in 1936 and stood as a party candidate in the 1937 elections to the [[London County Council]]. In 1936, Joyce lived for a year in [[Whitstable]], where he owned a radio and electrical shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/sites/blaenau/pages/hawhaw.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=North West Wales Blaenau Ffestiniog&amp;nbsp;— Coed-y-Bleiddiau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=2431|publisher=Canterbury|title=1900–1950|accessdate=26 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 1934 and 1937, when Mosley sacked him, Joyce also served as Area Administrative Officer for the BUF West Sussex division. Joyce was supported in this role by [[Norah Elam]] as Sussex Women’s Organiser, with her partner Dudley Elam taking on the role of Sub-Branch Officer for [[Worthing]]. Under this regime, [[West Sussex]] was to become a hub of fascist activity, ranging from hosting Blackshirt summer camps to organising meetings and rallies, lunches, etc. Norah Elam shared many speaking platforms with Joyce and worked on propaganda speeches for him. One particular concern for Joyce was the [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Bill]] (passed in 1935), designed to give a measure of autonomy to [[British India|India]], allowing freedom and the development of limited self-government. Joyce harboured a desire to become Viceroy of India should Mosley ever head a BUF government, and is recorded as describing the backers of the bill as "feeble" and "one loathsome, fetid, purulent, tumid mass of hypocrisy, hiding behind Jewish Dictators".&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; McPherson"&gt;{{cite book|last=McPherson|first=Angela|author2=McPherson, Susan|title=Mosley's Old Suffragette – A Biography of Norah Elam|year=2011|url=http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk|isbn=978-1-4466-9967-6|access-date=3 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154415/http://www.oldsuffragette.co.uk/|archive-date=13 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce was sacked from his paid position when Mosley drastically reduced the BUF staff shortly after the 1937 elections, after which Joyce promptly formed a breakaway organisation, the [[National Socialist League]]. After the departure of Joyce, the BUF turned its focus away from anti-Semitism and towards activism, opposing a war with [[Nazi Germany]]. Although Joyce had been deputy leader of the party from 1933 and an effective fighter and orator, Mosley snubbed him in his autobiography and later denounced him as a traitor because of his wartime activities. Unlike Joyce, the Elams did not escape detention under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]; both were arrested on the same day as Mosley in May 1940. The relationship between Joyce and Norah Elam was evidence of the strange bedfellows that politics can bring together. Elam's father had been an Irish nationalist, while Joyce had been a Unionist and supporter of the [[Black and Tans]]. In later life, Elam reported that although she disliked Joyce, she believed that his execution by the British in 1946 was wrong, stating that he should not have been regarded as a traitor to England because he was not English, but Irish.&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; McPherson"/&gt;

==In Germany==
{{Main|Lord Haw-Haw}}

In late August 1939, shortly before war was declared, Joyce and his wife Margaret fled to Germany. Joyce had been tipped off that the British authorities intended to detain him under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. Joyce became a [[naturalised citizen|naturalised]] German citizen in 1940.

In [[Berlin]], Joyce could not find employment until a chance meeting with fellow Mosleyite [[Peter Eckersley (engineer)#Dorothy "Dolly" Clark, later Eckersley|Dorothy Eckersley]] got him an audition at the [[Rundfunkhaus]] ("''broadcasting house''").&lt;ref name="MosNotes8"&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:S5wD7ii-PhEJ:www.8bitmode.com/mosleynotes/mosleynotespt6.pdf+Dorothy+Eckersley&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk 45/25728/244. CAB 98/18. Simpson 135-6. Thurlow, the 'Mosley Papers' and the Secret History of British Fascism 1939–1940], K/L, 175. Reporting statement from the Mail on 14.3.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckersley was the former wife or second wife&lt;ref name="MosNotes8"/&gt; of the Chief Engineer of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Peter Eckersley (engineer)|Peter Eckersley]]. Despite having a heavy cold and almost losing his voice, he was recruited immediately for radio announcements and scriptwriting at German radio's English service. William Joyce replaced [[Wolf Mittler]].

The name "[[Lord Haw-Haw]] of [[Zeesen]]" was coined in 1939 by the [[pseudonym]]ous ''[[Daily Express]]'' radio critic [[Jonah Barrington (journalist)|Jonah Barrington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = J. W. | contribution = William Joyce | page = 80 | title = Famous Trials | volume = 4 | editor1-last = Hodge | editor1-first = James H. | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | publication-date = 1954 | quote = Usually, the inventor of popular nicknames is unidentifiable, but the ‘onlie begetter’ of Lord Haw-Haw was undoubtedly Mr Jonah Barrington, then of the ''Daily Express''…}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this referred initially to Wolf Mittler (or possibly [[Norman Baillie-Stewart]]). When Joyce became the best-known propaganda broadcaster, the nickname was transferred to him. Joyce's broadcasts initially came from studios in Berlin, later transferring (because of heavy [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing) to [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] and finally to [[Apen]] near [[Hamburg]], and were relayed over a network of German-controlled radio stations that included [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Luxembourg]], [[Hilversum]], [[Calais]], [[Oslo]], and Zeesen. Joyce also broadcast on and wrote scripts for, the German Büro Concordia organisation, which ran several [[black propaganda]] stations, many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2584/is_n2_v14/ai_15588719/pg_1 | title = Black propaganda by radio: the German Concordia broadcasts to Britain, 1940–1941 | work = Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television | publisher = Find Articles at BNET.com}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role in writing the scripts increased over time, and the German radio capitalized on his public [[persona]]. Initially an anonymous broadcaster, Joyce eventually revealed his real name to his listeners; and he would occasionally be announced as "William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=nvRNx6YM7LIC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22wolf+mittler%22%22haw-haw%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wolf%20mittler%22%22haw-haw%22&amp;f=false Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the Second World War], Edinburgh University Press, 2000, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urban legend]]s soon circulated about Lord Haw-Haw, alleging that the broadcaster was well-informed about political and military events to the point of near-[[omniscience]].&lt;ref&gt;David Suisman, Susan Strasser, ''Sound in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, pages 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although listening to his broadcasts was officially discouraged (but not illegal), many Britons heard the broadcasts. At the height of his influence, in 1940, Joyce had an estimated six million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1 Axis Sally: The Americans Behind That Alluring Voice], HistoryNet, 23 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcasts always began with the announcer's words, "[[Germany Calling|Germany calling, Germany calling, Germany calling]]". These broadcasts urged the British people to surrender and were well known for their jeering, sarcastic and menacing tone. There was also a desire by civilian listeners to hear what the other side was saying since information during wartime was strictly censored.

The [[Reich Main Security Office]] commissioned Joyce to give lectures at the [[University of Berlin]] for [[SS]] members in the winter of 1941–42 on the topic of "[[British fascism|English fascism]] and acute questions concerning the [[British Empire|British world empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de//gerd.simon/ChrSS-Schulung.pdf University of Tübingen - Chronologie Schulung und Elitebildung im 3. Reich Schwerpunkt: SS ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce recorded his final broadcast on 30 April 1945, during the [[Battle of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyewitnesstohistory.com/vohawhaw.htm |title=The last Broadcast of Lord Haw Haw, 1945 |website=Eyewitnesstohistory.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rambling and audibly drunk,&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt from the broadcast can be heard in the episode on Joyce of the 1990s documentary TV series ''Great Crimes and Trials of the 20th century''.&lt;/ref&gt; he chided Britain for pursuing the war beyond mere containment of Germany and repeatedly warned of the "menace" of the [[Soviet Union]]. He signed off with a final defiant "Heil Hitler and farewell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthstation1.com/WWIIAudio/Germany/HawHaw'sLastBroadcast.mp3|title=Lord Haw Haw’s Last Broadcast|format=MP3|website=Earthstation1.com|accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are conflicting accounts as to whether this last programme was actually transmitted, although a recording was found in the Apen studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/hawhaw/8911.shtml |title=Archive – Lord Haw-Haw – Propaganda Broadcast from Germany &amp;#124; Lord Haw-Haw |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Radio Hamburg was seized by British forces, and on 4&amp;nbsp;May [[Wynford Vaughan-Thomas]] used it to make a mock "Germany Calling" broadcast denouncing Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02f847t|title=Mock ‘German Calling’ broadcast|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides broadcasting, Joyce's duties included writing propaganda for distribution among British [[prisoners of war]], whom he tried to recruit into the [[British Free Corps]]. He wrote a book ''Twilight Over England'' promoted by the [[Propagandaministerium|German Ministry of Propaganda]], which unfavourably compared the evils of allegedly Jewish-dominated capitalist Britain with the alleged wonders of [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist]] Germany. [[Adolf Hitler]] awarded Joyce the [[War Merit Cross]] (First and Second Class) for his broadcasts, although they never met.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

On 5 May 1945, four days after the Allies took Hamburg, CBS war correspondent [[Bill Downs]] broadcast a report about the condition of that city using Joyce's microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downs|first=Bill|title=CBS Radio broadcast by Bill Downs in Hamburg on 5 May 1945|url=http://billdownscbs.blogspot.com/2013/04/cbs-radio-broadcast-by-bill-downs-in.html|website=Billdownscbs.blogspot.com|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scripts and the microphone used by Joyce were then seized by soldier Cyril Millwood and have now come to light following Millwood's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1209142/Microphone-used-Lord-Haw-Haw-broadcast-Nazi-propaganda-UK-goes-sale.html|title=Microphone used by Nazi traitor Lord Haw Haw to broadcast propaganda found 64 years after he was hanged for treason|work=Daily Mail|location=UK|date=26 August 2009|accessdate=10 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}}

==Capture and trial==
{{moresources|section|date=May 2017}}
On 28 May 1945, Joyce was captured by British forces at [[Flensburg]], near the German border with Denmark, which was the last capital of the Third Reich. Spotting a dishevelled figure while resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers – including a Jewish German, Geoffrey Perry (born Horst Pinschewer), who had left Germany before the war – engaged him in conversation in French and English. After they asked whether he was Joyce, he reached into his pocket (actually reaching for a false passport); believing he was armed, they shot him through the [[buttocks]], resulting in four wounds.&lt;ref name="Farndale"/&gt;

Two intelligence officers then drove him to a border post and handed him to British military police.  Joyce was then taken to London and tried at the [[Old Bailey]] on three counts of [[high treason]]:

|align=center}}

"Not guilty" were the first words from Joyce's mouth in his trial, as noted by [[Rebecca West]] in her book ''The Meaning of Treason'' (as noted by [[Whittaker Chambers]] in his 1947 review of that book).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During the processing of the charges Joyce's American nationality came to light, and it seemed that he would have to be acquitted, based upon a lack of jurisdiction; he could not be convicted of betraying a country that was not his own. He was acquitted of the first and second charges.{{cn|date=May 2017}} However, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross|Sir Hartley Shawcross]], successfully argued that Joyce's possession of a British passport, even though he had misstated his nationality to get it, entitled him (until it expired) to British [[diplomatic protection]] in Germany and therefore he owed [[allegiance]] to the King at the time he commenced working for the Germans. It was on this basis that Joyce was convicted of the third charge and sentenced to death on 19 September 1945.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The historian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] remarked, in his book ''English History 1914–1945,'' that "Technically, Joyce was hanged for making a false statement when applying for a passport, the usual penalty for which is a small fine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

His conviction was upheld by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on 1 November 1945, and by Lords [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt|Jowitt L.C.]], [[Hugh Macmillan|Macmillan]], [[Robert Wright, Baron Wright|Wright]], [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Simonds]], and [[Samuel Porter, Baron Porter|Porter]] – although Porter dissented – of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] on 13 December 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniset.ca/nold/1946AC347.pdf|title=Document|website=Uniset.ca|format=PDF|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniset.ca/other/cs3/joyce.html|title=Joyce v. D.P.P.|website=Uniset.ca|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the appeal, Joyce argued that possession of a passport did not entitle him to the protection of the Crown, and therefore did not perpetuate his duty of allegiance once he left the country, but the House rejected this argument. [[Samuel Porter, Baron Porter|Lord Porter]]'s dissenting opinion assumed that the question as to whether Joyce's duty of allegiance had terminated was a question of fact for the jury to decide, rather than a purely legal question for the judge. Joyce also argued that jurisdiction had been wrongly assumed by the court in electing to try an alien for offences committed in a foreign country. This argument was also rejected, on the basis that a state may exercise such jurisdiction in the interests of its own security. 

Joyce's biographer [[Nigel Farndale]] suggests on the basis of documents made public for the first time between 2000 and 2005 that Joyce made a deal with his prosecutors not to reveal links he had had to [[MI5]]. In return, his wife Margaret, known to radio listeners as "Lady Haw-Haw", was spared prosecution for high treason.&lt;ref name="Farndale"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nigel Farndale|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3641790/Love-and-treachery.html|title=Love and treachery|publisher=Telegraph|date=9 May 2005|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haw-Haw: The Tragedy of William and Margaret Joyce|first=Nigel|last=Farndale|publisher=Macmillan|date=2005|isbn=978-0333989920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 32 British renegades and broadcasters caught in Germany at the end of the war, only Margaret Joyce, who died in London in 1972, was not charged with treason.&lt;ref name="Farndale"/&gt;

==Execution==
Joyce went to his death unrepentant:{{quote|In death as in life, I defy the Jews who caused this last war, and I defy the power of darkness which they represent. I warn the British people against the crushing imperialism of the Soviet Union. May Britain be great once again and in the hour of the greatest danger in the West may the standard be raised from the dust, crowned with the words&amp;nbsp;– "You have conquered nevertheless".

Joyce was executed on 3 January 1946 at [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth Prison]], aged 39. He was the next to last person to be hanged for a crime other than murder in the United Kingdom. The last was [[Theodore Schurch]], executed for [[Treachery Act 1940|treachery]] the following day at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In both cases the hangman was [[Albert Pierrepoint]].

As was customary for executed criminals, Joyce's remains were buried in an [[unmarked grave]] within the walls of HMP Wandsworth. In 1976 they were exhumed and reinterred in the Protestant section of the New Cemetery in [[Bohermore]], [[Galway]], Ireland. A Roman Catholic [[Tridentine Mass]] was celebrated at his reburial.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Joyce had two daughters by his first wife, Hazel, who later married [[Oswald Mosley]]'s bodyguard, Eric Piercey. One daughter, Heather Iandolo (formerly Piercey: stepfather's surname) has spoken publicly of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beckett|first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Beckett|url=https://www.theguardian.com/secondworldwar/story/0,14058,1657724,00.html|title='My father was a traitor but he was kind and loving to me'|work=The Guardian|date=5 December 2005|access-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The Yellow Wasps paramilitary unit was allegedly formed on 12 April 1992 by Brana Grujić, president of the Zvornik [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serbian Democratic Party]] (SDS), and a man known as Marko Pavlović, commander of the Zvornik Territorial Defense unit (TO), at a session of the Zvornik municipal assembly.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Consisting of about seventy men, the unit was commanded by Vojin Vučković, nicknamed "Žućo", born in 1962, an electrician from the town of [[Umka]], near [[Belgrade]], martial arts expert and former coach of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Serbian Interior Ministry]] judo team.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"&gt;{{cite web|title=War Crimes Trials in the Former Yugoslavia|at=sec.

During the ICTY trial of [[Momčilo Krajišnik]] evidence was given that Marko Pavlović was an intelligence officer named Branislav "Branko" Popović, a major with the Zvornik Brigade of the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] who subsequently transferred to the [[Serbian army]].&lt;ref&gt;Witness 682 evidence to the Krajisnik trial, 21 July 2005, ICTY Case  IT-00-39-T, p. 16861 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krajisnik/trans/en/050721ED.htm]. Retrieved 2 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Yellow Wasps" paramilitary group was one of three paramilitary groups responsible for the "ethnic cleansing" and looting of Zvornik. They targeted not just Bosniaks, but anyone rich, including Serbs.  They captured the Serbian mayor of Zvornik and tried to take control of the town using weapons from the territorial defence force. The Bosnian Serbs arrested them and sent them back to [[Serbia]], but they soon returned.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

==War crimes==
The village of [[Divič]], on the left bank of the river [[Drina]], near Zvornik, was one of the first Bosnian towns to be ethnically cleansed of its Bosniak population of about 3000.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

On 26 May 1992, the Bosniak residents were transferred out of the village on buses and kept overnight in Zvornik. The next day the women and children were driven to the Bosnian government-controlled city of Tuzla. The able-bodied men (a total of 180) were initially detained in the Drina stadium before being taken to makeshift prison in a former office building. Two days later on 29 May most of the men were transferred to the Dom Kultura community centre in Čelopek, others disappeared.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

On 10 June 1992, Dušan Vučković and ten other soldiers visited the Dom Kultura. They forced fathers to commit sexual assaults on their sons and beat to death or shot a total of fifteen prisoners. Survivors were given ten minutes to clean the blood, prisoners ordered to carry out the bodies were not seen again. Subsequently, Vučković and his companions visited Čelopek almost every night to beat, torture and kill prisoners. On 27 June 1992, Vučković fired a machine gun at prisoners at random, killing twenty-five. The prison was closed two days later, and eighty-four survivors were transferred via Zvornik to the [[Batković concentration camp]], near [[Bijeljina]].&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

==Arrests and trials==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2015}}
In August 1992 about seventy Yellow Wasp members were arrested and accused of robbing and murdering Serbian and Bosniak civilians. They were detained in Bijeljina, where they were allegedly beaten and forced to sign confessions extracted under torture. They were transferred to Serbia before being released. Subsequently, the Vučković brothers were arrested by the Serbian Interior Ministry on 5 November 1993 and indicted on 28 April 1994.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt; Duško was charged with killing sixteen civilians and wounding another twenty in June 1992, reportedly cutting off a civilian's ear, and for raping and robbing a Bosniak woman in the village of [[Radalj]], near [[Mali Zvornik]] in Serbia (allowing the case to be tried in Serbia). Vojin Vučković was charged with illegal possession of arms and falsely identifying himself as a police officer. The indictment stated that the brothers had volunteered to help the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war erupted.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

During the trial Vojin Vučković denied involvement in the crimes to which he had confessed, claiming that he had been forced to sign a confession because he feared that the secret police would kill his family. He claimed to have been dismissed from the army after about two months, diagnosed as "a psychopath and an alcoholic," and been treated for alcoholism and drug abuse.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt; Vučković boasted about connections in the Serbian Interior Ministry, was proud of his unit's military achievements in and around Zvornik, and said that his brother, who had obeyed his orders in the field, was an example to other soldiers.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

According to a [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Helsinki Watch]] researcher, the prosecutor's questions were formulated to elicit answers that supported the defense. The prosecution's witnesses, two members of the Yellow Wasps, revealed nothing about the crimes but praised Vojin and Dušan's soldiery. Implied Serbian government involvement in the crimes was not pursued.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt; The prosecution failed to present evidence of wrongdoing, witnesses did not appear, a judge allegedly showed inappropriate support towards the Vučković brothers, guards offered the brothers cigarettes, and on the third day of the trial, defense lawyers announced that Vučković had already been tried and found not guilty by a military court in [[Banja Luka]] for war crimes allegedly perpetrated in Bijeljina. The court was dismissed, the presiding judge fell ill, and the trial was then postponed indefinitely.&lt;ref name="TSP/HRW"/&gt;

In July 1996 the Vučković brothers were tried again and Duško Vučković was sentenced to seven years in prison. After an appeal, two years later the [[Supreme Court of Serbia]] sentenced Duško Vučković to ten years in prison for a war crime against civilian population and a rape, and Vojin Vučković to four months in prison for illegal possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives.&lt;ref name="NIN, 12.7.2001"/&gt;

At trial Duško Vučković admitted he had been a member of the [[Serb Radical Party]] (SRS). He said that he joined the SRS because no one else would have taken him because of his mental health problems.  He had made plans to go to the frontline with SRS colleagues Zoran Dražilović, Ljubiša Petković and Zoran Rankić and received military training under supervision of Rankic and his brother. He had been arrested on 15 April 1992 after an incident in Zvornik but was released a few days later thanks to the efforts of the president of the SRS in [[Loznica]] and a lawyer hired by the party.&lt;ref name="NIN, 12.7.2001"/&gt;

In November 2005 Branko Grujić and Branko Popović, and four of the "Yellow Wasps", Dragan Slavković, Ivan Korać, Siniša Filipović and Dragutin Dragićević, were accused of murdering at least 22 and forcefully deporting 1,822 Bosniak civilians from the Zvornik municipality were charged by the War Crimes Chamber of the Belgrade District Court with murder, torture and forcible movement of Zvornik Bosniaks in the period between May and June 1992. The so-called "Zvornik Group" were specifically accused of having expelled more than 1,200 Bosniaks from the villages of Kozluk and Skočić  on 26 June 1992. Grujić, Popović and the other four pleaded not guilty. Duško Vučković, who would otherwise have been charged with the same crimes had died suddenly the week before in a detention cell in Belgrade District Prison. The trial was the first war crime trial transferred to the Serbian War Crimes Chamber by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kovacevic appeal, Simic transfer, Zvornik trial, Kadijevic warrant and Bralo appeal|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/kovacevic-appeal-simic-transfer-zvornik-trial-kadijevic-warrant-and-bralo-appeal|newspaper=Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting|date=2 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First hearing in Zvornik Group trial in Belgrade|url=http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/521.html|newspaper=Human Rights House|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the trial in 2008 former Yellow Wasp member [http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=47302 Miroslav Nikolić] testified that the unit under Vojin Vučković's command had been responsible for the village of Kozluk.  After a period away from the unit Nikolić returned to find Kozluk deserted. Grujić and Popović were also accused of knowing about but doing nothing to prevent Yellow Wasp members killing at least 19 Bosniaks from Divič inside the Dom Kultura in Čelopek and at least three others in the Ekonomija and Ciglana districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-paramilitary testifies at Zvornik trial|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=47302|newspaper=B92|date=29 January 2008|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125328/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=47302|archive-date=6 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
