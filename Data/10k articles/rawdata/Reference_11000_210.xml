'''81st Street–Museum of Natural History''' is a local [[metro station|station]] on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] of the [[New York City Subway]]. It is served by the '''[[B (New York City Subway service)|B]]''' on weekdays, the '''[[C (New York City Subway service)|C]]''' train at all times except nights, and the '''[[A (New York City Subway service)|A]]''' train during late nights only.

==History==
This station opened on September 10, 1932 as part of the opening of the first city-owned subway line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line. On this date, the line opened from [[Chambers Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] north to [[Inwood–207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|207th Street]].&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Opening"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/09/10/100849529.pdf|title=Gay Midnight Crowd Rides First Trains In The New Subway: Throngs at Station an Hour Before Time, Rush Turnstiles When Chains are Dropped|last1=Crowell|first1=Paul|date=September 10, 1932|work=|accessdate=November 8, 2015|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the whole line cost $191,200,000. While the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] already provided parallel service, the new Eighth Avenue subway via Central Park West provided an alternative route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/09/09/archives/new-line-first-unit-in-citywide-system-8th-av-tube-to-ease-west.html|title=NEW LINE FIRST UNIT IN CITY-WIDE SYSTEM; 8th Av.

The station was renovated in 1998–2000, in coordination with building the new [[Rose Center for Earth and Space#Hayden Planetarium|Hayden Planetarium]], within the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]].&lt;ref name="Siegal 1998"&gt;{{cite web | last=Siegal | first=Nina | title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE/UPPER MANHATTAN; At This Stop, B and C Spell Walk | website=The New York Times | date=September 13, 1998 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/13/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-upper-manhattan-this-stop-b-c-spell-walk.html | accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floors were replaced, new lighting installed, the token booth upgraded, and the walls and staircases re-tiled.

This underground station has four tracks and two [[side platform]]s. On this section of the line, the local tracks are stacked, uptown above downtown, and the express tracks are stacked in the same order to the east of them, so both platforms are on the west side, one above the other. The station is at [[Central Park West]] and 81st Street, rather than the major crosstown [[79th Street (Manhattan)|79th Street]], in order to accommodate the [[American Museum of Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Museum of Natural History | website=[[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]] | date=May 1, 2014 | url=http://www.amnh.org/ | accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which largely fills the area of what was once called the Manhattan Square. The 79th Street Transverse Road, through [[Central Park]], exits the park here.

South of this station are storage/lay up tracks between the local and express tracks on each level. Both ends of the tracks merge with the express tracks, with switches to the local tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://images.nycsubway.org/trackmap/pm_west_1.png| title=NYC Subway Track Map (Midtown Manhattan) (Zoom to section by clicking)| work=www.nycsubway.org| accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NYCS const|trackref|468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exits===
There are two fare control areas, both on the upper platform. One is at the station's extreme south end, on Central Park West midblock between 77th and 81st Streets.&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Upper West Side|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M13_upper_west_side_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=December 30, 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this fare control, a passageway leads to a staircase on the west side of Central Park West, just south of the American Museum of Natural History's front entrance.&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015/&gt; This fare control also has an underground entrance directly into the museum's lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Directions and Transportation | website=[[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]] | date=May 1, 2014 | url=http://www.amnh.org/plan-your-visit/visitor-information/directions-and-transportation | accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is at the station's north end, at Central Park West and West 81st Street. Two staircases lead to either western corner of the intersection (one to each corner).&lt;ref name=MTAMaps-2015/&gt;

==Artwork==
[[File:81 Street wall vc.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dinosaur artwork on one of the station walls]]
In 1976, with funding from the [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Corporation]], this station, as well as three others citywide, received new "artfully humorous graffiti" murals and artwork.&lt;ref name="Burks 1976"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/18/archives/a-subway-elongatomus-why-its-preposterous.html|title=A Subway Elongatomus? Why, It's Preposterous!|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=November 18, 1976|website=The New York Times|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local designer Mayers and Schiff received $5,000 to add murals of dinosaurs such as "Thesaurus Rex, the dinosaur that had a vocabulary of a thousand words" and "Elongatomus, an elongated critter that stretched from coast to coast whose pelvic remains support a highway interchange in Missouri."&lt;ref name="Burks 1976" /&gt;

As part of the 1998–2000 station renovation, a program of tile [[mosaic]]s was undertaken, covering the stairs and platforms, extending to floor inlays. Stairwells evoke descending into the geological [[Stratum|strata]] of the [[Earth]] (at 81st Street) or into the [[Ocean]] (79th Street). Many creatures are evoked in mosaic vignettes that punctuate the stretches of white tiled wall. Fossil casts seem to emerge from the tiles as though the subway platform itself were an excavation, which it actually is.&lt;ref name="MTA-ArtsDesign"/&gt; Under the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA)'s [[MTA Arts &amp; Design|Arts for Transit]] program, a mixed-media installation was created in 2000.&lt;ref name="Siegal 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTA-ArtsDesign"&gt;{{cite web | title= 81st Street-Museum of Natural History: ARTS FOR TRANSIT COLLABORATIVE: For Want of a Nail, 2000 | website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] | url=http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&amp;line=B&amp;station=4&amp;xdev=250 | accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MTA-ReviewAC-2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.amnh.org/museum/subway/release.html| title=81st Street Museum of Natural History Station Reopening| work=[[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]]| accessdate=November 11, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926213506/http://www.amnh.org/museum/subway/release.html| archive-date=September 26, 2011| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled [[For Want of a Nail (proverb)|"For Want of a Nail"]],&lt;ref name=MTA-ReviewAC-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of the A and C Lines|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/AC_LineReview.pdf|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=January 19, 2016|date=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the old proverb, it addresses the interconnections of entities that are as vast as a galaxy and as small as a single cell. Using ceramic tile, glass tile, glass mosaic, bronze relief, and granite as primary materials, the design team depicted the evolution of extinct, existing and endangered life forms, from [[Microorganism|single celled organisms]] to the towering ''[[Tyrannosaurus|T. rex]]'' dinosaur.&lt;ref name="MTA-ArtsDesign"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-SteppingOff/&gt; It shows images and symbols ranging from the Earth's core, to the sea, the sky and the cosmos beyond.

==Examples==
A number of sources provide lists of initialisms and acronyms commonly used in health care.

{{About|the Islamic call to prayer|the settlement in [[Ras al-Khaimah]]|Adhan, Ras al-Khaimah}}
{{Islam}}

The '''''adhan''''', '''''athan''''', or '''''azaan''''' ({{lang-ar|أَذَان}} {{IPA-ar|ʔaˈðaːn|}}) (also called in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Ezan'')&lt;ref&gt;Nathal M. Dessing ''Rituals of Birth, Circumcision, Marriage, and Death Among Muslims in the Netherlands'' Peeters Publishers 2001 {{ISBN|978-9-042-91059-1}} page 25&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Islam]]ic call to [[Islamic Prayer|worship]], recited by the ''[[muezzin]]'' at prescribed times of the day. The root of the word is ''ʾadhina'' {{lang|ar|أَذِنَ}} meaning "to listen, to hear, be informed about". Another derivative of this word is ''ʾudhun'' ({{lang|ar|أُذُن}}), meaning "ear".

''Adhan'' is called out by a ''[[muezzin]]'' from the [[mosque]] five times a day, traditionally from the [[minaret]], summoning [[Muslim]]s for mandatory (''[[fard]]'') worship (''[[salat]]''). A second call, known as ''[[iqama]]'', (set up) then summons Muslims to line up for the beginning of the prayers. The main purpose behind the multiple loud pronouncements of ''adhan'' in every mosque is to make available to everyone an easily intelligible summary of Islamic belief.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  In modern times, [[Loudspeakers in mosques|loudspeakers]] have been installed on minarets for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The ''adhan'' recites the ''[[Takbir]]'' (God is great)&lt;ref&gt;H Azodanloo (1992), Formalization of Friday sermons and consolidation of the Islamic republic of Iran, Journal of Critical Studies of Iran &amp; the Middle East, 1(1), 12-24&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the ''[[Shahada]]'' (There is no god&lt;!--Please do not change to "deity", without discussing it on talk page and providing verifiable peer reviewed scholarly sources, see [[WP:RS]] --&gt; but God&lt;!--Please do not change to "Allah", without discssion on talk page and providing scholarly sources, see [[WP:RS]] --&gt;, Muhammad is the messenger of God).&lt;ref&gt;N Mohammad (1985), The doctrine of jihad: An introduction, Journal of Law and Religion, 3(2): 381-397&lt;/ref&gt; This statement of faith, called the ''[[Kalimah]]'', is the first of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]].

==Muezzin==
[[File:Adhan in Shalqar mosque.webm|thumb|265px|Adhan in [[:ru:Мечеть имени Матея Коканулы|Matey Qoqanuly mosque]] ([[Shalkar]], [[Kazakhstan]].]]
The [[muezzin]] ({{lang-ar|مُؤَذِّن|links=no}}''mu'aḏḏin'')–is the person who recites the ''adhan''&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|470}} from the [[mosque]]. Typically in modern times, this is done using a microphone: a recitation that is consequently broadcast to the speakers usually mounted on the higher part of the mosque's minarets, thus calling those nearby to prayer. The message can also be recorded, as is the case for [[London Central Mosque]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The muezzin is chosen for his talent and ability in reciting the ''adhan'' beautifully, melodiously and loudly for all Muslims to hear. This is one of the important duties in the mosque, as his companions and community rely on him in his call for Muslims to come to pray in congregation.{{weasel-inline|date=March 2018}} The Imam leads the prayer five times a day. The first muezzin in Islam was [[Bilal ibn Rabah]], a freed slave of [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Muir]], ''The Life of Mohammad from Original Sources'', reprinted by Adamant Media {{ISBN|1-4021-8272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}

===Sunni view===
[[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] state that the adhan was not written or said by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, but by one of his ''[[Sahaba]]h'' (his companions). [[Umar]], a prominent sahabi of Muhammad, had a vision in his dream, in which the call for prayers was revealed to him by God. He later related this to his companions. Meanwhile, this news reached Muhammad, and he liked it and confirmed it. Because of his stunning voice Muhammad chose a freed [[Habesha people|Habeshan]] slave by the name of [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] to make the call for prayers. Muhammad preferred the call better than the use of [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] (as used by the [[Christian]]s) and [[shofar|horns]] (as by the [[Jews]]).&lt;ref name="Sunan Abu Dawood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunan al-Tirmidhi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |authorlink=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=The Life of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&amp;pg=PA200 |accessdate= |publisher= |location= |isbn= 9789839154177|page=200|date=May 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]] ''(Salat Al Jumu'ah)'', there is one adhan but some Sunni Muslims increase it to two adhans; the first is to call the people to the mosque, the second is said before the Imam begins the ''[[khutbah]]'' ([[sermon]]). Just before the prayers start, someone amongst the praying people recites the ''iqama'' as in all prayers. The basis for this is that at the time of the [[Caliph]] Uthman he ordered two adhans to be made, the first of which was to be made in the marketplace to inform the people that the Friday prayer was soon to begin, and the second adhan would be the regular one held in the mosque. Not all Sunnis prefer two adhans as the need for warning the people of the impending time for prayer is no longer essential now that the times for prayers are well known.

===Shi'a view===
[[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] sources state Muhammad, according to God's command, ordered the adhan as a means of calling Muslims to prayer. Shi'a Islam teaches that no one else contributed, or had any authority to contribute, towards the composition of the adhan.&lt;ref name="Sunan Abu Dawood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunan al-Tirmidhi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quran 1"/&gt;

Other Shi'a sources state that [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] was, in fact, the first person to recite the adhan publicly out loud in front of the Muslim congregation.

The fundamental phrase ''lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh'' is the foundation stone of Islam along with the belief in it. It declares that "there is no god but the God". This is the confession of ''[[Tawhid]]'' or the "doctrine of Oneness [of God]".

The phrase ''Muḥammadun rasūlu llāh'' fulfills the requirement that there should be someone to guide in the name of God, which states Muhammad is God's Messenger,''rasūl'', ''[[Prophets of Islam|nabi]]'' ([[prophet]]). This is the acceptance of prophethood or ''Nabuwat'' of Muhammad.
[[File:Kalema at Bab al Nasr, Fatimid Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|photo of ''kalima'' at [[Bab al-Futuh|Bab al-Nasr]] of [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo with phrase '''ʿalīyun walī allāh''' ]]
[[File:Kalema-tut-shahadat.jpg|thumb|The [[qibla]]h of [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah|Mustansir]] of [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of, in [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] of Cairo showing [[shahada|Kalimat ash-shahādah]] with the phrase ''ʿalīyun walī llāh'' ]]
Muhammad declared [[Ali]] (Ali bin Abu Talib) [[Succession to Muhammad|as his successor]], at [[Wadi Rabigh|Ghadir Khumm]], which was required for the continuation of his guidance. According to the [[hadith of the pond of Khumm]], Muhammad stated that "Of whomsoever I am the [[mawla]], Ali is his mawla". Hence, it is recommended to recite the phrase ''ʿalīyun walī llāh'' means "Ali is His (God's) ''[[Wali]]'' "the headman."

In one of the [[Qibla]]h of [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] (1035–1094) of Fatemi era masjid of Qahira ([[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]) engraved his name and ''[[shahada|kalimat ash-shahādah]]'' as ''lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh, muḥammadun rasūlu llāh, ʿalīyun walī llāh''.

Adhan reminds Muslims of these three Islamic teaching ''Tawhid'', ''Nabuwat'' and ''[[Imamate]]'' before each prayer. These three emphasise devotion to God, Muhammad and [[Imam]], which are considered to be so linked together that they can not be viewed separately; one leads to other and finally to God.

The phrase is optional to some Shia as justified above. They feel that Ali's ''Valayat'' is self-evident, a testification and need not be declared. However, the greatness of God is also taken to be self-evident, but Muslims still declare ''Allāhu ʾakbar'' to publicize their faith. This is the reason that the most Shia give for the recitation of the phrase regarding Ali.

==Dua (invocation)==

===What to recite during Adhan (call to prayer)===
While listening to the adhan, Muslims repeat the same words silently, except when the muezzin says:" حي على الصلاة or حي على الفلاح " (''ḥayya ʿalā ṣ-ṣalāh or ḥayya ʿala l-falāḥ'')&lt;ref&gt;Muwatta&lt;/ref&gt; they silently say:" لا حولا و لا قوة إلا بالله " (''lā ḥawla wa lā quwata ʾillā bi-llāh'') (there is no strength or power except from God).&lt;ref&gt;Sahîh Al-Bukhari #548&lt;/ref&gt;

===What to recite after Adhan===
Immediately following the Adhan, Muslims recite the following [[dua]] (supplications):

1. {{script/Arabic|ﻭَﺃَﻧَﺎ ﺃَﺷْﻬَﺪُ ﺃَﻥْ ﻟَﺎ ﺇِﻟَﻪَ ﺇِﻟَّﺎ ﺍﻟﻠﻪُ ﻭَﺣْﺪَﻩُ ﻟَﺎ ﺷَﺮِﻳﻚَ ﻟَﻪُ ﻭَﺃَﻥَّ ﻣُﺤَﻤَّﺪﺍً ﻋَﺒْﺪُﻩُ ﻭَﺭَﺳُﻮﻟُﻪُ، ﺭَﺿِﻴﺖُ ﺑِﺎﻟﻠﻪِ ﺭَﺑَّﺎً ﻭَﺑِﻤُﺤَﻤَّﺪٍ ﺭِﺳُﻮﻻً ﻭَﺑِﺎﻹِْﺳﻼَﻡِ ﺩِﻳﻨﺎً}} ".

Wa ʾanaa ʾašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāhu waḥdahu lā šarīka lahu wa-ʾanna muḥammadan ʿabduhu wa-rasūluhu, raḍītu bi-llāhi rabban wa-bi-muḥammadin rasūlan wa-bi-lʾislāmi dīnan.&lt;ref&gt;Sahîh Muslim 386&lt;/ref&gt;

English: I bear witness that there is no god but God alone with no partner and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and the Lord God's chosen messenger is Muhammad and Islam is his religion.

2. An invocation of blessings on Muhammad:

ﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺻــﻞ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻭ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺁﻝ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ، ﻛﻤﺎ ﺻﻠﻴﺖ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﻭ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺁﻝ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﺍﻧﻚ ﺣَﻤِﻴﺪٌ ﻣَجيد. ﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺑﺎﺭﻙ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻭ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺁﻝ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﻛﻤﺎ ﺑﺎﺭﻛﺖ ﻋﻠٰﯽ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﻭ ﻋﻠﻰ ﺁﻝ ﺇﺑﺮﺍﻫﻴﻢ ﺍﻧﻚ ﺣﻤﻴﺪ ﻣﺠﻴﺪ

''Allāhumma ṣalli ʿalā muḥammadin wa ʿalā ʾaali muḥammadin, kamā ṣallayta ʿalā ʾibrāhīma wa ʿalā ʾaali ʾibrāhīma innaka ḥamīdun maǧīd. Allāhumma bārik ʿalā muḥammadin wa ʿalā ʾaali muḥammadin kamā bārakta ʿalā ʾibrāhīma wa ʿalā ʾaali ʾibrāhīma innaka ḥamīdun maǧīd.''&lt;ref&gt;Sahîh Al-Bukhari 3370
&lt;/ref&gt;

3. [[Muhammad]]'s name is invoked requested:

،ﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺭﺏ ﻫﺬﻩ ﺍﻟﺪﻋﻮﺓ ﺍﻟﺘﺎﻣﺔ ﻭﺍﻟﺼﻼﺓ ﺍﻟﻘﺎﺋﻤﺔ
ﺁﺕ ﻣﺤﻤﺪﺍ ﺍﻟﻮﺳﻴﻠﺔ ﻭﺍﻟﻔﻀﻴﻠﺔ ﻭﺍﺑﻌﺜﻪ ﺍﻟﻤﻘﺎﻡ ﺍﻟﻤﺤﻤﻮﺩ ﺍﻟﺬﻱ ﻭﻋﺪﺗﻪ

''Allāhumma rabba haḍihi d-daʿawati t-tammah wa-ṣ-ṣalāti l-qaʾimah, ʾāti muḥammadan al-wasīlata wa-l-faḍīlah wa-bʿaṯhu l-maqalam al-maḥmūdan illaḍī waʿadtah''&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari 588
&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Dua are then made directly to God, between the adhan and the iqamaah.

According to Abu Dawud, Muhammad said: "Repeat the words of the muezzin and when you finish, ask God what you want and you will get it".&lt;ref&gt;Abu Dawud 524
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
Each [[phrase (music)|phrase]] is followed by a longer [[rest (music)|pause]] and is repeated one or more times according to fixed rules. During the first [[sentence (linguistics)|statement]] each phrase is limited in [[Range (music)|tonal range]], less [[melisma]]tic, and shorter. Upon [[Repetition (music)|repetition]] the phrase is longer, [[Ornament (music)|ornament]]ed with melismas, and may possess a tonal range of over an [[octave]].

The [[tempo]] is mostly slow; it may be faster and with fewer melismas for the sunset prayer. During festivals, it may be performed [[antiphon]]ally as a [[duet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Habib Hassan Touma|Touma, Habib Hassan]] (1996). ''The Music of the Arabs'', p.157-158, trans. Laurie Schwartz.

===Turkey===
As an extension of the [[Atatürk's Reforms|reforms]] brought about by the establishment of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish government]] at the time, encouraged by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]], introduced secularism to Turkey. &lt;!-- As he declared the speech in opening ceremony of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] on November 1, 1937, ''bizim devlet idaresindeki ana programımız, chp programıdır. bunun kapsadığı prensipler, idarede ve siyasette bizi aydınlatıcı ana hatlardır. fakat bu prensipleri, gökten indiği sanılan kitapların dogmalarıyla asla bir tutmamalıdır. biz, ilhamlarımızı gökten ve gaipten değil, doğrudan doğruya hayattan almış bulunuyoruz.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/tarihce/ataturk_konusma/01_11_1937.pdf TBMM]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The program involved implementing a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] adhan program as part of its goals, as opposed to the conventional [[Arabic language|Arabic]] call to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/ArtCulture/2004/01/article01.shtml The Adhan in Turkey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412072422/http://www.islamonline.net/english/ArtCulture/2004/01/article01.shtml |date=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of said debates, the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]] (Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı) released an official mandate on July 18, 1932, announcing the decision to all the mosques across Turkey, and the practice was continued for a period of 18 years.

=== Turkish National Anthem ===
The adhan is mentioned in the eighth verse of [[İstiklâl Marşı]], the Turkish [[national anthem]]:

{{quote|O glorious God, the sole wish of my soul is that,&lt;br /&gt;No heathen's hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples.&lt;br /&gt;These adhans, whose [[shahadah]]s are the foundations of my [[Dīn]] ''(religion),''&lt;br /&gt;May their noble sound last loud and wide over my eternal homeland.}}

=== "The Armed Man" ===
The adhan appears in [[The Armed Man|"The Armed Man: A Mass For Peace"]] composed by [[Karl Jenkins]].

The '''Adra massacre''' was the killing of at least 32 [[Alawites|Alawite]], [[Christianity in Syria|Christian]], [[Druze]] and [[Ismailism|Ismailite]] civilians in the industrial town of [[Adra, Syria]] in December 2013, during the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=barrel/&gt; According to the government and activists it was conducted by the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name=pottsmerc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20131213/syrian-troops-launch-offensive-after-dozens-killed|title=Syrian troops launch offensive after dozens killed|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] condemned massacres in Syria and condemned 'the latest report of a massacre of civilians in Adra.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/218664.htm|title=Civilian Massacres in Syria|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December, the rebel [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]], Jaish al-Islam&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25370803&lt;/ref&gt; and Al-Nusra Front groups&lt;ref name=alawiteanddruze&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/12/12/syria-crisis-adra-idINDEE9BB0AR20131212 Islamists kill 15 Alawite and Druze civilians in Syria -activists] ''Reuters''. 12 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; infiltrated the industrial area of the town of Adra, northeast of [[Damascus]], attacking buildings housing workers and their families.

'''AeDES''' (Agibilità e Danno nell'Emergenza Sismica) is a printed Rapid Post-Earthquake Damage Evaluation form, from [[GDNT]] (Italian national seismic protection group). It is used by [[Italians|Italian]] qualified [[civil engineers]] to assess the structural damages of buildings after an [[earthquake]].
The AeDES Form is used from the civil protection technical staff since June 1998 to survey damages in the after-shock. The form has 9 sections. This tool allows for the definition of the conformity or non-conformity of a building. 
The form is scanned and digitized for further evaluations. Information about position of the building, classification, material, structural typology, damage of the current event and previous damages are object of this form.

The '''Babylonian astronomical diaries''' are a collection of [[Babylonia]]n [[cuneiform]] texts that contain systematic records of astronomical observations and political events as well as predictions, based on astronomical observations. They also include other information such as commodity prices for particular dates and weather reports.&lt;ref name=mjg&gt;{{cite journal|title=Babylonian Astronomical Diaries and Corrections of Diodorus|first=M. J.|last=Geller|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=53|issue=1|year=1990|pages=1–7|jstor=618964|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00021212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frh&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Babylonian Astronomical Diaries|first=F.|last=Rochberg-Halton|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=111|issue=2|year=1991|pages=323–332|jstor=604022|doi=10.2307/604022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, they are stored in the [[British Museum]].

It is suggested that the diaries were used as sources for the [[Babylonian Chronicles]].

==History==
The Babylonians were the first to recognize that astronomical phenomena are periodic and to apply mathematics to their predictions. The oldest known significant astronomical text is Tablet 63 of the ''[[Enûma Anu Enlil]]'' collection, the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], which lists the first and the last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years. It is the earliest evidence that planetary phenomena were recognised as periodic.

The systematic records of ominous phenomena in astronomical diaries began  during the reign of [[Nabonassar]] (747–734 BC), when a significant increase in the quality and frequency of astronomical observations occurred. That allowed, for example, the discovery of a repeating 18-year [[Saros cycle]] of lunar eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Saros Cycle Dates and Related Babylonian Astronomical Texts|author=A.

In [[Italian folklore]], '''Befana''' ({{IPA-it|beˈfaːna|pron}}) is an old woman who delivers gifts to children throughout Italy on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany Eve]] (the night of January 5)&lt;!-- Epiphany Eve is the day before Epiphany --&gt; in a similar way to [[St Nicholas]] or [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide"&gt;Illes, Judika. ''Encyclopedia of Spirits: The Ultimate Guide to the Magic of Fairies, Genies, Demons, Ghosts, Gods &amp; Goddesses'' (2009) p. 269. {{ISBN|978-0-06-135024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular belief is that her name derives from the [[Calendar of saints|Feast]] of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] or in Catholic ''La Festa dell'Epifania''. ''Epifania'' is a Latin word with Greek origins meaning "manifestation (of the divinity)."&lt;ref&gt;"Viva La Befana". Transparent Language 6 Jan, 2009. 12 Dec, 2009. &lt;http://www.transparent.com/italian/tag/la-befana/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Italian Link"&gt;"Italian Christmas tradition of "La Befana"." [http://www.italian-link.com/pages/labefana.shtml Italian-Link.com n.d. 15 Dec, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest that Befana is descended from the Sabine/Roman goddess named [[Strenua|Strenia]].&lt;ref name="Vestiges"/&gt;

In popular folklore Befana visits all the children of Italy on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany to fill their socks with [[candy]] and presents if they are good, or a lump of [[coal]] or dark candy if they are bad. In many poorer parts of Italy and in particular rural Sicily, a stick in a stocking was placed instead of coal.  Being a good housekeeper, many say she will sweep the floor before she leaves. To some the sweeping meant the sweeping away of the problems of the year.  The child's family typically leaves a small glass of [[wine]] and a plate with a few morsels of food, often regional or local, for the Befana.&lt;ref name="Italian Link" /&gt;

She is usually portrayed as a [[hag]] riding a [[broomstick]] through the air wearing a black [[shawl]] and is covered in [[soot]] because she enters the children's houses through the [[chimney]]. She is often smiling and carries a bag or [[hamper]] filled with candy, gifts, or both.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

She is also referred to as the Christmas Witch.

==Legend==
Christian legend had it that Befana was approached by the [[biblical magi]], also known as the [[Three Wise Men]] (or the [[three kings]]) a few days before the birth of the [[Infant Jesus]]. They asked for directions to where the [[Son of God]] was, as they had seen his star in the sky, but she did not know. She provided them with shelter for a night, as she was considered the best housekeeper in the village, with the most pleasant home. The magi invited her to join them on the journey to find the baby Jesus, but she declined, stating she was too busy with her housework. Later, La Befana had a change of heart, and tried to search out the astrologers and Jesus. That night she was not able to find them, so to this day, La Befana is searching for the little baby. She leaves all the good children toys and candy ("caramelle") or fruit, while the bad children get coal ("carbone"), onions or garlic.&lt;ref name="Italian Link" /&gt;

Another Christian legend takes a slightly darker tone as La Befana was an ordinary woman with a child whom she greatly loved.  However, her child died, and her resulting grief maddened her.  Upon hearing news of Jesus being born, she set out to see him, delusional that he was her son.  She eventually met Jesus and presented him with gifts to make him happy.  The infant Jesus was delighted, and he gave La Befana a gift in return; she would be the mother of every child in Italy.

Popular tradition tells that if one sees La Befana one will receive a thump from her broomstick, as she doesn't wish to be seen.  This aspect of the tradition may be designed to keep children in their beds.

Another commonly heard Christian legend of La Befana starts at the time of the birth of baby Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;"LA VERA STORIA." La Befana n.d. 13 Dec, 2009. &lt;http://www.la-befana.it/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Befana spends her days cleaning and sweeping. One day the magi, also known as the three wise men, came to her door in search of baby Jesus. Befana turned them away because she was too busy cleaning. Befana notices a bright light in the sky; she thinks this is the way to baby Jesus. She brought some baked goods and gifts for baby Jesus in her bag and took her broom to help the new mother clean and began her search for baby Jesus. She searched and searched for Baby Jesus, but never found him. Befana still searches today, after all these centuries. On the eve of the Epiphany, Befana comes to a house where there is a child and leaves a gift. Although she has been unsuccessful in her search, she still leaves gifts for good young children because the Christ Child can be found in all children.&lt;ref&gt;"The Legend of ’La Befana’". John D. Calandra Italian American Institute n.d. 12 Dec, 2009. &lt;http://qcpages.qc.edu/calandra/community/commbefa.html/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Befana was never a widespread tradition among the whole [[Italian people]], having originated in [[Rome]] and having only become well known and practiced by the rest of the population during the 20th century.

Many people believe that the name Befana is derived from the Italians' mispronunciation of the Greek word ''epifania'' or ''epiphaneia'' (Greek, επιφάνεια = appearance, surface, English: [[Epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]]). Others point to the name being a derivative of Bastrina, the gifts associated with the goddess Strina.  In the book ''Domestic Life in Palestine'', by Mary E. Rogers (Poe &amp; Hitchcock, 1865) the author notes:

{{bquote|But an 'Essay on the Fine Arts,' by E. L. Tarbuck, led me to believe that this custom is a relic of pagan worship, and that the word "Bastrina" refers to the offerings which used to be made to the goddess Strenia. We could hardly expect that the pagans who embraced Christianity could altogether abandon their former creeds and customs. Macaulay says, "Christianity conquered paganism, but paganism infected Christianity; the rites of the Pantheon passed into her 'worship, and the subtilties of the Academy into her creed.' Many pagan customs were adopted by the new Church. T. Hope, in his 'Essay on Architecture,' says: 'The Saturnalia were continued in the Carnival, and the festival with offerings to the goddess Strenia was continued in that of the New Year…'&lt;ref&gt;page 408&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A theory connects the tradition of exchanging gifts to an ancient Roman festivity in honour of [[Ianus]] and [[Strenia]] (in Italian a Christmas gift used to be called ''strenna''), celebrated at the beginning of the year, when Romans used to give each other presents.

In the book ''Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs, Discoverable in Modern Italy and Sicily''   (1823), John J. Blunt  says:

{{bquote|This Befana appears to be heir at law of a certain heathen goddess called Strenia, who presided over the new-year's gifts, 'Strenae,' from which, indeed, she derived her name.&lt;ref name="Vestiges"&gt;D. Augustine de Civit. Dei, lib. iv. c. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Her presents were of the same description as those of the Befana—figs, dates, and honey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fasti (Ovid)|Ovid ''Fasti'']] i. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover her solemnities were vigorously opposed by the early Christians on account of their noisy, riotous, and licentious character".&lt;ref&gt;Vide Rosini, ed. Dempster. lib. i. c.13, de Dea Strenia, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The tradition of Befana appears to incorporate other pre-Christian popular elements as well, adapted to Christian culture and related to the celebration of the [[New Year]]. Historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]] relates her to [[Nicevenn]]. The old lady character should then represent the "old year" just passed, ready to be burned in order to give place to the new one. In many European countries the tradition still exists of burning a puppet of an old lady at the beginning of the New Year, called [[Giubiana]] in Northern Italy, with clear [[Celt]]ic origins. Italian anthropologists Claudia and Luigi Manciocco, in their book ''Una casa senza porte'' ("A House without Doors") trace Befana's origins back to Neolithic beliefs and practices.  The team of anthropologists also wrote about Befana as a figure that evolved into a goddess associated with fertility and agriculture.

Befana also maintains many similarities with [[Perchta]] and her [[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions]].

==The Befana today==
[[File:Befana - Campomarino di Maruggio.JPG|thumb|upright|Befana of Campomarino di [[Maruggio]], Italy]]

The Befana is celebrated throughout all of Italy,&lt;ref&gt;"The Befana Comes by Night…" Alice Bonvincini Italian American Digital Project n.d. 2 Jan, 2011. &lt;http://www.i-italy.org/16375/befana-comes-night&gt;;&lt;/ref&gt; and has become a national icon. In the regions of [[Marche|the Marches]], [[Umbria]] and [[Latium]], her figure is associated with the [[Papal States]], where the Epiphany held the most importance. [[Urbania]] is thought to be her official home. Every year there is a big festival held to celebrate the holiday. About 30,000 to 50,000 people attend the festivities. Hundreds of Befanas are present, swinging from the main tower. They juggle, dance and greet all the children.&lt;ref&gt;Giglio, Michael. "Taking Flight with Italy’s Holiday Witch." Spiegel Online 12 Dec, 2008. 15 Dec, 2009.&lt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,596060,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, all Italian children may expect to find a lump of "[[coal]]" in their stockings (actually [[rock candy]] made black with caramel coloring), as every child has been at least occasionally bad during the year.

Three places in Italy are nowadays associated with the Befana tradition:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

* [[Piazza Navona]] in central [[Rome]] is the site of a popular market each year between [[Christmas]] and the Epiphany, where toys, [[rock candy|sugar charcoal]] and other candies are on sale. The feast of the Befana in Rome was immortalized in four famous [[sonnet]]s in the [[Romanesco dialect|Roman dialect]] by the 19th century Roman poet [[Giuseppe Gioacchino Belli]].  In [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s 1928 [[Feste Romane]] ("Roman Festivals"), the fourth movement, titled ''La Befana'', is an orchestral portrayal of this Piazza Navona festival. Romans believe that at the midnight January 6 the Befana shows herself from a window of Piazza Navona, and they always go there to watch her (it's a joke everybody tells while going to the feast to buy candies, toys and sweets).
* The town of Urbania in the [[Province of Pesaro e Urbino]] within [[Marche|the Marches]], where the national Befana festival is held each year, usually between January 2 and 6. A "house of the Befana" is scheduled to be built and the post office has a [[Letter box|mailbox]] reserved for letters addressed to the Befana, mirroring what happens with [[Santa Claus]] in [[Rovaniemi]].
* In [[Fornovo di Taro]], a  town in the  [[province of Parma]], the national meeting "Raduno Nazionale delle Befane e dei Befani" is held on 5 and 6 January.

In other parts of the world where a vibrant Italian community exists, traditions involving Befana may be observed and shared or celebrated with the wider community. In Toronto, Canada for example, a Befana Choir shows up on Winter Solstice each December to sing in the [[Kensington Market]] Festival of Lights parade. Women, men, and children dressed in La Befana costume and nose sing love songs to serenade the sun to beckon its return. The singing hags gather in the street to give candy to children, to cackle and screech to accordion music, and to sing in every key imaginable as delighted parade participants join in the cacophony. Sometimes, the Befanas dance with parade goers and dust down the willing as parade goers walk by.

==Poems and songs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filastrocche.it/nostalgici/natale/befana.htm DI FILASTROCCHE.IT] retrieved 2010-1-04&lt;/ref&gt;==
There are poems about Befana, which are known in slightly different versions throughout Italy. Here is one of the versions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''La Befana vien di notte''&lt;br&gt;
''Con le scarpe tutte rotte''&lt;br&gt;
''Col vestito  alla romana''&lt;br&gt;
''Viva, Viva La Befana!''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English translation is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Befana comes by night''&lt;br&gt;
''With her shoes all tattered and torn''&lt;!-- translation change from originally posted "With her shoes old and broken" --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''She comes dressed in the Roman way''&lt;br&gt;
''Long live the Befana!''
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Another version is given in a poem by [[Giovanni Pascoli]]:&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ridolfo.it/poesia/Pascoli.html] retrieved 2011-1-05&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Viene, viene la Befana''&lt;br&gt;
''Vien dai monti a notte fonda''&lt;br&gt;
''Come è stanca! la circonda ''&lt;br&gt;
''Neve e gelo e tramontana!''&lt;br&gt;
''Viene, viene la Befana''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English translation is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Here comes, here comes the Befana''&lt;br&gt;
''She comes from the mountains in the deep of the night''&lt;br&gt;
''Look how tired she is! All wrapped up''&lt;br&gt;
''In snow and frost and the north wind!'' &lt;ref&gt;Tramontana (English - [[tramontane]]) is  "a classical name for a northern wind", from ''tra i monti'', meaning "from the mountains"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
''Here comes, here comes the Befana!''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The national standards of the [[Republic of China]] administering [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] are titled '''National Standards of the Republic of China (CNS)''' (中華民國國家標準). They are administered by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. These standards are divided into 26 numbered categories. Applying the National Standards is voluntary unless authorities in charge cite any parts of the standards as laws and regulations. By the end of 2003, more than 15000 national standards have been issued. Although the Republic of China was removed in 1950 from the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) for failure to pay membership dues accordingly, there are still many National Standards translated from ISO standards into Chinese. A few standards also have English versions, but in case of any divergence of interpretation, the Chinese text shall prevail.

Each standard has a general number and may be prefixed "CNS", such as CNS 11296. The general numbers, English names and any similar ISO standards of some standards are listed below:

{{nf|date=December 2015}}
'''''Chronicon Roskildense''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Roskildekrøniken'' [[English language|English]]: ''Roskilde Chronicle'') a small [[Denmark|Danish]] historical work, which is, except for few yearbooks, the oldest known attempt to write a coherent account of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] by a Danish author, spanning from the introduction of [[Christianity]] in Denmark to the author's own time. It is written in [[Latin]].

The original chronicle covers the timeframe of 826 to c. 1140. A later addition from King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]]'s time, of a few more pages, takes the chronicle to 1157 when King Valdemar I gains the throne of Denmark; these additional pages are mostly direct quotes from other sources.

The author is unknown, but it is thought he must have had some relationship to [[Roskilde Cathedral]], as he is very confident with matters dealing with Roskilde. Churchly matters are not of special interest to him; he writes vividly about all kinds of matters happening around him. Events themselves are only briefly covered while people taking part in them or even causing them are throughout covered with great passion.

Unlike [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' or [[Svend Aagesen]]'s ''[[Brevis Historia Regum Dacie]]'', ''Chronicon Roskildense'' often covers the 'losing' side in these very same events told by Saxo and Svend Aggesen. At times the author can seem very bitter and blinded by politic; however, this fact also makes this chronicle a very interesting piece of work.

The early part of the work is in many cases based on [[Adam of Bremen]]'s ''Descriptio insularum Aquilonis'', sometimes even direct quotes. The author only takes what he needs, however, and the meaning is not always the same.

As with many Danish chronicles, the exact time of writing is not known with certainty. The original chronicle ends very suddenly. [[Olaf (II) Haraldsen|Olaf "II" Haraldsen]], son of [[Harald Kesja]], is still alive as of the writing; he is killed in 1143. The last subject written about is [[:da:Rike|Rike]] and [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]]'s quarrel over the [[Diocese of Lund|Archbishop seat of Lund]] in 1137 and 1138. With these in mind, the book must have been finished between 1138 and 1143.

The original manuscript is lost today and the chronicle exists now only in copies made in the 13th, 16th and 17th centuries.

Latin copies reside in:
* University Library, [[University of Kiel|Kiel]], S. H. 8 A.8° (13th century). Known as ''Codex Kiloniensis''.
* [[Den Arnamagnæanske Samling]], [[Copenhagen]], AM 107 8o (16th century). 
* [[Uppsala University Library]], De la Gardie XXV-XXIX (17th century).

Other less used terms are "sandwich thesis" and "stapler thesis".  It is composed of already-published journal articles, conference papers and book chapters, and occasional not yet published manuscripts. A thesis by publication is a form of '''compilation thesis''' (a term used in Nordic countries). Another form of compilation thesis is an '''essay thesis''', comprising previously unpublished independent [[essay]]s.&lt;ref name=Turku&gt;[http://www.tse.fi/FI/opiskelu/Documents/Muut%20oppaat/compilation_thesis.pdf Article theses and essay theses], Turku School of Economics, Finland, October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, article theses are the standard format in natural, medical, and engineering sciences (for example in the [[Nordic countries]]), while in social and cultural sciences, there is a strong but decreasing tradition to produce coherent monographs i.e. thesis as a series of linked chapters. Other times, doctoral students may have a choice between writing a monograph or a compilation thesis.&lt;ref name=Gu&gt;[http://www.globalstudies.gu.se/english/education_student/third_cycle-postgraduate_studies/about-the-doctoral-thesis/ About monographs and compilation theses], University of Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagen&gt;Niclas Hagen,[http://tycho5s.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/the-compilation-thesis-as-a-genre-and-as-a-method/ The compilation thesis as a genre and as a method], 7 May 2011 blog, affiliated with Lund University, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis by published works format is chosen in cases where the student intends to first publish the thesis in parts in international journals. It often results in a higher number of publications during the doctoral studies than a monograph and may render in higher number of citations in other research publications; something that may be advantageous from research funding point of view and may facilitate readership appointment after the dissertation. A further reason for writing a compilation thesis is that some of the articles can be written together with other authors, which may be helpful especially for new doctoral students. A majority of the articles should be reviewed by referees outside the student’s own department, supplementing the audit carried out by the supervisory staff and dissertation opponent, thus assuring international standards.&lt;ref name=Gu /&gt;

== Introductory chapters ==
The introductory or summary chapters of a thesis by published works should be written independently by the student. They should include an extensive annotated [[bibliography]] or [[literature review]], placing the scope and results of the articles in the wider context of current state of the international research. They constitute a comprehensive summary of the appended papers, and should clarify the contribution of the doctoral student if the papers are written by several authors. They should not provide new results, but may provide synthesis of new conclusions by combining results from several of the papers. They may supplement the articles with a motivation of the chosen scope, research problems, objectives and methods, and a strengthening of the theoretical framework, analysis and conclusions, since the extent of the articles normally does not allow this kind of longer discussions.&lt;ref name=Turku /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lund&gt;[http://www.lth.se/english/education/phd_studies/public_defence/compilation_thesis/ Guidance on the structure of a compilation thesis], Lund university, Faculty of engineering, Sweden.

The '''art collections of the [[Palace Museum]]''' ({{zh|c=故宫博物院|p=Gùgōng Bówùyùan}}), a national [[museum]] housed in the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], are built upon the imperial collection of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. This collection was expanded in the 20th century with new acquisitions, transfers from other museums, and new archaeological discoveries.

{{main|Forbidden City}}
The Palace Museum is housed in the Forbidden City, the [[China|Chinese]] imperial palace from the [[Ming Dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. It is located in the middle of [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]. For almost five centuries, it served as the home of the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] and his household, and the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government.

Built from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,707 bays of rooms&lt;ref name="Rooms"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=故宫到底有多少间房 (How many rooms in the Forbidden City) |url=http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |work= |publisher=Singtao Net |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2007-07-05 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718140600/http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers 720,000&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;metres. The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in [[East Asia]] and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; and is listed by [[UNESCO]] as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.

==History==
{{see also|History of the Forbidden City}}

[[File:Album of the Yongzheng Emperor in Costumes 9.jpg|thumb|From ''Album of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] in Costumes'', by anonymous court artists, Yongzheng period (1723—35).]]
Built from 1406 to 1420, the [[Forbidden City]] was the Chinese imperial palace from the early [[Ming Dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In 1912, [[Puyi]], the last Emperor of China, [[abdication|abdicated]]. Under an agreement with the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use,&lt;ref&gt;p 137, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; where a small museum was set up to display artifacts housed in the Outer Court. In 1924, Puyi was evicted from the Inner Court after a [[Coup d'etat|coup]].&lt;ref name="Yan4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yan|first=Chongnian|authorlink=Yan Chongnian|title= 正说清朝十二帝 (True Stories of the Twelve Qing Emperors)|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/40472/55544/55547/55560/3875789.html|year=2004|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=710104445X|language=Chinese|chapter=国民—战犯—公民 (National - War criminal - Citizen)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City on [[Double Ten Day]] (October 10), 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Cao Kun |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 故宫X档案: 开院门票 掏五毛钱可劲逛 (Forbidden City X-Files: Opening admission 50 cents)|url= http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/22226/53974/53977/3750782.html|work= Beijing Legal Evening|publisher= People Net|date=2005-10-06|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17&amp;nbsp;million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City.&lt;ref name=Wen&gt;
{{cite book|last=Wen|first=Lianxi (ed.)|title=故宫物品点查报告 [Palace items auditing report]|year=1925|publisher=Caretaker Committee of the Qing Dynasty Imperial Family. Reprint (2004): Xianzhuang Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=7-80106-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the imperial libraries housed countless rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forbidden city: the biography of a palace|author=Dorn, Frank|place=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|year=1970|OCLC=101030|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933, the threat of [[Japan]]ese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;See map of the evacuation routes at: {{cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title= National Palace Museum - Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= National Palace Museum |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the end of [[World War II]], this collection was returned to Nanjing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title= National Palace Museum - Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= National Palace Museum |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]' victory imminent in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the Nationalist government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered the evacuation of the pick of this collection to [[Taiwan]]. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artifacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei. This relatively small but high quality collection today form the core of that museum.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite news|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=三大院长南京说文物 (Three museum directors talk artifacts in Nanjing)|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|work=Jiangnan Times|publisher=People Net|date=2003-10-19|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201133727/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the [[Nanjing Museum]].&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

Under the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.&lt;ref name="Guangming"&gt;{{cite news|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=北京故宫与台北故宫 谁的文物藏品多？ (Beijing Palace Museum and Taipei Palace Museum: which collection is bigger?)|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|work=Guangming Daily|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110202014/http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|archivedate=2009-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the presence of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 闾丘露薇：星巴克怎么进的故宫？Luqiu Luwei: How did Starbucks get into the Forbidden City|url= http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/5290184.html|work= |publisher= People Net|date=2007-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}; see also the original [[blog]] post [http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/46e9d5da01000694 here] (in Chinese).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Starbucks]] store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.starbucks.com/retail/locator/MapResults.aspx?storeKey=33319|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070612055602/http://www.starbucks.com/retail/locator/MapResults.aspx?storeKey=33319|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2007-06-12|title= Starbucks Store Locator -- Store detail|accessdate=2007-05-01 |author= Starbucks Corporation|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mellissa Allison| title=Starbucks closes Forbidden City store| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003788095_webstarbucks13.html| work=| publisher=The Seattle Times| date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparked objections &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Reuters |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Starbucks brews storm in China's Forbidden City |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/FOOD/news/12/11/china.starbucks.reut/ |work= |publisher=CNN |date=2000-12-11 |accessdate=2007-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502100933/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/FOOD/news/12/11/china.starbucks.reut/ |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually closed on July 13, 2007. Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit Chinese citizens in order to [[price gouging|price-gouge]] foreign customers in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Two stores inside Forbidden City refuse entry to Chinese nationals|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/society/2006-08/23/content_4995055.htm|work=|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2006-08-23|accessdate=2007-05-01|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113150824/http://news.xinhuanet.com/society/2006-08/23/content_4995055.htm|archivedate=2009-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:北京故宫3.JPG|thumb|Interior of one of the many palace halls in the Palace Museum]]
Today, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.about.com/od/asiasouthasia/ig/Ancient-Beijing/Forbidden-City.htm|title=Forbidden City in Beijing, China|publisher=[[About.com]]: Architecture|author=[[Jackie Craven]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. According to an inventory of the Museum's collection conducted between 2004 and 2010, the Palace Museum holds a total of 1,807,558 artifacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected "valuable cultural relics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|title=Palace Museum puts its house in order|work=China Daily|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2011-01-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131083859/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|archivedate=2011-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China ceramics lotus vessel.JPG|thumb|left|A [[celadon]] [[Zun]] vessel with lotus design, Northern Dynasties, 386-581 A.D. Palace Museum collection.]]

===Ceramics===
The Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of [[ceramic]]s and [[porcelain]]. As well as other pieces, these include imperial collections from the [[Tang Dynasty]] and the [[Song Dynasty]], as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, sometimes, by the Emperor personally. This collection is notable because it derives from the imperial collection, and thus represents the best of porcelain production in China; other large collections are in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]] and the [[Nanjing Museum]].

The ceramic collection of the Palace Museum represents a comprehensive record of Chinese ceramic production over the past 8,000 years, as well as one of the largest such collections in the world.&lt;ref name="Guangming"/&gt;

===Painting===

[[File:Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface by Yun Shouping.jpg|thumb|right|''Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface'' by [[Yun Shouping]], 17th century]]
The Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China and includes some of the rarest and most valuable paintings in [[Chinese history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Paintings |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]] meant that one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history was held at the palace.  However, a significant portion of this collection was lost. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, some of the best parts of the collection were moved to [[Taiwan]]. The collection has since been gradually replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.

===Bronzeware===
[[Bronze]] holds an important place in [[Chinese culture]], and was always an important part of state ceremony. The Palace Museum's bronze collection dates from the early [[Shang Dynasty]]. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1600 are inscribed items from the pre-[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court, including complete sets of musical instruments used by the imperial orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Bronzeware |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timepieces===
The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace's own workships, [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) and [[Suzhou]] (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Timepieces |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable pieces in the collection include a clock with an attached [[automaton]] which is able to write, with a miniature [[writing brush]] on inserted paper, an auspicious couplet in perfect [[Chinese calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dpm.org.cn/English/c/c3/C3e/default.asp?artid=23|title= Gilded copper clock with the decoration of writing person|accessdate=2007-07-05 |author= The Palace Museum|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= Chinese|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jade===
[[Jade]] has a unique place in [[Chinese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laufer |first= Berthold|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jade: A Study in Chinese Archeology &amp; Religion|year=1912 |publisher=Reprint (1989): Peter Smith Pub Inc|location=Gloucestor MA |isbn=978-0-8446-5214-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan Dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artifacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the [[Neolithic]] period.  Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Jade |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palace artifacts===
In addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum's collection consists of the artifacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Palace artifacts |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[35&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;film]] [[film gauge|gauge]] has long been the most common gauge in professional usage, and thus enjoys the greatest number of cameras currently available for professional usage. The modern era of 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras dates to 1972, when [[Arri]]'s [[Arriflex 35BL]] and [[Panavision]]'s original [[Panaflex]] models emerged as the first self-blimped, lightweight cameras. Another distinguishing characteristic of modern cameras is the adoption of stronger [[lens mount]] seatings secured with a [[breech lock]] – namely the [[Arri PL]] and [[PV mount]], both of which were designs descended from the [[BNCR mount]] of Mitchell cameras.

===General===
* '''Camera model''' – specific camera body models and variants, usually officially authorized
* '''Camera line''' – either the body family (similar bodies) or system family (complementary design)
* '''Manufacturer''' – company of origin
* '''Introduced''' – first year of known usage
* '''Weight''' – usually just the body, but may include accessories as mentioned
* '''MOS/Sync''' – Sync-sound cameras are able to both maintain a constant speed (usually [[crystal oscillator|crystal lock]]) and run quietly enough not to be heard by the sound recordist. [[MOS (film)|MOS]] cameras do not meet either one or both of these requirements, and are usually used either for applications where camera noise is not a concern, or non-standard camera speeds are required. A camera is also deemed MOS if it cannot hold a constant speed, regardless of its noise levels.
* '''Noise level''' – measured noise made by the camera, dB(A), with film and at a given distance from the film plane, usually one meter. MOS cameras do not have a measured noise level since they are not intended to be used with recorded sound and thus are much louder.

:''A limited number of cameras prior to the modern period are listed due to their prevalence in special applications.''

===Lens and gate aperture===
* '''Lens mount''' – the type of [[lens mount|mount]] required for using the camera. Certain lenses may not be able to be used with particular cameras if the mounts are incompatible. The lens mount must be shifted to be centered to accommodate the Super 16 format from standard 16.
* '''Aperture size''' – the size of the aperture of the gate.
* '''Aperture plate''' – is the gate removable for inspection and what accessories may it have?
* '''Lens interface''' – electronic information system located in the lens mount to communicate lens data to the camera and accessories.
* '''Ground glass''' – interchangeable [[ground glass]]es allow for the viewfinder to display whichever [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] is being framed for.
* '''Frameline glow''' – can the camera make the framelines glow for easier viewing in low-light conditions?

===Shutter===
* '''Reflex''' – is the shutter a [[reflex mirror]] design?
* '''Design''' – [[rotary disc shutter]]s have two common designs – a "half-moon" disc of 180° or "butterfly" of two e.g. 90° segments opposite each other which spin at half-speed.
* '''Location''' – where the shutter is centered
* '''Adjustment''' – how the shutter angle can be adjusted. Most manual designs can only be adjusted when the camera is not running, often with the lens removed. All electronic shutters allow adjustment at all times, including when the camera is running.
* '''Angles''' – shutter angles available and in what increments or stops, if not continuous.

===Movement===
* '''Movement type''' – design of the movement mechanism
* '''Pulldown claws''' – number of claws which engage the [[film perforations]] to transport the film while the shutter is closed. Some claws may have more than one pin in order to engage multiple perfs at a time.
* '''Registration pins''' – number of pins which engage the film perforations during exposure in order to ensure consistent image stability from frame to frame.

==16 mm==
[[16 mm film]] occupies a rather curious position within filmmaking – with a wide range encompassing virtually every field – amateur home movies, student films, experimental films, television work, commercials, music videos, corporate films, industrial research, medical applications, and lower budget features. Its robust image quality in relation to its size allows for a much more versatile, accessible, and affordable usage in many fields where neither 35&amp;nbsp;mm nor [[Super 8 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;8]] would be well-suited. Despite current challenges from the burgeoning digital video market, the consistent improvement of cameras, lenses, and film stocks have enabled the [[16 mm film|Super&amp;nbsp;16]] format to flourish recently, with many labs reporting increased usage. The modern era of 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras is concurrent with that of 35&amp;nbsp;mm for both the same reasons as 35&amp;nbsp;mm as well as an additional change: the creation of the Super 16 format by Rune Ericsson in 1971. The format expanded the usable film negative horizontally, which required a larger [[film gate]] and necessitated either specialized conversion of machined parts or purchase of new cameras designed with Super 16 gates. Since the format took more than a decade to slowly standardize, the competition from both high and low end video cameras has decimated the demand for 16&amp;nbsp;mm cameras for most non-professional usage. Therefore, there are relatively few Super 16 cameras, although most are considered professional-grade.

:''π''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''l''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, and ''π''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The corresponding cycle of ''π'' is written as ( ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ); this expression is not unique since ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be chosen to be any element of the orbit.

The size ''l'' of the orbit is called the length of the corresponding cycle; when ''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the single element in the orbit is called a '''[[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]''' of the permutation.

A permutation is determined by giving an expression for each of its cycles, and one notation for permutations consist of writing such expressions one after another in some order. For example, let

:&lt;math&gt; \pi
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 7 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 &amp; 7 &amp; 6 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

be a permutation that maps 1 to 2, 6 to 8, etc.  Then one may write

:''π'' = ( 1 2 4 3 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 8 ) (7) = (7) ( 1 2 4 3 ) ( 6 8 ) ( 5 ) = ( 4 3 1 2 ) ( 8 6 ) ( 5 ) (7) = ...

Here 5 and 7 are fixed points of ''π'', since ''π''(5)=5 and ''π''(7)=7. It is typical, but not necessary, to not write the cycles of length one in such an expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gerstein|1987|loc=p. 240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, π = (1 2 4 3)(6 8), would be an appropriate way to express this permutation.

There are different ways to write a permutation as a list of its cycles, but the number of cycles and their contents are given by the [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''S'' into orbits, and these are therefore the same for all such expressions.

== Counting permutations by number of cycles ==
The unsigned [[Stirling number]] of the first kind, ''s''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') counts the number of permutations of ''k'' elements with exactly ''j'' disjoint cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=p. 290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Properties ===

:'''(1)''' For every ''k'' &gt; 0 : ''s''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') = 1.

:'''(2)''' For every ''k'' &gt; 0 : ''s''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;1) = (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)!.

:'''(3)''' For every ''k'' &gt; ''j'' &gt; 1, ''s''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') = ''s''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j'')&amp;middot;(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)

=== Reasons for properties ===

:'''(1)''' There is only one way to construct a permutation of ''k'' elements with ''k'' cycles: Every cycle must have length 1 so every element must be a fixed point.

::'''(2.a)''' Every cycle of length ''k'' may be written as permutation of the number 1 to ''k''; there are ''k''! of these permutations.

::'''(2.b)''' There are ''k'' different ways to write a given cycle of length ''k'', e.g. ( 1 2 4 3 ) = ( 2 4 3 1 ) = ( 4 3 1 2 ) = ( 3 1 2 4 ).

::'''(2.c)''' Finally: ''s''(''k'', 1) = ''k''!/''k'' = (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)!.

:'''(3)''' There are two different ways to construct a permutation of ''k'' elements with ''j'' cycles:

::'''(3.a)''' If we want element ''k'' to be a fixed point we may choose one of the ''s''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) permutations with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements and ''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 cycles and add element ''k'' as a new cycle of length 1.

::'''(3.b)''' If we want element ''k'' ''not'' to be a fixed point we may choose one of the ''s''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j'' ) permutations with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements and ''j'' cycles and insert element ''k'' in an existing cycle in front of one of the ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements.

== Counting permutations by number of fixed points ==

The value ''f''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') counts the number of permutations of ''k'' elements with exactly ''j'' fixed points.  For the main article on this topic, see [[rencontres numbers]].

=== Properties ===

:'''(1)''' For every ''j'' &lt; 0 or ''j'' &gt; ''k'' : ''f''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') = 0.

:'''(2)''' ''f''(0, 0) = 1.

:'''(3)''' For every ''k'' &gt; 1 and ''k'' &amp;ge; ''j'' &amp;ge; 0, ''f''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''j'')  = ''f''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) + ''f''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j'')&amp;middot;(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''j'') + ''f''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;middot;(''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)

=== Reasons for properties ===

'''(3)''' There are three different methods to construct a permutation of ''k'' elements with ''j'' fixed points:

:'''(3.a)''' We may choose one of the ''f''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) permutations with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements and ''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 fixed points and add element ''k'' as a new fixed point.

:'''(3.b)''' We may choose one of the ''f''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j'') permutations with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements and ''j'' fixed points and insert element ''k'' in an existing cycle of length &gt; 1 in front of one of the (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''j'' elements.

:'''(3.c)''' We may choose one of the ''f''(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) permutations with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements and ''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 fixed points and join element ''k'' with one of the ''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 fixed points to a cycle of length 2.

=== Alternate calculations ===

:&lt;math&gt;f(k,1)=\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{i+1}{k \choose i}i(k-i)!&lt;/math&gt;

Example: ''f''(5, 1) = 5&amp;times;1&amp;times;4! &amp;minus; 10&amp;times;2&amp;times;3! + 10&amp;times;3&amp;times;2! - 5&amp;times;4&amp;times;1! + 1&amp;times;5&amp;times;0!

:= 120 - 120 + 60 - 20 + 5 = 45.

:&lt;math&gt;f(k,0)=k!-\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{i+1}{k \choose i}(k-i)!&lt;/math&gt;

Example: ''f''(5, 0) = 120 - ( 5&amp;times;4! - 10&amp;times;3! + 10&amp;times;2! - 5&amp;times;1! + 1&amp;times;0! )

:= 120 - ( 120 - 60 + 20 - 5 + 1 ) = 120 - 76 = 44.

:For every ''k'' &gt; 1:

::&lt;math&gt;f(k,0)=(k-1)(f(k-1,0)+f(k-2,0))&lt;/math&gt;

Example: ''f''(5, 0) = 4 &amp;times; ( 9 + 2 ) = 4 &amp;times; 11 = 44

:For every ''k'' &gt; 1:

::&lt;math&gt;f(k,0)=k!\sum_{i=2}^k(-1)^i/i!&lt;/math&gt;

Example: ''f''(5, 0) = 120 &amp;times; ( 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24 - 1/120 )

:= 120 &amp;times; ( 60/120 - 20/120 + 5/120 - 1/120 ) = 120 &amp;times; 44/120 = 44

:&lt;math&gt;f(k,0)\approx k!/e&lt;/math&gt;

:where e is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]] &amp;asymp; 2.71828

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3569">The '''Dick Thornburgh Papers''' are the collection of materials related to [[Dick Thornburgh]]’s eight years as Governor of Pennsylvania. The Papers are housed in the [[Archives Service Center]], University of Pittsburgh Library System, [[University of Pittsburgh]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA). The collection contains digitized content that is accessible online at no cost. Not all the content is digitized but is available by request. Copies of materials are provided at a small cost to cover the cost of making the copies and mailing them.

==History==

The collection was acquired through Dick Thornburgh on February 27, 1998 and was processed by archivists with funding by a grant by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;type=simple;rgn=Entire%20Finding%20Aid;q1=Bolton;view=reslist;subview=standard;sort=occur;start=1;size=25;didno=US-PPiU-ais199830-11;focusrgn=admininfo;byte=20971484&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pittsburgh received the grant to fund the work needed to digitize the papers. The grant supported the formation of online-accessible to be available to researchers. Processing the papers involved encoding of the 37,000 pages of text, hundreds of photographs, and many audio and video recordings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.pitt.edu/thornburgh/coll.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

===Three Mile Island Nuclear Accident===

Records pertaining to the Three Mile Island Nuclear Accident are part of the collection. Other documentation regarding the accident are housed in the Pennsylvania State Archives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.c-span.org/video/?422277-1/three-mile-island-collection&lt;/ref&gt; The materials included in this section of the collection were from during and after the incident. Some of the materials contain annotated notes by Thornburgh and his staff. The types of materials in the files include, for example: memoranda, news clippings, news releases, correspondence, reports, topic background, wire stories from the early days of the accident, press statements and advisories, transcripts of news conferences, public statements by the Governor and others, reports on the future of nuclear energy, staff and cabinet notes and drafts, and emergency and evacuation plans.

===Videos===

Videos in the collection number 547 and span 1978-1991. Chronologically, they were recorded beginning with Thornburgh's campaign for governor in 1978 to his campaign for U.S. Senate in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;view=reslist;subview=standard;didno=US-PPiU-ais199830-19;focusrgn=contentslist&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70 videos are available for streaming from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.pitt.edu/thornburgh/collection/series19.html&lt;/ref&gt; Archived content include: Governor’s Testimony before joint committees of US Senate regarding cleanup of Three Mile Island [online] October 20, 1981, Governor proposes cost-sharing plan for cleanup of Three Mile Island, July 9, 1981, WQED: Governor Thornburgh press conference, Scranton, Denton, Adamcik, 3 p.m., April 9, 1979  and others.

===News releases===
News releases related to events are also contained in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.pitt.edu/thornburgh/coll.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63297">'''Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols''' are used to communicate and detail the characteristics of an [[engineering drawing]]. This list includes abbreviations common to the vocabulary of people who work with engineering drawings in the manufacture and inspection of parts and assemblies.

[[Technical standard]]s exist to provide glossaries of abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols that may be found on engineering drawings. Many corporations have such standards, which define some terms and symbols specific to them; on the national and international level, ASME standard Y14.38&lt;ref name="ASME_Y14.38_2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the widely used standards.

| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|BASIC}} || [[basic dimension]] || A [[basic dimension]] is one that is the theoretical value without any tolerance range. It does not serve as an acceptance criterion. It is thus similar in some respects to a [[#REF|reference]] dimension. The reason why a basic dimension does not carry a tolerance is that its actual value will fall (acceptably) wherever it is put by other features' actual values, where the latter features are the ones with tolerances defined. A common and simple example is hole location: If a hole's centerpoint location has a [[position tolerance]], then the centerpoint's coordinates do not need (and should not have) separate tolerances applied to them. Thus they are instead given as basic dimensions. In modern practice basic dimensions have a rectangular box around them, or sometimes the word "BASIC".

One corporation can have many CAGE codes, as can one government, because each division, department, and site (campus) can have its own CAGE code. The same CAGE code can change owners over the years.

It may be the entity who first designed the part (that is, the [[#ODA|ODA]]), but today it is also likely to be a designated successor entity, owing to [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&amp;A) activity (e.g., ODA company was bought by CDA company); contract letting (e.g., an Army engineering department ODA turns over the design activity to the prime contractor that makes most or all of the parts, turning that contractor into the new CDA); [[privatization]] (e.g., a government privatizes the design and manufacture of [[materiel]], and a [[arsenal|state arsenal]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Armory (military)|state armory]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ODA transfers design authority to a [[Armory (military)|private armory]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[defense contractor]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ODA); or patent licensing (e.g., a patent-holding inventor [ODA] licenses one or several companies to manufacture products using his intellectual property, in which case the "same" part could end up with multiple design authorities, although they may not be considered the official/nominal CDA).

|-
| valign="top" | {{Anchor|f_meaning_finish}} ''f'' || finish || An italic ''f'' (Latin small letter f) written on a line representing a surface was an old way of indicating that the surface was to be machined rather than left in the as-cast or as-forged state. The "f" came from "finish" in the sense of "machine finish" as opposed to raw stock/casting/forging. Later the ASA convened upon [[#v_meaning_finish|a letter V]] (specifically a [[sans-serif]] V) touching the surface. Soon this evolved into the "check mark" sign with accompanying number that tells the reader a max roughness value (RMS, microinches or micrometres) for the machined finish, to be measured with a profilometer. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|FAO}} || finish all over || A note telling the manufacturer that all surfaces of the part are to be machined (as opposed to leaving any surfaces as-cast or as-forged). Not an obsolete usage, but not seen as commonly as it was decades ago; not least because parts that once would have been spot-faced castings are now likelier to be contoured from billet with [[CNC]] milling. But more importantly, best engineering practice today, reflecting [[design for manufacturability]] and avoidance of spurious cost drivers, is either to specify specific, quantifiable requirements for surfaces with specific needs (such as RMS roughness measurements in microinches or micrometres, plus any plating or painting needs), or to leave finish out of the part definition (and thus at the manufacturer's discretion) because it is not important to fit, function, or criticality. This same spirit is behind the shift in military standards from writing requirements about methods to writing them instead about performance, with the method to reach that goal being up to the ingenuity of the designer. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|FCF}} || feature control frame || The rectangular box (with several cells) that conveys geometric tolerances in [[#GD&amp;T|GD&amp;T]]. It typically tells you what sort of geometric condition (e.g., parallel, perpendicular, round, concentric), followed by what size (and maybe shape) the tolerance zone is, and finally which [[datum (geodesy)|datums]] it relates to, the order of gaging against them, and what material condition applies to them ([[#LMC|LMC]], [[#MMC|MMC]], or [[#RFS|RFS]]). A diameter symbol ([[⌀]]) tells you that the zone for the geometric tolerance is [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]]. 
|-

Rationales for drawing changes that are noted in the rev block often use these abbreviations for brevity (e.g., "DIM 14.00 was 12.50; added default TOL info to T/B; added leader lines to F/D; added alternate hardware IDs to P/L; added alternate alloy to L/M").

|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|FN or F/N}} || flag note, flagnote; find number || 1. Flagnote: A [[Engineering drawing#Flagnotes|flagnote]] is a note that is called out in specific spots in the field of the drawing. It is numbered with a stylized flag symbol surrounding the number (or sometimes a [[delta (letter)|delta]] symbol). A general note applies generally and is not called out with flags. 2. Find number: "FN" meaning "find number" refers to the ordinal number that gives an ID tag to one of the constituents in a parts list (list of materials, bill of materials). Thus "fasten using FN7" refers to a fastener that is "find number" 7 in the list. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|FoS}} || feature of size || A type of physical feature on a part. An FoS is a feature that can have size associated with it, usually involving the opposition of two surfaces (e.g., the two diametrically opposite sides of a hole wall; the two opposite walls of a slot or flange). Features of size (FoSs) in reality always have actual sizes and forms that differ from their theoretical size and form; the purpose of tolerancing is to define whether the difference is acceptable or not. Thus material condition ([[#LMC|LMC]], [[#MMC|MMC]], somewhere in between, or [[#RFS|RFS]]) is important in [[#GD&amp;T|GD&amp;T]]. ) A given geometric tolerance may be defined in relation to a certain FoS datum being at LMC or at MMC. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|FS}} || far side || The drawing notations "[[#NS|near side]]" and "far side" tell the reader which side of the part a feature is on, in occasional contexts where that fact is not communicated using the rules of [[orthographic projection|projection]] alone. Contexts of usage are rather limited. One example is hole locations; "3X AND 3X FAR SIDE" defines symmetrical groups of 3 holes on both sides of a part (6 total), without having to redefine equivalent hole center coordinates on two separate views, one for each group. This is not only a convenience for the designer but also a method of error prevention, because it provides a way to avoid forking geometric definition that ideally should be kept unforked to prevent discrepancies. For example, the groups defined above cannot accidentally become asymmetrically discrepant in a future [[#REV|revision]] by the revisor failing to revise both groups equally (because their definition is unified in only one place). Another example is part marking locations. An area for part identification marking can be circled on a top view but assigned to either the top or bottom of the part simply with a "near side" or "far side" notation—which obviates adding any otherwise-unneeded bottom view to the field of the drawing.

For example, "Weld all subassemblies IAW AWS XYZ.123" means "Weld all subassemblies in accordance with [[American Welding Society]] standard number XYZ.123" (the number is hypothetical in this example). The word "per" is functionally equivalent to "IAW" in such contexts; thus "rivet all sheet metal per MIL-PRF-123456" or "[...] IAW MIL-PRF-123456". Part of the motivation behind the choice of words "in accordance with" is that they do not allege that any particular activity is ''explicitly specified'' by standard XYZ.123 (which "per" could be interpreted as alleging, at least in [[connotation]]); rather, these words merely instruct the user that whatever s/he does must not ''contradict'' the standard in any way.

The dimension may also be surrounded by parentheses to signify a [[reference dimension]]. When a dimension is defined in one view but also mentioned again in another view, it will be given as reference in the second case. This rule prevents the mistake of defining it in two different ways accidentally; the "main" (non-reference) mention is the only one that counts as a feature definition and thus as a part acceptance criterion. See also [[#BASIC|basic]] dimensions, which are similar in some respects. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|REQD}} or REQ'D || required || For example, "4 REQD" written next to a fastener means that four of those fasteners are required for the assembly. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|REV}} || revision || Engineering drawings and material or process [[specification]]s are often revised; the usual [[revision control]] convention is to label the versions A, B, C, D, etc.; a revision block (rev block) is a tabular area on the drawing (typically in the upper right corner) that lists the revision letters, a brief description of the changes and reasons, and approval initials and dates. Revisions beyond "Z" start the alphabet over again with doubling, e.g., AA, AB, AC, AD, and so on. In the days of manual drafting, redrawing was expensive, so engineering orders (EOs, ECOs, DCNs, ECNs) were not always incorporated into a next-letter revision. They thus accompany the drawing as part of the TDP. With the dissemination of software usage (CAD, CAM, PDMSs), revision control is often better handled nowadays, in competent hands at least. In recent years the [[revision control]] of engineering drawings has even been standardized by ASME, in their standard Y14.35M.&lt;ref name="ASME_Y14.35M_1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also herein ''[[#f_meaning_finish|f]]'' as a finish mark. 
|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|RT}} or R/T || rough turn, rough turned; [[room temperature]] || Rough-turned means turned on a lathe but not finished to a final machined dimension and [[surface roughness]].

In other words, distances may be given from intersection points where lines intersect, regardless of edge breaks or fillets. This is usually implied by default, so "S/C" often need not be explicitly added. But in some cases it clarifies the definition. See also [[#TSC|TSC]], [[#POI|POI]], and [[#AC|AC]].

| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|TB or T/B}} || title block || An area of the drawing, almost always at the bottom right, that contains the title of the drawing and other key information. Typical fields in the title block include the drawing title (usually the part name); drawing number (usually the part number); names and/or ID numbers relating to who designed and/or manufactures the part (which involves some complication because design and manufacturing entities for a given part number often change over the years due to [[mergers and acquisitions]], contract letting, [[privatization]], and the buying and selling of intellectual property—see [[#CDA|CDA]] and [[#ODA|ODA]]); company name (see previous comment); initials/signatures of the original draftsman (as wells as the original checker and tracer in the days of manual drafting); initials/signatures of approving managers (issuance/[[#RTP|release-to-production]] information); cross-references to other documents; default tolerancing values for dimensions, geometry, and surface roughness; raw-material info (if not given in a separate list/bill of materials); and [[access control]] information (information about who is authorized to possess, view, or share copies of the information encoded by the drawing, e.g., [[classified information|classification]] notices, copyright notices, [[patent]] numbers). [[#REV|Drawing revision]] (versioning) information is not always included in the title block because it often appears in a separate revisions block.

|-
| valign="top" | {{Visible anchor|TYP}}&lt;ref name="orau"/&gt; || Typical || Other features share the same characteristic. For example, if the drawing shows 8 holes on a bolt circle, and just one is dimensioned, with "TYP" or "(TYP)" following the dimension label, it means that that hole is typical of all 8 holes; in other words, it means that the other 7 holes are that size also. The latest revisions of Y14.5 [[deprecation|deprecate]] "TYP" by itself in favor of the specifying of a number of times, such as "2X" or "8X". This helps avoid any ambiguity or uncertainty. TYP or Typical was describe in Mil-Std-8, the directing body prior to adoption of the dimension tolerance interpretation Y14.5 series.  Its last revision was C in 1963, but can still be found in many older aircraft drawings.

The older symbol for this was a small script (italic) ''f'' (see herein ''[[#f_meaning_finish|f]]''). Later the ASA convened upon a letter V (specifically a [[sans-serif]] V) touching the surface. Soon this evolved into the "check mark" sign with accompanying number that tells the reader a max roughness value (RMS, microinches or micrometres) for the machined finish, to be measured with a profilometer.

'''EzineArticles''' is a website that accepts unpaid submissions from authors, in exchange for links to the authors' websites and visibility for their work.  The site also allows web and Ezine publishers to freely republish articles from the site, subject to certain conditions. Editorial oversight, based on simple editorial guidelines, occurs as submissions are screened by human editors who work for the company. In December 2013, [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] ranked the site 646 globally and 129 in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How popular is ezinearticles.com?|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ezinearticles.com|work=Alexa|publisher=Alexa Internet, Inc|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
EzineArticles was among the hardest hit websites by Google's major algorithm update in 2011, which hit all article directories. The site responded by becoming more selective, reducing submissions by 10%, reducing the amount of advertisements displayed on each page, and raising their minimum word count.  The site considered adding [[nofollow]] tags to all links, but abandoned this idea after objections from users.

On September 11, 2014, EzineArticles changed all their links from "do follow" to "nofollow". In an announcement made on the company's blog, the team cited their decision to change all links nofollow as an experiment to see how it will affect their site's traffic.

One digital marketing reviewer wrote that EzineArticles, along with "other article directories have become synonymous with low-quality content" because they "let almost anyone post" and "they don’t properly compensate writers."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Zachary.

The '''Flash Museum''' is a [[fiction]]al [[museum]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The museum is dedicated to the [[superhero]]es sharing the alias of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], with its primary focus on [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. It first appeared in the 'B' story from ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #154 (August 1965), "Gangster Masquerade," created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]].

==Fictional history==
The museum has been destroyed and subsequently rebuilt several times during the careers of both [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]]. The museum was originally located in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], but was relocated to [[Keystone City]] after the original was destroyed by [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' vol. 2, #197 (June 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was last destroyed in ''The Flash'' vol. 2, #196 (May 2003), and a rebuilt museum is shown in ''The Flash'' vol. 2, #208 (May 2004). After the death of the fourth Flash ([[Bart Allen]]), a statue of him was constructed with a candlelight vigil in his memory being held shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Countdown'' #43 (July 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Bart's statue was vandalized and later destroyed by [[Superman-Prime]], who holds a grudge against Bart for his initial defeat during the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

The museum features various exhibits about the Flash, including his battles and his [[List of Flash enemies|rogues gallery]] of foes. The museum also contains a working [[cosmic treadmill]], the device that allows Flash to travel to other dimensions and across time. In addition to the exhibits, the Flash Museum houses a vast storage of various artifacts and weaponry that the Flash has encountered. Depending on the story, some of these weapons are actually part of public exhibits, and are occasionally used during a fight.

[[Image:Flash Museum published by Marvel Comics.jpg|thumb|250px|Reference to the Flash Museum in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1 (September 2003). Art by [[George Pérez]].]]
The museum's curator since its founding is Dexter Myles, a former Shakespearean actor given the job by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] after his assistance in foiling a robbery.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' #154 (August 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is depicted in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1 (September 2003), and is the site of a battle between the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] against [[Black Canary]], [[Blue Beetle]], and [[Hawkman]] to retrieve the [[Wand of Watoomb]], which is won by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] after the Witch uses her chaos magic to knock out the other fighters.

In ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'', [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], and [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] arrive at a destroyed Flash Museum where technology from the cosmic treadmill was stolen, and three of Jay's friends were killed.

==Future versions==
* In the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' story arc "[[Titans Tomorrow]]"&lt;!--It's not "Titans *of* Tomorrow"--&gt;, set ten years in the future, the whole of [[Keystone City]] is converted into a huge Flash Museum. The adult [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]] uses the museum as a hideout.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #18 (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the "[[Cobalt Blue (comics)|Cobalt Blue]]" storyline, the Flash Museum is shown to exist in the 25th and 30th centuries. By the later era, the museum contains exhibits on the many Flashes of the previous 1,000 years. The new curators are a pair of robots named Dexter and Myles.&lt;ref&gt;"Guided Tour: The Central City Flash Museum". ''The Flash Secret Files'' #1 (November 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Several years before the Legion of Superheroes are formed, the Flash Museum is a derelict wreck. This is because the current President of Earth, Thawne, despises the Allen genealogical line. Despite this, it hosts the functioning [[Cosmic Treadmill]].&lt;ref&gt;"Impulse" #25 (May 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' reality, Flash is not Central City's superhero. Instead the resident hero [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]] has his own museum.

==In other media==

===Television===
====Live Action====
* The Flash Museum is referenced in the live-action CBS television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]''. In the episode "Fast Forward", [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] is thrown 10 years into the future where Central City is ruled by the brutal dictator Nicholas Pike. Allen is taken to the headquarters of the resistance, where they keep a room full of Flash artifacts that they refer to as "the Flash museum." Among the artifacts are newspapers, the Mask of Rasputin (from the episode "Honor Among Thieves"), the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]'s costume, the Ghostess's costume, Nightshade's costume (both from the episode "Ghost in the Machine"), and a replica Flash costume.
* The Flash Museum is referenced in the CW television series '' [[The Flash (2014 TV series) | The Flash]] ''. Dexter Myles appears in the series. In the episode "Things You Can not Outrun", [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] mentions that he "does not want to museum built in [his] name", when asked whether or not he helps people for the glory. In the season 1 finale, "Fast Enough," when Barry is running back in time, there are a few glimpses of future events, one of them being the Flash museum. The museum is mentioned in season 5 episodes "Nora" and "Blocked and appears in a flashback of "The Death of Vibe". Between 2018 and 2024, the Flash Museum will be inaugurated in the same building as the '''[[S.T.A.R. Labs]]''', with Mr. Myles becoming it's curator. Some time in or before 2032, a section called the "Hall of Villains" was built. This area included a wide variety of equipment that the Flash's enemies had used, or in the case of some artifacts, gadgets Team Flash had developed to take them down.

====Animation====
The Flash Museum appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Flash and Substance". True to form, it is destroyed in the fight between the Flash, [[Batman]], [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], and several members of the Flash's rogues gallery. A huge statue of the Flash is built in front of the museum. Among the exhibits are [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]'s helmet, the [[Kid Flash]] costume, some wax mannequins of Flash's enemies,Turtle Man, Gorilla Grodd, Top and others, one of Captain Boomerang's actual boomerangs, and a globe with a miniature Flash and [[Superman]] racing around it to commemorate their race in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Speed Demons".

===Film===
In the animated movie ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', the Flash museum appears attacked by [[Captain Cold]], [[Top]], [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Mirror Master]]. However, [[Professor Zoom]] betrays the rogues and attaches bombs to them which cannot be removed. The plot is thwarted when the [[Justice League]] arrive and manage to dispose the bombs from each of the rogues.

===Video games===
The Flash Museum appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

=== Comic Strips ===
In a storyline of the comic strip ''[[Funky Winkerbean]]'', The Flash Museum in Central City is a destination for a surprise trip planned for Darrin, a main character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10141">The '''group attribution error''' refers to people's tendency to believe either (1) that the characteristics of an individual group member are reflective of the group as a whole, or (2) that a group's decision outcome must reflect the preferences of individual group members, even when external information is available suggesting otherwise.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamill|first1=Ruth|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|last3=Nisbett|first3=Richard E.|date=1980|title=Insensitivity to sample bias: Generalizing from atypical cases|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92179/InsensitivityToSampleBias.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=578–589|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.4.578|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511145714/https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92179/InsensitivityToSampleBias.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Scott T|last2=Messick|first2=David M|date=1985|title=The group attribution error|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=563–579|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(85)90025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Diane M.; Allison, Scott T. (1987). "Group attribution errors and the illusion of group attitude change". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group attribution error shares an [[attribution bias]] analogous to the [[fundamental attribution error]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than focusing individual's behavior, it relies on group outcomes and attitudes as its main for conclusions.

== Types of Tendencies ==

===Type I===
To demonstrate the first form of group attribution error, research participants are typically given case studies about individuals who are members of defined groups (such as members of a particular occupation, nationality, or ethnicity), and then take surveys to determine their views of the groups as a whole. Often the participants may be broken up into separate test groups, some of which are given statistics about the group that directly contradict what they were presented in the case study. Others may even be told directly that the individual in the case study was atypical for the group as a whole. Researchers use the surveys to determine to what extent the participants allowed their views of the individual in the case study to influence their views of the group as a whole and also take note of how effective the statistics were in deterring this group attribution error. Ruth Hamill, Richard E. Nisbett, and Timothy DeCamp Wilson were the first to study this form of group attribution error in detail in their 1980 paper ''Insensitivity to Sample Bias: Generalizing From Atypical Cases.'' In their study, the researchers provided participants with a case study about an individual welfare recipient. Half of the participants were given statistics showing that the individual was typical for a welfare recipient and had been on the program for the typical amount of time, while the other half of participants were given statistics showing that the welfare recipient had been on the program much longer than normal. The results of the study revealed that participants did indeed draw extremely negative opinions of all welfare recipients as a result of the case study. It was also found that the differences in statistics provided to the two groups had trivial to no effect on the level of group attribution error.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

===Type II===
The second form of group attribution error was first reported by Scott T. Allison and David Messick in 1985. This form describes people's tendency to assume incorrectly that group decisions reflect group members' attitudes. In their study the researchers did multiple experiments presenting participants with group decisions made on the national, state, and local levels. Participants were presented with situations in which a matter of public policy was determined by a single leader with no popular vote, a popular vote of over 90% of the population, and a popular vote which included approximately 50% of the population. If no group attribution error were present, the participants would be expected to conclude that in the 90% vote the views of the individuals were reflective of the group decision, in the 50% vote they may or may not be, and in the leader decision there is no evidence that the individual views reflect the group outcome. Allison and Messick discovered instead, however, that the participants associated the individual views with the group outcome in all three cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Limitations and threats ====
Follow-up research by Leila Worth and Scott T. Allison attempted to identify the limits of the effect.  These studies have shown that the error becomes stronger in perceptions of groups that are viewed as (a) more dissimilar to one's own group, (b) more monolithic, and (c) adversarial to one's own group. The error tends to disappear in perceptions of one's own group.  Group members are more likely to attribute the decisions of their own group to structural constraints placed on the group, such as its decision rules, whereas members tend to attribute the decisions of another group to its members' attitudes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=Diane M|last2=Allison|first2=Scott T|title=Group attribution errors and the illusion of group attitude change|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1031(87)90016-3|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=6|pages=460–480|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(87)90016-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Corneille et al. conducted further studies that suggest that threatening groups are viewed as being both more extreme and more homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corneille|first1=Olivier|last2=Yzerbyt|first2=Vincent Y.|last3=Rogier|first3=Anouk|last4=Buidin|first4=Genevieve|date=2001|title=Threat and the Group Attribution Error: When Threat Elicits Judgments of Extremity and Homogeneity|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=4|pages=437–446|doi=10.1177/0146167201274005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The group attribution error has been referred as a term since 1985 by Scott T. Allison and David M. Messick after evaluating numerous researches made between 1970-1985. These researches tie different attribution biases to an individual either 1) the individual's behavior or 2) the outcomes of the group that the individual belongs to. The first one is known as the fundamental attribution error, and the consequent one is known as the group attribution error.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L. (1977). The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process. ''Advances in experimental social psychology'', ''10'', 173-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human development perception of group attribution==
Infants develop the ability to categorize first by putting a gender label to other children. Then, the difference in color of the skin begins to play a role in their ability to distinguish different backgrounds. Consequently, group attribution biases towards members of different groups, either on race or gender, affect their ability to judge others.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011). ''Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity''. Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the conception of children believing that "all girls are quiet" illustrates the influence of categorization and generalization to members of this group (girls).

==Connections to different attribution errors==
The [[fundamental attribution error]] is similar to the group attribution error in that it refers to the tendency to believe that an individual's actions are representative of the individual's preferences, even when available information suggests that the actions were caused by outside forces.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1975). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. In ''Utility, probability, and human decision making'' (pp. 141-162). Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group attribution error and the [[ultimate attribution error]] share the individual's tendency to draw different prejudiced conclusions between in-groups and out-groups. The individuals involved in an in-group would attribute positive conclusions about their group outcomes, yet they would attribute negative conclusions towards the out-group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas F.|date=2016-07-02|title=The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014616727900500407|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/014616727900500407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guy Larose''' (February 7, 1925 &amp;ndash; May 26, 2012), better known by his [[ring name]] of '''Hans Schmidt''', was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] famous in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Wrestling career==
Larose used a background in [[amateur wrestling]] to break into the pro business after [[World War II]], wrestling as a [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] under his own name with modest success early on.&lt;ref name="slam obit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2012/05/28/19806356.html |title=Legendary Hans Schmidt dies at 87 |author=Greg Oliver |date=May 28, 2012 |work= |publisher=SLAM! Wrestling |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1951 the [[Boston]]-area promoter [[Paul Bowser]], who thought the tall, naturally balding Franco-[[Quebec|Québécois]] looked like a [[Germany|German]], rechristened him Hans Schmidt. Playing the character of an 'evil German', Schmidt became one of the first great [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] of televised wrestling in the 1950s, drawing the hatred of fans as he battled their [[Americans|American]] [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] heroes of the squared circle. In the 1998 [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] documentary ''[[The Unreal Story of Professional Wrestling]]'', Hans Schmidt was labeled "the classic foreign villain" - tapping into lingering anti-German sentiment in America following World War II, Schmidt was a forerunner of many other wrestling characters that successfully used the "anti-American foreigner" [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] to enrage the crowd, such as [[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[The Iron Sheik]].

Nicknamed '''The Teuton Terror''', Schmidt wrestled a rough, aggressive rule-breaker's style.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=121|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often finished his opponents off with a backbreaker, and was also known to use the piledriver as well. Fellow wrestlers recalled that he liked to work [[Stiff (professional wrestling)#Stiff|stiff]] on them, particularly with his boots, a practice for which he earned the nickname of "Footsie".&lt;ref name="slam imprint"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2012/05/28/19807086.html |title=The imprint of Hans Schmidt |author=Greg Oliver |date=May 28, 2012 |work= |publisher=SLAM! Wrestling |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt wrestled in territories all over North America but was a particularly big name in [[Chicago]], [[Milwaukee]] and [[Toronto]]. By 1954 he was so thoroughly hated by wrestling audiences that he turned [["Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]] into a face simply by wrestling a match against him. He later said that at the peak of his career, between live events and TV tapings he was wrestling as many as eight matches a week.&lt;ref name="slam bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/schmidt.html |title=SLAM! Wrestling Canadian Hall of Fame: Hans Schmidt |author= |date= |work= |publisher=SLAM! Wrestling |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt wrestled [[Lou Thesz]] several times for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], and faced many other legends of the era such as [[Verne Gagne]], [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Whipper Billy Watson]]. He was naturally partnered up in [[tag team]] action with other 'evil German' wrestlers around at the time, such as [[Karl von Hess]] and [[Ludwig von Krupp]]. He also frequently tag teamed with [[Dick Brower|Dick 'The Bulldog' Brower]]. In the wake of Schmidt's success in drawing [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heel heat]], other wrestlers took the 'German heel' gimmick and pushed it to greater extremes with [[Goose-Step|goose-stepping]], [[Hitler salute|fascist saluting]] and use of [[Nazi]] iconography. Schmidt never took it to this level himself, though he was known to wear a helmet to the ring later in his career.

Near the end of his career in the 1970s, Schmidt worked around the [[Montreal]] region, still a heel but billed as hailing from Chicago. Guy Larose spent his retirement years in the [[Laurentian mountains|Laurentians]] north of Montreal until his death on May 26, 2012. He is survived by two children as well as his wife and stepchildren.&lt;ref name="slam obit" /&gt;

'''Heinlein juveniles''' are the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novels written by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. The twelve novels were published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] between 1947 and 1958, which together tell a single story of space exploration. A thirteenth, ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', was submitted to Scribner's but rejected and instead published by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]]. A fourteenth novel, ''[[Podkayne of Mars]]'', is often listed as a "Heinlein juvenile", although Heinlein himself did not consider it to be one.

In addition to the juveniles, Heinlein wrote two short stories about [[Scouting]] for boys and three short stories with Puddin', a teenage female protagonist, for girls.

== The Scribner's juveniles ==
* ''[[Rocket Ship Galileo]]'' (1947)
* ''[[Space Cadet]]'' (1948)
* ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' (1949)
* ''[[Farmer in the Sky]]'' (1950)
* ''[[Between Planets]]'' (1951)
* ''[[The Rolling Stones (novel)|The Rolling Stones]]'' (also known as ''Space Family Stone'', 1952)
* ''[[Starman Jones]]'' (1953)
* ''[[The Star Beast]]'' (1954)
* ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' (1955)
* ''[[Time for the Stars]]'' (1956)
* ''[[Citizen of the Galaxy]]'' (1957)
* ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'' (1958)

James Gifford wrote, "It is not often recognized that [the juveniles] are a reasonably consistent 'Future History' of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, ''Robert A. Heinlein: A Reader's Companion'', 2000, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The dozen novels do not share any characters and do not form a strict chronological series; the later novels are not sequels to the earlier ones. They nonetheless tell a single story of space exploration.&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;[[Jack Williamson]], "Youth Against Space: Heinlein's Juveniles Revisited", in ''Robert A. Heinlein'' (1978), ed by  [[Joseph D. Olander]] and [[Martin H. Greenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first novel, ''[[Rocket Ship Galileo]]'', is about an effort to reach [[Moon|the Moon]]. The next few (through ''[[The Rolling Stones (novel)|The Rolling Stones]]'') revolve around [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary travel]] within the [[solar system]].  The next few (''[[Starman Jones]]'' through ''[[Time for the Stars]]'') revolve around various versions of the early phase of [[interstellar travel]]. In the next novel (''[[Citizen of the Galaxy]]''), interstellar travel is well-established and easy for humans, and the central problem is one of the maintenance of law and order in the galaxy. The protagonist of the next and last Scribner's juvenile, ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'', travels to the [[Lesser Magellanic Cloud]] and interacts with an [[Intergalactic travel|intergalactic]] civilization. The last book submitted to Scribner's, ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', portrays an interstellar war between mankind and several other species.

The intended readership was teenage boys, but the books have been enjoyed by a wide range of readers. Heinlein wanted to present challenging material to children, such as the firearms for teenagers in ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]''. This led to "annual quarrels over what was suitable for juvenile reading"&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Heinlein]], ''[[Grumbles from the Grave]]'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; with Scribner's editors. 

===Reception===
[[Groff Conklin]] wrote in 1955 that "Nobody but nobody can beat Heinlein in the writing of teen-age science fiction".&lt;ref name="conklin195503"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Williamson]] wrote: "[An] inspiring theme of space conquest unifies the dozen Scribner's titles ...  The books, taken together, tell an epic story of the expansion of mankind across the planets of our own Sun and the stars beyond.  ...  a generally consistent story of the future conquest of space.  The first, ''Rocket Ship Galileo'', begins in a backyard shortly after [[World War II]], with three boys testing a primitive rocket motor.  The last, ''Have Space Suit—Will Travel'', ends with the triumphant return of its young hero from the Lesser Magellanic Cloud...  Nobody has written a more convincing and inspiring future human epic."&lt;ref name="williamson" /&gt;

== Starship Troopers ==
{{Main article|Starship Troopers}}

''Starship Troopers'' was written as a juvenile for Scribner's but the publisher rejected it,&lt;ref name="Gifford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gifford| first=James| url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/ftp/fedrlsvc.pdf| title=The Nature of Federal Service in Robert A.

P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]] published the novel in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/biographies.html| publisher=The Heinlein Society| title=Biographies of Robert and Virginia Heinlein| accessdate=March 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scouting stories for boys ==
* "[[Nothing Ever Happens on the Moon]]", 1949
* "[[Tenderfoot in Space]]", 1958

When he returned to writing after World War II, Heinlein sought to diversify beyond pulp science fiction.  The Scouting stories, originally printed in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] magazine ''[[Boys' Life]]'', were part of that effort.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Expanded Universe]]'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Farmer in the Sky'', which also had a strong connection to Scouting, was serialized in ''Boys' Life'' under the title "Satellite Scout". Heinlein considered writing another Boy Scout story called "Polar Scout" in conjunction with a planned trip to Antarctica in early 1964, with the goal of releasing a collection of Scouting-related stories as a juvenile book. The trip did not take place and the author never wrote "Polar Scout".&lt;ref&gt;December 28, 1963, ''[[Grumbles from the Grave]]'', p. 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Puddin' stories for girls ==
* "[[Poor Daddy]]", 1949
* "[[Cliff and the Calories]]", 1950
* "[[The Bulletin Board]]", 1951

Upon delivery of one of his early juveniles, his editor at Scribner's  wished someone would write stories for girls.{{r|expanded354}} Heinlein took this as a challenge and wrote a short story for girls. The story, a first-person tale featuring Maureen "Puddin'", appeared under the byline "R. A. Heinlein" in ''Calling All Girls'' magazine.  He wrote two more, and planned four additional stories with the goal of publishing a collection titled ''Men Are Exasperating'', but he never wrote any more and the Puddin' stories have never been collected in one volume.

== Podkayne of Mars ==
{{Main article|Podkayne of Mars}}
Heinlein wrote "I grew so fond of Maureen [from the Puddin' stories] that I helped her to get rid of that excess weight, changed her name to 'Podkayne,' and moved her to Mars (along with her unbearable kid brother)."&lt;ref name="expanded354"&gt;''Expanded Universe'', p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Heinlein felt that a particular ending for ''Podkayne of Mars'', published in 1963, was dramatically necessary to the story. Early readers hated it, however, and he reluctantly changed it. In 1995 the book was rereleased with both the published and original endings.

Podkayne's categorization as a "Heinlein juvenile" is unclear. Many reviewers list it with the juveniles,&lt;ref name="panshin"&gt;[[Alexei Panshin]], ''Heinlein in Dimension''&lt;/ref&gt; and it is narrated by a teenager, but Heinlein himself did not regard it as a "juvenile".&lt;ref name="grumbles86"&gt;March 10, 1962, ''[[Grumbles from the Grave]]'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ties to other works ==
Heinlein wrote a few [[Robert A. Heinlein#Series|series]] of linked stories and novels. Three of the juveniles are connected to his [[Future History (novel)|Future History]]. [[Hazel Stone]] of ''The Rolling Stones'' also appears in ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', and ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]''. ''Space Cadet'' is set after "[[The Long Watch]]", which appears on Heinlein's Future History chart.  The protagonist of ''Farmer in the Sky'', Bill Lermer, plays the song "[[The Green Hills of Earth]]" on his accordion; the song is featured in the story of the same name from Heinlein's Future History.  ''Farmer'' also refers to the "Space Patrol," the interplanetary peace-keeping organization described in ''Space Cadet''.

The [[Mars]] of ''Red Planet'' seems to be the Mars of ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''; Jack Williamson writes that "The [[Martian#Martians in fiction|Martians]] in this story have a special interest, because they are the educators of Valentine Michael Smith [and] they display the same appalling powers that Smith brings back to Earth." &lt;ref name="williamson" /&gt;  ''[[Have Space Suit—Will Travel]]'' mentions a recently established lunar base and an "infant Luna City", possible early references to what Heinlein developed into the lunar outpost of his Future History and the lunar colony of ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''.

Other juveniles do not as a whole integrate easily into those series. For example, the timeline for interstellar travel in ''Time for the Stars'' does not fit into the Future History. Neither does the [[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Arachnid]] War from ''Starship Troopers'', nor the appearance of the advanced civilization in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud from ''Have Space Suit—Will Travel''.  Some of the juveniles which do not integrate with each other, nevertheless share similar elements of setting.  The [[Mars]] of several of the books (''Red Planet'', ''Between Planets'', ''The Rolling Stones'', and ''Time for the Stars'') has indigenous, intelligent (even dangerous) life, but they are not necessarily the same [[Martian#Martians in fiction|Martians]] in each book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4020">"[[IBM]] [[Tivoli Storage Manager]] [[Hierarchical Storage Manager|HSM]] for Windows" is an HSM product for [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] which allows policy based archival of files out of [[NTFS]] and into [[IBM Tivoli Storage Manager]].  In its place is left a [[stub file]] with [[offline bit]] set and a matching [[reparse point]].  Access to the file is transparently provided by DMAPI drivers.  The purpose of this migration is to allow rarely used or sufficiently aged files to be stored on lower cost media, while retaining transparent access as if the file were stored locally.

==Features==
In general, IBM TSM HSM for Windows is similar to many other HSM products.  This section discusses the semantics of how this particular HSM implementation operates.

Administrators can set up archiving policies, and HSM for Windows automatically executes the policies at predefined times, without requiring any end-user knowledge or intervention. Running in default mode HSM f/Win replaces each archived file by a stub containing a pointer to the archive in which this object is stored. Retention can be specified within TSM to meet any legal or business requirements.  

The product can keep any number of versions of a file in the repository and provides administrator functions to retrieve any of these versions.  Selected files or complete file spaces can be searched using SQL-like criteria and selected files or the complete results of a search can be retrieved either to their original location in the file system or to a different location in the file system.  The basic functionality of user transparency is not affected by this added value as a user-initiated recall of a file is always directed to the latest version.

An administrator may also override migration for specific archiving jobs by specifying that the original data is either kept on disk or completely deleted. This can be useful in particular in a Content Management environment, where files and other types of content are organized by business-related item groups or index classes, and users have access to this repository via a specific client or application. 

The administration of HSM for Windows does not require knowledge of the backend repository. The administration tool for OpenStore for File Server provides Windows administrators with these abilities:
* Archives can be organized as logical groups of files from directories and subdirectories
* File groups and file types (extensions) may be included and/or excluded
* Files may be included and excluded based on the date of creation, modification and last access
* Files may be included and excluded based on the size of files.
* Archives may refer to a complete disk volume or any part of a directory structure

==History==
Prior to 2004, and through 2008, IBM TSM HSM for Windows was known as '''OpenStore for File Servers''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185811/http://www.intercope.com/products/os4fs_whole_story_print.html OpenStore for File Servers on Archive.Org]&lt;/ref&gt; a.k.a. OS4FS.  The product was (and still is as of 2011-07-20) developed by [[Intercope|Intercope GmbH]].  In addition to [[Tivoli Storage Manager|TSM]] as a backend, OS4FS supported [[IBM Content Manager]] and [[IBM Content Manager On Demand]].

Since 2010-06-28, the product pages were removed from InterCope's website, with a small page &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intercope.com/os4fs/what-happened-to-os4fs/ InterCope - What happened to OS4FS?]&lt;/ref&gt; referring back to [[IBM|International Business Machines, Inc.]] for sales and support.

IBM no longer lists Content Manager as a target on the product page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/storage-mgr-hsm/ IBM Tivoli Storage Manager HSM for Windows product page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Keralolpathi''' (Malayalam: കേരളോല്പത്തി ''kēraḷōlpatti''; literally 'Kerala's Origin') is a [[Malayalam]] work that deals with the origin of the land of [[Kerala]]. Shungunny Menon ascribes the authorship of this work to [[Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]], a 17th-century scholar of the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] region of India.&lt;ref&gt;History of Travancore by Shungunny Menon, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The Keralolpathi is mostly an expansion from an earlier [[Sanskrit]] work known as the ''Kerala Mahatmayam''.  That work is classed among the [[Hindu]] [[Purana]]s as an ''Upa Purana'' (or sub Purana) of the ''Bhoogola Purana''.

The Keralolpathi covers the ancestry of the [[Namboodiri]] Brahmins and other castes of Kerala and is sometimes called the "Kerala Ulpathy". While the "Kerala Mahatmayam" deals with the origin of Kerala and its people alone, the Keralolpathi gives a history of Kerala down to the modern age, including reference to the [[United Kingdom|British]] in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;History of Travancore by Shungunny Menon, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Historians doubt the reliability of this collection of legends as it contains many discrepancies. For instance it states that a certain [[Viceroy]] of Kerala went to [[Mecca]] and met the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Mohammed]] there. However the corresponding date mentioned is such that the prophet was not even born till more than a century later.&lt;ref&gt;History of Travancore by Shungunny Menon, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that the King [[Krishnadevaraya]] of the [[Vijayanagara empire]] appointed a Viceroy over Kerala in 428 AD. However the said king reigned between 1509 and 1529 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual by V.Nagam Aiya, Volume I, page 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise even the origins of most of the [[caste]]s and clans of Kerala varies from the ancient Sanskrit Kerala Mahatmayam. Besides, by the 18th century modified versions of the work started appearing, varying from kingdom to kingdom and region to region in Kerala.  Therefore, according to Shungunny Menon (a native historian of [[Travancore]], Kerala) one cannot place, in the Keralolpathi, the value of a historical source. Shungunny Menon, stated that:

{{cquote|...numerous discrepancies and glaring mistakes are visible for we find the authors in their anxiety to prove the correctness of their accounts confusing occurrences of the modern age with those of the ancient...it is obvious that on a work such as the Kerala Ulpathy little reliance can be placed....&lt;ref&gt;History of Travancore by Shungunny Menon, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''William Logan''', who was the author of the ''Malabar Manual'' also refutes the validity of the Keralolpathi and describes it as:

{{cquote|...a farrago of legendary nonsense having for its definite aim the securing of the Brahmin caste of unbounded power and influence in the country...&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;A survey of Kerala history by A. Sreedhara Menon, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''K.P. Padmanabha Menon''', another native historian calls the Keralolpathi:

{{cquote|...an ill digested and uncollated collection of different versions huddled together in inextricable confusion...&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

There is some debate over the exact country in which the kitchen witch originated, some claiming [[Norway]] and others [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germandeli.com/witch.html |title=The German Kitchen Witch |publisher=Germandeli.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but consensus points to it stemming from older European customs.

{{LGBT mythology mini}}
'''LGBT themes in Hindu Epics''' involve [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deities or heroes whose attributes or behavior can be interpreted as [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]), or as having elements of [[gender variance]] and [[non-heterosexual]] sexuality. Traditional Hindu literary sources do not speak of homosexuality directly,&lt;ref name=morgan15/&gt; but changes of sex, [[homoerotic]] encounters, and [[intersex]] or [[third gender]] characters are often found both in traditional religious narratives such as the ''[[Vedas]]'',  ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Puranas]]'' as well as in regional folklore.

[[Hindu epic]] has many examples of deities changing gender, manifesting as different genders at different times, or combining to form [[androgynous]] or [[hermaphroditic]] beings. Gods change sex or manifest as an [[Avatar]] of the opposite sex in order to facilitate sexual congress.&lt;ref name=conner305/&gt;&lt;ref name=conner67/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanita69/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanita94/&gt; Non-divine beings also undergo sex-changes through the actions of the gods, as the result of curses or blessings, or as the natural outcome of [[reincarnation]].

Hindu epics contains numerous incidents where sexual interactions serve a non-sexual, sacred purpose; in some cases, these are same-sex interactions. Sometimes the gods condemn these interactions but at other times they occur with their blessing.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik99/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanitu100/&gt;

In addition to stories of gender and sexual variance that are generally accepted by mainstream Hinduism, modern scholars and [[queer]] [[activist]]s have highlighted LGBT themes in lesser known texts, or inferred them from stories that traditionally are considered to have no homoerotic subtext. Such analyses have caused disagreements about the true meaning of the ancient stories.&lt;ref name=Greenberg307/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanitu/&gt;

==Gender variance of deities==
[[File:Ardhanari.png|right|thumb|upright|Shiva and Parvati in the form of [[Ardhanarisvara]]]]
Many deities in Hinduism and Indian epics are represented as both male and female at different times and in different incarnations or may manifest with characteristics of both genders at once, such as [[Ardhanarishvara]], created by the merging of the god [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Parvati]].&lt;ref group=n&gt;Parvati is also called Shakti and Uma&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=conner305&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 305, "Shiva"&lt;/ref&gt; The name Ardhanarishvara means "The Lord whose half is a woman". This form of Shiva represents the "totality that lies beyond duality", and is associated with communication between mortals and gods and between men and women.&lt;ref name=conner67&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 67, "Ardhanarishvara "&lt;/ref&gt; Alain Danielou says that "The hermaphrodite, the homosexual and the transvestite have a symbolic value and are considered privileged beings, images of the Ardhararishvara.".&lt;ref name=conner67/&gt; A similar merger occurs between the beauty and prosperity goddess [[Lakshmi]] and her husband [[Vishnu]], forming the hermaphroditic or androgynous [[Vaikuntha Kamalaja|Lakshmi-Narayana]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 211, "Lakshmi"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', Vishnu takes the form of the enchantress, [[Mohini]], in order to trick the [[Asura|demon]]s into giving up [[Amrita]], the elixir of life. Shiva later becomes attracted to Mohini and spills his semen on the rocks which turn into gold. In the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'', Shiva's wife Parvati "hangs her head in shame" when she sees her husband's pursuit of Mohini. In some stories Shiva asks Vishnu to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself.&lt;ref name=Vanita69&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Stories in which Shiva knows of Mohini's true nature have been interpreted to "suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction".&lt;ref name=Vanita70&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Pattanaik writes that those focusing only on homo-eroticism miss the narrative's deeper metaphysical significance: Mohini's femininity represents the material aspect of reality, and Mohini's seduction is another attempt to induce Shiva into taking an interest in worldly matters. He cites another story to show that only Vishnu has the power to "enchant" Shiva: a demon tries to kill Shiva by taking the form of a woman (placing sharp teeth in "his" vagina). Shiva recognizes the impostor and kills the demon by the placing a "thunderbolt" on his "manhood" during their act of "lovemaking".&lt;ref name="Pattanaik_73-4"&gt;Pattanaik (2001), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, Puranic story of the origin of God [[Ayyappan|Ayyappa]],&lt;ref group=n name=Ayyappa&gt;Ayyappa is also known as Hariharaputra, Manikantha, and identified with Dharma-[[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]]&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu as Mohini becomes pregnant from Shiva, and gives birth to Ayyappa, who she abandons in shame. Pattanaik writes that rather than Mohini becoming pregnant, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's semen, which he ejaculated upon embracing Mohini.&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In another version, the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyan]] king Rajasekhara of Pantalam adopts the baby. In this version, Ayyappa is referred to as ''ayoni jata'', "not born from a vagina", and later ''Hariharaputra'', "the son of Vishnu and Shiva", and grows up to be a great hero.&lt;ref name=Vanita94&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLSmith5&gt;Smith, B.L., p. 5, ''Legitimation of Power in South Asia''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tamil versions of the ''Mahabharata'', the god [[Krishna]] – an incarnation of Vishnu – also took the form of Mohini and married [[Iravan|Aravan]]. This was in order to give Aravan the chance to experience love before his death, as he had volunteered to be sacrificed. Krishna remained in mourning in the Mohini form for some time after Aravan's death. This marriage and death of Aravan are commemorated annually in a rite known as ''Thali'', during which ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]'' (Indian "third gender") take on the role of Krishna-Mohini and "marry" Aravan in a mass-wedding, followed by an 18-day festival. The festival ends with a ritual burial of Aravan, while the Hirjas mourn in Tamil style: by beating their chests in ritual dances, breaking their bangles and changing into white mourning clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Canner &amp; Sparks, p. 66, "Aravan"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender variance in heroes==
Changes of sex and cross-dressing also occur in epics about non-divine figures. One such figure is [[Shikhandi]], a character in the ''Mahabharata''. He was originally born as a girl named 'Shikhandini' to [[Drupada]], the king of [[Panchala Kingdom (Mahabharata)|Panchala]]. In a previous lifetime, Shikandini was a woman named [[Amba (Mahabharata)|Amba]], who was rendered unmarriageable by the hero [[Bhishma]]. Humiliated, Amba undertook great austerities, and the gods granted her wish to be the cause of Bhishma's death. Amba was then reborn as Shikhandini. A divine voice told Drupada to raise Shikhandini as a son; so Drupada raised her like a man, trained her in warfare and arranged for her to marry a female. On the wedding night, Shikhandini's wife discovered that her "husband" was female, and insulted her. Shikhandini fled, but met a [[yaksha]] who exchanged his sex with her. Shikhandini returned as a man with the name 'Shikhandi' and led a happy married life with his wife and children. During the [[Kurukshetra war]], Bhishma recognised him as Amba reborn and refused to fight 'a woman'. Accordingly, [[Arjuna]] hid behind Shikhandi in order to defeat the almost invincible Bhishma. In the Javanese telling, Srikandi (as she is known) never becomes a man, but is a woman equal to men, and is the wife of Arjuna.&lt;ref name=connerarjuna&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 68, "Arjuna"&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Shikhandi's masculinity was transferred back to the yaksha.

[[File:arjuna statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of Arjuna on a street in Bali.]]
Arjuna himself is an example of gender variance. When Arjuna refused her amorous advances, the nymph [[Urvashi]] cursed Arjuna; he would become a "kliba," a member of the third gender. Krishna assured Arjuna that this curse would serve as the perfect disguise for Arjuna during his last year of exile. Arjuna took the name [[Brihannala]] and dressed in women's clothes, causing the curse to take effect. Thus Arjuna gained entry into the city ruled by king [[Virata]], where he taught the arts of music, singing and dancing to the princess [[Uttara (Mahābhārata)|Uttarā]] and her female attendees.&lt;ref name=connerarjuna/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pattanaik80&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Doniger describes Arjuna's cross-dressing disguise as a source of comedy in the story, with references to his "hairy arms".&lt;ref name=Doniger281&gt;Doniger, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Padma Purana]]'', Arjuna is also physically transformed into a woman when he requests permission to take part in Krishna's mystical dance, which only women may attend.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik80/&gt;

The story of [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]], a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to alternate between being a man and woman each month, appears in several traditional Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries [[Budha]] (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the ''Ramayana'' version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the ''Mahabharata'' Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pattanaik4547&gt;Pattanaik (2001), pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=connerila&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 183, "Ila/Sudyumna"&lt;/ref&gt; In another version, Budha is described as transgender as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharata|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|publisher=Penguin India|year=2011|isbn=9780143104254|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrons of LGBT and third sex people==
Numerous deities have been considered patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can originate in epical stories about the deity, or from religious practices and rituals. For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, has been linked to lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example two pieces of wood perceived as feminine, called the ''adhararani'' and ''utararani'', are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 66, "Arani".&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Bahuchara Mata]] is a patron goddess of the Hijra. In popular iconography she is often shown riding a [[rooster]] and carrying a sword, trident and a book. Various stories link Bahuchara to castration or other changes in physical sexual characteristics, sometimes as the result of her aiming curses against men. Bahuchara is believed to have originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 81, "Bahucharamata"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pattanaik101&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik99&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories also link Bahuchara to gender variance after she becomes divine. One epic concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince grew up to be impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince in a dream and ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be impotent. This epic is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.&lt;ref name=abbott&gt;{{cite book |last=Abott |first=Elizabeth |title=A History of Celibacy |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2001 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA  |isbn=0-306-81041-7 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samba (Krishna's son)|Samba]], the son of [[Krishna]], is also a patron of eunuchs, transgender people and homoeroticism. Samba dresses in women's clothes to mock and trick people, and so that he can more easily enter the company of women and seduce them.&lt;ref&gt;Conner Sparks (1998), p. 303, "Shamba"&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Mausala Purana'', Samba, dressed as woman, is cursed after being questioned about "her" supposed pregnancy. As a result of the curse, Samba, although remaining male, gives birth to an iron pestle and mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Krishna Charitra|last= Chattopadhyaya |first= Bankim Chandra |pages= 165–166 |publisher= Pustak Mahal|location= |isbn=978-81-223-1035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex sexual interactions==

[[File:Agni god of fire.jpg|thumb|Agni, god of fire. Agni's role in accepting sacrifices is paralleled by his accepting semen from other gods.]]
Homosexual or bisexual activity also occurs between gods, although such interactions are most usually considered purely ritualistic, or have purposes other than sexual pleasure. [[Agni]], the god of fire, wealth and creative energy, has same-sex sexual encounters that involve accepting semen from other gods.  Although married to the goddess [[Svaha]], Agni is also shown as being part of a [[same-sex couple]] with [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], the god of the moon. Agni takes a receptive role in this relationship, accepting semen from Soma with his mouth, paralleling Agni's role in accepting sacrifices from Earth to Heaven. Orthodox Hinduism emphasises that these are "[[mithuna]]", ritual sexual encounters, and Agni and his mouth represent the feminine role.&lt;ref name=conner309&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 309, "Soma"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=connergani&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 44, "Agni"&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni also accepts semen in epics of the conception and birth of [[Murugan|Karttikeya]], a god of male beauty and battle.&lt;ref group =n name=Karttikeya&gt;Also called Murugan, Skanda ("that which is spilled or oozed, namely seed"), Subrahmanya, Kumara ("unmarried" and "Mara-slayer"), Guha ("cave") Lalita ("the Beautiful"), Kanta ("the Handsome"), Senapati ("Lord of the army") and Brahmacharin ("vowed to celibacy").&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous versions of Karttikeya's birth story exist, many having a conception from only male input, although heterosexual sex or desire also plays a part. However, Parvati is credited as Karttikeya's mother due to her having sexual intercourse with Shiva, causing him to ejaculate. Ganga is Karttikeya's mother in other versions, accepting semen from Agni and carrying the unborn child. The male progenitor is sometimes Shiva, Agni, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref name=Vanita78&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' and the ''Ramayana'', the gods fear the outcome of Shiva and Parvati's "unending embrace," and interrupt their coitus. Shiva then appears before the gods and declares "now let him step forward who will accept the semen I discharge". At the prompting of the gods, Agni captures Shiva's semen in his hands and swallows it.&lt;ref name=connergani/&gt; In these stories, Parvati and Shiva condemn Agni's actions, calling them "wicked" or "improper." In the eleventh century text ''Kathasaritsagara'', however, Shiva forces the reluctant Agni to receive his semen.&lt;ref&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The semen causes a burning sensation in those that ingest it, prompting Agni to divest it into wives of a group of sages, under Shiva's advice. The sages' wives in turn drop the semen into the [[Ganges river]] (the ''Ganga''), where it flows to the shore from which Kārttikeya springs. In the ''Mahabharata'', Kārttikeya is also the son of Agni, who ejaculates into the hands of one of the ''[[Krittika]]s'' (the [[Pleiades]]), who in turn throws the semen into a lake, from whence Kārttikeya is born. In some myths, Agni ejaculates onto a mountain that was itself made from Shiva's divine semen, making Kārttikeya the child of the two gods, according to an interpretation by [[Markandeya]] in the ''[[Vana Parva]]''.&lt;ref name=Vanita78/&gt;

Mitra and Varuna, are gods of great intimacy and often mentioned together in Vedic literature. These Adityas preside over the universal waters wherein Mitra controls the ocean depths and lower portals while Varuna rules over the ocean’s upper regions, rivers and shorelines.&lt;ref name = MitraVaruna/&gt;

In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna are portrayed as icons of affection and intimate friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet and when they are thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.&lt;ref name = MitraVaruna/&gt;

The Bhagavata Purana (6.18.3-6) lists Varuna and Mitra as having children through ayoni or non-vaginal sex. For example, Varuna fathered the sage Valmiki when his semen fell upon a termite mound, and Agastya and Vasistha were born from water pots after Mitra and Varuna discharged their semen in the presence of Urvasi. This account is similar to Gay couples having children through surrogate mothers in modern days.&lt;ref name = MitraVaruna/&gt;

Some versions of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] text [[Krittivasi Ramayan|''Krittivasa Ramayana'']] contain a story of two queens that conceived a child together. When the famous king of the [[Sun Dynasty]], Maharaja Dilipa, died, the demigods become concerned that he did not have an heir. Shiva appeared before the king's two widowed queens and commanded, "You two make love together and by my blessings you will bear a beautiful son."  The two queens execute Shiva's order and one of them conceived a child. The child was born boneless, but by the blessings of the sage [[Ashtavakra]], the child was restored to full health. Ashtavakra named the child "[[Bhagiratha]]" – he who was born from two vulvas (''bhaga''). Bhagiratha later became one of the most famous kings of India and is credited with bringing the Ganges River down to earth through his austerities.&lt;ref name=Vanitu100&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elephant-headed, wisdom god [[Ganesha]]'s conception has numerous versions. Some sources consider him to be the progeny of Shiva and Parvati, although conception occurs outside the womb. However, most versions consider him to have been produced purely through the actions of Parvati, who in the ''Shiva Purana'' fashioned him from clay. However, when Ganesha blocks Shiva, he is beheaded and later restored to life by Shiva.&lt;ref name=Vanita81&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In a 13th-century Kashmiri text, Jayadratha's ''Haracaritacintamani'', Ganesha's birth is the result of Parvati's menstrual blood being washed into the Ganges, where they are swallowed by Parvati's elephant-headed handmaiden Malini, who in turn gives birth, giving Ganesha an all-female origin.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik116&gt;Pattanaik (2001), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanita82&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Courtright considers the birth to be "less auspicious" due to the lack of male input and use of bodily fluids such as sweat or menstrual blood,&lt;ref name=courtright/&gt; but Ruth Vanita points out that Hindus consider Ganesha's birth auspicious, and that the use of non-procreative bodily fluids is considered sacred and purifying in many Hindu rituals.&lt;ref name=Vanita82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 18, "Malini"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 18, "Hinduism"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sangam literature==
[[Sangam literature]] use the word ‘Pedi’ to refer to people born with [[Intersex]] condition, it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various types of  Hirja. Likewise, the famous sangam period characters of King Koperunchozhan and Pisuranthaiyar are another example for same sex love. They are said to have not seen each other at all and yet shared love and regard for each other, so much, that they die at the same time at different places. “For instance, the friendship between King Pari and poet Kabilar is shown as something more than just friendship. There are lyrical undertones suggestive of the intimate relationship they had. But since there are no explicit representation, one can only postulate a possibility.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/no-more-under-siege/article5247859.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=A. | last=Shrikumar | title=No more under siege | date=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==

Hindu traditional literary sources say little about homosexuality directly. Homoeroticism in traditional texts is often masked by adherence to strict gender and caste rules.&lt;ref name=morgan15&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethical issues in six religious traditions|last= Morgan|first= Peggy |authorlink= |author2=Lawton, Clive  |year= 2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=15 |isbn=978-0-7486-2330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical study is further hampered by the lack of [[Sanskrit]] words for modern conceptions (such as homosexuality), although words for specific same-sex sexual acts exist. Timothy Murphy writes that LGBT themes are often ignored by "heterosexist scholars", and even early investigations into sexual minorities in Hindu culture failed to analyse stories or artwork depicting same-sex sexual acts between mythological beings. Murphy describes the study of LGBT topics in Hindu culture as "still in their infancy".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy (2000), pp.281–282&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="“Hindu society had a clear cut idea of all these people in the past.

Goldman writes of transsexualism in Hindu literature: "Few cultures have accorded this phenomenon so prominent a place in the realms of mythology and religion as has that of traditional India." Goldman considers the numerous myths concerning gender change to be a manifestation of patriarchal cultures desire to control the sexuality of women, but writes that many myths "project a positive valuation of women and femininity".&lt;ref name=goldman1&gt;Goldman, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in gender may be caused by a god or through the use of magic, in order to deceive others or to facilitate a romantic encounter. A change in gender may also occur spontaneously due to changes in a person's spiritual or moral character, either in a single life, or through reincarnation.&lt;ref name=goldman3&gt;Goldman, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions'', queer theorists and activists have reinterpreted ancient texts "searching for alternative voices" that demonstrate the diversity of gender models and sexualities in Hinduism. These scholars include [[Gita Thadani]], who attempted to uncover lesbian subtext in ancient Vedic and Sanskrit texts in ''Sakhiyani: lesbian desire in ancient and modern India'', and [[Ruth Vanita]], who attempts "to locate spaces of same-sex intimacy in vernacular texts" in ''Same-sex love in India: readings from literature and history''.&lt;ref name=Greenberg307&gt;Greenberg, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanitu&gt;Vanita &amp; Kidwai (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LGBT interpretations of popular stories and characters have been controversial. ''Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings'', applied [[psychoanalytic]] approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that [[Ganesha]]'s trunk represented a flaccid penis and his love of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual oral sex.&lt;ref name=courtright&gt;Courtright, pp. 110–125&lt;/ref&gt; The deductions of this book, and similar application of [[psychoanalysis]] to the study of Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, [[S.N.Balagangadhara]], Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 7| issue = 19| pages = 118–143| last = Balagangadhara| first = S.

The scholarship of [[Wendy Doniger]], which focuses on interpretation of Hindu texts through psychoanalysis, is similarly controversial and has been criticised. Doniger has been described as "being rude, crude and very lewd in the hallowed portals of Sanskrit Academics."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020911134952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/asianlife/tv/network_east_late/biogs/wendy_doniger.shtml BBC's article on Wendy Doniger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Invading the Sacred', p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Doniger's works that feature LGBT interpretations of Hindu myths include the books ''Siva: The Erotic Ascetic'', ''Tales of Sex and Violence'',&lt;ref&gt;Doniger O'Flaherty (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Splitting the difference: gender and myth in ancient Greece and India''.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Michael Witzel]], a Professor of Sanskrit, said that Wendy Doniger's knowledge of Vedic Sanskrit is severely flawed.&lt;ref&gt;''Invading the Sacred'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Kazanas]], a European Indologist, has also criticised Doniger's works and wrote that Doniger seems to be obsessed with only one meaning of myths: the most sexual imaginable.&lt;ref name="kazanas"&gt;Kazanas, Nicholas. Indo-European Deities and the Rgveda. Journal of Indo-European Studies, vol. 29, nos. 3–4 (Fall &amp; Winter 2001), pp. 257–293. Footnote #14 on page 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Reynard-the-fox.jpg|thumb|200px|The trickster figure [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] as depicted in an 1869 children's book by [[Michel Rodange]].]]
This '''list of tricksters''' attests to both the enduring nature of the [[Mythology|mythological]] figure of the [[trickster]] and its continued popularity in a variety of [[Mass media|media]].

The trickster in later folklore or modern popular culture, is a clever, mischievous person or creature, who achieves his or her ends through the use of trickery. A trickster may trick others simply for their amusement, they could be a physically weak character trying to survive in a dangerous world, or they could even be a personification of the chaos that the world needs to function.

An [[archetypical]] example is of a [[fairy tale]] of the King who puts [[Courtship|suitors]] for his daughter to the test.  No brave and valiant prince or knight succeeds, until a simple peasant arrives. Aided only by his natural wit, he evades danger and triumphs over monsters and villains without fighting.  Thus the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the prize. Such characters are a staple of animated [[cartoon]]s, in particular those used and developed by [[Tex Avery]] et al. during the [[Golden Age of American animation]].

== Characteristics ==
Hynes and Doty, in ''Mythical Trickster Figures'' (1997) state that every trickster has several of the following six traits:&lt;ref&gt;Hynes, William J. and William G. Doty. (1993).  ''Mythical Trickster Figures,'' (pp. 34-42). Tuscaloosa:The University of Alabama Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# fundamentally [[ambiguous]] and anomalous
# deceiver and trick-player
# [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifter]] or [[master of disguise]]
# situation-inverter
# messenger and imitator of the gods
# sacred and lewd [[bricoleur]]

The '''Loggia dei Lanzi''', also called the '''Loggia della Signoria''', is a building on a corner of the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], adjoining the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]]. It consists of wide arches open to the street. The arches rest on clustered pilasters with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals. The wide arches appealed so much to the Florentines that [[Michelangelo]] proposed that they should be continued all around the Piazza della Signoria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Sometimes erroneously referred to as ''[[Loggia]] dell' [[Andrea Orcagna|Orcagna]]''&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite book | first=Guido | last=Zucconi | year= 1995| title=Florence: An Architectural Guide | publisher=Arsenale Editrice srl | location=San Giovanni Lupatoto, Vr, Italy | isbn=88-7743-147-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was once thought to be designed by that artist, it was built between 1376 and 1382 by [[Benci di Cione]] and [[Simone di Francesco Talenti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=loggia | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly following a design by [[Jacopo di Sione]], to house the assemblies of the people and hold public ceremonies,&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; such as the swearing into office of the Gonfaloniers and the Priors. Simone Talenti is also well-known from his contributions to the churches [[Orsanmichele]] and San Carlo.

The vivacious construction of the Loggia is in stark contrast with the severe architecture of the Palazzo Vecchio. It is effectively an open-air sculpture gallery of antique and [[Renaissance art]].

The name ''Loggia dei Lanzi'' dates back to the reign of Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], when it was used to house his formidable [[landsknecht]]s (In Italian: "Lanzichenecchi", corrupted to ''Lanzi''), or German mercenary pikemen.&lt;ref name=arch/&gt; After the construction of the Uffizi at the rear of the Loggia, the Loggia's roof was modified by [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] and became a terrace from which the [[Medici]] princes could watch ceremonies in the piazza.

==Description==

=== Architectural setting ===
[[Image:Firenze-piazza signoria statue02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus]]'', a much-restored Roman sculpture]]
On the façade of the Loggia, below the [[parapet]], are [[trefoil]]s with allegorical figures of the four [[cardinal virtues]] (Fortitude, Temperance, Justice and Prudence) by [[Agnolo Gaddi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=Gaddi, Agnolo | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their blue enamelled background is the work of  Leonardo, a monk, while the golden stars were painted by  Lorenzo de' Bicci. The vault, composed of semicircles, was done by the Florentine [[Antonio de' Pucci]]. On the steps of the Loggia are the ''[[Medici lions]]''; two [[Marzocco]]s{{citation needed|reason=The Marzocco seems to be a sitting lion with a escutcheon.|date=January 2016}}, marble statues of lions, heraldic symbols of Florence; that on the right is from Roman times and the one on the left was sculpted by [[Flaminio Vacca]] in 1598. It was originally placed in the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome, but found its final place in the Loggia in 1789.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

On the side of the Loggia, there is a [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription from 1750 commemorating the change of the Florentine calendar in 1749 to bring it into line with the Roman calendar. The Florentine calendar began on 25 March instead of 1 January. The other inscription from 1893 records the Florentines who distinguished themselves during the annexation of [[Milan]] (1865), [[Venice]] (1866) and Rome (1871) to the kingdom of Italy.

[[File:Lion of Loggia de' Lanzi right.JPG|thumb|200px|One of the ''[[Medici lions]]''.]]
Underneath the bay on the far left is the [[bronze statue]] of ''[[Perseus]]'' by [[Benvenuto Cellini]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=Florence | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the mythical Greek hero holding his sword in his right hand and holding up the [[Medusa]]'s severed head in his left. The well-proportioned muscular body of Perseus stands poised on the right leg. Perseus is reflecting and he seems to be frightened by his same action. Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Minerva]] and [[Danaë]]. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing ''Perseus freeing Andromeda'', is a copy of the one in [[Bargello]].

[[Benvenuto Cellini]] worked almost ten years on this bronze (1545-1554). His wax design was immediately approved by [[Cosimo I de' Medici]]. He met numerous difficulties which, according to his autobiography, almost brought him to the brink of death. The casting of this bronze statue was several times unsuccessful. When attempting again, the melting furnace got overheated, spoiling the casting of the bronze. Cellini gave orders to feed the furnace with his household furniture and finally with about 200 pewter dishes and plates, and his pots and pans. This caused the bronze to flow again. After the bronze had cooled, the statue was finished, except for three toes on the right foot. These were added later.
[[Image:Giambologna sabine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Rape of the Sabine Women''.]]

On the far right is the [[Mannerism|manneristic]] group ''[[Rape of the Sabine Women (Giambologna)|Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' by the Flemish artist Jean de Boulogne, better known by his Italianized name [[Giambologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=Giambologna | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impressive work was made from one imperfect block of white marble, the largest block ever transported to Florence. The goccia model is now in the Galleria dell' Academia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofflorence.org/English/Friends/press.htm Copy of the rape of the Sabine Woman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219175733/http://www.friendsofflorence.org/English/Friends/press.htm |date=19 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giambologna wanted to create a composition with the ''figura serpentina'', an upward snakelike spiral movement to be examined from all sides. This is the first group representing more than a single figure in European sculptural history  to be conceived without a dominant viewpoint.  It can be equally admired from all sides. The marble pedestal, also by Giambologna, represents bronze bas-reliefs with the same theme. This marble and bronze group is in the Loggia since 1583.

Nearby is Giambologna's less celebrated [[marble sculpture]] ''Hercules beating the Centaur Nessus'' (1599) and placed here in 1841 from the Canto de' Carnesecchi. It was sculpted from one solid block of white marble with the help of Pietro Francavilla

The group ''[[Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus]]'', discovered in [[Rome]] stood originally at the southern end of the [[Ponte Vecchio]]. There is another version of this much-restored Roman marble in the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. It is an ancient Roman sculpture from the [[Flavius|Flavian]] era, copied from a [[Pergamum|Hellenistic Pergamene]] original of the mid third century BC. This marble group was discovered in Rome.  It has undergone restorations by Ludovico Salvetti, to a model by [[Pietro Tacca]] (1640) and by Stefano Ricci (about 1830).

The group ''The Rape of [[Polyxena]]'', is a fine diagonal sculpture by [[Pio Fedi]] from 1865.
[[Image:PolyxenaFedi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Rape of Polyxena'']]

On the back of the Loggia are five marble female statues (three are identified as Matidia, Marciana and Agrippina Minor),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfmN96E_VHgC&amp;pg=PA114 Giovanna Giusti Galardi, The Statues of the Loggia Della Signoria in Florence]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabine]]s and a statue of a barbarian prisoner [[Thusnelda]] from Roman times from the era of [[Trajan]] to [[Hadrian]]. They were discovered in Rome in 1541. The statues had been in the Medici villa at Rome since 1584 and were brought here by Pietro Leopoldo in 1789. They all have significant, modern restorations.

The [[Feldherrnhalle]] in [[Munich]], commissioned by King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] to honor the tradition of his military, was modelled after the Loggia dei Lanzi.

'''Lycos' Top 5%''' was a [[web directory]] run by [[Lycos]] that aimed to review, categorize and award the top 5% of all [[website]]s. Top 5% was started in 1994 by [[Point Communications]] and was a pioneer in the field.  In 1997, it was acquired by [[Lycos]], and its founder, Chris Kitze&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskitze/|title=Chris Kitze|last=|first=|date=|website=LinkedIn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Who's created a digital currency called "Flash Coin" that using FalunDafa practitioners to get illicit profits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moitruongphapluancongvn.org/single-post/2018/07/17/Vo-Hoang-Vinh-1-dien-hinh-ve-su-pha-hoai-trong-noi-bo-hoc-vien-Phap-Luan-Cong-tai-Viet-Nam-hien-nay|title=Võ Hoàng Vinh – điển hình phá hoại trong nội bộ hv Pháp Luân Công VN {{!}} Trang chủ {{!}} Việt Nam {{!}} Sự thật môi trường Pháp Luân Công|website=Trang chủ {{!}} Việt Nam {{!}} Sự thật m&amp;ocirc;i trường Ph&amp;aacute;p Lu&amp;acirc;n C&amp;ocirc;ng|language=vi|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, his co-creater is Vo Hoang Vinh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moitruongphapluancongvn.org/single-post/2018/08/15/Ai-dang-kiem-soat-vnminghuiorg-minhuenet-vifalundafaorg-phapluanorg-va-chanhkienorg-tieng-viet|title=Ai đang thao túng vn.minghui.org(Minhhue.net),vi.falundafa.org VN {{!}} Trang chủ {{!}} Việt Nam {{!}} Sự thật môi trường Pháp Luân Công|website=Trang chủ {{!}} Việt Nam {{!}} Sự thật m&amp;ocirc;i trường Ph&amp;aacute;p Lu&amp;acirc;n C&amp;ocirc;ng|language=vi|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and editor Mark Simmer, both became Vice Presidents of Lycos. The Top 5% directory received an upgrade in June 1997.  It was then edited by Tim Riley.

Lycos retired the Top 5% directory in 2000. [[Webmaster]]s of sites listed in the directory were allowed and encouraged to include a banner on their home page to announce its TOP 5% status. "Top 5%" was an entirely arbitrary designation, with the editors simply picking excellent websites from the few available in the early days of the Internet.

'''Music Maker Relief Foundation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], based in [[Hillsborough, North Carolina]]. Music Maker Relief Foundation was founded in 1994 by Tim and Denise Duffy to "help the true pioneers and forgotten heroes of Southern music gain recognition and meet their day-to-day needs. Music Maker presents these musical traditions to the world so American culture will flourish and be preserved for future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicmaker.org/mission/ |title=The Music Maker Mission - Music Maker Relief Foundation |publisher=Musicmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001021745/http://www.musicmaker.org/mission/ |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
In 1989, while completing his studies for a master's degree in [[Folklore]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], Tim Duffy was documenting [[blues]] musician James "Guitar Slim" Stephens for the university's Southern Folklife Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/d/Duffy,Timothy.html |title=Timothy Duffy Collection, 1990-2004 |publisher=Lib.unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens's health was in decline, and shortly before his death, he advised Duffy to locate a musician named [[Guitar Gabriel]].

After his graduation, Duffy began working as a substitute teacher at a middle school in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], hearing an assortment of folkloric tales about Guitar Gabriel from students, until one student volunteered that Gabriel was her neighbor, living in the [[public housing|government housing projects]] of Winston-Salem. That evening, Duffy followed the student's directions to a "drink house" in the neighborhood, where he met Gabriel's nephew, Hawkeye, who took him to meet Gabriel. Duffy forged a close friendship with Gabriel, and the two began recording and performing under the name Guitar Gabriel &amp; Brothers in the Kitchen, releasing the album ''Do You Know What it Means to Have a Friend?'' (also known as ''Toot Blues'') on their own Karibu label in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/guitgfrm.htm|title=Guitar Gabriel|publisher=Wirz.de|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel had been inactive in the music industry since the 1970 release of his album ''My South, My Blues'' (as Nyles Jones) on the Gemini label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Nyles-Jones-My-South-My-Blues/release/2604538 |title=Nyles Jones - My South My Blues (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had received no royalties {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and was impoverished. He required almost daily assistance from Duffy, who provided transportation to medical appointments, money, and food for Gabriel and his wife. Through Gabriel, Tim and Denise Duffy made field recordings of other local blues musicians, such as Captain Luke, Macavine Hayes, Mr. Q., and Willa Mae Buckner.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} They lived in poor conditions and needed regular assistance.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Duffy thought their culture was slipping away unnoticed by the music industry.

Tim Duffy's father, Allen Duffy, a lawyer, had represented and won a case for audio pioneer [[Mark Levinson (audio equipment designer)|Mark Levinson]], allowing him to continue working in the [[High fidelity|hi-fi]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesart.at/NeueSeiten/TIM+DUFFY.html |title=Tim Duffy And Music Maker |publisher=Bluesart.at |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson heard about Tim Duffy's field recordings, some reminiscent of the work of [[John Lomax|John]] and [[Alan Lomax]], and invited Duffy to visit his stereo showroom in New York. After hearing the recordings, as well as the stories of the many destitute musicians, Levinson offered to remaster the tapes, which became an eight-artist CD anthology of traditional North Carolina blues entitled ''A Living Past''. Levinson became a crusader for the cause, and solicited funds and industry connections from his friends and colleagues, which, in 1994, resulted in the incorporation of the Music Maker Relief Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;from an interview of Tim Duffy on the [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode219 Americana Music Show #219], published November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995–present===
In 1995, Tim Duffy met [[Eric Clapton]] in a [[Manhattan]] bistro, sharing some of his field recordings, as well as the philosophy and goals of the foundation, after which Clapton became a supporter, introducing artists such as [[B.B. King]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Ron Wood]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Rosanne Cash]], all of whom donated to the Music Maker Relief Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/musicmakers/mm5100.html |title=American Blues-Music Maker Relief Foundation: Music Maker Article |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy was invited to the Los Angeles studio where B.B. King's album ''[[Deuces Wild (B. B. King album)|Deuces Wild]]'' was recorded and where he met [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], who contributed to the foundation's growth and success.

By 1996, after receiving several sizable donations, Music Maker Relief Foundation had established the Musician Sustenance, Musical Development, and Cultural Access Programs, which provide food, monetary assistance, transportation to doctor's appointments and to pick up medications, home repairs (in some cases, extremely poor living conditions have warranted the relocation of the musician), performance bookings in professional venues, such as the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] and [[Carnegie Hall]], as well as European tours and music festivals worldwide. The success of which is due, in large part, to Taj Mahal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/articles/view/title:tim_duffy_music_maker_relief_foundation |title=Tim Duffy: Music Maker Relief Foundation |publisher=Swampland |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who by 1997 had become an advisory board member, artistic consultant, contributor, and co-producer for many of the artists' records. Taj Mahal headlined blues festivals in support of Music Maker, was instrumental in securing advertising in mainstream print media, as well as the creation of the "Fishin' Blues Tournament", which raises funds for the foundation. Over the next several years, many new donors and contributors were involved, allowing Duffy to expand the roster of the label, and to release over one hundred albums, the proceeds of which the artists keep, in their entirety. Many of the label's artists have been documented in the collaborative work of artists [[Harvey Pekar]] and [[Gary Dumm]], who have contributed artwork since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmaker.org/comics/ |title=Comics - Music Maker Relief Foundation |publisher=Musicmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose work was featured in a 2010 calendar, created as a fundraiser for Music Maker Relief Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmaker.org/articles_post/harvey/ |title=Harvey Pekar/Gary Dumm 2010 Calendar in the News - Articles - Music Maker Relief Foundation |publisher=Musicmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Tim Duffy saw the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] performing at the Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance in [[Silk Hope, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wake Zine|title=Feature {{!}} Carolina Chocolate Drops|url=http://wakezine.com/carolina-chocolate-drops/|website=Wakezine.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy signed a management deal with the group and released their debut record, ''Dona Got a Ramblin' Mind'' on the Music Maker Label. During Duffy's time as manager the Carolina Chocolate Drops won a [[Grammy Award]] in 2010 for Best Traditional Folk Album with their first album on [[Nonesuch Records]], ''Genuine Negro Jig''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weston|first1=Keith|title=Grammys: Steep Canyon Rangers Win Best Bluegrass Album, Avett Brothers &amp; Chocolate Drops Miss|url=http://wunc.org/post/grammys-steep-canyon-rangers-win-best-bluegrass-album-avett-brothers-chocolate-drops-miss|website=Wunc.org|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chocolate Drops second release with Nonesuch, ''Leaving Eden'' was nominated for a Grammy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 2014, the Music Maker Relief Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary with an exhibit of 28 photographs of Music Maker artists. The exhibit was previewed at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. A double-disc compilation album and 144-page photo book is also set to be released in honor of the foundation's anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mazor|first1=Barry|title=Giving Them a Hand The Music Maker Foundation Celebrates 20 Years.|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/giving-music-makers-a-hand-1407362559|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2014 [[PBS NewsHour]] aired segment on the Music Maker Relief Foundation, showing [[William R. Ferris]] say, "They provide a model for what our nation should be doing. The New Deal under FDR did this for the entire nation, and Tim Duffy thankfully is doing it for the community of blues artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Music Maker eases the blues for down-and-out artists|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/music-maker-eases-blues-artists/|website=Pbs.org|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North Greenwood Library''' is a public library that is part of the [[Clearwater Public Library System|Clearwater Library System]] which, in turn, is part of the [[Pinellas Public Library Cooperative]]. Located at 905 N Martin Luther King Jr. Ave, its current Branch Manager is Christa Smith.

== Services ==

There is a computer lab with free internet access and free Wi-Fi throughout the library. For non library members, there are two 15 minute express computers. The library offers paid copy and scanning services. It does not have a fax machine. The library has one community room that is used for programs and can be reserved through the online calendar. The newly renovated children's area has Lego tables and coloring areas as well as coloring materials. There is a high definition television that kids can use to watch [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G or PG rated]] DVDs and Blu-rays with librarian permission. All books are free to be read inside the library without needing to be checked out. With a library card issued from North Greenwood and other Clearwater Libraries, patrons have access to online applications and materials such as [[OverDrive, Inc.|Overdrive]], [http://www.pronunciator.com/ Pronunciator], Zinio, 3M, and [[Hoopla (digital media service)|Hoopla]].

== History ==
During the 1940s, the black community felt that they should have a library for their children and the future generations. The City Commission agreed to fund a library as long as the community found a building and librarian willing to work there. The library, simply referred to as the "Negro Library", first opened on March 15, 1950 on the corner of Pennsylvania and Cedar Street in a rented building space. [[Christine Wigfall Morris]] was the librarian who first opened the doors of the library and was the first black Librarian to work in Clearwater, Fl.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater Library History http://www.myclearwaterlibrary.com/learn/historical-information/clearwater-library-history&lt;/ref&gt;

The library, loved by both the community and "Miss Chris", outgrew its rented space so a building was officially built for the collection on Palmetto street. The new building, named the Northeast Library and designed by Eugene Beach, was meant to be run by a single librarian— [[Christine Wigfall Morris|Christine Morris]]. It opened in September, 1962 with a collection of 15,000 books. Christine Morris worked tirelessly to keep the library open acting as not only a librarian, but also janitor and community counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Johnston. "Christine Wigfall Morris" Women of Library History. http://womenoflibraryhistory.tumblr.com/post/115029361252/christine-wigfall-morris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castillo, P. (2011). LONGTIME LIBRARIAN LOOKS BACK; Christine Morris, a trailblazer in Clearwater, writes a book about 'the legacy of my family and the community.'. The St. Petersburg Times (St. Petersburg, FL).&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1983, after Morris' retirement, that the library received its current name of North Greenwood Library.

In 1970 the "Edward Allen Henry Jr. Special Collection on Negro Culture and History" was added to the library. In 2002 the special collection's name was changed to "The [[Christine Wigfall Morris]] African American Collection" in honor of her decades of work and dedication to the library and the community. In an interview, [[Christine Wigfall Morris|Christine Morris]] commented that the community believed the whole library should be named in her honor but the city said she would have to be deceased in order for it to be allowed. She preferred to be alive and see the collection named after herself than to be dead and not see the whole building named.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. W. (2011). NEWSMAKER: CHRISTINE WIGFALL MORRIS.

Its grand opening was January 18, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;"Library Closing To Relocate, Begin New Chapter." Tampa Tribune [Tampa, FL] 29 Dec. 2002: 3. Business Insights: Essentials.

2009 proved to be a worrisome year for North Greenwood Library, as well as East Library, as budget cuts threatened to close the facility and move the collection to a space inside the North Greenwood Recreation center. In protest of closing the library, the NAACP and local ministers staged marches to save the library.&lt;ref&gt;Brassfield, Mike.

While many people disagreed with the tax increase, one counsel member remarked how surprised she was that so many of her constituents were willing to accept the tax increase if it meant the libraries stayed open.&lt;ref&gt;Brassfield, Mike.

{{Israel-Palestinian Peace Process}}

The '''Palestine Papers''' is a collection of confidential documents about the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]] [[news leak|leaked]] to [[Al Jazeera]], which published them between 23 and 26 January 2011. Nearly 1,700 of documents from the office of the main [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] negotiator, Sa'eb Erekat, and his team have been published, dating from 1999 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Introducing The Palestine Papers |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/palestinepapers/2011/01/201112214310263628.html |date=23 January 2011 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FAQ: The Palestine Papers |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011123114726552723.html |date=23 January 2011 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=story_behind&gt;''Guardian'', 24 January 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/23/story-behind-leaked-palestine-papers "The story behind the Palestine papers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Jazeera and ''[[The Guardian]]'' say they have authenticated the documents, and a media adviser to [[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] also affirmed their authenticity. Leaders of the [[Palestinian Authority]] have complained about the way the documents were presented by Al Jazeera.

== Background ==
The Palestine Papers uncover documents about the negotiations between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), the only recognized representative of the Palestinian people, and Israel from 1999 to 2010. The negotiations in 1993 that led to the [[Oslo Accords]] were the first direct negotiations between the parties. The following "peace process" focussed on the formation of the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) and the territory it would govern. The PA, however, represents only the local people in the [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]], not the Palestinians in the [[diaspora]].

In 2011, when the Papers were published, the negotiations were in a deadlock after the refusal in September 2010 of the [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] government to extend the freeze of [[Israeli settlement|settlements building]] over ten months. Ziyad Clot, the until now only identified source, felt frustrated about the fact that the great majority of the Palestinian people, the [[Palestinian right of return|refugees]], being one of the "remaining issues" in the "peace process", were not properly represented.&lt;ref name=pp_blew_the_whistle /&gt;

== Sources of the Papers ==
The documents were obtained by [[Al Jazeera]] and shared in advance of publication with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in an effort to ensure the wider availability of their content. ''The Guardian'' has authenticated the bulk of the Papers independently, but has not sought or been given access to the sources of the documents. Al Jazeera, which published the Papers on their website, has [[Redaction|redacted]] minimal parts of the papers to protect their sources' identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Palestine papers: Editor's note |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/23/palestine-papers-editors-note |date=23 January 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=23 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NSU ===
Most of the documents are from the Palestinian negotiation support unit (NSU). The NSU was the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO's]] main technical and legal advice organ in the peace negotiations, set up in 1999 and headed by [[Saeb Erekat]].&lt;ref name=story_behind /&gt; Gershon Baskin, codirector of [[Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information|Israel/Palestinian Center for Research]], said, "I'm 100 percent sure that it's a former disgruntled employed" member of the Negotiations Support Unit headed by Palestinian chief negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]]. Israel's Channel 10 news show also named the source of the leak as a former member of the NSU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Possible source of Palestine papers leak |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0125/Possible-source-of-Palestine-papers-leak |date=25 January 2011 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clayton Swisher ===
On 27 January 2011, following Al Jazeera's broadcast of the Palestine Papers, Saeb Erekat appeared on Al Jazeera Arabic, condemning the publication. He accused Al Jazeera journalist [[Clayton Swisher]], who delivered the disclosure of the Palestine Papers, of being a CIA agent and of working for the NSU. He also said that former British intelligence officer [[Alastair Crooke]] was involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011127163052761490.html Erekat condemns Palestine Papers]. Al Jazeera, 27 January 2011 (video)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ma'an News Agency]], Erekat later admitted Clayton Swisher neither worked for the Palestinians nor the US intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=356993 Palestinian negotiator backtracks on CIA charge]. George Hale, Ma'an News Agency, 4 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after the publication of the Palestine Papers, on 11 February 2011, Erekat resigned as Chief PLO Negotiator, citing the release of the papers and due to an internal Palestinian investigation that suggested the Palestine Papers leak had come from a source inside Erekat's office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011212135152355248.html Erekat quits over Palestine Papers]. Al Jazeera, 13 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jlNVedQZfU1Y6iuRI0EiYMsc2ZfQ?docId=CNG.34b0a7cfb441605b61894f84b5a9eda2.b71 Palestinian election plan runs into Hamas obstacle]. Nasser Abu Bakr, AFP, 12 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, however, he was still holding the function of Chief Palestinian Negotiator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erekat to remain chief PA negotiator|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/225091|website=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Palestine Papers: The End of the Road?'', Swisher confirmed account, as he wrote, "In the fall of 2010, I traveled the world meeting with US, Israeli, and Palestinian Authority officials who had no idea that I held in my possession the secret records of their negotiations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Palestine-Papers-End-Road/dp/1843913534 |title=The Palestine Papers: The End of the Road?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=Amazon.com |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complaint filed by Erekat and the PLO against Al Jazeera and Clayton Swisher on grounds of unfairness was wholly dismissed in a 19-page ruling released in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb191/obb191.pdf |date=10 October 2011 |work=Ofcom |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ofcom's ruling on the Palestine papers offers hope to the Middle East |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/10/ofcom-al-jazeera-palestine-papers |date=10 October 2011 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ziyad Clot ===
In a 14 May 2011 op-ed article in the ''Guardian'', Ziyad Clot, a French lawyer of Palestinian descent and a former adviser for the NSU involved in 2008 Annapolis negotiations exposed himself as one of the sources of the leaks. In the ''Guardian'' article, Clot said that the so-called peace process was "an inequitable and destructive political process which had been based on the assumption that the Palestinians could in effect negotiate their rights and achieve self-determination while enduring the hardship of the Israeli occupation". He also said that "the "peace negotiations" were a deceptive farce whereby biased terms were unilaterally imposed by Israel and systematically endorsed by the US and EU". Clot emphasized that "these negotiations excluded for the most part the great majority of the Palestinian people: the seven million Palestinian refugees". He felt "that the PLO, given its structure, was not in a position to represent all Palestinian rights and interests". Clot resigned from the NSU after he witnessed the killing of more than 1,400 Palestinians in Gaza during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. After he resigned, he believed he had a duty to inform the public. In the Guardian article, he also stated: "In full conscience, and acting independently, I later agreed to share some information with al-Jazeera specifically with regard to the fate of Palestinian refugee rights in the 2008 talks. Other sources did the same, although I am unaware of their identity."&lt;ref name=pp_blew_the_whistle&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/14/blew-the-whistle-about-palestine?CMP=twt_g Why I blew the whistle about Palestine], ''The Guardian'', 14 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/french-lawyer-reveals-himself-as-palestine-papers-source-1.361679 French lawyer reveals himself as 'Palestine papers' source]. ''Haaretz'', 14 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== The documents ==

=== Character of the documents ===
The ''Palestine Papers'' include many [[minutes]] of bilateral meetings between Israel and the Palestinians and with the USA as well as minutes of joint trilateral meetings. They also include other documents, such as memos, [[email]]s, letters, strategy papers, a matrix of positions&lt;ref name=positions_matrix&gt;[http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218233256500873.html Current P/I positions reflecting discussion up to June 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and even maps of possible land swaps&lt;ref name=landswaps&gt;[http://transparency.aljazeera.net/files/2648.PDF Meeting Minutes On Borders], 4 May 2008. On [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121823285937752.html]; [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/files/4736.PDF Summary of Olmert’s “Package” Offer to Abu Mazen], 31 August 2008. On [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121821046718794.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Presentation program|power point presentations]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/2590.pdf Water for a Viable Palestinian State], 17 May 2008. On [http://thepalestinepapers.com/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218232625296694.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/4440.PDF Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: Challenges to a Negotiated Solution], 1 February 2009. On [http://thepalestinepapers.com/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218205458750797.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were published 1,684 total documents, including:
* 275 sets of meeting minutes;
* 690 internal emails;
* 153 reports and studies;
* 134 sets of talking points and prep notes for meetings;
* 64 draft agreements;
* 54 maps, charts and graphs;
* and 51 "non-papers".

[[Akiva Eldar]], writing in ''[[Haaretz]]'', said that the documents are more important than those released by Wikileaks because they deal with current issues regarding permanent borders in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Akiva Eldar, [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-palestine-papers-al-jazeera-trumps-wikileaks-1.338875 The Palestine papers: Al-Jazeera trumps WikiLeaks], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 24 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlements ===
At a meeting in November 2007, [[Tzipi Livni]] told [[Ahmed Qurei]] that "I understand the sentiments of the Palestinians when they see the settlements being built. The meaning from the Palestinian perspective is that Israel takes more land, that the Palestinian state will be impossible, the Israel policy is to take more and more land day after day and that at the end of the day we'll say that it is impossible, we already have the land and cannot create the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/feb/12/corrections-clarifications?INTCMP=SRCH |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Corrections and clarifications |date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the documents, in a meeting with Livni in Jerusalem, Qurei proposed that Israel annex all settlements along the border except for the large cities and towns of [[Giv'at Ze'ev]], [[Ma'ale Adumim]], [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], and [[Efrat]].&lt;ref name=globeandmail&gt;Patrick Martin, ''The Globe and Mail'', 23 August 2012, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/israel-rejected-historic-concessions-palestine-papers-reveal/article580377/?page=all Israel rejected historic concessions, 'Palestine Papers' reveal]&lt;/ref&gt; Livni rejected Qurei's demands that Israel cede these settlements. Qurei suggested to Livni that these settlements be placed under Palestinian sovereignty, but Livni told him "you know this is not realistic". [[Condoleezza Rice]] similarly told Qurei that "I don't think that any Israeli leader is going to cede Ma'ale Adumim", to which Qurei replied "or any Palestinian". Rice then told him "Then you won't have a state!"&lt;ref name=biggest_Yerushalayim&gt;Al Jazeera − Palestine Papers, 23 January 2011, [http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011122112512844113.html "The biggest Yerushalayim"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Napkin map ===
"Napkin map" is a colloquial name for a Palestinian sketch made by Palestinian Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] on a napkin, of a map with land swap proposals shown to him by then Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] during peace negotiations in mid-2008. According to Al Jazeera, Abbas was not allowed to keep the unofficial map, so he sketched it by hand. During the first of several meetings, the Palestinian Authority proposed a land swap, offering Israel the opportunity to annex all of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem in return for land concessions by Israel. Olmert, however, offered no concessions in return but an even more aggressive land swap.&lt;ref name=pp_napkinmap_revealed&gt;Al Jazeera – Palestine Papers, [http://english.aljazeera.net/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011122114239940577.html The "napkin map" revealed] The maps: [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/files/4736.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Prime Minister Olmert's own proposal, Israel would annex 6.3% &lt;ref name=rd_hamakor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetower.org/2580-breaking-abbas-admits-for-the-first-time-that-he-turned-down-peace-offer-in-2008/ |title=Hamakor: Raviv Drucker interview of Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas |last=Drucker |first=Raviv |date=17 November 2015 |publisher=[[Channel 10 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the West Bank. The land in Olmert's map included the four settlements of [[Gush Etzion]] (with [[Efrat]]), [[Ma'ale Adumim]], [[Giv'at Ze'ev]], and [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], in addition to all settlements in East Jerusalem ([[Har Homa]]). In exchange for those concessions by the Palestinian Authority, Olmert offered 5.8% &lt;ref name=rd_hamakor /&gt; of Israeli land as part of the swap. The land offered consisted of lightly populated farmland, which would be divided between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused to comply. Mahmoud Abbas was forced to sketch Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration.&lt;ref name=pp_Olmerts_offer&gt;Al Jazeera – Palestine Papers, [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121821046718794.html ''Summary of Ehud Olmert’s “Package” Offer to Mahmoud Abbas – August 31, 2008'']&lt;/ref&gt; This map was then later referred to as the ''Napkin map''.&lt;ref name=pp_napkinmap_revealed /&gt;

The third and final meeting occurred on 16 September 2008. It was during this time that Ehud Olmert was nearing the end of his political career. At the time, Olmert was under police investigation for alleged corruption that had occurred while he was Mayor of Jerusalem, and as a result of the accusations was not planning on running again. During the final meeting, Mahmoud Abbas was prepared by the Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) to clarify many questions regarding Ehud Olmert's peace plan in which Abbas was quoted as asking questions such as "How do you see it addressing our interests, especially as Ariel, Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Homa and Efrat clearly prejudice contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine?" as well as others about the value of the land that they would receive in such a swap in terms of value and size.&lt;ref name=pp_napkinmap_revealed /&gt;

The Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) also insisted that Prime Minister Olmert provide them with a copy of the map, which was again denied. In the end, however, Mahmoud Abbas asked for a few days to consider the offer. A day after this meeting, Olmert resigned and [[Tzipi Livni]] stepped in as Acting Prime Minister, with [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] being elected shortly afterward. Palestinian negotiators said Abbas had forgotten another appointment and postponed the next meeting. Netanyahu thought Olmert had made too many concessions and refused to continue from where the last round of negotiations had left off, preferring to restart the negotiations from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/01/30/goodspeed-analysis-a-palestine-that-might-have-been/ |title=Goodspeed Analysis: A Palestine that might have been |last=Goodspeed |first=Peter |date=30 January 2011 |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jerusalem ===
According to one of the documents, the Palestinian Authority was prepared to concede most [[Israeli settlements]] in [[East Jerusalem]], as well as the [[Armenian Quarter]], with the exception of [[Har Homa]]. The [[Temple Mount]] would be temporarily administrated by a joint body consisting of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United States]] until a permanent solution was reached.&lt;ref name=biggest_Yerushalayim /&gt;

At the meeting in Jerusalem in November 2007, Tzipi Livni became visibly angry when asked about the demographic composition of the future Israeli state. She was quoted as saying, "Israel the state of the Jewish people—and I would like to emphasize the meaning of 'its people' is the Jewish people—with Jerusalem the united and undivided capital of Israel and of the Jewish people for 3,007 years". The Palestinians team then protested her position on Jerusalem. She responded by saying "Now I have to say, before we continue, in order to continue we have to put out Jerusalem from your statement and from our place. We have enough differences, without putting another one out there". &lt;ref name=PP_131107&gt;{{cite web|title=The Palestine Papers: Meeting Minutes: 8th Negotiation Team Meeting|url=http://www.ajtransparency.com/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121823740234656.html|work=Al Jazeera Transparency Unit|publisher=Al Jazeera Media Network|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
The minutes of the trilateral meeting on 26 August 2008 reveal that Israel not only demands a "demilitarized" Palestinian state, but also wants to keep control over borders, Jordan Valley and airspace, after withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the West Bank, for reasons of security.
[[Tzipi Livni]]: "In the Jordan Valley – what will be between Palestine and Jordan. EWS. [Early Warning Stations] ... the I is that we will have something on the crossings, borders, etc ... The idea is to withdraw, but to keep a presence, not close to the situation today, on the EWS, on passages&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=PP_260808&gt;Al Jazeera – Palestine Papers, [http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/3242.PDF Meeting Summary, 26 August 2008], second part, pp. 18–19; on [http://thepalestinepapers.com/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218203227453537.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refugees ===
Yankie Galenty, a media adviser for [[Ehud Olmert]], affirmed the complete authenticity of the documents in an interview. In regards to refugees, he stated that "Olmert, from day one, did not deceive Abu Mazen and told him that Israel will not allow the return of refugees and not one refugee will return to the land of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/4739/World/Region/Olmert-adviser-says-AlJazeera-leaks--correct.aspx Olmert adviser says Al-Jazeera leaks 100% correct], ''Al-Ahram'', 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other officials in the Israeli government asked for a limited right of return numbering between five and ten thousand, out of a total of five million refugees, who would be carefully picked by Israel and allowed to stay under "humanitarian conditions".

US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] proposed settling Palestinians refugees in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] as an alternative to letting them return to former homes in Israel and the occupied territories during a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/24/condoleezza-rice-palestinian-refugees-south-america |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Rory |last=Carroll |title=Condoleezza Rice: send Palestinian refugees to South America |date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her memoirs, [[Condoleezza Rice]] wrote that Olmert initially proposed that Israel accept 5,000 Palestinians refugees. Abbas rejected the offer, saying, "I can't tell four million Palestinians that only 5,000 of them can go home".&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=243917 |title=Rice reveals concessions in 2008 peace talks |last=Stoil |first=Rebecca Anna |date=11 January 2011 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919025443/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=243917 |archivedate=19 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second night of the Al-Jazeera broadcast, Israelis and Palestinians eventually agreed that Israel would accept 10,000 refugees.&lt;ref name="gave up"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/24/papers-palestinian-leaders-refugees-fight?intcmp=239 |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Ian |last1=Black |first2=Seumas |last2=Milne |title=Papers reveal how Palestinian leaders gave up fight over refugees |date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Palestinian Authority ===
Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said the leaked documents deliberately confuse Israeli and Palestinian positions, and that he had kept the [[Arab League]] updated on all details of the negotiations with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=alja24 /&gt; Chief Palestinian negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]] said the leaks were "a pack of lies", containing mistakes and inaccuracies and that his words were taken out of context and he had been misquoted.&lt;ref name=alja24&gt;{{cite news |title=PA negotiators reject leaked report |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011123234940952149.html |date=24 January 2011 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Palestinians question 'offers' leaked by al-Jazeera |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12263671 |date=24 January 2011 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erekat said that the "Palestinian Authority would never give up any of our rights. If we did indeed offer Israel the Jewish and Armenian Quarters of Jerusalem, and the biggest Yerushalayim as they claim, then why did Israel not sign a final status agreement? Is it not strange that we would offer all these concessions which Israel demands, yet there is still no peace deal?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12263671 |publisher=BBC News |title=Palestinians attack al-Jazeera 'distorted' talks leaks |date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yasser Abed Rabbo]], giving the PA's first official response, accused ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' and the Government of [[Qatar]] of attacking the Palestinian Authority, having a hostile attitude towards the PA since the days of former president [[Yasser Arafat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/4721/World/Region/PA-hits-back-at-Qatar%E2%80%99s-Amir.aspx PA hits back at Qatar’s Amir], ''Al-Ahram'', 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Abed Rabbo was quoted saying that the Al-Jazeera leaks are "a distortion of the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/24/palestine-papers-distortion-truth-reaction |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Ian |last1=Black |first2=Seumas |last2=Milne |first3=Harriet |last3=Sherwood |title=Palestine papers are distortion of truth, say Palestinian officials |date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abed Rabbo accused the [[Emir of Qatar]], Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]], of giving Al Jazeera the "green light" to start the campaign, and called on the Emir to "extend the climate of transparency in his own state and reveal his true relations with Israel and [[Iran]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahmoud Abbas: Palestine Papers "fraudulent disinformation campaign"|url=http://www.vancouverite.com/2011/01/25/mahmoud-abbas-palestine-papers-fraudulent-disinformation-campaign/|work=Vancouverite|accessdate=19 June 2012|author=Yehonathan Tommer|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahmoud al-Zahar]], a senior [[Hamas]] official in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], stated that the [[Palestinian Authority]] officials should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;ref name=alja24 /&gt;

[[Ahmed Qurei]], former [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority]] and chief Palestinian negotiator in the 2008 talks, said that "many parts of the documents were fabricated, as part of the incitement against the [[Palestinian Authority]] and the Palestinian leadership".&lt;ref name=alja24 /&gt;

[[Nasser Gawi]], a lead organizer for demonstrations in the Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Sheikh Jarrah]], where he had been recently evicted by Israeli settlers from his home, was quoted as saying "Erekat must have become more Zionist than Zionist. He has no mandate to give up Sheikh Jarrah or an inch of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian map of dividing Jerusalem 'out of touch with reality', says cartographer|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/palestinian-map-of-dividing-jerusalem-out-of-touch-with-reality-says-cartographer-1.338995|work=Haaretz|accessdate=19 June 2012|author=Nir Hasson|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
[[Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Avigdor Lieberman]] said that "even the most left-wing government of Olmert and Livni did not manage to reach a peace agreement, despite the many concessions." He also promoted his [[Lieberman Plan|plan]] for peace, which would allocate 45% to 50% of the [[West Bank]] for the creation of a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lieberman-leaked-palestinian-papers-prove-interim-deal-is-only-option-1.338872 Lieberman: Leaked Palestinian papers prove interim deal is only option], Haaretz, 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Livni said that "the [peace] process did not fail and was not exhausted. It did not end, but was not allowed to ripen until an agreement was reached because of elections in Israel and this government's choice not to continue the negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livni: 'Palestine Papers' show peace process is not over|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=205042|work=Jerusaem Post|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">'''''Peters, Flamman and Company v Kokstad Municipality''''',&lt;ref&gt;1919 AD 427.&lt;/ref&gt; decided by Solomon JA, is an important case in [[South African contract law]], specifically in the area of [[South_African_contract_law#Termination_of_obligations|termination]] and supervening impossibility of performance.

The company had entered into a twenty-year contract with the municipality to light its street lamps.&lt;ref&gt;This was, in those days, a manual task.&lt;/ref&gt; It managed this without trouble for more than ten years, at which point [[World War I]] broke out. The company was run and staffed by Germans, who were designated enemies of state and interned forthwith in prisoner-of-war camps. The company was handed over to and wound up by the state.

The company was clearly unable any longer to carry out its contractual obligations, so Kokstad Municipality sued for breach of contract. Solomon determined that, owing the [[South African contract law#Supervening impossibility of performance|supervening circumstances]], performance was objectively impossible (''casus fortuitus''), and that the contract should therefore be terminated. The company's failure to perform was excused, "as no-one in those circumstances would be able to perform the contract and the impossibility is not due to his or her [that is, the company's] fault."&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis ''et al'' 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Physicians' Desk Reference''''' ('''''PDR''''') is a commercially published compilation of manufacturers' prescribing information ([[package insert]]) on [[prescription drug]]s, updated annually. While designed to provide [[physician]]s with the full legally mandated information relevant to writing prescriptions (just as its name suggests), it is widely available in [[Library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s, widely used by other medical specialists, and sometimes valuable to the [[layman]]. The compilation is financially supported in part by pharmaceutical manufacturing corporations which create drugs listed within its pages.

Since the late 20th century, a consumer edition has been offered at a much reduced price. Electronic editions are available on [[CD-ROM]] and the [[World Wide Web]] to subscribers. In 1984, Paul C. Kranz and Michael Grondin travelled to Oradell, New Jersey, and presented to Medical Economics (then-publisher of the ''PDR'') a prototype developed by Grondin on a [[TI 99/4A]] computer of how a digital copy of the PDR would work and benefit clinicians. The idea originally conceived by Kranz was well received by the president and vice-president of IT and an agreement was struck to investigate. The result was the ''PDR'' on CD-ROM.  The main edition is usable by determined laypeople in conjunction with a [[medical dictionary]].

Today, the ''PDR'' is available in many forms, including the annual publication, online  (PDR.net), and integrated directly into [[electronic health record]] (EHR) systems.  

==About the ''PDR''==
The 2011 version is the 65th edition, and has information on over 1,116 of the most commonly prescribed drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PDR Bookstore.com: 2011 Physician's Desk Reference|url=https://www.pdrbookstore.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781563637803&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=BL&amp;PCS=PDR|accessdate=10 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829073953/https://www.pdrbookstore.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781563637803&amp;PG=1&amp;Type=BL&amp;PCS=PDR|archivedate=29 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quadrangle''' is the common name for a cluster of museums and cultural institutions in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts]], on Chestnut Street between State and Edwards Streets.

The [[Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden]], in the center of the Quadrangle, is surrounded by a park, a library, four active museums, a fifth museum due to open in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Opening Announcement|url=https://springfieldmuseums.org/about/dr-seuss-museum/|website=Springfield Museums|publisher=Springfield Museums|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cathedral. A second cathedral is just on the Quadrangle's periphery.

==Merrick Park==
On the corner of Chestnut and State Streets, '''Merrick Park''' is distinguished by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] "[[The Puritan (Springfield)|The Puritan]]," a statue depicting one of Springfield's settlers, [[Deacon Samuel Chapin]]. Springfield Central Library and [[Christ Church Cathedral (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Christ Church Cathedral]] are adjacent to the park.

==Springfield City Library==

[[File:1891 Springfield public library Massachusetts.png|left|thumb|1891]]
The Central Library, constructed in 1913, was paid for by [[Andrew Carnegie]].  It is the second library to be built at that location.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  The nonfiction department is based in Rice Hall (named for [[William Rice (Methodist minister)|William Rice]]), consisting of a main floor and mezzanine.  Opposite Rice Hall is the Arts and Music Hall, where multimedia, periodicals, and the computer lab are based.  The circulation desk lies in the rotunda between the two halls.  [[Fiction]], children's literature, and community rooms are in the basement. The Central Library also has a Teen Advisory Board — a grouping of teenagers who help make decisions and organize events at the library geared towards teenagers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Cathedrals ==
The Roman Catholic [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Springfield|St. Michael's Cathedral]] adjoins the neo-classical Springfield City Library at the southeast corner of the Quadrangle.

Also located near that edge of the Quadrangle is the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts' [[Christ Church Cathedral (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Christ Church Cathedral]].

'''''Roadfood''''' is a series of books by [[Jane and Michael Stern]] originally published in 1977. The term [[Road food|Roadfood]] was coined by the Sterns to describe the regional cuisine they discovered when they began driving around America in the early 1970s. Their focus was not on deluxe fare, but on everyday local food – [[barbecue]], [[chili con carne|chili]], [[fried chicken]], [[apple pie]] – and the unpretentious restaurants that serve it: [[diners]], small-town [[Coffeehouse|cafe]]s, seaside shacks, [[drive-ins]], and bake shops.

The Sterns, who had no formal training in cuisine or journalism, met at [[Yale University]] in 1968, married in 1970, and graduated in 1971, after which they left academia to explore the USA. At first, their focus was on popular culture in general, but after traveling around the country for a few years, they realized they had been keeping an informal diary of unknown and unique places to eat: inconspicuous restaurants that were, at the time, of no interest to the food-writing establishment. After three years of travel in a beat-up [[Volkswagen Beetle]], staying at seedy [[motel]]s, and occasionally sleeping in the back seat of the car, they drafted the manuscript of ''Roadfood'', a guide to restaurants that were neither fast food nor gourmet dining, but were an expression of local foodways. 

''Roadfood'' was a landmark, the first cross-country guide to regional American food. Since then, the Sterns have written ''Roadfood'' columns for [[Gourmet magazine]] and [[Saveur]] and report regularly about "road food" on public radio's "[[The Splendid Table]]." They have won numerous [[James Beard award]]s for their writing and have been inducted into the Who’s Who of American Food. 

The book ''Roadfood'' has been updated several times; the 10th edition will be published in 2017. Writing in the [[New York Times Book Review]] about ''Two for the Road'', the Sterns' memoir of their pursuit of "road food", [[Nora Ephron]] commented, "Jane and Michael Stern write about ordinary food so simply and exuberantly that I couldn't help thinking, as I read this latest book of theirs (the 31st), that they deserved a room of their own in the [[Smithsonian Institution]], right next to [[Julia Child]]'s Cambridge kitchen."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Event archive: Jane &amp; Michael Stern|date=January 12, 2010|publisher=Seattle Arts &amp; Lectures|url=http://www.lectures.org/about_us/event_archives.php?fromlist=1&amp;id=36|accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since its first publication, ''Roadfood'' has inspired countless other writers, television personalities, and internet bloggers to pay attention to regional fare. In 2000, the Sterns partnered with Stephen Rushmore to create [[Roadfood.com]], the first internet website to include photos with restaurant reviews. In 2015, ''Roadfood'' was acquired by Fexy Media of Seattle, Washington.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html?pagewanted=all |title=Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Jeff |last=Gordinier}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of the website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Tretyakov Gallery''' ({{lang-ru|Государственная Третьяковская Галерея}}, ''Gosudarstvennaya Tretyâkovskaya Galereya''; abbreviated ГТГ, ''GTG'') is an art gallery in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], the foremost depository of Russian [[fine art]] in the world.

The [[Art gallery|gallery]]'s history starts in 1856 when the [[Moscow]] merchant [[Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov]] acquired works by [[Russia]]n artists of his day with the aim of creating a [[Collection (museum)|collection]], which might later grow into a [[museum]] of national art. In 1892, Tretyakov presented his already famous collection of approximately 2,000 works (1,362 paintings, 526 drawings, and 9 sculptures) to the Russian [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;Korolev &amp; Iovleva (1992), 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/museum/history/gallery/1892_1898/ The donation of the Gallery to Moscow, 1892-1898]". ''The State Tretyakov Gallery'' website. Accessed 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The façade of the gallery building was designed by the painter [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] in a peculiar Russian [[fairy-tale]] style. It was built in 1902–04 to the south from the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. During the 20th century, the gallery expanded to several neighboring buildings, including the 17th-century [[church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi]].

The collection contains more than 130,000 exhibits, ranging from ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' and [[Andrei Rublev]]'s ''[[Trinity (Andrei Rublev)|Trinity]]'' to the monumental ''Composition VII'' by [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and the ''Black Square'' by [[Kazimir Malevich]].

In 1977 the Gallery kept a significant part of the [[George Costakis]] collection.

In May 2012, the Tretyakov Art Gallery played host to the prestigious [[FIDE]] [[World Chess Championship]] between [[Viswanathan Anand]] and [[Boris Gelfand]] as the organizers felt the event would promote both chess and art at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/a8b0$wix.htm|title=2012 Anand - Gelfand : World Chess Championship|author=|date=|website=www.mark-weeks.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surikov streltsi.jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Surikov]], ''[[:ru:Утро стрелецкой казни|Morning of Streltsy's execution]]'' (1881)]]
Pavel Tretyakov started collecting art in the middle of 1850. The founding year of the Tretyakov Gallery is considered to be 1856, when Tretyakov purchased two paintings of Russian artists: ''Temptation'' by N. G. Schilder and ''Skirmish with Finnish Smugglers'' by V. G. Kudyakov, although earlier, in 1854–1855, he had bought 11 drawings and nine pictures by Dutch Old Masters. In 1867 the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and [[Sergei Tretyakov (arts patron)|Sergei Tretyakov]] was opened. The Gallery’s collection consisted of 1,276 paintings, 471 sculptures and 10 drawings by Russian artists, as well as 84 paintings by foreign masters.
 
In August 1892 Tretyakov presented his art gallery to the city of Moscow as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/russia-and-the-arts/exhibition/tretyakov.php|title=Russia and the Arts: The Age of Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky - TRETYAKOV|author=|date=|website=www.npg.org.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the collection at this time, there were 1,287 paintings and 518 graphic works of the Russian school, 75 paintings and eight drawings of European schools, 15 sculptures and a collection of icons. The official opening of the museum called the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov took place on August 15, 1893.
 
The gallery was located in a mansion that the Tretykov family had purchased in 1851.  As the Tretyakov collection of art grew, the residential part of the mansion filled with art and it became necessary to make additions to the mansion in order to store and display the works of art. Additions were made in 1873, 1882, 1885, 1892 and 1902–1904, when there was the famous façade, designed in 1900–1903 by architect V. Bashkirov from the drawings of the artist Viktor Vasnetsov. Construction of the façade was managed by the architect A. M. Kalmykov.
 
In early 1913, the Moscow City Duma elected Igor Grabar as a trustee of the Tretyakov Gallery.
 
On June 3, 1918, the Tretyakov Gallery was declared owned by Russian Federated Soviet Republic and was named the State Tretyakov Gallery. Igor Grabar was again appointed director of the museum. With Grabar’s active participation in the same year, the State Museum Fund was created, which up until 1927 remained one of the most important sources of replenishment of the gallery's collection.
 
In 1926 architect and academician A. V. Shchusev became the director of the gallery. In the following year the gallery acquired the neighboring house on Maly Tolmachevsky Lane (the house was the former home of the merchant Sokolikov). After restructuring in 1928, it housed the gallery's administration, academic departments, library, manuscripts department, and funds and graphics staffs. In 1985–1994, an administrative building was built from the design of architect A. L. Bernstein with two floors and height equal to that of the exposition halls.
 
In 1928 serious renovations were made to the gallery to provide heating and ventilation. In 1929 electricity was installed.
 
In 1929 the church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi was closed, and in 1932 the building was given to the gallery and became a storage facility for paintings and sculptures. Later, the church was connected to the exposition halls and a top floor was built which was specially designed for exhibiting a painting by A. A. Ivanov,''The Appearance of Christ to the People'' (1837–1857). A transition space was built between rooms located on either side of the main staircase. This ensured the continuity of the view of exposure. The gallery began to develop a new concept of accommodating exhibits.
 
In 1936, a new two floor building was constructed which is located on the north side of the main building – it is known as the Schusevsky building. These halls were first used for exhibitions, and since 1940 have been included in the main route of exposure.
 
From the first days of the Great War, the gallery's personnel began dismantling the exhibition, as well as those of other museums in Moscow, in preparation for evacuating during wartime. Paintings were rolled on wooden shafts, covered with tissue paper, placed in boxes, and sheathed with waterproof material. In the middle of the summer of 1941 a train of 17 wagons traveled from Moscow and brought the collection to Novosibirsk. The gallery was not reopened in Moscow until May 17, 1945, upon the conclusion of the Great War.
 
In 1956, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Tretyakov Gallery, the Alexander Ivanov Hall was completed.
 
From 1980 to 1992, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery was Y. K. Korolev. Because of the increased number of visitors, Korolev was actively engaged in expanding the area of exposition. In 1983, construction work began to expand the gallery. In 1985 the Depository, a repository of works of art and restoration workshops, was commissioned. In 1986 renovations began on the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery. The architects I. M. Vinogradsky, G. V. Astafev, B. A. Klimov and others were retained to perform this project. In 1989, on the south side of the main building, a new building was designed and constructed to house a conference hall, a computer and information center, children's studio and exhibition halls. The building was named the "Corps of Engineers", because it housed engineering systems and services.
 
From 1986 to 1995, the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane was closed to visitors to accommodate a major renovation project to the building. At the time, the only museum in the exhibition area of this decade was the building on the Crimean Val, 10, which in 1985 was merged with the Tretyakov Gallery.

== Gallery of modern art ==
[[Image:New Tretyakov Gallery.jpg|thumb|200px|New Tretyakov Gallery on Krymsky Val]]

In 1985, the Tretyakov Gallery was administratively merged with a gallery of contemporary art, housed in a large modern building along the [[Garden Ring]], immediately south of the [[Krymsky Bridge]]. The grounds of this branch of the museum contain a collection of [[Socialist Realism]] sculpture, including such highlights as [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]]'s iconic statue ''[[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Iron Felix]]'' (which was removed from [[Lubyanka Square]] in 1991), the ''Swords Into Plowshares'' sculpture representing a nude worker forging a plough out of a sword, and the ''Young Russia'' monument. Nearby is [[Zurab Tsereteli]]'s 86-metre-tall statue of [[Peter the Great]], one of the tallest outdoor statues in the world.

Near the gallery of modern art there is a sculpture garden called "[[the graveyard of fallen monuments]]" that displays statues of former [[Soviet Union]] that were relocated.

There are plans to demolish the gallery constructed in the late Soviet modernism style, though public opinion is strongly against this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ruvr.ru/2009/11/05/2180229.html House of Artists not only for Artists], ''Moscow Time'', November 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/world/europe/15iht-moscow.html Moscow Cultural Landmark Is Seen as Threatened]".

'''''Turen går til''''' is a [[travel guide]] series published by ''Politikens Forlag'' in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The meaning of the Danish title is “The trip goes to”. The series is the largest travel guide series in [[Scandinavia]] and covers more than 200 destinations around the world. The books are either about countries, regions, or cities. They contain information about the destinations’ history and culture, their attractions, and practical information such as lists of restaurants and hotels, and useful phrases in the local language.

The series started in 1952 with a [[guidebook]] to [[Austria]] followed in 1953 by guidebooks to [[France]] and [[Italy]]. By 1958, the series included books on [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Spain]], as well as on [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turen går til Jugoslavien, eds.|last=Schultz, Hans Joakim|first=Meyer, Torben J.|publisher=Gebers|year=1958|isbn=|location=Stockholm, Sweden|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books were published in Danish by ''Politikens Forlag'', in Swedish by ''Gebers Förlag AB'', and in Norwegian by ''Chr. Skibsteds Forlag''. A limited number of guidebooks were also translated to German and sold as ''Polyglott Reiseführer''. By 1962, the travel guides series had sold 373,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turen går til Tjekkoslovakiet|last=Poulsen|first=Milena|publisher=Politikens Forlag|year=1962|isbn=|location=Copenhagen, Denmark|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded June 2, 1890 as a [[Select or special committee (United States)|Select Committee]], the '''Committee to Establish a University of the United States''' was an initiative of the [[United States Senate]] which became a [[Standing Committee (US)|Standing Committee]] on March 19, 1896. During this time there was also a [[National University Committee]] outside of the Senate.

In 1897 the committee tried to pass a bill to create a [[University of the United States]], and three years later it presented a bill to allow the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to give out [[academic degree|degree]]s. Neither bill was successful. The committee was disbanded in 1921 as part of a "housecleaning" that got rid of several largely inactive or defunct committees which still officially existed.

The '''Winter Park Public Library''' is a [[public library]] located at 460 E. New England Avenue in [[Winter Park, Florida]]. The library's core mission is education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter Park Rising To The Challenge|url=https://www.wppl.org/dialogue|website=Winter Park Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Congregational Parsonage, 1885.jpg|thumb|Congregational Parsonage, 1885]]

The library dates back to 1885, when nine women organized to create a lending library for Winter Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library has been located at its present site since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books had previously been circulated in an organized reading circle, but a library didn’t exist within the small community. The village of Winter Park was still in its infancy at this time, less than five years old, but both the incorporation of a railroad and the inaugural classes beginning at Rollins College in 1885 influenced the town’s image as a desirable place to live. Intent on creating a [[lending library]] for the community, this ambitious group of women held a meeting at the Congregational Parsonage, which is now the location of the current Rollins campus, roughly where the Archibald Granville Bush Science Center sits today. 

This was a time of male-only [[suffrage]], and women had to content themselves with more “ladylike” pursuits, such as ministering to the needy and coming up with ideas for civic projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; All elected officers of the [[circulating library]], however, would be women. The president was Mrs. Elizabeth P. Hooker, the wife of a doctor and Congregational minister, as well as a president of Rollins College. She was raised by a professor at [[Middlebury College]], where she received some advanced education and was likely familiar with the workings of a collage library. The “two Marys” in the group, Mary McClure and Mary E. Brown, were both retired teachers. Brown would be remembered as being "of a singularly acute and independent mind, a lover of the best books, a keen critic, and an unfailing source of intellectual stimulus to all who knew her.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Guild and her sister, Clara, came from Boston with their father in 1883. Alice, 25 at the time, was elected as fundraiser for the library, while her sister, Clara, albeit not one of the library's noted founders, was in her own right a member of the first class at Rollins and later received the college’s first degree conferred upon a woman. Evaline Lamson was only 30 when she became the driving force behind the library’s survival and for several years served simultaneously as librarian for the town library and the one at Rollins College. Little is known about the remaining members, Mrs. C. J. Ladd, Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Cook, and Mrs. W. O. Cady, except that the latter would become the first librarian for the Winter Park Circulating Library. 

[[File:Winter Park Public Library, 1902.jpg|thumb|Winter Park Public Library, 1902]]While deliberating and discussing details, the most crucial decision for the women was not how to get the necessary books, as they had been circulating books among themselves for some time, but where to base their new venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first site was the Lamson house at 503 Interlachen Avenue, and initially operating only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Records for the year of 1887 gave some insight into what was being read that year, including [[''The Scarlet Letter'']], [[''The Last Days of Pompeii'']], [[''Jane Eyre'']], [[''Ivanhoe'']], and [[''The Rise of Silas Lapham'']]. Biographies were also popular, such as those on [[Frederick the Great]], and religious titles, ''The Blood of Jesus'', ''Thoughts on Personal Religion'', and ''Scientific Theism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the library shelves and inventory were limited, the rules for borrowing material were that members could take out one book on Wednesday and Saturday and keep it for two weeks, with a one-week renewal. They would impose a 10-cent fine for non-renewals, and those who were not members would be allowed to take out books if they paid a $1 deposit plus 10 cents for each week.

One year after the library’s founding, as recorded in the minutes of the annual meeting held on December 16, 1886, the officers accepted an offer to move its operations from Miss Lamson’s porch to a room in a building occupied by the [[Winter Park Company]] on the southwest corner of New England and Park Avenues. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association wrote its [[constitution]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic devastation would bring the library to the brink of closure in 1895. As it is today, Florida’s two biggest commodities are citrus and tourism. Winter Park relied on winter visitors, but according to ''The History of Orlando'' by Eve Bacon, “the temperature dropped to 24 degrees the Sunday after Christmas Day in 1894,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dropped even lower to an astounding 17 degrees in February. This hard freeze killed trees and citrus, and potential visitors to the area, hearing news of the record cold, decided not to visit. The blow to the area’s economy was evident in the library’s December 1895 annual meeting, where the treasurer’s report revealed an existing balance of $8.60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this drop in profit, the overall bleak outlook of the time gave an unexpected boost in inventory, which may have been gifted books by families moving from the area. The population of Winter Park would fluctuate dramatically from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, but the welcome addition of some wealthy new residents would bring relief via donations, which enabled the library to buy more books in 1896. 

In 1900, discussion of what should be included in a new, permanent building effectively set the library’s policy for years to come, as the decision was made to include a children’s department. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association’s president, Eleanora Comstock, called a meeting to propose plans and start fundraising efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pledges of $1,216 were received by February 1901, and land was donated by the estate of Francis Knowles. The library opened in April 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also expanded hours of operation to every day. Fundraising consisted of outreach to the public and a financial commitment from the city government, which continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indoor plumbing was not part of the original design of the new building in 1900, and in the absence of modern insulation, complaints about heat in the summer and cold in the winter are recorded aspects of its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosperity inevitably came back to the area due in part to both a revitalized citrus industry and the construction of the new [[Seminole Hotel]] in 1912 following a fire that had burned down the prior building, and had long been a great source of revenue for the library. Also, the town council agreed to provide free electricity to the library building in 1914. In light of these developments and donations, the library added a kitchen wing that same year, which inspired the ladies of the library to continue a series of teas, fundraising socials and other events of interest to potential patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library would eventually double in size in 1924 when they added two new wings and a [[Toilet (room)|lavatory]]. And by 1945, the library had a collection of 12,269 books and a circulation of 33,214.

Despite the historical and commendable efforts behind the library’s origin and contribution to the community of Winter Park during this time, it had remained somewhat of an exclusive group of patrons that many residents chose not to join. Furthermore, the library only served the white townspeople. A separate library was founded in the heart of the black residential community in mid-1937. Founded by Dr. Edwin O. Grover in 1937, the [[Hannibal Square Library]] was established for African American residents, dedicated in memory of his wife, who had been an activist in the cause of education and the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially functioning as an independent library, it began receiving regular appropriations from the city in the 1950s, albeit on a smaller scale than that received by the Winter Park Public Library. A children’s room was added in 1955. A popular place for children and local organizations to meet, neighbors maintained the grounds, donated to the organization, and planted shrubbery and flowers to beautify it. The Board of Directors was composed of black and white residents. The Winter Park Public Library [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1962 and 1963, adopting a policy of library service to all residents of Winter Park, irrespective of age, race, creed, color or financial situation. In 1979, the Hannibal Square Library was closed due to decline in circulation and the building and grounds were returned to the city’s council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title="Winter Park Public Library"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Although it was initially proposed to simply build on to the existing library site, the issue of insufficient parking was the inspiration for constructing a new building on a different site. In September 1976, the city bought some land at 460 East New England Avenue, and in July of 1977, the Library received a grant for construction on the site. Soon thereafter, the Winter Park Public Library opened with nearly twice the square footage and increased parking spaces from thirteen to sixty-five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was expanded starting in 1994, adding a third floor to allow more space for services to patrons aged 12 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Collections==

*The core of the Winter Park History and Archives Collection[http://archive.wppl.org/wphistory/overview.html] was established through the generosity of local historian and businesswoman, Eve Bacon. In 1976, Bacon donated her numerous files of Winter Park information to the Winter Park Public Library and set into motion the active acquisition and preservation of materials pertaining to the city of Winter Park and its residents. The collection continues to grow through the library's own acquisition efforts and the generous donations from members of the community. In the pursuit of preserving Winter Park's rich history, the collection includes maps, photographs, newspaper clippings, periodicals, scrapbooks, city government records, books, pamphlets, and correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Rachel|title=About Our Collection|url=http://archive.wppl.org/wphistory/overview.html|website=Winter Park History|publisher=Winter Park Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
